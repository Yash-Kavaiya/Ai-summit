## 📝 Transcript

And lastly, we have Jiu Ilas, who's the content head of India AI. Now, I'd like to Oh, and the Mosilla Foundation. Apologies.

So, with that, um, we'll get straight into it and I'd like to give the floor to Vanessa. where we can really accelerate the way

that science can build these technology advances. So that's kind of the big thinking at the International Science Council. We're a nonprofit organization with a global

mandate. We have about 200 uh more than 200 member organizations. Some of them are based in countries. So they might be nationalmies of science. Others of our members are discipline specific but with

an international footprint for example like international union and similar and they go beyond the natural cross natural and social sciences. So we

really have a a great membership from which we can pull some of these learnings. So this is version three. Please feel free to scan the QR code or download the

full report at the URL given on the link there. The version three includes a total of 26 country case studies. Some of these were published of course first in 2024 and we

may see that you know the situation has moved on quite rapidly. The new case studies that we've added in this edition are eight. They from Egypt, Fiji, Hungary, Kenya, Namibia, Romania,

Rwanda, Singapore. And on stage, I mean has already introduced you from three of these case studies from India, from Singapore, from so just to give you a sneak peek what's

in the report. This kind of shows the geographical footprint of those country studies. But in addition to those sort of five to six page case studies, there was also a

comprehensive literature survey that was done in 2023. And that survey pulled up about 45 interesting issues that emerged kind of as critical for the uptake of AI science

systems. And when we had a look at these on writing the third report and we thought, do we need to update this literature review? actually many of these 45 issues the

majority of them are not yet solved and are still issues that we're dealing with today and in addition to that literature survey there's a synthesis of some of

the common learnings that I'll share with you but just to give you a flavor I mean this is not 45 issues this is maybe 10 on this page the issues that came out of

that initial literature survey were issues around the integrity of science and the cond How do we manage things like particular tensions around explainability? There's

black boxes around reproducibility of scientific results which is a key cornerstone of how we do science. How do we adjust some of our funding practices? How do we use AI and research

allocation which and in the evaluation of research for and of course in terms of D management. How do we balance things like access to data, open data with an advantage that

might be taken, you know, using these open data resources that we create as a global public algorithms that are often closed and of

course things like harmonization of infrastructure. So this is just a flavor of some of those issues that came up. We think that the report will be helpful

for decision makers and policies. We think they'll be useful for those who are drafting policies at country level looking particularly at some of the science system issues

and taking some good practice from those cases. And of course for scientists and scholars who are just getting involved in using AI within their own research also benefit from some of these

take just to look at what we have learned. So across these 26 country case studies we tried to pull out what were the common thread and the common gap.

And what the gaps are really are that many countries have some of these national AI strategies, but there's no specific guidance for the science systems in those countries on how to

respond or to utilize AI. And so that is an area where either countries have to take sometimes even left to universities or research institutions to take their own initiatives or where we can pull our

resources to kind of international level guidance. We see that across countries comput and data center access is uneven and that is a major stumbling block to utilizing

the resources and software but also to training the next generation. And there's some interesting results where we see that countries have grouped together to access shared resources

across regions to overcome those. We also see point number three that data stewardship is often overlooked in science systems. Science systems seem to be very much focused on products,

patents, papers but not always placing sufficient value on the import. foundational things like data stewardship that is required to get use AI to get

across almost all the case studies there was a focus on skills development skill shortages work forces needed to sustain R&amp;D and I think you'll probably hear some of the particular angles on that

from our country case study and then also around number which was the evolution of our science funding mechanisms. There was a concern in some of the case

studies that we would see mechanisms adapt to to fund the next best thing at the expense of some of the foundational humanity studies, social sciences that really are important for understanding

of how these technologies will impact. So a kind of a warning bell on over investment. And then environment environmental sustainability was a concern across many

of the country case studies but it was accompanied in a large to a large extent by a lack of knowledge. Almost never talked about what we know about. So just to show you a quick kind of

snapshot of the country case studies. We try to have this visual tool that is a lot to assimilate I think in a short presentation but it talks about sort of four key strands there strategy

infrastructure capac clearly present relatively mature if it's light blue it's coming It's emerging. There's some thinking happening about it. If it's gray, it may

not be there yet, but it's an aspiration for many countries. And just a note, please caveat here that some of these um case studies come from 2024 and we know just how rapidly the field moves in AI.

So, they're to be taken in that. And I'll just leave the slide here. Back to Felix for the rest. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much, Vanessa, for setting the stage and presenting the

report. We now get to um the exciting part of the the talk where we will zoom in on specific countries that were included as case studies um in the report. Um and and while we do that, I

want the audience to start thinking about questions uh because we will have some time for for questions at the end. So do get your questions ready. So to start us off, I would like to give the

floor to Moses who uh authored the Kenyan case study. &gt;&gt; Thank you. My name is Moses Uron University is found in Nakuru, Kenya

and um Kenya is in the news a lot with innovation and technology. But when we take a keener look at the ecosystem, we find interesting uh perspectives. For one, our research

ecosystem is still being reorganized. So round about last year uh the government uh created a state department for research for science research and innovation. And the objective of that

was to bring together three key agencies that run the sector. is one the national commission for science technology and innovation that does policy regulation and just guiding research. We have the

Kenya national innovation agency that handles innovation and we have the national research fund. So all these now are organized under our state department for science research and innovation. Of

course, the ecosystem comprises of everybody else, the universities, the research institutions, uh technical and vocational colleges and etc.

With respect to how the sector does operate, we do have regulation, we do have policies that govern science. However, speaking to the subject of today, which is AI, we have no AI policy

in Kenya in general, even before we get to one that touches on AI, I mean on research. What we have closest is an AI strategy that was launched last year. And in this

strategy there are aspirations to move from what we generally do in Kenya which is applied research and applied uh AI to more foundational uh research in AI. That's what the strategy

aspires to. uh their efforts that are started off this year [clears throat] towards a national AI policy and again the policy is general but it does have some the draft or the work in progress

is looking into a bit of research and how to strengthen the research ecosystem but that is still a work in progress. When you think about the other issues that touch or impact the research

ecosystem in Kenya, we have funding. Now funding in general for research is not optimal in the country and there isn't any ring fenced or allocated research funding uh for AI.

It's only last year that the National Research Fund uh sent out a call for research in AI in cultural heritage. But that again was a one off. It's not something we are seeing this year. Uh I

don't know whether we have it coming in the next year. Sorry. So with respect to funding again there isn't anything consistent from the government side. The bulk of the

research funding comes from multinationals and private companies. And we're talking about the the large foundations. That would be the Bill and Melinda Gates. uh there would be Google,

there' be Microsoft who again are also orchestrating a bit of a brain drain internally. So they've set up a lot of their research centers. So we have uh the research centers for Google,

Microsoft, IBM within Kenya and they pull the best from high education. So the net effect is those the talent that we have in AI in high education tends to be drawn to industry and a good amount

of it also gets drawn outside of the country. So you find a lot of the Kenyans doing any work in research in AI uh either in the multinationals or outside the country. So that's looks

like how Kenya is. So at the moment there is a lot of activity, a lots of boot camps, lots of hackathons to build capacity. We are beginning to see the rise of a lot of data science and AI uh

bachelor's degrees uh master's degrees some research at PhD level that is the effort that is currently going on. But when you think about an a research uh ecosystem that is focused towards AI and

for AI, we don't yet have that. It's a lot of disjointed effort, a lot of talk, a lot of high level kind of applications focusing on agriculture and health, but no concerted collection. We don't have

compute. That's the other thing. So we have data centers set up by the likes of U. IBM and etc. you know but the cost of comput is still way beyond ordinary researchers in Kenya. So we have efforts

from one the Kenya education network which is an association of universities. They're about to launch a a GPU cluster this this month. It's probably going to be the first educational or research

cluster available within the country. Otherwise most researchers who do in heavy lifting do it from the center for high performance computing in South Africa. So in a in a nutshell that's how

things look like no policy as yet no dedicated funding no compute and all the talent either working within but without. So that's that's how it is like but lots of energy. Thank you.

&gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Thank you very much, uh, Moses. Uh, we'll now go to Kelly who will tell us about the Singaporean case study. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much. It's working right.

Thank you very much. Um, I think uh it was a pleasure to be part of this study and to be joining here today. I think it was it was it's a very important um study um in particularly thinking about

some of the points Vanessa discussed there which includes we know AI is reshaping many things and many many different sectors and will no doubt impact uh science how we currently

collect data research the impact that that will have across every other sector as well as science normally is the foundation for many other things that we see connecting happening across the

world. Um and so speaking for Singapore, um as we saw there, um there were um they're very advanced in three out of the four um pillars that you have there where there's a challenge is in relation

to data uh to talent shortage. Um, so I'll speak a little bit about human skills. Uh, but I think speaking for what we're seeing in terms of strength that comes out of Singapore, um, a very

small economy, uh, with, uh, relatively small population agile um, and has started many many years ago on the AI strategy. And that AI strategy started very early with the

idea that they saw how AI will reshape many of u their processes and priorities for the government. Um and um science being one of them. Um undoubtedly um they have a strong agenda for um

building um Singapore as a smart city. Um so they have very much been thinking for um many years now how you can move to integrate AI uh and become embedded across different sectors and uh making

science a part of that as well. So you have a a really a great amount of programs and initiatives in place across various different sectors. Particularly for science we see um AI for um science

initiative which uh speaks of about 120 million of funding the educator to just focus on um this specific space. Um you also see a lot of work happening from a few different government agencies that

have been put in place to be the educated to thinking about how to build more of this as well as more um talent shortage as well. So building capabilities to be able to perform well.

So you have AAR for example, you have AI Singapore which is um not only um has a strong agenda in supporting what Singapore can do um locally but it also supports a lot in building partnerships

on a regional level. Um you have uh for example uh sea lion which has been launched as Singapore's um ledge language model and the idea was you know I think governments are very um specific

about not having a copy and paste exercise from Silicon Valley when adopting AI locally and CIA was an example of that. How do we create here a large language model but we build use

data according to our own values uh and our own priorities locally. Right? This is the same for the whole Southeast Asia because what you see happening with Silio now is how Singapore is also

exercising um influence and support over coordination with other countries in the region um as it goes about uh supporting that as well. So there is the um the row uh that you see there what Singapore is

for Southeast Asia. Similarly we also contributed around Fiji right for the Pacific Islands. Similarly, what you see Fiji becoming for the Pacific Islands is uh because they are ahead of the curve

in many things, there is a certain leadership level that is involved in how they can also go about supporting other economies, right? Um in terms of challenge we see uh the area of uh you

know uh you still struggling as a small ismo economy with talent shortage right uh and particularly when it comes to um issues about detecting explanability in science biases how research is being

done. How do we protect the future of science? Well, um, ensuring that it continues to be independent and as as a foundation for what we can rely on going forward is that you must also prepare

humans to work well alongside the technology. And on that front, Singapore is doing um a lot of great things. Again, it started very early with a lot of initiatives around upskilling and

reskilling people, preparing for the future of work, knowing that a lot of jobs are changing, disappearing or uh being completely augmented, right? Um and so there is that level of

preparation. Um and at the same time I think what you struggle with is a small population um a small country that has relied in history on a lot of external um talent a

lot of foreign talent and is now you know trying to leave Prague in AI continue to remain at the forefront of it and so there's a a balancing act there and one of the proposals is that

how do you build more around cooperation particularly for Southeast Asian death that sense so they can work together on those um those challenges going forward. Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Thank you very much Kelly and we'll now go to the third uh case study which is India and we'll give the floor to Jeep to talk to. &gt;&gt; Uh thank you Felix. Um so one thing uh I

have noticed you know as Moses was also speaking right most countries have AI strategies now even smaller countries like Namibia, Mauritius they have all came up with AI strategies but what very

few have is a u research ecosystem ready for AI. That's what missing from all of these uh AI strategies. Right? So and I want to uh emphasize that this readiness for uh you know research ecosystem is uh

about universities uh you know and uh how they can access uh compute data and uh governance uh equally as well. So coming to India, India has um uh clear ambitions like you know again coming to

what you said Moses more strategies seems to be an aspiration uh putting it out there. So uh we have been having this large scale experiment in public AI infrastructure that has been the larger

uh message of the summit as well you know building DPIs on AI and but one thing specific about India is India is still a country which is uh kind of struggling or

in the face of u uh capacity building right now and uh so so so coming to the strengths of India right the biggest strength uh of India when it comes to air research and scientific research

point of view is its strong DPI tradition. uh you know we have uh the UPI system the Aadhaar uh and many other uh platforms it has built which has provided the strong uh governance

support but as well as a larger use of technology in general right uh furthermore there's this growing policy attention towards AI uh compute and data set which is very visible how the

government is shaping its policy uh and the latest uh announcements and things like that. Um and the third most important aspect is the huge talent pipeline India has. Now if you look at

the Stanford AI index for the last I don't know I've been tracking it since uh 20 20 I think. Yeah. Yeah. Because I was working with India AI back then India

has been there in the top three top five when it comes to talent penetration and and diversity in that talent penetration. these two matrices has been the key core strength of India and if

you also look at that India has um when it come to uh you know computer science graduates India has a large number of graduates in the world every year coming through so and active public sector

interest in AI is another uh interesting aspect so these are &gt;&gt; hi everyone &gt;&gt; some of the things I have mentioned in the case study you know such as the

bashi bashni has become a large uh you a DPI effort from the government and another thing we have focused is on COE's right so back then you know in 2024 when we uh wrote the case study

India has announced four AI related COE's center of excellence and now we have already have three of them already implemented in healthcare agriculture and sustainable uh cities and another

one is announced that will be coming soon on uh education in IIT Madras as well But it's uh not all you know roses I will say because we are notorious for uh uh notorious for the budget

allocations for R&amp;D in our country. I think when we compare to uh the countries we are competing with whether it's China or uh any any other emerging uh other countries uh closer to us we

are very uh even Singapore you know India allocates very very little of its uh overall spending in research and development uh but one of the larger challenges when it comes to an AI point

of view is the scarcity of compute right especially outside the elite institutes I mean we recently procured 14,000 GPUs And now uh access to those GPUs are being given through uh subsidized access

is being given by India mission. But the larger questions like this GPUs have a lifespan. You know it's easy to say we procure 14,000 GPUs but the GPUs what will you do after 3 years. uh and

furthermore uh not every academic institute uh or research facility is getting the same access and we have seen that time and time again how uh you know the ones which has the name starting

with I always get that preferential treatment from the uh government side when it comes to research uh and universities also lack funding you they have to go their own way to procure this

kind of computer capacity or AI experimentation as well and furthermore is fragmented data Right. So we always say India is technically poor but uh data rich. So why we say that is because

of the enormous data our various ministries, various department hold. But the largest challenge with data is this data hasn't been able to you know we have been never been able to leverage

this data. Uh I mean there are many use cases uh you know if there is a data.org or website or many states have data websites nowadays and most of these sites you can say data in skewed PDFs or

uh in formats that can be machine readable. So there there is effort by India mission from what I know to create uh you know provide this data to clean up this data and provide this data to

Indian researchers and the startups right and finally it's the faculty capacity you know that's a huge gap when it comes to IIT and I you know uh the the level of uh capacity the level of

eligibilities and qualifications and uh it can be a real difference. So if uh if uh India's challenge is not uh to modern innovation right about building a research uh ecosystem of inclusion so I

will also just mention what we have been doing the Mozilla Foundation has been doing in India for last 3 years uh is that we've been running this program called responsible computing challenge

where we partnered with uh nine universities um including uh IIT Gojhati uh Indor Ashoga uh Christ um NIT Warangal one of the oldest uh universities in India and a few more. So

where we worked with the teams of faculties and departments uh as empowering them to uh create open open AI curriculum uh faculty training and communitydriven governance framework and

uh uh that's we have been doing that and we so essentially I I think I'm uh running out of time. So we if we invest only in infrastructure we will uh get more of AI adoption but if you invest in

people we will able to build AI capacity capability in large sense. So I'll stop here. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much Jibu and thank you to all of our case study authors. Uh we'll

now turn to you the audience. this is your chance to uh ask questions or uh or comment on anything that you've heard here today or if if there's more you would like to know about the report,

then uh please feel free to uh to ask your questions. My name is data engineering from my question to you is how do we bridge

the gap between AI research in India and real industry development like are there some kind of models that are being used in the world and that are not being used in

&gt;&gt; yeah I think this has been a one big challenge uh we faced when we were setting up like 2018 this was been a main topic right in India we have this There are two problems. You mentioned

other countries right like for example we speak about Darthmouth work workshop as the beginning of AI it was funded and started by DARPA universe whether internet various major innovations were

funded by agency like DARPA which kind of acted between academy and the military right uh so we uh I'm saying not just military but we don't have anything like that and we've been

notorious for uh the kind of you know industry academia collaboration uh but that has been changing. Now if you want good examples I think Germany is a good example like uh for example

you take universities like FAU which works very closely with Seammens uh in terms of research. So their uh um medical uh you know technology development is very much focused on

seammen's uh larger vision as well. uh but when it come but we are seeing difference like look at uh IIT Madras right where we have Google has working closely with uh professor Ravy's

department uh in building uh cap capacity capacities there we have I think cortex center in I IC where they have supported supercomputers and others so that that that trend is changing but

we still don't have a larger uh way to have a closer capacity right and a lot of that has to do with how our IT sector is also changed right we I mean I'm sorry to say if any of them working here

in the IT industry we have built a essentially I keep telling if Indians if Chinese spoke English India would would never have an IT sector we our IT sector is an extractive force you know it was

never about building technology it's all about using cheap labor so when you have that kind of mentality and mindset it's very difficult to build the kind of you coming from a computer science

background you know to build a industry academy ecosystem. Right? So well not for my case study but from an experience you would want to go and check out the leads institute for data

analytics. Had the opportunity to visit them and they have a very uh beautiful model to engage industry. So they offer consultancy to the industry to solve their data

related problems. So they end up doing research on industry challenges with the lead institute for data. &gt;&gt; Just to add to that and not that this is a specific example in science but I

think a lot of governments are experimenting with uh sand boxes or creating ecosystems where they bring different they bring, you know, the academia, they bring uh industry, civil

society, and I'm seeing a lot of initiatives like that from Singapore as well as a lot of other leading um governments such as the UAE where I'm based. Um and those initiatives I find

where we have seen I guess in finance and other sectors tend to um really support building bridging those gaps. Hi. So my question is

a lot of work. Uh specific question is have you found any patterns which might take the global south more inclusiveness when it comes to using the technologies and how any of the battles

what are the next frontiers that you foresee for the that needs to be addressed in the next few minutes. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Maybe I will start. That is a

great question. Um I think we're privileged to be doing this conversations in India this week. Um and having more representation from from this part of the world. Um and um I

think that uh it needs to be an intentional investment in how do we bring um this part of the world into these conversations on a global level, right? More representation. Um and and

that goes across every single sector, right? When we look at the majority of research coming out in AI, um you still have uh the the major representation from western um culture, right? When we

face a lot of issues now across biases, mis representation, that is where we start, right? Unless we actually intentional about including and being inclusive uh on on the global level um

it will be really difficult for us to leaprog into that. Right. I'm sure you both have something to add to that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. also taking a look I think at the selection of case studies I think

important things are thanks that in uh I think this some of the important things that we've seen is that for example in Africa there's this huge uh explosion of a young population

and that can really be seen as a you know if we get our skills training and things right that can really be seen as a as a you know big step forward in terms of uh capacity and skills

training. And I think the other thing that I noticed across the the set of case studies from the global south is the importance of data sovereignity um for within the global south. And that's

not really of course something that seems to come up often in in other conversations, but it really seems of fundamental um importance. And I'm not sure entirely how to answer your

question in it translating to a big step forward, but it's clearly a big priority. &gt;&gt; I could add Yeah. The way out is

nations seeking sovereignity not just territorial but also technological. So then we begin talking about data

hosting compute locally getting our data to build our models you know and building our skill to build our solutions. It's really the only way out. So if we

don't have enough nationalism, then we need to build that fast. Yeah. Countries that have had no choice. I would say China is one. It's it's it's a national pride issue. They have

literally a lot of their solutions. India is doing well. I also want to cite examples of economies that in my opinion are a bit isolated from the world like Russia for example.

They've made it in many ways because they have no choice. So we've got to have some sense of nationalism that will take us to the next level. Uh good evening guys. Uh my name is

Karthik. I am a final year student from VIT. I had a question regarding I have two questions actually. The first one regarding the research currently being done inside India and I would like to

hear the opinions on the other panelists as well that India is currently doing research on the applications of AI or the foundation models that are already been prepared or uh open weights models

that have already been created by the western nations. Uh so how much of a platform right now India and the other countries are at to be able to build their own foundation models or uh their

own as uh Mr. Moses said uh to create their own sovereignty in their uh technological aspect in terms of foundation models and uh my second question is uh right now especially in

India there is a flood of u western models in terms of perplexity anthropic and open AI and how do uh startups or middle midlevel companies that uh drive innovation in terms of these uh AI

research systems can challenge those uh barriers to entries and uh make an addressable market for themselves as well. So these are my questions. Yes. Um so uh the first part about

research in general, right? See the thing is I mean I don't know if you know the Saram has been doing some phenomenal job in terms of building our own language models and uh I know they've

been releasing some of the models in this these days and more in the coming days. So that's one thing but I don't think that you know building our own uh foundation models are going to solve the

larger question regarding the research ecosystem right uh it's all about access the researchers need and how how much of access they they get right and coming to uh the big ones like uh anthropic or uh

you mentioned perplexity which is started by Indian uh itself uh so it's um why they have an advantage and uh it's it's about one one aspect I keep

noticing is that this dichotomy in our policy where one side we will say we want a uh you know innovation pro- innovation uh environment regulation but uh then who are we supporting in terms

of innovation for example I I will uh you know you look at uh so for for open AI and others India is just a market nothing more that and and of course they benefit more by you know getting our

data and other side as well and uh while you know the institutions which are supposed to be the guardians of our research ecosystem and all are entering partnerships with this or organization

I'm not mentioning any institutions name you know public uh public bodies I'm saying right so it's a larger question we should ask to the uh authorities larger you know the the authorities

right why there is If you want to promote you know India like you remember when there was a ban on Twitter who rose and who was quite good I I they were one of the early uh

companies to develop uh indic language uh incorporated you know they had you know working on NLP uh back then even earlier as back then but unfortunately once the Twitter came back again and it

gone so it's about that you know the double dichotomy right on one hand we want our companies to work well. on the other hand we want to uh give more uh for example I think the the previous

panel I heard about a senior official from the Andhra Pradesh speaking u if you look at the subsidies these governments has given to Google and Microsoft for starting their data center

it's crazy you will keep wondering do don't they have that fund you know free electricity free water like so yeah that's a question right why this do you give the same for an Indian

So I think that I will stop here. You want to get &gt;&gt; anything you would like to add Moses or Kelly we move on to another question. Right. Let's go back to the audience. Uh

yes gentlemen. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you for this panel. Um I had a question regarding ethics integrity. So how do we see the scientific publishing

you know evolving as the AI is becoming more and more dayto-day and more and more active in you know day-to-day scientific research and publishing. So how do we see the publishing landscape

evolving in that case? &gt;&gt; That's an excellent question I think uh which we we should be discussing more about. So one thing I have seen I am I'm an editor with uh u editorial board

member with springer on AI and ethics journal. So you see the number of I think there is there I I was in one of our meetings and you see this high spike in the number of submissions you are

getting since uh chat GPT came out and interestingly I also receive lot of uh papers from students and people saying hey I wrote this paper can you check completely machine generated there are

cases where they forget to remove you know if you want a shorter crisper version I can provide that as well I'm not talking that's the kind of uh I'm not disrespecting my country but there

are faculty members in unfortunate country who doesn't even remove that right uh it's it's a sad reality so what springer has done now right now is they have a very clear uh terms like you can

use AI say so you if you come and say don't use AI of course then what's the point of standing as research right but the you look at the positive side there are because I am somebody who struggled

with grammar and all those things but AI has me there so if you're using AI to polish your language if you're a AI to you know make those kind of changes it's accept acceptable you can mention

that but if it's you using just to generate it uh and uh copy paste it you know and many cases we have seen the cases of hallucination right uh and interestingly there is a paper recently

published on how to define AGI and that paper had uh references which were hallucinated so this This is the kind of world we are living. So that's one one way and when

we are doing Mosul foundation when we are inviting application we ask clearly uh have you used AI models if so okay for what right and now there are some cases where if it's okay to use but you

had to share prompts as well so but I think it's okay to use as long as it's a human work with a support of AI. I mean like even if you look at the grammarly these days it's very much uh AI LLM

based on so I you know I will leave it to my fellow panelists. &gt;&gt; Yeah that's great. I um there's something called cognitive debt. Um, and it's this term that basically summarizes

what Jibu is telling us, which is this ability that we're losing to really, you know, I think analyze and human capacities that we have rationalize um activities and tasks, right? Because we

are now automating them all to AI. And so um it will it will certainly reshape how research is doing, how science is doing, how every single task that we're currently performing here, it will

change more and more and more. Um what how do we prepare for that is again we go back to I think in every single case here we touch on um human capacity right so is the ability of unless we really

prepare surprisingly most people don't know that AI can host an age. You have had lawyers showing up in court with completely made up cases in front of a judge um and not even um you know I

think double checking and analyzing and you know acknowledging that. So that is part of human capacity, right? Being able to detect when where the information came from, where are the

sources, how do we analyze this, but most importantly, how do we how how are we building the skills that we have that are going to be more important, which are those soft skills, right? Creativity

or testing or um and and questioning most importantly the responses and the outputs that we receiving from AI that starts with education even with the way children are

currently being prepared besides schools and universities right &gt;&gt; just a quick one AI is in all cases is a double-edged sword that's what you're saying it's clear advantages

and I love it I use it but it has it clear disadvantages One of the dangers, let me put in another big word there that it's leading to is cognitive atrophy. The more we use

it uh our brains begin to atrophice just like m you know and once we become alive to that fact then we'll be afraid of AI and

what it's doing to us. It's always refreshing to come across a piece of writing that is human these days. You know they say shortly if we don't deal with AI we'll end up having the same

kind of poems and the same kind of creativity because AI cannot learn beyond what we've given it. So time just repeats. What is that doing to the research

ecosystem? I think that's the main question. It's currently presenting it's currently a bigger danger than it is a benefit. The pressure to publish

is not doing as well and people have found a way out and AI is like a breath of fresh air to them. So we probably need to ease on the pressure to publish and probably go uh

is it the China way practice PhDs? Yeah. It's not about what you publish, but what you produce. And with time, there'll be no pressure to publish. And I'd encourage all of us,

let's use it as much as possible, because that's the only way you know it is AI. I can pick a piece of writing and look at it from all the telltale signs of the formatting, the language. I'll

tell you this is AI. Why? Because I use it. So time we will need to be also the the integrity checkers ourselves but it is more of a danger right now that is because the pressure to publish that is

to come down. Yeah. Uh it's not about a question. It's about an opinion meeting of everyone because uh it's a rare uh scenario to get many other countries in one place

because uh the AI will uh obviously arase in the border of nations and countries also because enable everything to access everything as quick as possible. uh the same way quantum and a

get together will take to the next stage of human uh especially uh like this kind of a scenarios what it leads to uh is it a uh human enabled AI or AI enabled human researches may go fast as possible

also uh we should retain our own things also like uh we mentioned the uh the previous sessions the last decades uh usually the lowest uh IQ in our humanity were uh found. So where it goes and uh

where it moves to the uh next generation, I'm expecting your opinions. Thoughts from our panelists on that rather philosophical question. &gt;&gt; Um it's going to get worse if we don't

take action. Yeah. The level of intelligence I just mentioned will keep deep and AI will suddenly not become better but become worse because the source is becoming

worse. So yes it will all collapse. AI depends on us and we are getting less intelligent. So it gets less intelligent with time. I don't know what would be

left of both of us. So, but AI can be a very very uh instrumental addition to our research ecosystems properly understood and utilized. Thank

you. Well, let's let's end it there. Please round of applause to the to the panel. Thank you very much for uh for joining us here today.
