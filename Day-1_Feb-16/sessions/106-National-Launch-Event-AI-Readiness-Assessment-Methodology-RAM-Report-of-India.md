## 📝 Transcript

readiness assessment that we are launching here today. This RAM is not merely a technical audit. It's a diagnostic tool designed to ensure that the impact we discussed

this week is inclusive, ethical, and sustainable. By linking these these readiness findings to the summit's efforts, we aim to transition from high level ambition

to a grounded actionable road map for the nation. So as we heard the report is the outcome of sustained efforts over the last 18 months with many stakeholders.

&gt;&gt; We held five consultations across Delhi, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Guaki. More than 600 stakeholders including government, startups, research, civil society helped to build a grounded

picture of where India stands today and where it might want to go next. I would like also to thank the India AI mission and matey in particular for their partnership on the RAM initiative

in part in particular secretary Krishna and Mr. Singh's team have been incredibly supportive throughout this endeavor and we are excited about our joint collaboration to advance the

ethics of AI in India. Of course, in a country as vast and complex as India, inclusivity in AI is foundational. With 1.4 billion people, thousands of

languages, and deep regional and socioeconomic diversity, the question is not whether AI will shape our daily life, but how evenly or unevenly it might do so if we are not deliberate

about it. AI is already mediating access to welfare, employment, education, healthcare, justice. In this context, the design choices behind these systems have the power to determine who benefits

and who is left behind. When an algorithm determines who is shortlisted for a job, approved for a loan or prioritized for public services, its choice carries real human consequences.

And behind every data set is of course a citizen. Behind every algorithm, a life shaped by its outcome. So UNESCO's recommendation on the ethics of AI matters because it sets a clear

baseline for how AI should be used and in ways people can trust and the round helps map what's already in place and what might need strengthening. So while the detailed findings will be

shortly presented by my colleague, let me just offer a quick sense of what the RAM tells us about India's overall picture. And I must say we've done this round now I think in 70 countries more

than 70 countries around the world. So it's giving us a collective data set and India really does have a strong space for responsible AI. The country accounts for about 16% of the world's AI talent.

There is real momentum on multilingual AI and digital public services through efforts expanding Indian language data sets and models and the innovation system is vibrant and supported by

strong digital foundations. At the same time, there are areas that could improve. According to the assessment, access to an ethical use and showing of data could be strengthened.

Environmental sustainability needs to be built more directly into AI infrastructure planning. and ethics uh is there but could be more consistently reflected in [cough]

education and training including regional uh language offering uh offerings. So building on all of these findings the report sets out a few priority actions

to address the above gaps and translate readiness into responsible adoption across sectors. The India AI mission alongside key institutions such as the office of a principal scientific advisor

play key roles in this exercise. So India's AI future will be shaped not just by what is built but how it is built, who it serves and what safeguards are embedded from the start.

We should aim for AI that listens before it decides. AI that performs well not only in demos but in the lived complexity of real communities. And here in lies the real challenge.

The RAM report offers one practical path one of many. It reflects what data and stakeholders are telling us at the moment and it and it can translate into actions that the various stakeholders

government industry civil society can take forward together. So I'd like to once again thank the government of India and all our partners for their unwavering commitment to this

journey and we look forward to a continued collaboration on what will define India's leadership in ethical. Thank you very much. [applause] [clears throat]

&gt;&gt; Thank thank you uh Mr. Curtis for setting the context so thoughtfully. I think what you said about being deliberate in our approach really I think resonates with some of the

findings that we've got here. Um it now gives me great pleasure to invite Secretary Krishnan, Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology Government of India to deliver the

opening remarks. Secretary Krishnan, I don't need to say this to this room has been instrumental in st steering India's digital public infrastructure and AI governance vision. Sir, thank you for

your presence. [applause] Thank you very much and thanks thanks to UNESCO the you know agency which has worked on this readiness assessment report and

thank you for to your principal scientific advisor being present here today and uh more than anything else thanks to all of you who are participating as delegates to uh as part

of the India AI impact summit which I think has gotten off to really I would say a roaring start and uh there's been [singing]

all of you are here and there's been extensive participation great deal of enthusiasm great deal of energy um everywhere that we go and it's wonderful to see this

presumably also reflects part of our readiness to engage AI and to sort of at least the curiosity the need to find out what it is all about and the way that we can actually adapt it to what India's

needs are. I think that is that is truly what the response to this event reflects. Um, of course as was pointed out this is an effort over 15 months. I recall I was at an event about uh about

a year and a half ago at PMS headquarters here in Perry to sort of discuss on how this will go forward and I'm very glad that today we are seeing the final outcome of the readiness

framework. Uh it would undoubtedly help to inform what we in India are attempting to do in the AI space. Fortunately, the way we have designed the India AI mission is flexible and we

can sort of accommodate any midcourse corrections and changes that we need to do and the vision of the AI mission apart from of course the summit itself was

fundamentally to make sure that we without I mean given the constraints of how much public resources could be expended on AI what is it that we can do to clear the impact. So whether it is

the approach to creating the AI compute, whether it is the approach to skilling, whether it is the approach to creating the models or whether it is the approach to creating the databases, it is very

much grounded in something we wanted to do with partnerships. Um the government is not the only agency which is working in many of these spaces. We have a number of partners, number of

stakeholders who are working with the government to enable this in the way that we are rolling out the AI compute. We are doing it through a mechanism whereby the private sector steps in to

actually build it out and we enable access to those who need it the most by subsidizing the access. Now this is an approach which would possibly fit many other countries who don't want to invest

billions and trillions in actually building out the infrastructure at one go and are not sort of put off the idea of trying to access AI because by saying that it just costs too much and we can't

actually do I think there is an alternate approach which is what India is now championing to see that it it the access to some of the infrastructure of the

likewise I The skilling part of it is a very important part of the story and I was very happy to note the comments that have been made and recommendations which have been made in the report on the

skill. We have to address it at every level in existing organizations and institutions how they move forward in in uh for those who are still in schools and colleges in terms of what what

background they will need to move forward in this space and more than anything else I think readiness of organizations and institutions to actually enterprises to adopt because

ultimately unless we have applications and unless we have use cases converted into actual uh solutions your acceptance of AI into enterprises is just not going to be there unless

that acceptance takes place you don't see the real world impact and ultimately what's the point of building a model what's the point of building out huge compute what's the point of you know

setting up huge databases if it doesn't translate into something which is a practical utility in the real world and that is the ultimate goal which we are attempting to reach and in some ways I

think this report to some extent uh validates the approach we've taken and actually gives us much more of an impetus to pursue the line that we've taken to sort

of redouble our efforts on some of the specific parts of it and it's like a report card on some of the stuff that we've done and so thank you very much for sharing this with us. It would be a

very useful commentary on what has happened and the way that we can push this forward and the work that you have done here I'm sure is something which can be

transferred to other parts of the world to other countries in the global south for it to be really useful [singing] as to what would the the literally the playbook which needs to be developed how

they can actually work on it and [singing] move forward. So thank you again Mr. purpose and the entire university. [applause]

&gt;&gt; Thank thank you secretary uh for your remarks and for your openness to receive inputs along the journey. Thank you so much. Um next we are honored to have with us today Dr. AJ Kumar Sud,

principal scientific adviser to the government of India to deliver the keynote address. Dr. Sud's leadership in advancing science, innovation and evidence-based policy continues to shape

India's strategic direction in emerging technologies. Sir, may I now call upon you to deliver your &gt;&gt; Thank you very much, &gt;&gt; Mr. Tim Cartis.

practitioner who was here few seconds back. All the AI enthusiasts in the room. You can see this room is full of energy. You can see what is happening outside. It really tells that AI is here

to make an impact in our lives. So first I'm truly delighted to be here on the launch of this India AI readiness assessment methodology report and uh it has been a privilege for me and my

office of principal scientific advisor to be associated uh over uh last two years or two and a half years very intimately with this AI scene in the country helping to say uh shape fit

because this was discussed in the prime minister science technology innovation advisory council which I chair and it was very clear that we need admission more to really see the benefits of AI to

the society and I'm so glad that we can now see uh that it is bearing some fruits and much much more has yet to come. So uh we know that AI brings enormous opportunity. It's a no-brainer

to say this at this time, but we also know that it also carries a profound ethical uh social, environmental and human rights implication and uh its inherent opportunities

come with responsibilities and that's why UNESCO's readiness AI assessment matters a lot and this is the right time for it. So the real question before us

is not simply how fast we can adopt AI but how thoughtfully we can shape it. So this is a uh something for all of us to see. First, how do we ensure that AI truly serves people guided by a clear do

no harm principle? And the second, how do we make it fair, trustworthy, inclusive and align with constitutional values, human dignity and fundamental freedoms? So these are the

two basic questions which all of us need to answer. So presently at this point uh that is why this uh assessment uh methodology RAM it's a good word from semiconductor technology uh it will be

very catchy I can assure you when we say RAM people will be confused is it UNESCO RAM or is it Intel RAM so there will be a confusion but it's good confusion uh for this report it's very relevant at

this time uh because it offers a structure ed way for countries to reflect on their preparedness across legal, social, economic, scientific, educational and technological

dimensions. So many dimensions we have to see when we look at the assessment of this AI. So it also operationalizes global ethical principles into concrete actionable policy guidance without

hampering innovation. &gt;&gt; So at today's launch I thought time is very brief in seven minutes which have been given to highlight three core priorities for advancing uh ethical AI.

So let me just say that it these are not absolutely new which you have heard at this thing but let me say in my own words what it means because it is never harmful to say the good thing twice. So

I'm sure you will appreciate because it reinforces our commitment to this first AI ethics cannot be an afterthought &gt;&gt; within the AI system from beginning. So that has to be understood. This uh we

had uh uh uh we have recently come out uh perhaps most of you know with a technolal framework from our office uh namely strengthening AI governance through technolleal framework and we

believe that the grounding principles of ethical AI namely respect for human rights uh fairness, transparency, explanability, privacy, safety and accountability must

be embedded across the entire AI life cycle right from data governance, model designs, training, inference to final deployment with human oversight. So human has to be in the loop if we don't

want uh catastrophe. So this is something which we have articulated in our AI governance framework which was released in November 2025 and more recently in

the technolal framework which a white paper which came out few days back. So as we scale AI across sectors, these principles must be reflected in standards,

procurement frameworks, impact assessments and institutional mechanisms. in all of them. We need to embed this and this aligns obviously with the UNESCO's call for right based

policy measures and legal norms that keep pace with technological change and that is very essential because public trust depends on this and trust is the key thing which you have to realize that

the technology doesn't get killed but it gets deployed. So trust is the key issue which has happened with other technologies which did not take off because of the trust. So this is

something all of us should be very very keenly aware of. Second inclusions must remain central to India's AI journey. AI should work for all Indians across regions, languages, genders, abilities

and socioeconomic backgrounds. As was mentioned, we have a huge diversity in all of this. So, it's a absolutely good platform and a sandbox to really see what works and what doesn't work. And u

uh AI should help bridge divides and not widen them. This is something is a good metrics to see when we see the deployment of AI and uh it must be accessible in locally relevant

culturally sensitive format in an equitable manner for all. So please note culturally sensitive is very important which can be missed if you are blindly following AI developed somewhere else.

So this has to be born in mind because this will not come just by saying it. Unless you have the right data to which is culturally sensitive, it will not happen. So capacity building especially

for states, small enterprise, startups and underserved communities is equally important and these insights will be crucial as we move from assessment to action. And the third point, the last

point, collaboration is our biggest strength. So no single stakeholders can shape the future of AI alone. And uh we need government, we need industry, we need academia, civil society, research

communities, all of us have important roles to play and this collaborative approach is what uh a India AI mission has taken particularly its safe and trusted AI pillar and India's AI

governance guidelines. So the convergence between UNESCO's global ethical framework and India's national priority gives us a robust frame robust foundation for leadership and not just

adoption of AI. So the recommendation in this report I'm very sure will offer a practical road map strengthening institutional coordination enhancing regulatory and ethical oversight

investing in talent and research promoting data media and information literacy and deepening public engagement on air on all these factors. I hope this report will cover it which it does. I

didn't have a chance to look at all the things but I'm sure uh I'm it will cover them. So at this juncture it's a pleasure to acknowledge u and my appreciation on record for UNESCO uh the

India AI mission under MIT uh which is really doing a phenomenal job and our mighty leadership with Mr. and rational very very intimately engaged with all the stakeholders with our office all of

us are in this together uh the eeky guy law which is a part of this and most importantly all the stakeholders who contributed their perspective and expertise so thank you very much

[applause] the next phase obviously is the implementation phase and I'm sure uh this is the next phase uh of the outcome of assessment ment matrices and I'm sure uh we will meet uh one year from here on

out to see how the outcome of this assessment is done and that what will be the proof of the what is that pudding pudding thing so we I look forward to that and [clears throat]

uh I would only say this is a wonderful moment let us seize this moment or to really see that AI makes a difference to the societ society to the last mile and we hope that inclusive AI will be the

norm is not an exception. Thank you so very much. [applause] &gt;&gt; Thank you Dr. for those reflections and very grateful for yoursightful to &gt;&gt; and I I think the question everyone has

on their minds right now is what does the report really say and to walk us through the key findings and recommendations emerging from this national assessment. It is my pleasure

to invite Miss Yunong Kim program specialist and chief of section social and human sciences UNESCO regional office for South Asia. Uh Miss Kim has closely read the RAM process in India

and will present the report's key insights and policy recommendations. &gt;&gt; Hello everyone. It's amazing to see a full room and I'm very excited to present the findings of the RAM in

India. You must now be sick of hearing the RAM and wondering what what is this? What is the RAM? So it starts off by UNESCO's interpretation of AI readiness. When UNESCO looks at AI readiness, it

goes beyond infrastructure. We interpret readiness in terms of governance, in terms of institutional frameworks, in in terms of human capital readiness. So that is what we have tried to capture in

the India AI RAM report. Um as the structure of the India AI RAM report is divided into two sections. We start off with the diagnosis which has all the data that we have um collected

quantitatively through the indicators across 200 data points of the five dimensions the principal scientific advisor has mentioned as well as all of the qualitative data that we collected

through five stakeholder consultations across the country which we thought was important in a country as diverse as India. And then the second part is culminating all of these different

inputs into the policy recommendations. We have eight policy recommendations and each of the recommendations are linked with a concrete road map that is real realistic, actionable and also builds on

the existing AI infrastructure and ecosystem in India already. So as you can see we've conducted the secondary research as well as the consultations. Tim mentioned in his

speech as well that we were able to reach um inputs from 600 [laughter] more than 600 stakeholders across the country and we were very very happy that we did it in cities like Bangalore and

Hyderabad which is has a very mature AI ecosystem but also in cities like Gujati in the north northeast where we got very different inputs and insights where regional diversity was an important um

aspect that we have reflected in the RAM report. So I'll get on with the task of summarizing a 120page document into a 10-minute uh presentation. But let's see how well I can do. So the first uh

dimension is what we call the legal and regulatory dimension. If you look at India, it's very much a hybrid AI governance framework combining cross- sectoral laws, se sector specific

standards and voluntary guidelines led by the ministry, matei, the PSA's office, NITO and many other government bodies. It also has quite a strong cyber security readiness as you can see in

ITU's global cyber security index. And just to let you know, the report is being launched today. So you can see all of these data points within the report and it also has a very strong online

participation readiness. It still has quite an evolving data ecosystem reflected in a moderate open data performance. And then the stakeholders are telling us that they support the

government's principal paced o approach and cautioned against overly prescriptive regulations which I think the secretary also mentioned today. There was a strong call for a gap anal

analysis in the existing laws to identify what the existing laws cover and what are the existing gaps that probably future research can um uh address and definitely the experts call

for a stronger state and center alignment in terms of AI initiatives. Now we go on to the social and cultural dimension which I think is quite a unique aspect of the UNESCO RAM. We make

sure that this is a part of readiness when we talk about air readiness because we believe that there is no onesizefits-all kind of prescription.

&gt;&gt; There's definitely a strong momentum in India for multilingual AI as we can see in Bashi and different initiatives. digital access access to AI continues to expand, but there's still a bit of a

large issue in terms of the gender gap, especially in internet access. There's room for improvement in STEM inclusion, especially for young women and girls, and that's a very important part that we

tried to reiterate in the recommendations because without the STEM pool, it's also a narrow pool going into the AI talent pool. there's room room for improvement especially in terms of

sustainability and the environmental um impact assessments which is a strong recommendation from the report. The experts continued to say that socially beneficial AI projects were receiving

insufficient funding. And what they mean by socially beneficial AI projects is things on sustainability on on multilingual languages. And that's where we already quite see the government

directing towards and making sure that local language data is collected in AI. Um again the experts also echoed the importance of environmental impacts and making sure that is considered in the

future development of AI of of India. In terms of the scientific and educational dimension there's a very very strong innovation momentum in this country. We found that over 86,000 AI

patents were filed between 2010 and 202025 and that was over 25% of all of the t tech patents in this period which is absolutely enormous. There's an

expanding AI research ecosystem led a lot by the center of excellences led by the government and a very robust national AI skill skilling initiative as you can see here. There is definitely

room for improvement. First of all, a stronger mainstreaming of AI ethics into the education system. When when a lot of the initiatives talked about AI literacy, we found that AI ethics wasn't

necessarily at um always included. So, that was something that we found was scope for language. And that made it difficult for some of these students to access so much

of the opportunities that was out there in India. The stakeholders also corroborated a lot of these findings such as AI skilling still being remained very urbanentric and very English. So

what about the students and and the informal workers who are not in the urban areas nor is very fluent with English. So that was another very important dimen finding in the

educational dimension. For the economic dimension, I'm I hope I'm on the right page. There's a very very strong global positioning of India. It hosts 16% of the AI world's AI

talent, which is huge. And um it is one of the fastest growing AI talents across the world. It has a very vibrant industry ecosystem with 2,000 plus companies only in Bangalore. So across

the countries there's way more which is a very very positive sign but again in terms of distribution outside of the urban tech hubs there's still a lot of room for improvement access to financing

for a lot of the startups beyond Bangalore beyond Hyderabbad beyond Delhi was still continued to be um posted as an issue that can be resolved. stakeholders also asked for targeted

incentives to encourage firms to be more ethical in their approaches to um inclusive AI development. A lot of a lot of the stakeholders were saying ethical AI is great but if you don't give

financial incentives or any kind of incentives for the firms to follow, it's much more difficult for these firms to consider the ethical dimensions. Um the informal sector still largely remains

outside of the AI ecosystem where all the discussion we have here and we must recognize that India does still still has quite a huge large informal econ economy sector that should be considered

in the technical and infrastructural dimension. Um there was a strong national focus on building accessible affordable AI infrastructure but in terms of improvement um things like

electricity in certain areas where there's not constant electricity could be a problem in in accessing a lot of these um infrastructure AI infrastructure. We definitely w

stakeholders welcome the India emissions GPU procment um initiatives but again without sustainable or continued electricity some of these issues were um pointed out as there are room for

improvement. Now let's go on to the recommendations. The way we we decided or came up with these recommendations are definitely based on the 200 data points that we

collected through secondary research. It's corroborated with the stakeholder consultations that we conducted and we try to also understand the existing policy landscape so that we don't

recommend something that doesn't align with the government's uh initiative. We also wanted to make sure that they are realistic and actionable and you'll see here that each of the recommendations

have concrete road maps. So the first recommendation is to ensure informed AI governance uh governance across sectors through comprehensive evidence-based risk and legal review. What do we mean

by that? In the road map, we suggest three things. Number one, let's do a AI risk mapping. The AI safety institute which exists under the India AI mission can lead with academia industry

The second re recommendation is to create operational guidance for ethical AI. When we talk about ethical AI, we have a lot of principles. We have a lot of um frameworks, but can we make

something that's much more relevant and actionable to day-to-day lives of policy makers and developers? That's why we recommend that the AI safety institute creates first of all an ethical AI

repository with examples and case studies for people to really understand what specific use cases in ethical AI looks like. also have a voluntary measure especially with industry

partners to um implement them and experiment with regulatory sandboxes to test some of these responsible AI approaches especially in high impact sectors like healthcare, agriculture um

and and and pharmaceutical areas. The third uh recommendation which came out quite a lot I must say in the stakeholder consultations is to strengthen the center and state

coordination for AI governance and implementation. There are already um emerging actions from the government but dedicated center state coordination mech mechanism could help make sure that the

AI policy and planning at the state level are informed from the voices and opinions of all of the different states in India and also to develop pol modular policy implementation toolkits for

states to make it much more easier um to action on these policies. Next is leveraging the AI kosh platform which already exists and has huge potential in terms of data in in this

country. There are a lot of efforts already underway and we recommend to strengthen some of these existing offices such as the AI data office such as the data creation units in different

parts of the government to make sure that AI kosh can fulfill its full potential and we go a step ahead and also ask the private sector to contribute to AI kosh so that we can

make sure that this is very very useful for those inside and outside of the government. Next recommendation is about trust. How do we increase public trust of AI

governance? We recommend that um the AI safety institute can guide some of these init in initiatives. For example, have a nationwide study that can inform some of the campaigns and literacy programs and

also have model AI procurement guidelines that ensures and gives that trust to people that when AI is being procured, it is being done in an ethical way. Recommend six is all about skilling

and workforce and we have two parts to it but I'll briefly go through it. Um there was a strong strong call for uh making sure that India's workforce is AI future ready through capacity building

embedding ethics and supporting inclusive transitions. There was a lot of anxiety and concerns around especially mid uh career workers on reskilling and upskilling. It's not as

easy as it sounds to suddenly um embed all these new skills. So that was a strong call from a lot of the experts we talked to and we feel like the skills development ministry, the AI um safety

institute, the ministry of education can definitely play a role in pacifying some of these anxieties through platforms, through integrated um upskilling initiatives.

And yes, this was another very important point. AI capacity building for public officials was called for again and again in all across the government at center and state level that how important it is

for public officials to truly understand um at least have basic AI literacy in order to implement some of these um public initiatives but also policies. The seventh recommendation is to ensure

environmental sustainability considerations into AI infrastructure all across based on comprehensive studies and um making sure that environmental impact assessments is

truly meaningful uh rather than just a tick in the box. Last but not least, we talked about diversity in the AI workforce. We had another session that documented really the the data on how

women are not being as integrated into the AI ecosystem as we think it is and there's definitely scope for improvement especially going beyond the urban centers of of India. So this takes me to

the end of the presentation. The report will be available on UNESCO's homepage from today. So I hope you can all have a look and hope it's useful to the AI ecosystem in India. Thank you so much.

THANK YOU, YUNONG. I know that was a very difficult task to condense so much into such little time. Um, I'm sure people have questions for you, but they can read it online like you said. Uh,

we'll now quickly move to the final segment of today's program. Something I'm very excited about. Uh, a fireside conversation on global perspectives in ethical AI governance. Uh, it's my

pleasure to invite on stage Dr. Mario Gradzia. She's the chief of executive office social and human sciences UNESCO and has been very closely involved with the RAM in India. Um and Mr. Vas Dhar,

president of the Patrick J. McGovern Foundation. The McGovern Foundation has been supporting the RAM exercises in India and globally. Um this conversation will reflect on the global implications

of ethical AI frameworks and the role of multilateral collaboration in using and shaping trusted AI ecosystems. U over to you There we go. So, it's really my pleasure

and honor to be here with uh actually there are three words in my mind that always and as the president of the McGover Foundation. The first one

is insightful. There hasn't been one single in which I was talking to and then I thought oh I haven't thought about and this doesn't happen at all. So that's already one thing really that's

always help me it's a great pleasure to be with the other one is that he's a visionary. He has been seeing this transformation. He has been seeing the challenges coming with him and the

opportunities of course much before others and taking a really active role in that in steering it towards the right direction and committed always the energy you put in that the kind of the

determination but also the unusual way of thinking on how to address the problem is something that always has frightened me all the time by the time I've been talking to you so I don't have

I won't have questions for you today because we really want to get the best out of your brain so the first one is as brilliantly showing This report is very rich and it shows

that there is a lot of strength in India but there are also real complexity and I mean a scale is not the only one. So um you have supported UNESCO and a lot of your work anyway looks at what are the

factors that might be the ecosystem that might be conducive to AI that is ethical and how to make the best out of AI that really goes for your mind is there one example or one thing that India could

adopt replicate scale up in order really to set up already let's say the transformation information is very visible and it's very much there but what would be perhaps

something an addendum or an approach that you would suggest that India takes &gt;&gt; well thank you so much for that very kind introduction too kind you're supposed to set a low standard so that I

can exceed it not set a very high standard I want to thank you for this invitation at UNESCO and I also want to acknowledge Secretary Christian who I know had to go but also you Dr. Um I

want to say one scientist to another. I think it gives the world a great deal of confidence and comfort to know that you really have the kind of scientific background that's coupled with a moral

and a consciousness driven approach. Your technical frameworks as you know have been picked up in countries around the world already. I want to thank you for that leadership. Your question I

think is wonderful right but I'm actually going to flip it and I'm sorry you know me well. Rather than talk about what media should adopt I actually first want to talk about what the rest of the

world should adopt because I think this is not where we're saying what do we start here and figure out who else in the world your readiness assessment shows that India is actually far ahead

of the pack I think one of the things we should look to is a reconceptualization of what AI governance is actually about when you go to many places in the world AI governance is seen as a way of

limiting risk risk for institutions liability for people minimizing and in doing so you miss the amazing opportunity that's possible when you think of AI governance as a way to

incentivize a positive vision for the possible. You do that through a set of interventions that go beyond minimizing that go beyond restricting the worst

possible. You instead think about how you incentivize and name and elaborate a whole of society approach. one that centers the idea of participatory one that allows for people to engage in

as you have done with consultations across the country to let people not merely be the subjects of an AI governance but rather be the architect. We've seen that happen in India in the

DPI where we saw in digital public infrastructure the idea that while there were guidelines guard rails that were put forward much of the innovation actually came from a combination of

private and public sector who came together not merely to operate inside to say how can we consistently deliver services to those who are left out the market and yet in doing so also build a

framework that can then be picked up abstracted and shared. So this is my answer to you. I would say what the world needs to learn from is a governance that doesn't start from

heavy-handed restrictions but rather from the light touch that's been espoused here in the country but allows for the incredible innovation of 1.4 billion people to shape the world.

&gt;&gt; Absolutely. And actually one strong component of that is really the skills the human capital now in your mind because I've been here way too often and before me in relation

AI skills and I've always been saying to me it's more skills for the digital era what do the digital look for you and what you see for a lot of action

depends also what we are aware we might not be aware &gt;&gt; look I think the first part of the story was we have to build technical skills at scale across a population. We very

quickly realized that doesn't make sense. We don't need 1.4 billion AI scientists. We barely need like you know a few hundred thousand. What we need instead though is a population that

understands the opportunity set that's available to in the past few months I've had the opportunity to travel across India and across the world as you know visiting those top tier institutions

which are known for their engineering prowess and having great conversations with students and faculty. But you know where I find inspiration is when you go to those other institutions. They're

often termed two or three. I reject the premise. But here in India institutions like PSG, like Micah, like Amriita University, places where students come together in an environment where they

have access to the underlying ecosystem of AI, but then they bring their lived experience from communities across the country. They may or may not be able to sit down and understand exactly how to

build the next frontier model, but they do know that their are struggling with drought. They know that agricultural productivity is at risk. They know that the electricity grid is not functioning

the way it should. They know that dislools that are available and build real solutions. Solutions that operate at low cost, sometimes in low power and low

connectivity environments that deliver real value for Somebody agrees with me. I like it. &gt;&gt; And actually, so there are a lot of this is something

that it's really good to be able to discuss that for whatever reason in the discussion in &gt;&gt; I'll take one. I think there are many

but you called out in the report and I know that the government is very aware of it. India will go from about 1.4 gawatt in data center capacity to projected 9 to 10 gawatt in the next and

when you look at that and you understand it on one side there is a wonderful storyline of companies investing in building on the other is the community for those data centers the environmental

impact and sustainability issues that will arise now the conversation that I'm asking to have is not to name those risks because we already know them but rather about what a uniquely Indian

model might one where you center economic sustainability as a frontline matter not as something thinking about mandatory disclosure instead of voluntary definition of the

impact on water and local power of building mechanisms that say fresh water cannot be used for data centers unless there's enough to go around because we know there are commercially viable

alternatives or other things and finally to note that even in India and especially in India the tariffs on renewable energy are actually lower than where natural gas is. What would happen

if we were to mandate that in order to put that you not only have to commit to the increase in energy but commit to building that capacity. This is the opportunity here that as you

begin this incredible ramp up can you use those technal frameworks to actually build a new mechanism and show the world what sustainable data center look like. &gt;&gt; Certainly and this would also speak to

the issue of inequality which was raised during the presentation. So suppose you can decide tomorrow put one thing in and you have limited unlimited resources to do that.

&gt;&gt; Uh for sure human &gt;&gt; sign me up. This is a good story line. I love it. &gt;&gt; What would you do? What would be the first thing that you're going to do?

&gt;&gt; It's the easiest question in the world because what I would do is ask communities across this country what they prioritize and rank as their primary.

&gt;&gt; But once you've asked them No, that's great. But I mean, I don't want [laughter] to skip over it, right? I don't want to be flip about it because one of the things is when we name

participatory AI, we often skip over the fact that that requires participation. But once you ask them, I think there are a couple of things that I would advise, right? The first is really investing in

this idea of translational AI. Take what models enable and allow and invest meaningfully in building the architecture that brings it in the form of apps and services in the form of

that actually lets us change I think we could look at priority sectors and we've done that already. I think in the report you identify them but focus also on where you see

innovation sectors that are organically emerging across the country and invest in them. &gt;&gt; So I think those of you in the room that can do something tomorrow might want to

start thinking about this. Now one last question because time's up and I see it very clearly unfortunately as my music but there is one thing we were talking before in the other panel about the

different France that AI is taking and actually uh we were discussing also about agents which are you know perhaps now the the kind of developments that um excites many but fright and others and

the question is well they've been with us now for some time but we haven't seen the scale of adoption that we would expect In your mind that you've been you know analyzing this thing what is that

is and should we start thinking about dynamics like the ones we have seen for instance with the internet of things and the kind of failing to develop being adopted at the pace you would expect.

&gt;&gt; It's a great question and this is a really nice story. I'll be very quick about it. We saw the first generation of agents to do some of the most boring things you can imagine. companies that

build agents to increase profitability by redeploying your CRM, by working in your workspace. And can anybody in this room really say they were excited about that? I don't think so. But we saw a new

phenomenon happened just in the last few weeks. We saw hobbyists come forward with an open platform for building agents and it took the world by swarm. Why? Because we allowed people to be

creative in their use. We let them bring agents into their lives and solve their problems. And with that, we saw hundreds of thousands of people deploy agents at scale. We even saw all kinds of weird

effects like agents talking to each other online and even most interestingly now a service that lets agents autonomously go and contract a human being to go and do a task for them in

the real world. This is the future right agentic AI is not a corporate term and it cannot become one. It has to be a way of extending human agency in ways that the powerless have never had. A way of

democratizing access to the ecosystem of both economic success but also environmental political Join me in thank in thanking Vi. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much for that.

I think we've been cut off. &gt;&gt; Thank you everybody.
