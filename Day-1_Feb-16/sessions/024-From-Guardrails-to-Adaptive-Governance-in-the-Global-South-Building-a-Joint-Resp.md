## 📝 Transcript

sentencing policy and criminal justice. We are working on that. We're all sentenced and we know that in that criminal system in the end of the day after conviction

the judge would be looking at all those aggravating and factors in the appropriate and there that particular decision making will be a human decision making

only because that has to take into account the variety of factors. Friends, I I have an interest to share with you that in our Indian philosophy we have those concept lovers. These are

those nine emotions or sentiments starting from love, then like the first one, laughter, sorrow, anger, energy, fear, distress, wonder and finally

peace. Now these are human sentiments and they are integral part of decision making when we are dealing with human being and these are the factors where a human

brain will capable of empathy is at work. So we take the help from machine for shifting across the things putting things in order but then in the end of

at the end of the day the final decision making definitely remains with the adjudicators and there we ensure we we all as the law professional what is required for us to ensure is that since

we all are dedicated to the constitution of morality this black box system whatever we use it remains a glass box for all of us transparent.

Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you so much. And as we conclude with this session today there are three important reflections which stand out very very clearly. The first

reflection is that technology is no longer at the periphery of judicial system. It's already becoming a part of the main architecture of this entire judicial ecosystem and all kinds of

initiatives which Supreme Court has already taken. They very well demonstrate that we are on the way towards institutional reforms for adopting and adapting to this

technology. The second important reflection here is that no matter what every development, every technological advancement, every framework which we create should be constitutionally

anchored and humanentric in its approach because it's we human beings who are at the end of it. And the third very important reflection which emerges today is that the future lies not in replacing

human not in replacing the judicial system but in strengthening the entire system when it comes to equipping courts and judges with tools technologies that enhance

research streamline case management and reduce tendency and of course expand access to justice. So with this uh the road map ahead which is a very important uh key takeaway from from this important

panel discussion. The road map ahead requires clear ethical guardrails. It requires transparent implementation. It requires institutional oversight capacity building within the judiciary

and finally and very important one continuous public trust. So with that we conclude the session. Thank you very much everyone. On behalf of National University Delhi, I extend my sincere

gratitude to all the panelists here. Justice Mah Shah Raji to each one of you for taking out time to join us for this final discussion. I also extend my sincere

gratitude to my team to India AI impact team Dr. Son Gupta and her team for giving us this important platform for this deliberation today and to of course all of you some of you all the

participants for your thoughtful attention and engagement today. So uh with this I would request my colleague Dr. Nakshima Chandra to present a token of gratitude to the panelist here.

&gt;&gt; This is the momentto from mighty as well as national university sir. Alhamdulillah. Yes.

Thank you very much everyone. Thank you. That's my brother. RA, ICMR and healthy for bringing this entire panel together on this very very important topic from

adaptive governance. No longer a futuristic concept in health history. It is already there and public health is reshaping how it works.

There holds an enormous promise improving efficiency, security and strengthening the system performance. But alongside this promise comes a very

very fundamental challenge and the challenge is that unlike the traditionalities, &gt;&gt; AI systems are dynamic. Yes, sir.

Existing regulatory approaches provide essential guard. However, they're also rooted in static hard law models that struggle to keep pace with fast evolving.

And without adaptive governance, we risk infiltrate data right and of

India and country where digital adoption is advancing rap sometimes even ahead of the governing spirit. India stands at a very very clear

critical standpoint with digital public health goods like I used digital health mission already in place. We are not here to just adopt AI but also to shape governance models that

are contextually relevant, equitable and globally instructed. So as the character just mentioned we are moving in this panel from a single track regulatory mindset towards a

twotrack adaptive governance model. The first is regulatory guardrails across the AI total product life cycle from development to deployment and to post market monitoring.

Second, a contextualized AI in technology assessment framework. One that integrates the local society and equity dimensions alongside traditional assessment of cost, utility,

interoperability and system and system but they need to be interwined. And today in this session we aim to bring to discuss AI governance but to not only to

discuss AI governance but to collectively reflect on how to ensure that AI is safe, trusted, just and most importantly responsive to the reality of so without much ado I will

Thank you, Monica. And uh just to introduce myself I'm the director of the opportunity to tell you more about what we do at

so um the introduction I'd like to start this conversation with just two paradox. The first part is digital health and technologies growing faster than cycles

and then not only are they evolving faster when we talk about technical consideration aspect that raised earlier that AI solution are not just the solution that we use as device support

but all solution that are used for mental health optimization in the hospital uh um um operations. So all these applications that are nonical. So there is really that duality that we

need to take into account is that often working for the perfect regulation framework in So that raises the question,

&gt;&gt; how do we foster &gt;&gt; more innovative governance approaches? &gt;&gt; Yes ma'am. &gt;&gt; And this is really the question that um asked earlier today and this will be the

conversation today. &gt;&gt; But before they answer that question, let me just talk about health. So we are global agency for responsible for AI and health. We're a local independent

nonprofit partner and we're based in Switzerland. And we have national capacity to regulate artificial. We convene governmental authorities and the world

local regulatory network. That's what we do. We work and partner for different states. And basically we have this country develop

and splash a national and regional 4 It's a board and we get a public global repository solution at least around the world or at

least around the country we work with and then establish a global early bing system and actually today &gt;&gt; we already have 10 private countries um that represent

20 that represent 28% of the world population and that's also eight um countries as part of the global south and as you can see I said 10 countries

two are still uh to be um announced On top of our activities with the global regulator network, we also have a community of practice where it's really about and sharing best practices for

responsibility in healthcare. &gt;&gt; So what's council and I have to tell you India was one of the first signing as a pioneer country for our global regulatory

network. So we work as an implementation partner and we have a technical acceleration framework that consists. &gt;&gt; So the first phase is the baseline assessment where we really discuss with

our sponsor and get with different authorities and make an assessment of the readiness of the platform. Then we do a discovery workshop and then um we have the strategy planning phase

which is the navigator which I'll discuss in the next slide and then that when we roll out the capacity strengthening &gt;&gt; and some monument that allow us to go

back to the baseline assessment. So you can already see here that we initiate that circular approach. It's not just like one big turn on the R&amp;D like regulations.

&gt;&gt; Hello. Let me take you through the navigator and why it's so important. So it's our implementation plan tool that translate the gaps in opportunity to identify in

the deadline assessment and we turn them into actionable steps across the key responsibility governance uh dimension. So we already mentioned earlier in the lecture

in the world today we have dynamic. And next to these hyperdamic AI to product life cycle process practices we have static and linear regulatory processes. Last but not least we have

high level healthcare governance requirements. These are all the guidelines. It's very high level often time difficult to just translate them to how how to put them in the real

world in my own context. But what we've done at LPI was package all these together in the double governance map to navigate from execution. When you ask yourself the

question again, how do you fail? Then we can look here again and look at just a regular very waterfall. It's very linear. When you look at life cycle approach, it's very cyclic.

So beautifully you could start anywhere. So for any country you can say this is my position today and I'm starting from there. So if I take the question well actually this guidance and my priorities

are really to um to create evidence then we can use that mapping to help you redefine your regulatory processes and policy in a more dynamic framework for medical devices.

This is really important for that health. So how healthare can assist you? So it start with as I said at the beginning the global regulation network and the

partnership we can do as India as the global south there is already network that can define shared common frameworks for instance mechanisms and then from there you can use the navigator

tool to use anchor in the regulatory river that's really for the sake of transparency approaches &gt;&gt; but as you mentioned earlier it's not enough so we have a health technology

assessment well AI for health technology assessment because we need to make that distinction which health technology assessment just related to medicine and we really need something specific for

digital health and the technologies and we have a blueprint where you can weave in all the aspects of value on economy, clinical workflows, ethics and equity balance and constraints and why it does

matter. This is the you need to contextualize your needs to the realities of your own country. And then we have a regulatory sentence um package where basically you can build

the control and step by real world learning and evidence through through that mechanism which is an example of what we do and that's what we want to discuss with the panelists today. It

allows you to move faster without breaking trust. But most of most importantly as a company we can use those methods use those innovative approaches to reimagine health and care

all together. Thank you very much. I'm sorry if I have to rush you not but hopefully you had a view on where we stand and I'd like to continue discussion. I need to um excuse

that we have photo but I really need to apologize on behalf of uh of Alan Pan who has been delayed with his flight so you cannot attend. &gt;&gt; Yeah, we can have a a group photo now.

That's All right. So, let lettuce um for coming here and sorry for doing good but let me start with Dr. Vidushi Shaki. So Vidushi

holds a PhD in international politics from La University in New Delhi and she has served for more than 20 years as Indian civil servant in diverse sector

including social finance and technology and as part of her engagement in IO project. She has been addressing questions of emerging technology innovations helping to solve problems

faced by humanity or on the impact of transformative technologies such as AI logistics, climate resilience, sustainable development, societal bodies and trust. Uh Dr. Ricardo

next one is a pathologist senior lecturer and head of the department of basic science at the uh mana school of medicine and health science university of Fiji. He also lectures in tele

medicine and digital medicine preparing future clinicians to navigate in the digital and medical healthare ecosystem clinical practice and scientific growth who brings a really integrated global

south perspective to the evolving conversation on responsibility healthcare Dr. Aurva welcome. So after completing her medical

training Aurva pursued a PhD at the National Institute of Mental Health and Neuroscience. Her areas of interest include child and adolescent psychiatry particularly neural development

disorders and neuro imaging and prior to her current policy or editor at the lens version of Southeast Asia was work uh worked as a clinician in child and adult and mental health in scientific publish

but not least uh he is a senior global health advisor at the Norwegian agency for development cooperation working on international development, health financing and digital innovation. His

work focuses on strengthening health systems and supporting equitable access to health technologies and development, cooperation and strategic partnership. So you can see that the Spanish is quite

diverse. Yeah, you will have other session today um around around resilience mechanism around um uh sandboxes that are more technical and I think we really wanted to put it as a

strategic with a panel session that has multiple perspective question &gt;&gt; because

you're actually setting scenes I have lots of question about real world evidence but &gt;&gt; I'd like to frame it more with you on the strategy side and

so are there particular regions or topical gaps you'd like to address sharing with us for this context of global south and innovative &gt;&gt; thanks so much uh I think um as you just

as Dr. mentioned I'm from the publishing side of things and I'm from the Lancet which is uh particularly the Lancet regional health Southeast Asia &gt;&gt; which is a journal that publishes all

about the health concerns of the countries belonging to the WH Southeast Asia region and um like you said it's a nice platform to have we aim to give a voice to all the diverse stakeholders of

the region so um I the way I see it uh there are things that can be done from all sides So from the edi from an editor's perspective, how much are we encouraging research that is coming from

our population uh that perhaps has a smaller sample size or is something that is novel to our region perhaps not to the world. Uh are we putting out calls for that kind of research? Are we um

putting out commissions? Are we encouraging policy pieces? Uh so uh that's what we really need to see uh to support uh and we need to also you know uh so if people have this kind of

research we they need to be aware that there is a platform for it and it has value because it is representing this population. Uh from um we can also ensure diversity in say the editorial

board or the peer review process uh to make sure that we are looking at it with the correct um context. So we are able to appreciate the value of that piece of work and that research. Um from the

author's side we can um we can uh standardize &gt;&gt; we can as we work with all other research we're going to also need to sort of standardize a set of um uh what

to say protocols for this sort of research that's coming in. How transparent is the data? Where is um the provenence of the data? we need to be, you know, very clear on what we're doing

with what is coming to us and um yes and I think um that is what we can do from our side as a publishing industry and uh we need to give this more of a space because this is the future and we need

to you know prioritize these pieces uh more often and yeah &gt;&gt; thanks thank you for that and I have more question from what you said but I like to give the the chance from the

other side the scientist and and lecturer. So um Dr. Ricardo, &gt;&gt; would you like to to really give us your words as a clinical doctor and lecturer and digital technologist for health?

What are the opportunities the global south in general responsibility and especially why you need more health and care?

&gt;&gt; Okay. First question was &gt;&gt; the challenges. So the challenges not only difficult to overcome number one in using AI number one we need to have a very strong internet

connection but uh so far in Fiji uh we have this problem with our internet connection for in we are being cut sometimes not because of we're not really but sometimes weather disruptions

and also uh for challenges in AI I people should know how to use AI. It's like AI is student and you are the teacher. From one movie they said there's no such thing as bad student but

a bad teacher. If you put a bad uh trunk or order to that AI, chances are you'll have a bad command also. The student will have a bad command. So that's the challenges. Can I can I have

just the one? I forgot the second. &gt;&gt; Yes. What about the the opportunities and uh why why there's a lot &gt;&gt; for opportunities? Number one for example in not only in Fiji but not only

in uh in India but in all countries there's a lot of patience in having AI we can now streamline or try what is needed and because they can uh they are very fast in knowing those things uh the

patients you can now have much more understanding of your patient rather and then you leave it for an hour the AI will read it for you but again depending on the prompt that you'll be giving the

opportunities it will shorten our time when we have AI but I'll quote this again there's no such thing as a bad student but a bad teacher if you are bad in doing the prom

you will really have bad bad uh results Thank thank you Dr. I think we raise about regulation but when I'm talking about governance aspect

thank you for that point then from from there and it's quite it's quite important you know then I will ask here uh solution for you. I mean the current

work of the book uh I think it's quite interesting again I mentioned about education but you know before I think when we talk about all the digital solutions that Dr. mentioned

you have problem with internet infrastructure needs to be done the digital setting needs to be done it needs to be done [snorts] and from your work how is India driving this adaptive

governance for the country and the global south at large through technology &gt;&gt; thank you Raido good morning everybody and thank you for having me here it's a great opportunity

uh well u as far as governance is concerned I would like to say that the end goal has always to be kept in mind and we have to be very clear of what is it that we are aiming at when we talk

about governance and of course in the case of AI we know that AI is evolving so fast that governance is a very very huge challenge not only for us in India but all over the world and uh because

you know when we talk of governance we would like to keep the values the ethics that is very very specific to this part of the world very central to whatever we try to do when we talk of governance and

policy formulation and therein India is taking a lead in bringing together the global south and as we know this is the first biggest you know conference on AI in the global

south and India took a lead during the G20 and uh conceptualized the digital public infrastructure and you know the public part of it is very important because it comes from the doctrine of

public trust and at the end of the day it is the citizenry it is the people it is the individual who's the owner of whatever assets are created and whatever assets have to be governed so that is to

be kept in the mind always so that is the human and the humane aspect and when we come to the global south we know that AI is a technology which has been concentrated whether it is development

deployment conceptualization by a very few hands in the global north and that is the reason why the global south has to come together and AI is forcing us I mean there is no other way

we have to cooperate and partner with each other we have to create an R&amp;D ecosystem because it's not that you know one country or one part of the world can do everything global south cannot do

anything without coming together and that is What is all about this conference the realization that we can work only as partners we cannot work in isolation in silos AI has taught us that

so when we come to the governance part of it of course inclusion the values of global south that is peace tolerance democratization of technology becomes very very central to whatever we do and

therefore the partnership becomes veryant important. It's not that I'll go solo because we know that AI is a two-h horse race. And what are we going to do? Are we going to sit as witnesses to

whatever is unfolding before us? Therefore, conferences like this bring together governance people, policy makers, researchers, academicians and of course people at the helm of affairs to

realize that we cannot be left behind. We have to set the agenda. We have to see that these are the ethical values that have to be inbuilt into the AI models and of course the AI models are

being built with a motivation and with a an incentive which is a little different when it comes to the global north. So we have to see what are the ethical values that we cherish the most in the global

south and that is of course talking about inclusion because we are yet to climb the development ladder so we cannot afford to leave anybody behind. Democratization is very very important

to us. So look at the models that are being developed. There's so much of violence against women. There are child health issues. When we make a model we we keep these things in mind and we are

not you know focused on creating models which are only attuned to creating profits for us. We think of people people people and as we know people

planet is also the one of the goals of this conference. So I think that's what we I would like to point out at this juncture. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thanks a lot. Um actually

before we go we go to hea because he is here to represent the family of all just said must resonate but he's just there is a question I have we let the

audience ask question after but the question I have for all of you When you talk about the global So again collective action is important

for all of us especially where the technology is one of the main challenges now I'm changing my my points the main challenge is if you have a data set that is

geographically biased because the models, the tools, the medical products are trained in a different population setting and then we would like to apply it in another

setting. This is as a [clears throat] recipe for because at least it will lead to mis treatment, misdiagnosis and explosion. it's extreme and this might lead to

death. So this is or at least it will make the solutions and products that are made somewhere will not work in that recipient. So, so these are the we need

really and in that context mobilization has got a new dimension. That's why education, infrastructure, uh capacity, regulatory, capacity and so on. It's very important because you will

never have localization unless you build these pillars and you put that in place. Uh so this is my my reflection on this. If I have two minutes to to go back to my my points because I I represent uh as

a Norwegian development agency um and uh we are under the Ministry of Health in Norway. So we are a development agency. So we manage funds and we manage uh the global health funds in Norway and global

health has been one of the main priorities for developing the systems in um innovation has been one of the main pillars and we have been doing this in 25 years

now almost with great success in ending the market. So because innovation saves lives costs um stress health systems and improving

quality of healthare um and that's why going back to 2010 before the MDG's uh deadline innovation came into the agenda top of the agenda because of that because we wanted to

accelerate the achievement of the MDGs sound familiar now we are on track to achieve the STDs. So that's why innovation is important, right? In addition

so coming out of the pandemic, we we appreciated how innovation helps in the response of during the pandemic and then strengthening health system post pandemic.

Um and why we apply to trans system because to deliver on your system and health security. So optimizing processes and delivery

through digital tools like AI is going to be important going forward. So for us at Norway Lura region development agency we have been moving from early engagement

on digital health with focus on evidence what works is it scarable part of that and so on to now trying to have a balance between the regulatory and the governance so to reap

the the benefit of this technology because it is is is developing so fast nobody is keeping peace right uh so so from that to this from evidence on impact and scalability and

sustainability and the gaps that we we saw at that time to now regulating chasing the technology with regulation. So we have to strike the balance right

uh and that's why with a purposeful and sufficient funding and support to our normative partners to our technical partners like LCI we can do that together

um I will come back to some of the points &gt;&gt; thank you I'll just tell in brief uh that you know India India has a very large cohort of young population and uh

we have a demographic dividend. So therefore the adoption and diffusion of technology is extremely uh impressive in India. We all know that the youngsters are born in the AI age and there's no

problem for them. There's no discussion of legacy technology or electronistic technology moving forward. So that is not a problem for us. But the problem is to blend innovation, adop adoption,

diffusion, walk together, you know, take everything together and building an ecosystem for R&amp;D is our biggest challenge according to me. &gt;&gt; So well, we we think we are better off

as far as adoption and diffusion of technology. That's our strength. Thank you. by an agency which will have the credibility of the question.

probable nature. &gt;&gt; I would love to take because because this is one of the main impact AI has on the work we do. You know AI is blaring the line between what is medical device

and what is medical solution. So from before we have this picture in that uh medical devices were made in in rich countries and then to to to low and middle countries with no

infrastructure and capacity to use them. So in my time for many years ago who estimated that 4 to 70% of medical devices that are in the were not in use but before now with AI we add another

layer of complexity to approving assessing controlling and so on so so that's why I my my point about modernization is very important and we have always to think access

&gt;&gt; before starting creating a new device or building a new device. access for in where these devices are going to be used and and the point of um of uh of the data set how

this these model this products are going to be trained is very important now because the main shift the main shift is AI is before it was human who were defining the logic now it is the data

which defining the logic and this treatment. &gt;&gt; I'll be a little brave and uh maybe add a few points. Uh thank you sir for the question. Uh so I have come across a lot

of research which does exactly what what you say. Um they're testing out a device in a population for which this device was not created for and then the study is only for a short period of time and

then there's no followup. So I feel uh this actually points to an evidence gap. It would be great uh to you know look at research that um addresses the felt needs of clinicians. Do they really need

that device for this particular uh clinical protocol or clinical workflow? Uh how suitable is it for our population? Is it addressing a real felt need? And uh once it has been

implemented uh is there a longitudinal followup uh and is there uh monitoring that goes on to it. So I think that would also perhaps add valuable evidence which could

you know give us insight that we need for governance question. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. My question is so in terms I'm also a PhD scholar

also. So I wanted to ask how are you considering AI in terms of publishing and how should be this

question. Perhaps it's a bit out of scope for the panel but um I think it's inevitable. People are going to use AI and you have to we know that that is going to be part of the future. Um what

we try to advocate for is you acknowledge that where you have used AI. So for example for language editing that that is another way of you know um creating equity. Uh if you're going to

be writing in a language you perhaps may not may not be comfortable with scientific communication is in English for the most part. um there it has its uses. Uh but what is important is

authors acknowledge that uh they take responsibility for what is there in the manuscript and they own their data and they own what they're trying to say about their data. So um but it's still a

very nent um and but I think there'll be a lot more um regulations that come up in the future. &gt;&gt; Sorry, just one question. Is that okay? Just one minute.

Sorry just one question because we also work in the same space from Delhi. Uh so a lot of LLMs are at the last mile digitizing the health work or healthy and all that. So I my question

is basically to Dr. Okay. Uh is the is the government thinking of creating a national framework for kind of standardizing NLMs which works in the last in order to ensure that you meet

certain standards because multiple of us partners national and global partner you're working in but it is not national level framework on that. So just wanted to

&gt;&gt; thank you for that question. That's a very very important uh point that you have raised. So uh we are aware that in in in the context of India we are going uh we are taking a sectoral approach. So

the different uh sectoral regulatory bodies are laying down the principles and the guard rails and the points that are to be you know the ethical values that are to be incorporated while

designing and developing a model. That being said, as far as the last mile connectivity is concerned, that is a huge concern and there is still thought processes that are going on and I don't

think there is a readymade solution as of now. I must admit that. But uh you have raised a very important point and for Ashas we are trying to give them tablets and we are holding hackathons

and we are holding you know competitions amongst youngsters startups who are trying to create models which will suit specifically say Asha because you know these are very very specific needs. So

after the need assessment has been carried out we are we are throwing open a competition and we are asking the public and the youngster startups to come with solutions and then we would

look at it and then adopt it but not any one size of thanks a lot. So as a conclusion, Professor said at the beginning you really wanted to hear the panelists

what they have to say.
