## 📝 Transcript

Yes. &gt;&gt; And Dr. Ba is just it's right about time. &gt;&gt; I'm sure you've been able to do your 10K steps for the day.

&gt;&gt; Perfect. You're right here, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So before we begin the session, we'd like to sort of have all speakers join us up front for a group picture, which

is the mandate for the India team. So request all speakers to sort of gather in the front so that we can take a group picture and also the cast team including Olivia and Stefan.

&gt;&gt; Uh the front is here. Yeah. Okay. Thank you all. Just to set the context of this session,

I'd like to invite Stephan Stampy from CAT to sort of give us a little bit of the context of what the session is going to explore. Stephan, please. &gt;&gt; Good afternoon,

excellencies, members of parliament, ladies and gentlemen. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm representing the long um rule of law program in Asia. We are based in Singapore and we are a long time a

long-term partner of the Dino. So we have embarked on these issues many years ago and we are happy to be part of the AI impact summit now and this year this year it couldn't be any more timely. I

mean the developments on the tech side are enormous basically by the week, by the day, sometimes by the hour and I mean I would argue that we do have that we already see AGI the artificial

general intelligence. Maybe we are already on the way to the certain super intelligence. Maybe we will see singularity at one day sooner or later. And of course given all

the chances and the opportunities that the tech side and the tech development has and provides for all of us for all walks of life, communication, work, life as such. Um there are some downsides

obviously uh some risks that we need to assess um that we need to take care of uh very well to keep things in balance and that's why I'm happy that um you know

this week will be the forum for exactly those discussions and on the German side uh we are very much looking forward to engage with India and beyond. It's always good to be back in Delhi and and

embark on this. And I think that you do have the global dimension, but um there's also of course the bilateral component that Europe and India can embark on. For example, when you know

there's not too much of a difference when for example a school child or Cuba in India or in Germany in Europe uh uses AI tools to conduct the homework then most likely as of today the language

models they use are not trained in India or in Germany. So we need to balance things out. We need to talk about the consequences that all of this means. I mean language is culture. culture is

connected to ethical issues, values, health and so forth, religion and more. So we are very much open to embark on those discussions. That's why I'm happy that we have uh on the German side we

are here with a number of speakers for this session for this panel two speakers. There's Marcus Zebat from TUM. You might have heard of the institution Technical University Munich um and the

think tank they have. They also have a presence in India. And of course uh we have uh the minister of the state of Essen, the minister for digitalization and innovation of one of the key states

in Germany that is driving a driving force in Germany when it comes to digitalization and also AI developments Mr. Mrs. Christina Cinemos she's on her way. She's I think now at gate seven

making her way. So I'm I'm confident that we will see her here soon and you know contribute to the discipline. So thank you very much to all of you on the panel and I'm very much discussing

today. Thank you very much. &gt;&gt; Thank you Stefan. We were supposed to have the the keynote address by Mr. Singh but he's also on his way. He's almost reached the building. Apologies

but we will have his address a little later during the session. For now uh you know given the posity of time I'll start the discussion through this panel. Today we will try to explore how India and

Germany are looking at their own national perspectives on rulemaking, how we're sort of advancing institutional accountability, preventing any power concentrations and also learn a little

bit about cross jurisdictional learning and social political sensitivities that exist in both countries through the expertise of the panelists that we have on the dis. Uh without further ado and

also just to lay some ground rules given that we have a set time limit would request all my uh my panelists to sort of you know give their remarks as succinctly as possible but also sort of

you know uh do engage the audience with whatever your expertise in. So we'd love to hear more from you but also be cognizant of the time that we're trying to work out on. Uh so I'll just quickly

start uh and susit and bat sir my question this question is to you maybe Dr. Patra you can answer first and then we'll go to uh but the idea is to understand you know what India's current

approach to AI governance essentially is what are we thinking around the principles that we keep talking about the transparency accountability explanability and others how we're

approaching it in the various sectoral laws that govern the country right now what is the current status quo if you can sort of enlighten the audience a little bit on that

Thank you so much. I'll be very brief for an Indian politician. So uh I would use the operative word inclusive in a country where data is not

proportionately and evenly distributed. We have and I'm also a member of the parliamentary standing committee on communications and information technology. Our focus is on soft touch

regulations. So we're not looking at this point of time on very hard knuckle regulation like the India EU a act AI act that we have. But having said that we are focused on a constitution-based

approach. The constitution based approach is based on equality, transparency, accountability and inclusivity. So having said that the regulations that

we are focusing on today as a nation and at least at the parliamentary level is to ensure that while we do have guard rails to ensure that we have responsible AI at the same point of time we do not

want to have such hardbound laws coming in that will stifle innovation and probably not allow our innovators and entrepreneurs to also move forward. So very briefly I must say that it's a

constitution-based approach based on value as we know that the rural economy that we have the data may not be as easily accessible and probably not readily available as probably urban

India we still have a digital divide. So being responsive to those approaches and the needs that are still there and the lack of probably enough data available across every village and every district

of this country. We have to ensure that inclusivity stays a key element and interoperability through the DPI the digital public infrastructure and the DPI stack that we

have is ensured. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thanks Dr. Praat sir. What are your views on this? How is India sort of approaching the conversation on AI governance and are there any lessons

from us from the EU AI act as we see it which is the risk space approach that they follow and is it anything that we can adopt from them learn from them or do better

&gt;&gt; firstly we're all a little scared what's what's going to happen &gt;&gt; as a public representative as said We are here in a life of service to ensure

that we bring balance to society. &gt;&gt; But I recent tweet written by Mr. Dalio speaking about I don't know if any of you has it speaking about how history

has taught us how powers work. So essentially rules uh are demanded by the weak &gt;&gt; to control the powerful and the powerful don't operate by any rules.

They change the rules once they leave the power. So when we are in government now &gt;&gt; there is both an explicit and an implicit choice that we have on how we

are going to govern ourselves. Based on my work in the last two years, I want to believe that the government and my party which is a part of the India alliance are good actors and they

do care about ensuring that there is a rule-based order and the constitutional values are &gt;&gt; having said that how we navigate this AI era I don't

think there is one fixed path yet we don't have an act in India yet we're a democracy and other democracy See also there's a lot of diversity in terms of language, economic prosperity, access to

information. So we have to be conscious of all these things when we take decisions and I hope I invite all of you in the

audience that I represent uh the state of Andhra Pradesh and we are also part of the NDA. If any of you have any ideas because we are in some sense just your representatives right so you come and

speak to us we engage with you and I think through that dialogue India is going to move forward so we are not experts on anything we we rely on you thank you for making uh time to come to

this panel and I'm saying what is our intent our intent is uh to create a balanced most equitable society in India where those who have the best ideas are given the access to pursue those ideas

whether it be access to data access to resources access to good rules because often rules and the system is designed in such a way that it doesn't help the small guys

they normally always help the big guys the big guys will remain big because of that there's a lot of force on as many of which uh lot of which you can't come out

and say but uh the few good people are standing between anarchy and based on this I'll pause &gt;&gt; thank you sir I think what your opening

remarks have also underlined and resonated clearly with the audience is the is the need for inclusiveness and something that Dr. Barra also underscored in his comments and with

this I come to you Mr. Marcus uh you know we've been talking a lot about inclusiveness as a principle given your work in the space I'd love to understand from you how do we really translate this

principle inclus inclusiveness into something actionable when we are thinking about it from a regulator from a governance standpoint how do we translate that in reality on the ground

your thoughts on that &gt;&gt; yeah uh first of all thank you so much for having I'm really honored um to to come all the way here from Munich um to join you in

this conversation. Um it's funny that you asked me this question to be honest um because um at least my personal opinion and perspective is always that I look to um to India to other South

countries in order to um to understand better um how to build inclusivity and uh into into technology. Um I think these are conversations that we usually um yeah maybe have in Germany you know

second order or third order and I always have the feeling that you know these questions um are much more prevalent uh whenever I come to India or visit African countries and so forth um how to

build it um uh in included into um into the regulatory scheme. So what we do a lot and the team um my wonderful colleagues at the at the tomb think tank we work a lot on um regulatory learning

and a little bit echoing what you know has been said here before um on the panel is like the it starts with a very we don't know if we're honestly true where you know the field is moving at

the direct at the moment. So we need to uh have a more humble approach in that sense you know and think about okay how what kind of mechanisms can we put in place in order to learn

um uh while doing stuff and if we think about the inclusion principle I think we can go through you know um uh the policy cycle think about like you know I think first upstream really early in the

process that we you know gather weak signals about you know the technology, what problems are there? Uh include um the stakeholders that are relevant early on. Um create something like, you know,

um peer-to-peer learning mechanisms um to exchange ideas um and then we can translate that through um through um in the in the midterm uh and uh midway through the policy cycle. I think we

have already a really good established toolkit that we can use whether it's policy pilots whether it's su whether it's other tools which allow us to experiment and not only as a regulatory

mechanism but really as a participatory tool in order to involve like the people that are um affected by a certain technologies right and then you know last point downstream it's all about the

policy feedback loops right So what do we then actually do when we implement the policy and how you know can we keep up with then the stakeholders that are using the technology and so forth. So

what I want to stress is like you know I think there's no uh one tool that fits everything but it's really like more of a mental model that we need to apply here instead of like how can we learn in

this fast-paced world. &gt;&gt; Thanks Dr. Marcus. uh you know it it does make sense that a lot of this is for us is also to learn eventually of how things translate into action which

brings me to Ivana here you know given Vipro's uh you know leadership in AI governance would love to understand from you Ivana how you envy to translate some of these you know global AI principles

that we keep hearing about how can India truly translate it into action when we talk about its governance here &gt;&gt; thank you so much and it's great to be here not only because I work an Indian

company had enough governance and translating a lot of this into into practice but also because I live in Germany so I couldn't be more at home um and I um yes I mean it's a very good

question I think um the key here of course Germany the European Union and India they have there's a different approach a different approach to regulation European a risk based

approach exam legislation before a product hits the market let's look at the risks Indian approach very interesting a techno legal approach saying okay before putting in law first

we evaluate the laws out there yeah for example privacy legislation they are just being operationalized with the rules very important because AI does not exist in isolation the privacy

legislations consumer legislation all applies to AI. So I the approach I've seen so far in India is to say before we enact new legislation, we look at existing ones and see how it squares

with the potential new harms coming from artificial intelligence and we look at use cases and we look at embedding u at embedding the controls uh into the design of the systems. Now that is the

solution to me. The reason why I'm saying this is because we need to operationalize uh governance not just as a compliance overhead. We

have to stop seeing governance of artificial intelligence as compliance. We have to see governance of artificial intelligence as the way forward for us for businesses as well as governments

and states to put in the market products that are resilient safe and they bring longterm value. If I put in a in in the market or if I work with a client and I have a product that is biased, if I have

a product that is not safe, I'm not creating innovation that I can get behind because it's not going to bring me long-term value. So, it's really important that we don't look at

governance as a compliance tickbox exercise. We look at governance as the way to create longterm value innovation, growth, productivity and all of this. This is where I think

the theme of this summit is important. When you talk about democratizing AI, which is the core of the summit, democratizing AI doesn't simply mean that you give everybody tools. It means

that you are inclusive in the way that these tools are designed in the first place because this is the core of inclusion. We can't have tools that are designed by a small minority. We can't

have tools in one part of the world. We cannot have tools that do not represent the diversity, the complexity, the ethical values that bring communities together. This is very very important.

So I close by saying design is crucial. How we design the schools, what are the controls that we put in place, the way that we don't see governance just as risk management, but we see it as

embedding values, embedding very strong design choices into products. &gt;&gt; Thanks. Thanks. Thanks for sort of underscoring some of the dos that really need to go in when

we talk about AI governance at large. And with this, Mr. Nan and I come to you. We've been talking a lot about what needs to be done, but I want you to sort of comment on what should policy makers

avoid today so as to avoid any kind of reactive policy making which then leads us to sort of ponder upon later. So your thoughts on that what needs to not be done as of now.

So first and foremost I must I must say that uh it's a great compliment to a speaker to have so many people in such a small room but I think um that would encourage us

to and probably bring out the best out of us. Um, we've had the world has had roughly about 148 bills on AI from 32 countries

in the last few years the approaches have been either that the law of the country is good enough and doesn't need a change and that's broadly what we've been saying in India that our

laws are quite sufficient or in some countries they've followed the European risk model and in some countries the like in US the no fakes act and the no AI fraud act has

followed a right to publicity model those are the three very broad kinds of legislation that they've India you must remember legislation takes a lot of time.

So just to give you an idea. So in the last 10 years or so there have been roughly about 20 to 30 bills or which became acts in one year in India as opposed to the figure goes in

European parliament something like 300 400 They pass bills or pass laws on the smallest of thing including the bubble size of champagne.

So you can imagine how much of legislation takes place. Therefore what do we do in India to achie attain speed? Our courts are proactive.

The courts come up with solutions. To give you an idea, domain name cases on the internet, meta tagging, hyperlinking, framing, fishing, all of these. There was no law in India.

But the courts found solutions including right of privacy, right of publicity, privacy. We had Davi's case much before we got the BPD act.

We had cases on well-known trademarks much before the 1999 act introduced that concept legisatively and we had the uh domain name the Anton pillar order uh introduced I mean in the

1980s we had antron pillar orders to seize evidence much before it was introduced in the trademark legislation in 1999 so the model that we've been following

is a problem arises. One, two, the courts try to solve that problem. Three, when the courts have done that for about 10 years, then some kind of a legislative solution comes. The question

is that give us speed, but it doesn't give us certainty. &gt;&gt; Why? because one from another &gt;&gt; or even decision

&gt;&gt; we think he has. So how do we attain certainty? One way of course is to have more objectivity in our roles to make them as objective.

That's one way. &gt;&gt; And the other way I think is that we try to legislate not by primary legislation but by rule making by principles by

guidelines which is what India has been doing. All the guidelines principles of AI have have come first as non enforcable and in due course of time they will

become rules and become law. So that policy in due course of time becomes. So today for example intermediary liability under section 79 of the IT act when it was originally enacted I think 2001

&gt;&gt; there was nothing to do with AI &gt;&gt; but AI principle AI cases came to court we had a whole lot of personality cases with an Rita Bachan Ashwar etc. They were all protected without a law

&gt;&gt; on simply on for common law principles. &gt;&gt; Then came the amendment in 2022. An amendment has come which recognizes in the IT rules of 2021 which have now been amended in effect from 26 to

recognize synthetic material. So problems of deep fakes, problems of bias, all that dark patterns. And now there's a guideline which is an enforcable guideline but we had dark

pattern cases before that. So the law the court's solution has now been implemented as soft law which is the guidelines and rule making secondary legislation and slowly will become hard.

That's the path that we will thanks for sort of you know breaking that down Mr. and I also welcome Mr. Singi who's sort of now in the room. Thank you so much sir for joining us.

We'll be hearing him shortly after the panel closes as the closing address remark. Thank you sir for making the time for this. Uh coming back to you Dr. Padra. We've been speaking a lot on

what's happening in Germany. What what I think he you know Mr. was also highlighted on you know how laws have already existed and they've been sort of catering to the evolution of AI as we've

seen it but when we talk about it from a social political context right and given the diversity that exists in a country like ours what adaptations do you think we need to keep in mind to ensure that

nobody misses out in in this whole race of AI as we speak and know of I believe uh it's the last three letters of your panel today. rule of law. If rule of law as a basic driving

principle is used, only then we'll be able to ensure that in the socopolitical landscape of India given its diversity. I'll give you a very small example. If let's say an AI tool is developed

that can probably identify beneficiaries all of you in some way or the other versus your voting pattern. All right. Now, many of you I believe most of you are not farmers here. But

now take that example into the farmland and say that a farmer is a beneficiary of a specific program of the government and gets 10,000 Indian rupees every quarter. And then if you link all the

beneficiaries together, all the benefits that we get to a AI platform that is able to then decifer to a certain extent a voting pattern of their respective districts, punch booths or WS. So what

you then know is who's getting the benefit and who's voting for whom approximately. That's dangerous. Let's say for example youngsters are here from various universities. If let's

say a AI platform is able to crawl through your social media and understand your mindset as far as your postings are concerned and then is able to derive probably tomorrow when you apply for a

government job then that's changes. So citizenry versus the governance versus the law versus the benefits all have to align together on a rule of law where irrespective of your preferences

and choices as an individual. Article 90 famously quoted as right of expression. Let's say you express something. It is not dangerous. There's no case against you. But somewhere down

the line when you've probably done 10 years 15 years of some work and suddenly that becomes a determinant through an AI platform which is yet to appear before us

and stares you in your face. Like for example the US government has already said if you're applying for a US visa any one of you you have to unlock your privacy settings and allow that

your social media be read. &gt;&gt; That is dangerous. So for India for our diversity when even today 60% of people vote against the government of the day

&gt;&gt; the government that is in power gets 43% vote share which roughly means about 60% are voting against it. &gt;&gt; So AI tools when they come in have to ensure that if the algorithm in some way

starts reading into these patterns then the rule of law goes for a toss. Therefore from the perspective of citizenry 1.4 4 million people whether he's a farmer he's a fisherman he is a

mana worker who gets a 300 rupees per day or a student in JNU or Delhi University whatever you do or you don't do should not be held against you as long as it is in the contours of you

then you have a very safe responsible and inclusive fear that is why I said the last three letters of this panel is going to be the driving force because that is part of the unwritten code of

Indian constitution rule of law which we borrow from the British and that is why as long as we are able to sustain the rule of law and that is why I said honorable prime

minister has also been saying we are moving from an ethical AI responsible AI to an inclusive AI culture unless there is inclusivity a person in India also earns 30 rupees a day and a person in

India also earns 30 crores a day from the Adanis and Amanis of India to a man who earns probably 100 rupees a day. All of them are equal in the eyes of Indian law. That is the power of the Indian

constitution and that is why the rule of law and the basic tenets of our principles of our republic have to be seen through the AI. And if there is any change or any diversion of that that

will destroy the very fabric of what we stand. It's not directed at any government. It's for generations to come because Gen AI 3 years back was doing something differently that is doing

today. and exponential is going to do something very different in the next 5 years that we don't even know of and that is why it's very important that the rule of law and inclusivity are the key

binders which will be able to circumvent socioultural landscape of India. &gt;&gt; Thank you for that articulation Dr. Patra I think you very rightly highlighted the need for rule of law and

also for democratic resilience as we know it and that brings me to you uh sir uh you know we've been talking a lot about you know what we can do and how how to navigate that space and you know

what we can learn from the social political context of a country like ours but from you I'd like you to sort of elaborate a bit on you know how to also avoid any kind of power concentrations

as we know it right we know that there are you know a lot of companies that are booming There are a lot of there's a big startup ecosystem in the country right now that that India is sort of proud to

host. Would love to understand what should we do as you know as you being a policy maker to ensure that the power does not concentrate in the hands of the few and sort of gets distributed for

all. &gt;&gt; It's too late for that. I think uh power has been concentrated in our society for a very long time far before I was born.

Uh &gt;&gt; we're joined by &gt;&gt; Dr. Christina. She's the minister for digitalization and innovation at the Hen Ministry of Digitalization and uh

Innovation at Germany. Thank you so much ma'am for finally making it and we know that you've had a tiring flight but thank you for making it to the panel. &gt;&gt; Yes, they are very

important. How many of you watch science fiction science fiction dystopian movies? Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, right? There's this crappy band of

people that come together against a big bad evil force and by uh pure luck uh and some talent, we're able to save the world. &gt;&gt; And then we feel the movie is over, but

then there's a scene. and the evil comes back. So in that sense, we have to be recognize that we're very transient and we're going to die and no matter how hard we work, how

much peace we bring, conflict will come come back. So I derive joy not in the destination but in the journey. uh the joys in playing a game and uh it is to and also there's it's exciting to do

something that many others are not doing. So power is concentrated so we can't avoid that. What we are trying to do is ensure that it doesn't become further concentrated

and we're we're trying to uh democratize access to more people so that more people can ensure that there's going to be a better future at least as long as I'm alive after that. Oh.

&gt;&gt; So in in this uh if you see when calculators came and when the phone came earlier I used to remember two 300 numbers. Now I remember maybe 10 numbers 15 numbers. I used to do complex

multiplications and mathematical calculations in my mind. Now I don't do anything. I rely on the calculator. So with AI my worry is that people will export their thinking also to um some

engine and they lose their own ability to think originally and then we lose control we become a slave to somebody else's agenda. So my desire as a policy maker, as a leader, as an educator, I

also lead a university is to uh protect, develop original thinkers in whatever number and start from a very young age because our large public schools, government schools, CBSC schools, many

of them don't develop or create original thinkers. And uh we are in a world where it seems to be that more than rules power power is determining how things

go. So at least in India we want to be an alternate uh symbol of hope for the world where we say that in India we will work towards following the rule of law providing

access to original thinkers will invite any of if you're different countries and you feel your country is not providing that platform please come to us. We're not perfect. We have a lot of problems.

Uh but intent is there to do good. The other thing, the other premise is that I feel or at least I hope that AI is not going to take over like the movie Iroot and want wants to kill us all. I want to

believe that at least a very small subset of human beings will still be uh the decision makers of the future course of our society. So those few decision makers should have good intent. So my

role is to ensure that those people are protected, those people are empowered, those people are heard and those few people come together to shape how the country moves forward and through India

we set a model for the rest of the world on how we should do things and like-minded nations should come together in these times because we can't do things together. Sorry, we can't do

things alone. When we come together, I think we share best practices. like-minded nations I think will bring balance to the world. That's what I believe.

&gt;&gt; Thanks Dr. B. Thanks uh sir. Uh Dr. Christina we can now come to you. We've been waiting to hear from you a little bit on how you know you at H you know given your ministry how are you

translating some of these principles of AI governance as we know it into action and also are there any examples uh from your public sector initiatives that you can elaborate a little bit upon so that

we can also learn and see how India can also draw some values from that. So, but also I'd like to flag that we're also running short on time. So, just to be cognizant,

&gt;&gt; I tried to make it very brief. So, it's it's really um changing of world coming from the snow here to India. So because there was a delay of because that it was snowing and I think uh to

have this different uh worlds is the same as AI has implemented with a shed GPT in 2011 uh in 2019. the whole world is is going in another dynamic. And I think what is

our task from the policy side is on one hand to really try to make rules which have transparency on one hand but at the other hand to have trust to have trust in the rules and to have trust in the

policy makers and therefore there are two actions I would like to point out what I'm doing uh as ministry of digitalization and innovation

No three. The first is I trust the innovation of my country and the people who have innovation innovative ideas through AI and therefore we invest in the brains. We invest in the brains in

with a program and they get even the ones who make their PhD at the university and so on get money for showing that their AI products are functioning. So we trust them in their

good brains and ideas. That is one thing what we are doing. We are have now 107 startups. We have as a ministry tr um invest in 1770 startups. The second is we found in

Gmbbr together with a big um association. It's uh the association of engineering fa it's called and they f found with us in GMBA and what we want to do is to generate a clearly label for

qualitative AI. We have a AI quality and testing hub. we built this and then we want to produce these labels. I think that's that's important and the producing of the labels is along the AI

act and the third because I'm speaking about trust. I start three years ago a tour. I go with uh AI exponents through the marketplaces all over Germany and show the people what AI positive things

can do. For instance, for health care, for instance, for planning cities and in going to the marketplaces and speak with the people and say we want to help us to have a good future in innovative and AI

in this kind of dialogue, I think that's important. That's a kind of building trust. And I think building trust having transparency and have rules which we as policy maker are following and show the

people that they have a chance for the future. I think that are maybe the three pillars I want to give you as an idea. &gt;&gt; Thank you Dr. Christina that's very insightful. Uh you know given the posity

of time I'd like to come back to the three people that I could not come back to and give two minutes each to all of you Ivana Dr. Marcus and Mr. Anand to sort of share your concluding remarks

before we welcome Mr. Singhi for his closing address. So maybe Ivana we start from you and then move on to Dr. Marcus and Mr. Anand. &gt;&gt; Yeah absolutely. I think I think we have

got a unique challenge right now which is really about uh not just about AI capabilities because these will grow and they grow on a daily basis. not just AI capabilities but about the institutional

capability that we have as countries as companies to make sure that we can govern these changes and I think this is a wonderful challenge to have regardless of whether we have the European AI act

or whether we have technal approach that is the key thing the countries that will now make it are the countries who going to have this institutional capability to really take on this massive change and

govern it in the right direction and I think this is great. The last thing I wanted to say is I have the most wonderful job in the world because I more than the politicians because is the

job of working with product managers of AI systems and working with them and say hey how are we going to embed privacy security resilience legal safeguards into the products that we're making.

This is fantastic and what I would like to see in India as in Germany where I live by the way I would like to see participation on how what are the best practices to make this happen. What are

the privacy enhancing technologies that we can take? What does it mean to design the trust stack into for example aentic AI? having that really concrete good practice on how we can code and design

legal safeguards into the the tools that we put out there. &gt;&gt; Thanks Avana. Dr. Marcus also reminding about the time again. &gt;&gt; I I tried to be brief. Um yeah, maybe

two thoughts that resonate um that have been posed here at the panel. Um so I think one thing is about you know policym needing to be concise. um what you also alluded to I mean what we're

currently experiencing in Germany and in Europe probably is like a struggle between Xant and expose regulation and you know we can't decide whether we go this way or that way and um where we put

our resources in you know where do we build this institutional capacity and I think we just need to make one choice either or in order to build that capacity in order then follow through um

because what we experience at the moment is kind of that we don't have a capacity to enforce either for and so it's the worst of of both worlds. Um secondly power I think is a crucial point and I

would strongly u resonate what you meant. I think many of the many of the developments are already like you know pass and you know are embedded into our society. So however we need to look

carefully and you know what processes can we change. So maybe we can't do nothing about like who belong you know who owns the data who has data centers who owns the large L&amp;Ms we can't change

that by tomorrow but we can't change we can change something about like how we involve people right and kind like who we assign power to in the process of like giving them a voice this is

something that we that we can't change um uh and we need to be a little bit more you know maybe proactive in mapping the field of dependencies and and power struggles in this field.

&gt;&gt; Thanks Dr. Marcus. Mr. Anand, &gt;&gt; so there are we all see that there are two sides to the AI coin. There's a opportunity side and there's a risk side. And as a result of the risks, what

is happening is that there have been violations. Violations, breach of personality rights, IP violations when copyright cases have come up, defam defamation, breach of

privacy, and a whole lot of other wrongs. Roughly about a th00and to 3,000 cases have gone to courts in about 35 countries of the world. And one thing is coming out quite

clearly and that is that in all these cases you need to prove electronic documents. You have to show that a particular page for example

is is an accurate page. So you have to prove that and we've got the laws for that. We've got section 634 of the BSA which is the new evidence act by which we can prove all electronic

documents. However, attribution, how do you show that that document has originated from the person who you think is the wrongdoer or who you allege to be

the wrongdoer? So the whole lot of attribution rules are used and we follow a mosaic theory which means it's not one evidence, it's a host of evidences put together. There may be in whose name is

the phone registered? In whose account is the is the website registered? It may be things of that kind. Money trails to follow. Um time logs and and a host of other pieces of evidence together help

you prove that a particular electronic record has originated from a particular person. But what happens when you file these cases? defendants fail to appear. The result, you can stop the wrong, but

you can't get money. You can't put them behind bars. Now, that's a big drawback globally. It's not an India phenomena. It's the same problem in Germany, same problem in

most other countries. So, we end up presuming the courts have to draw presumptions. So presumptions come from for example section 114 of the evidence

Indian evidence act that if the defendant doesn't appear then whatever the plaintiff has said is produ presumed to be correct so presumptions are resorted to but discovery law although

it exists in our our act interrogatories inspection antonpillar orders all those mechanisms exist but discovery laws have yet to develop in India in you'll see find in the

The cases involve truckloads of discovery and there used to be this concept of document dump. You ask somebody to discover the emails, he sends you a truck of emails. How do you

go through it? Now with AI, you can go through it. You can find out that one email which is the clincher. And so discovery laws in India although they exist on paper, they need to be

developed. then reversal of burden of proof because in a lot of these cases you have to presume that the wrong it's a strict liability test which has to be imposed particularly what in European EU

uh AI actu has a uh unacceptable risk standard for that all the wrongs there's a total ban and so if somebody's been caught with that kind of a wrong he is presumed to be wrong which is as a

strict liability irrespective of men's ria or intention you have to assume. So that's how we need to develop two areas. One is reversal of burden of proof as we have

in section 104A of the patents act and dis better development of discovery laws. &gt;&gt; Thanks. Thank you. Thank you Mr. An. And thank you all to my all my panelists for

your insights. uh you know given the posity of time I know I've been running uh but I now welcome Mr. Singi for his closing address. Thank you so much sir for making the time. Mr. Singi is the

additional secretary at the Ministry of External Affairs and it's our honor to have him give the closing address for this uh

good afternoon everyone. Uh at the outset uh let me thank uh the organizers, the dialogue and the partner institutions uh for convening this timely and

important conversation in this India AI impact summit and it is an honor for me to join uh legislators, ministers, members of parliament, scholars, industry leaders and colleagues from

different parts of the world for this policymaker dialogue on AI polic policy evolutions and the rule of law. Uh friends, we are meeting at a moment when artificial intelligence as you all

know is no longer a distant technological horizon. It is already shaping economies, governance systems and the daily lives of our citizens. The real question before us therefore is not

whether AI will transform society. That transformation is already underway. But whether we can ensure that this transformation remains democratic, accountable and firmly anchored in the

rule of law. And you have heard the learned speakers talk about this that how we can ensure that. And this question become even more relevant when we speak of democratizing

AI resources which is I think also some speakers alluded to and when we use the word democratization I think it is worth pausing to reflect on what we truly mean. Democratization

is not merely about access to computational power or advanced models. It is also about access to quality data sets, institutional safeguards, transparent governance systems and legal

records when things go wrong. In essence, to my understanding, it means ensuring that AI does not concentrate power in the hands of few, whether governments, corporations or

algorithmic elites, but in a street, but instead expands opportunity, fairness and participation. And when we view this in this light, the democratization of AI becomes

inseparable from the democratization of governance itself. Friends, history tells us that every major technological shifts reshapes the relationship between the state, citizen

and the market. We have seen in the history. The printing press widened access to knowledge. Electricity as you all know powered industrial transformation and industrial

revolution. The internet rewired communication and commerce. AI however is different and it's different in one profound respect that it can influence decisions shape behaviors and determine

outcomes at scale that is why precisely governance in the AI age cannot remain reactive it must be anticipatory principled and inclusive and this brings me to the core of

today's discussion that is operationalizing the rule of law in the age of AI How do we do it? What does that mean in practice? And to my mind at its hearts, the rule of law rest on

three core concepts. Accountability, transparency and fairness. We have heard learned speakers speak about all these in different uh flavor. And when we look at it in the context of

AI, to my understanding, accountability requires that decisions made or assisted by algorithms remain explainable and contestable.

Transparency demands clarity in data usage, model design and decision pathways and fairness requires that AI system do not replicate or amplify historical biases embedded in the

society. These principles may sound abstract but they must be translated into the legislative frameworks, regulatory institutions and also judicial oversight

mechanism that citizen can trust. Now if you look at India's approach to AI governance, you will find that it has evolved from its development priorities and democratic ethos. Our objective is

not merely to regulate risk but also to harness AI for inclusive growth, improved public service delivery and social empowerment and we are doing that. You all know about the digital

public infrastructure through this DPI from Aadhaar to UPI to DG locker. You are all aware that we have democratized how technology can scale inclusion at population scale.

Inclusion has been talked about here to a great in a great detail and that is very important and as AI becomes integrated into these ecosystems our guiding principles I

think must remain trust safety and accessibility and that is very important. The India AI mission as you all know for instance seek to expand compute access support indigenous

innovations and promote responsible AI development while ensuring that benefits reach citizens across geographies and socioeconomic backgrounds. At the same time we must also recognize

that AI governance can governance cannot be confined within national boundaries and that is again very important. Algorithms do not respect boundaries. They travel

across jurisdictions. Data flows data flows across continents and digital services transcend geography. Global cooperation therefore becomes essential and different regulatory

approaches offers different frameworks. You have heard about how Europe's riskbased regulatory approach offer valuable insight into safeguarding rights and managing systematic risk. But

on the other hand, India's development centric model emphasize scalability, affordability and societal benefits. But rather than viewing these approaches as competing paradigms

to my mind, I think we should see them as complimentary and I think their convergence can build an AI ecosystem that is both safe and socially transformative.

Now this raises a very important question. Can we evolve shared global principles while respecting diverse social socopolitical context? And to my mind I think yes we can.

Such a framework to my understanding would rest on common values such as human dignity, democratic accountability, technological openness and equitable access.

It would encourage interoperability of standards while allowing policy flexibility to reflect local realities. It would promote innovations while safeguarding rights. And above all, it

would recognize that trust is the currency of the digital age. And this and in this journey the role of legislatures, courts, regulatory institutions is

central. Lawmakers must craft forward-looking policies that are technologically informed yet constitutionally grounded. Courts must interpret emerging disputes

with sensitivity to both innovations and right protection. And that is very very important as we go forward in development of AI for the larger public good.

Regulators at the same time must remain agile capable of responding to rapid technological evolutions without stifling progress and governance must also be participatory incorporating

voices from academia, civil society, industry and citizens themselves. And when governance become participatory, I think legitimacy naturally flows and follows.

Now allow me to pause and pose a simple but fundamental question here that is who benefits from AI and if the answer is limited to those with access to data capital and compute power I think we

risk deepening inequality and that is something very important. Honorable member of parliament also spoke about that but if we but if the AI improves healthcare access in rural areas enhance

learning outcomes in un un underserved communities, optimizes agriculture for a small farmers and delivers public services with transparency and efficiency, then AI became and AI can

become a force multiplier for equity. And I would say the direction we choose will depend on the governance framework we build today. And in this context, I think India's digital journey offers

useful lessons in building at scale while preserving democratic accountability. Open standards, interoperable platforms and public private collaborations have

created ecosystems that fosters innovation while promoting citizen rights. And as AI become embedded with these systems, our focus remains on building trust

through safeguards, grievance, redressal mechanism and responsible data governance practices. Another important aspect which I need I want to highlight and has become very

important is that geopolitical competition increasingly intersect with technological advancement and you all know that AI governance is also emerging as an

important dimension of strategic diplomacy nowadays and it is therefore important that we cooperate and collaborate. Cooperation in AI standards, ethical frameworks and

research partnerships can build bridges of trust among nations. Conversely, conver on the other hand, fragmented regulatory regimes risk creating digital silos and widening

technological divides. And in this context, I think dialogues such as this, bringing together policy makers from across the region are therefore vital in shaping a cooperative digital future.

And what despite all this however I think the regulations alone will not ensure responsible AI. Capacity building is also equally critical. Policy makers need technological literacy. Regulator

needs analytical tools. Judges need technical understanding. citizen needs digital awareness. Democratizing AI resources therefore also means democratizing knowledge and

institutional capacity. And without this even the most well-designed legal frameworks with struggle and implementation. So as we navigate this transition to my

mind three guiding ideas may help us stay on course. First governance governance must remain humanentric. ensuring that technology serves people. Second, it must be inclusive reflecting

the diversity of the societies. Honorable member of parliament has alluded to a great respect on this. And third, I think it must be adaptive evolving alongside technological changes

rather than lagging behind. And friends, the rule of law is not an obstacle to innovation as often people think that rule of law is something which is going to stifle innovation and

so on. But to my mind, it is the foundation. Trust enables adoptation. Predictability encourage investment. Accounted accountability sustains legitimacy.

And when citizen trust that AI systems are fair, transparent and contextable, they are far more willing to embrace technological transformation. Now, let me conclude with a thought.

The future of AI governance will not be determined only in laboratories or boardrooms. It will be shaped in legislatures, courtrooms, and democratic forums such as this one.

And the choices which we make today will determine whether AI becomes an instrument of concentration or a catalyst for empowerment. And if we align innovation with democratic values,

we will not only regulate technology, we will shape a future where technological progress and human dignity advances together. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much, sir. I invite Kazim

to hand over the momentos to the speakers. So speakers, can you please take your places in front of the DAS? We don't have time. Thanks a lot.

Mom, I'm Sarah Gulani, a senior director and head of technology from FIKI and like I mentioned we are very very happy to present this session under the ages of

AI impact summit with done with our partners from the India Singapore business forum. We have an esteemed set of panel who's going to talk about on the various aspects. Uh while the dasin

being settled, I'll just give your thoughts on what is India Singapore business forum. So it's a very high powered platform which has been created. There is something called India

Singapore ministerial discussions which happened a forum and on the sidelines there is a business forum. The business forum looks into the various aspects which is important uh for the I would

say the bilateral as well as not limiting ourselves to the discussions only to Singapore as a joint partner of India Singapore what else can be done globally what are the subjects which the

panel presents today is harnessing AI for fraud prevention and financial inclusion today the session with the panelist which we have is Mr. Sures Si managing director and CEO of protein ego

technologies Mr. Mr. Sarab Mittal Country head strategy transformation analytics and research DBS India Mr. Bhuvan Noda chief executive officer AI division Mahindra and Mahindra Mr. Sujay

Gosh managing director TMS Mr. Manish Shagarwal President and business at COTCH 811 COC Mahindra Bank so this is the panel and the session is going to be moderated by Mr. Niraj Agarwal, managing

director and senior partner Singapore BCG. Before I hand it over to you Niraj, can I request Sur to kindly deliver the welcome remarks and share a brief thoughts on the ISBR and how we are

looking it forward and the participation of the room. Over to you Sur. &gt;&gt; Okay. Uh I think there is a need from the organizers side to have a photograph for the speakers. Can I request you for

a group photograph first? &gt;&gt; Yeah, please. Thank you. &gt;&gt; And ma'am, we will be handing it over to you five minutes late. Thank you.

Mr. City, move it up. Okay friends, good afternoon. Am I audible? &gt;&gt; So distinguished

uh audience uh fellow ecosystem builders, ladies, gentlemen, uh it's a privilege to be here today at the India AI summit. As Sarika

mentioned, we are very happy to be here to talk to you at this important dialogue under the ages of the Indo Singapore business round table. The ISBR was created as a formal

institutional mechanism to deepen economic and strategic collaboration between India and Singapore. It brings together policy makers, regulators and very importantly the

industry from both countries to identify concrete actionable initiatives across priority sectors. We are going across a stream of sectors including digital infrastructure, financial services,

trade, sustainability and now increasingly artificial intelligence. ISBR is definitely not just a talk forum. Its core purpose is to translate bilateral instent into execution-led

outcomes supported by policy alignment, regulatory coordination and industry-led innovation. Over time, ISBR has evolved into a trusted platform where both the

governments and industry can jointly addressed shared challenges especially that cannot be solved by any single institution or country acting alone. The focus on digital and AI

infrastructure uh which frames part of today's discussion reflects a clear recognition that digital trust is now foundational to economic growth, financial stability

and inclusion. Uh this brings me to the theme of this session. Uh today we are going to be talking about harnessing AI for fraud prevention and financial inclusion in

BFSI. As we are all aware, India's digital financial ecosystem today operates at a scale I see have enabled millions of citizens.

Volumes run into billions on a monthly basis. Onboarding happens in seconds, not days. While this scale is a source of enormous strength at At the same time, we must ensure that

stronger controls do not come at the cost of exclusion or friction, especially for firsttime users and MSMES. This is where AI must be reframed not as

a tool but as an infrastructure. While we speak of AI in BFSI, the real shift is from after the-act detection to in-flight intelligence. AI enables continuous risk assessment across

onboarding transactions and networks. It allows institutions to detect subtle behavioral anomalies, identify muled networks and surface systemic risk that no human or static rule engine can

identify in real time. If designed correctly, AI can reduce f false positives, lower friction and improve customer experience. This is also where Indo Singapore

partnership becomes very powerful. While India brings to the table population scale digital rails, diverse real world data sets and deep technology talent pool, Singapore brings regulatory

oversight, very strong governance frameworks and proven capability in operationalizing advanced technology responsibly. In particular,

uh to show up here and I know it's not the most comfortable standing like this. Uh sorry can't do much about it but we'll hopefully try to make the conversation interesting. Second, I do

want to uh s introduce one more thing. I couldn't be more pleased to have such high quality organizations whether it is teasc and have the highest regard. So I I'm

deeply pleased. I think uh Sur spoke very eloquently about this partnership between India and Singapore and I think the one other thing which I also want to uh further emphasize is there's a lot

which both sides bring to the table represented here as well. Uh I personally worked in the early years of when Aadhaar got rolled out and the foundation of the digital public

infrastructure in India was created. Um you know the amount of progress we've made in the last decade has been remarkable at the next decade from here on there

are many opportunities but there are also many questions and that's the kind of thing we'll debate can we take it to the next level can trust be the foundation uh in this in this context is

is very very critical so I think that's what we're going to talk about so the basic digital onboarding has happened you know almost all of us have seen that happen whether it is on payments credit

all of that But trust is a place where AI can play a very important role in establishing the infrastructure by giving it real-time risk intelligence uh fraud prevention. It could also create

more of those. So I think that's and there's a whole host of questions about can it go from pilots to scaling can it be truly explainable? Can it create privacy auditability? All of those. So

there is those are the lenses we'll examine and I'm going to go around and ask questions to each of the participants. So I'm going to start first with Suresh. uh with you itself.

So while you get your water. Uh so as you said our digital financial rails are now at population scale right everywhere I travel people are hugely impressed by what India has accomplished on those. So

with rising velocity but also increasingly sophisticated fraud right and uh the legacy based rules are no longer going to be sufficient in this context. Do you think AI can provide a

core trust infrastructure? Uh as part of this uh you know would be good to hear your views. &gt;&gt; You want to press this button slide it to the right.

&gt;&gt; Yes. Am I audible? No. Thanks N. Thanks for the question. uh know as I said earlier I think first of all it's the scale that we are talking about today as we are all aware

and we very proudly know we track it month uh UPI last did 20 billion plus transactions in a month right and interestingly has also doubled in the last two to three years and we are

actually talking about projected losses exceeding a lakh crores if if things are not caught. So rule-based mechanisms while they are important at a to set a threshold but they are 01 signals which

work at a transactional level. So you can either block transactions above a certain value, you can uh block you know your daily limits which we all do on our applications. Uh they are just not good

enough to work at scale in the way the transaction velocity is going. So I think three key things which come through it. One is the speed and reactiveness. Now clearly when we are

talking about transaction happening at this scale uh it's very difficult because fraud happens in milliseconds and you would always be caught postf facto in trying to prevent it. One

simple example uh if you are having a few cars on the road it's very easy to have fixed traffic signals right and and the red light and green light just signify move or don't move. uh but when

you're talking about millions of cars on the road uh which are creating congestion accidents you need a very smart adaptive system which can dynamically change the rules of the game

and change the signals and the traffic control and the directioning and I think interestingly today's experience in entering this place uh would have been far superior if AI would have

dynamically managed which queue to take and to come in over here. So I think speed and reactiveness is one. Uh the second part clearly isworked uh intelligence is very critical because

today when we are talking about all of us from the financial services industry we are very familiar with the term called mule accounts. Now what is that? Effectively the money is moved from the

victim's account into one or more accounts in milliseconds and then just branches out into multiple accounts including crossber accounts. So one single institution which is managing it

will see maybe a genuinely created account into which the money is moving. But unfortunately while it could be coerced or fraudulent uh you're not

is rules are today giving you just limits. It's 01. uh so you have challenges around false detection and false positives and you are excluding people by just saying if a

transaction is above a certain value stop it and in this case they are real live transactions and people's livelihood depends on it so AI really plays a role

we spoke about it uh whether it is intelligence which means you are now looking at behaviors across multiple accounts across multiple institutions s and you are seeing anomalies in those

behavior and you're able to catch it at source. And clearly the third one being of course what you said data is not available it's all over the place there's no single source of truth every

plant every manufacturer every branch has its own data source uh so bringing it all together and making sense out of it of course is tedious and is required for any AI systems to work at scale. Uh

and pilots are designed to be successful. Everybody wants the PC's and pilots to be successful. Uh and hence they are successful. Nobody wants scale up and hence it has to come from top

down and we have to start from making the data readiness. But couple of other things also come in the way. I think scale up is less of a tech problem and more of a mindset shift.

We often have very low tolerance for AI systems when they start making decisions. When humans make decisions, it's fine for them to make errors. But when AI make a makes a decision, we of

course as human beings, we start judging the AI and often call it, you know, this is not working. This is not something that can work at scale. We can't rely on this.

I think we need to move on from using AI as a rule-based system like Suresh was saying in into a paradigm where AI is learning on a daily basis from the data and from the patterns and also realize

that it is going to get better today. What it is doing is if if even if it is as good as human not better of course it is much better in many areas but it is creating capacity before it is creating

new capabilities. So what you were able to do in two hours, we can now do the same thing at the least in two minutes. And imagine approving a loan with all the fraud checks done in place uh from

an application to cash happening in 2 minutes straight through is something that India needs at scale and I think AI is going to play a big role in making that happen. So thinking of AI as first

catalyzing capacity and then adding new capabilities I think is one way to get to scale quickly and as the capabilities increase I think we will see much more uh use cases come to life uh in real

life. &gt;&gt; Some excellent points about catalyzing capacity first and mindset. Yeah. Thanks Van. Manish I'm going to come to you. So Manish uh 811 for those who don't know

is like a bank within a bank and has been remarkably successful. uh and uh you do a lot of stuff uh you know onboarding decisions uh multiple kind of transaction decisions etc etc I'm sure

when you meet your friendly regulator uh they ask you can you be can you do explanability accountability and all those questions right I mean and rightfully so the regulators have to ask

that question if I was in the shoes I would ask the same question uh do you think uh this tool is helping you with that and not just regulators by just regulators even customers can ask this

question auditors can ask that question so Everybody can ask that question and uh please shed some light on this. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So uh as you everybody knows we are one of the largest acquiring engine

in India and two of the problem which does not let me sleep is AI and fraud. And when this session was happening that AI and fraud is happening I said I better attend this. Primarily if AI has

to be used in financial which is a highly regulated one it has to be explainable and governance mindset has to be very much into the people who are building it up. One acronym which I have

found it and which works is JCT. It has to be justifiable. Any decision which has been taken whether the credit has been denied a transaction has been stopped. How do we justify that? That is

J. C is contestability where anybody who has been affected by the decision he should have the wherewithal to go back and contest ask for what was the reason person and third is the traceability the

decision which happened which AI made it across can you go back and see what were the reason what were the biases which made that decision to happen now in this there are three stakeholders as you

rightly said one is customer for whom transparency and recourse are very critical The second is auditors for whom traceability and evidence they would

look at model lineage and versioning. They would look at any biases which exist into it. And the third and the most important stakeholder is the regulator who's looking for

evidences and accountability. They are looking for human in the loop. AI can continue to create decision make decisions but is there a human who's looking at the decision being done a

classical example is video KYC was launched in India in May 2020 we were the first one to go live but regulator was very clear that while the systems will do all of those checks face match

all elgo run there has to be somebody sitting behind who will go through the process to ensure that person who's getting onboarded is a real person so So I think if we follow this JCT

justifiable, contestable and traceable and take care of all three stakeholders which is customer, auditor and regulator, we probably would be in good shape.

&gt;&gt; Excellent. I love that framework JCT. So I'm going to ask you a follow-up question Manish on that. &gt;&gt; So using JCT &gt;&gt; uh do you think you can help customers

reduce friction for customers? Right. But uh and also uh the other error can be unintended exclusion right whether it is retail whether it is MSME

uh you know do you think that is possible to accomplish both lower friction uh and noted exclusion &gt;&gt; yeah so so uh if we start from onboarding right there could be tiered

onboarding can happen a low friction product where the risk are lower can get started very quickly and As the progression happens there could be friction like video KYC there has to be

a people if it is little higher kind of stuff there could be a physical PD which happens in terms of onboarding. Now as Sur also mentioning gone are the days when rule based things can protect us.

It has to be realtime decisioning which has the context to it. Just to give you an example one of the fintech in UK has launched something called as street mode. What it does is in an app I can

tell these are my safe places, my home, my office. But there are lot many times where mobile get picked up when you are walking on the street. Now if somebody picks up your mobile and the payment

being instant, money can move very quickly. So what has been done? If it is not my safe place, if money has to move, I need to do face authentication. Even if I put in an order saying that move

one lakh from this account to other it does not happen real time. It has a lag of whatsoever time you put in and after that time again the face authentication happen. Now if somebody has to take my

money he probably better kidnap me for an hour for the money to move using my app. So so uh n I think uh definitely AI is helping. We need to have guardrails have to ensure that we

use it in the right context. But I firmly believe AI has a huge future and it is helping financial institution as well. &gt;&gt; I love this street mode. Yeah. I mean

that's a great I had not heard of this. I I love it. So I'm going to come to you to build off this if that's okay. Um firstly would you resonate with the points Manish made and then is there any

let's start with that and I have a question on regulation to follow up and SJ I'm coming to you right after don't feel like unwanted &gt;&gt; I think I fully agree with what Manish

has said just couple of things one um is that every fast car needs a break for us to be having a sense of safety similarly any AI development will require guard rails to be in place so

that we know we are going in the right direction and that is something that we followed at least in our organization. We may use different acronyms. So uh we call it pure. So the questions we ask

ourselves is can we do it where the regulations allow us. The second is should we do it whether it meets the pure framework which is purposeful unsurprising to the customer respectful

explainable something similar to GCT I think the only thing I'll add to that is respectful because one of the things which data seems to have is a biases so if I'm using historical data and it

creates a bias which excludes a section of the society I think that is something that we need to take care while making make sure that we are building the right AI models and the last one which we have

is how do we do it is make sure that once the models are there we have the right kind of governance on it I think these are things if it were to take care I don't see any reason why AI should not

go even faster in our life &gt;&gt; and just you see regulation as an enabler or regulators are willing to play ball &gt;&gt; I regulate regulations are critical and

regulators are having the right kind of framework for getting the banks. So Singapore we have the FEAT framework in India RBI has come out with the concept paper around it and we have gone through

it. It sort of aligns with what we have in a place and it's critical. &gt;&gt; Okay SJ as I said &gt;&gt; sorry just one point I'd like to add is I think the important part which

regulators are facilitating is &gt;&gt; sharing of data between the organizations. And I think that will be the most crucial fact because as a bank I can

look at my own data but if I'm getting a larger information of frauds what's happening those kind of information will really help us make better decisions. Got it. Thanks S. Uh SJ uh from a I'm

going to ask you from a long-term capital as well as ecosystem perspective. Do you see uh a convergence uh or where do you see the strongest conversion between this AIdriven

infrastructure or trust infrastructure and uh financial markets maybe financial inclusion uh both in this part of the world as well as on crossber financial corridors.

&gt;&gt; Thanks N. um you know if you think about uh from a long-term capital standpoint it's very easy to say that look the convergence will happen in functional areas and and it's very important and

I'll talk a little bit about that &gt;&gt; sorry before that CJ works for TESC is one of the larger uh deployers of capital in this part of the world for sure not all parts of the world

&gt;&gt; so so I think uh you know there are functional areas where it's really important but also there is a larger strategic imperative that we shouldn't forget so uh let me uh touch on the

functional areas first. uh so if you think about the functional areas, one is the role of AI in capital allocation. Now capital allocation is the basic building block of inclusion the right

capital allocation because if you misallocate that's a systemic risk and that is really what we want to avoid as capital allocators. Uh and if you want to avoid that, you really need to embed

that trusted infrastructure in the financial pl plumbing. All the things that all of you said right uh data integrity, provenence, you know, model drifts, how do you fix model biases, uh

all those governance has to be embedded in the financial plumbing. uh I say this because you know if I try to simplify it it's really saying that if you have trusted data you have trusted models if

you have trusted models you have trusted capital allocation if you have trusted capital allocation then you have trusted inclusion and that's really the flywheel that hopefully we can iron out as we

progress in the future now the second functional area is what is the role of AI uh in the context of doing audits what I call the audit layer which is uh you know validation of disclosures uh as

in as as capital allocators we are always relying on disclosures and um and the traceability of them particularly in the context of climate and ESG where you're looking at multimodal data to uh

to validate whether something is accurate or not again the role of AI in the context of audit is very important so I would say capital allocation and um auditability and traceability are

functional areas where um you know long-term capital is particularly interested from a convergence standpoint but now I want to come back to the strategic imperative and this is very

important because um we don't think convergence sits in applications in fintech apps convergence sits in the infrastructure and that is extremely important because that's where the

network effects are are created the second thing where I think the strongest convergence comes is actually outside of banking. It actually happens in the supply chains

and and if you're able to embed finance in the supply chains, think about agriculture, renewables, you know, the labor markets, that is where the impact is highest and for us to get there, that

is where the trusted infrastructure has to converge all the points that you mentioned which is identity, productivity, credit and in the context of crosser crossborder uh

interoperability. Uh I'll just end that note with a with a with a line that I wrote when I was reflecting on this topic yesterday which is when financing is

embedded in production networks inclusion is a byproduct of economic growth and that is exactly what we are talking about. That's where you can be a

lot more inclusive and also drive growth and productivity as you think about capital and capital allocation. &gt;&gt; Excellent. Uh so I'm going to go to another round of questions but I think

this is there's been a lot of alignment of the thoughts that the possibilities with AI are enormous. Yes, there are things to work around. Uh so just to give you a heads up, I'm going to ask at

the end all of you one thing you feel excited about with AI and one thing you feel skeptical about with AI. Okay. Okay. So, but just a heads up but nevertheless, let me carry on. Suresh,

I'm going to come back to you on this India Singapore AI hub uh that you and I actually uh engaged a lot on. Uh what do you think are possibilities uh which can happen on data on compute on talent or

other places where there could be or information sharing or intelligence or uh just just share some of those perspectives please. So n I'll carry it forward from what

just mentioned uh building AI as a trust infrastructure. I think we spoke about it earlier that today uh when fraud is happening you know our defenses are fragmented but

fraud is connected uh we took the example of the mule accounts. So you are really talking crossber intelligence to be built into the AI infrastructure and one simple starting point is we are

talking about multiple institutions uh which are spread across different countries uh when you're looking at an AI uh Singapore hub when we were looking at the entire idea it was saying how can

the two countries come together and build a shared infrastructure which is powered by AI to be able to create this crossber impact act from an intelligence perspective and very very closely linked

to the theme we are talking about over here and underlying it what would be critical and uh when we talk about shared infrastructure in India we've had reasonable success in what we today call

as programmable registries uh we are building large data registries and uh that starts from whether we talk about agriculture as a as an ecosystem or we talk about education as an ecosystem

whether they are institution utional or whether they are at an individual level. Very simply one example I can take over here here is that between the two nations if we can build a mule account

registry any fraudsters you are able to look at it and you are able to identify in a crossber ecosystem uh you're talking about uh intelligent onboarding uh where each country is respecting and

having a common framework for identifying the right people who are operating within the ecosystem and are being able to connect to each other. And last but not the least, this co-sharing

of data can also mean that we can have a lot of uh predictability in the risk analytics because everything starts with data. Two countries sharing data. But coming to that I would again say you

know more learning also from our banker friends on the panel. Uh the data which is being shared has to be anonymized. So that that risk should be clearly mitigated to say this is not customer

data we are sharing but these are anonymized signals behavioral patterns which come together and doing anything at a crossber level will strengthen the digital you know sort of crossber rails.

uh it will help us to break any supply chains of risk and fraud that we see out there and it will help us to do preemptive onboarding of the right institutions and the right individuals

into the ecosystem for exchange and I think the biggest beneficiaries could be the MSMES and the and the citizens between the two countries as you create create more increased crossber

engagement uh between the two places &gt;&gt; well articulated sesh abhan Maybe I'll come to you back to my theme of pilots to scale. Is there a possibility of using this corridor also as an enabler

for moving from pilots to production models? &gt;&gt; Absolutely. And let me build upon what Suresh was talking about. We've been discussing setting up AI hub as a

platform. um data sharing with of course anonymity is going to be crucial for us to prevent large scale frauds and become organized when it comes to detecting and and

avoiding fraud. But just from the just from the perspective of sharing best practices of what works, what does not work in one country versus another uh sharing talent

uh is another area that we're going to look at as we set up the AI hub across the two countries. And then as we move on to sharing learnings, sharing data and then sharing perhaps building

platforms that can enable us to run some of these uh high-profile algorithms and AI systems at scale uh with data that's trusted as well as verified across multiple entities uh with crossber uh

signals as as well. So I think that's going to be a key uh stepping stone towards setting up the AI hub. The other thing coming from pilot to scale is uh again this very engineering mindset of

using the latest technology &gt;&gt; especially in um you know all the banks and financial services industries uh all of us have become tech companies and u we want to chase the latest

technologies. I think we are at a point where technology evolution especially in the AI uh space is way ahead than the adoption. We have to use the current technology really well put the right

guard rails in place before we go after the next next model the next release of uh you know what is happening in Silicon Valley and so on. I think we need to use the current technologies really well and

make sure that we able to scale up what works before we go to the next one. No well said and I see this desire to chase every shiny object being uh quite quite out there. SJ that's this is the last

formal question and then I have this common question to all of you in case time permits and I look at Sarika through the time but you know you are the big mover of capital as I said

earlier what signals do you look for uh when you back AIE financial initure at scale uh is it I won't give you know whatever what signaling helps you &gt;&gt; yeah I think uh you know uh this is uh

the truth for any investor is they're looking for returns and the expected returns is a function of the risk that you're taking. So when you think about the convergence uh when you think about

the trusted infrastructure does it bring the risk of capital down because if it brings the risk of capital down then you will deploy a lot more capital not just from an equity standpoint but also from

a credit standpoint that is extremely important because inclusion is all about being able to allocate capital and all the things that you said right how do you reduce friction costs how do you

reduce doing business cross product that's something that we're trying to do through the hub uh all these come into play in bringing that cost of doing business down which brings the cost of

risk down which helps to deploy more capital with a much better expected return profile. So nothing less nothing more. &gt;&gt; Well said S and maybe then uh sorry I'm

looking at the clock there four minutes to 425 so I'm going to go through oh this is saying more time than what you're saying so I'm I'm following the 425 rule if you feel we can go to the

430 whatever but this is the last question really speaking. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Okay. Fine. So, SJ maybe you first. One thing you feel very excited about and maybe one thing you feel skeptical or

still unclear about. &gt;&gt; I think uh I'm extremely excited about u you know how this is a potential for us to move up the value chain of anything that we do and and if you think about

where I spend my time, I can move 20 30% up the value chain because I get more productive. And that applies to anybody and everybody on whatever they're doing. So moving up the value chain as humanity

I think is the biggest biggest opportunity. I think um what I'm worried about is um is is dilution of human accountability because there will be a lot of decisions that are taken uh by by

by agents machines but uh uh human accountability has to stay uh uh that that that uh you know uh that human in the loop on how certain decisions are taken. So I hope we don't dilute

accountability while we think about the opportunities on the productivity and moving up the value chain side. &gt;&gt; Well said. I think the way I look at is I'm excited

about the fact that uh we are still just started the journey on AI. We may talk about we have been in it for eight years or 10 years but the fact is we are still touched the tip of the iceberg. So what

lies ahead of us is really exciting time within DBS. What we see is that nearly twothird of our employees use actively use AI in their day-to-day work and that is something we have seen benefit

everybody in their productivity individual productivity. I think the second piece uh is I think it is a slow sort of headline from our CEO is we want to be a AI enabled bank with a heart. So

the point is somewhere as the AI become more pervasive the empathy should not go away and that is something that worries us and that's why we say we want to be a AI enabled bank with a heart

&gt;&gt; I love that Ses keeping it uh sort of short I would say to me the the positive is inclusion and the

negative is exclusion. inclusion, right? Because when we talk about inclusion and we use this example a lot, our ability to communicate with the last person who's not digitally savvy because

we spent a lot many years talking about digital literacy and you were teaching people to you know sort of talk to machines and now the machines can talk to you and that's made a big difference.

I look at my you know last two roles whether we were doing empessa I remember hearing the stories that the Kenyan population was numerate but not literate so they virtually built the entire

ecosystem on saying people know how to do numbers but they can't do instructions and when we built India post payments bank our biggest challenge was digital literacy we spent 10 million

manards of training the postmen because we had 300,000 postal workers getting enabled to service the ecosystem and in today's world it becomes a very very easy thing to do with AI embedded

over there and even for a citizen who has a simple mobile phone your ability to converse and be able to do what you want to do is much easier exclusion becomes the challenge because yes as

some people adapt adopt there are the others who will get left behind and I think India till now has adopted a very fine model of both assisted and self-serving you know individuals. So I

think assisted digital models in our country will remain very strong and need to be kept very strong so that if you can't do it yourself somebody can help you do it.

&gt;&gt; Thanks Shell of this inclusion and exclusion. &gt;&gt; I think I'm really excited about the fact that with agents coming in humans will get to exercise much more agency

ironically because the drudge were the drudgery of the job goes away and uh I can see a future where every every human every person whether in your personal

productivity capacity or as an enterprise worker you become 10x of who you are because you using AI or AI is working for you. I think that's that's really exciting. What's worrying me

actually about AI and how it's going in the last four or five years is I'm worried our education system is yet to catch up and are we preparing uh the AI natives to be truly different from how

we were brought up. &gt;&gt; Excellent. Uh Manish and then I'll probably bring it to a wrap after that. Yeah. Uh so most of it has been said if I have to put it across what I'm super

excited I am a businessman I'm a business guy the speed which AI brings the thing which I would launch in 3 months probably can be launched in 15 days so that is what is really exciting

about AI the thing which bothers me is do I have a job tomorrow &gt;&gt; actually surprisingly nobody else talked about that so which is interesting uh I was I was waiting for it to come but it

didn't you okay so look we are pretty much at the end of the panel. I first uh first and foremost wanted to thank the panelists genuinely. I I read a lot about AI. I'm quite well versed

but I learned from each of their perspectives a lot and I hope you also took away something from each each of these speakers. Uh they they had thought a lot about it and they brought the

wealth of their uh wisdom from the their respective organizations to bear as well. So hopefully you saw cumulative wisdom of some very iconic organizations come into play. uh I I just if I I was

thinking what will I add to this uh the only the maybe there's one theme I will add uh at uh at my organization BCG we often use this phrase 10 2070 uh and I think it fits in with what people are

saying 10 is often uh the technology and 20 is the algorithms but the 70 is the people so any big change needs the 10 and the 20 to be complemented to the 70 and often you know in many large change

agenda We talk a lot about 10 and 20 and we talk a lot less about 70 and I think you touched upon it in different ways but if I could leave that the enormity of that is huge and uh we need to

whatever you are doing in your respective places keep thinking about that uh you know whether it is inclusion or exclusion whether it's agency increasing or decreasing all of those

things whether it's learning unlearning all of those things that 70 uh is is a very very critical part of the equation uh but I also want to bring it to a wrap by thanking all of you, you've been

incredibly patient, uh very engaged. I from what I can tell from your body language, it's hard when you're standing or sitting uncomfortably. So, a huge shout out to you as well. And with that,

thank you. &gt;&gt; I don't know if uh Sarah, we have I don't know the panel design. The questions are off. &gt;&gt; So, I was about to skim on that. Since

we have cut the organizers 10 minutes, uh we can give 5 minutes for the Q&amp;A if the panel is fine with that. Yeah. Couple of people said they had to leave sharp at 4:30 for a flight. So I want to

be respectful of that. If they can stay five more minutes guys everybody if you have five. Okay. &gt;&gt; Will you will you moderate I mean there are lots of hands.

&gt;&gt; I would try to &gt;&gt; the trick in this is be short snappy with the question and what I will do is maybe let me do this. Let me take a few questions so that we don't like overload

one. So okay since he's put his hand up first I'm going to can somebody pass a mic to him? Uh if somebody can help me with that. Okay, we will take you uh the lady there as well as uh the gentleman

here. We'll take three questions and then we'll see what you think. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Just say it out. Yeah, &gt;&gt; as we already know, we are moving to the

autonomous systems. So uh like as we I'm holding like uh a system like uh everything would be automated like if the company want to do something so it need to be have a lot of step of paying.

So like it will be completely autonomous. it will pay 10 to 20 transaction without uh requiring human in loop. So will you uh would you allow this kind of system?

&gt;&gt; Okay, good. Let's load a couple of questions and then maybe different people will. Will will you? Yeah. Can I possible? &gt;&gt; Okay. once again I was just going to ask

her to yes raise your question go ahead &gt;&gt; uh so hi everyone uh I'm Muskan and I'm a financial analyst working with the cap gemini since three years so as in cap gemin like I'm

&gt;&gt; give the question fast we short on time yeah please &gt;&gt; so as in corporate employee we know uh that we are all all around with the AI and progressively growing but uh if we

are talking about the other than the employees they are still cautioning the AI so what key points we have to check and we have to follow for the same to grow up the AI in India as uh like in

other countries as well &gt;&gt; just pass okay pass mic to the gentleman and then I'll ask different panelists if you want to take one of the questions and I'll go around so that we can just

said my question to bin that no basically you did mention that we are less forgiving of AI and then more forgiving to human being and every CEO has a tendency that no shall I follow

this shiny object or shall I wait and watch this more like a dejàu moment when uphar ecosystem was building up I was very fortunate to deliver the first loan on Aadhaar India STS traveled all the

slum areas Now you did mention that we move from pilot to scale. What are the best practices work for you which every CEO every CXO can learn from this room that know from pilot which pilot to take

and which pilot to &gt;&gt; let go right. &gt;&gt; All right. So let's go the autonomous agents question. Sab if you could take over you know uh if is that okay you

know the question of auto is you're saying agents without any human in the loop do you envisage that you know uh &gt;&gt; system &gt;&gt; I get it so

&gt;&gt; don't add more questions right now I'm worried about more you know let him answer but if you want to answer than that so as of as we waste and today I'm not going to answer about the future

here is the fact that we still do not have enough comfort to let AI run it fully within banking world. We have human in the loop helping us and so in any transaction or anything that gets

processed. Uh we do not have that confidence right now but as the time passes by I it can happen but as of now I don't have that view.

&gt;&gt; Oh no no no sorry that's what I want to avoid. Uh do you are you able to take the whitelisting question on the UPI evolution or given &gt;&gt; yeah so I yeah but there are challenges

of whitelisting how many IP would I so would I block the real customers moving the money is a challenge I understand that there's a fraud and there are ways to control frauds so what you are

articulating probably might not be the only solution to control fraud. Are you getting me? So, whitelisting of IPs, individual IPs because IPs are getting created which are genuine as

well as fraudulent very difficult to whitelist IP from a UPI perspective. But there are ways and means to control fraud which are happening on UPI and we are working with NPCI to control those

kind of frauds. &gt;&gt; Okay, maybe not a full answer but you know and ban on the scaling one &gt;&gt; the only best practice do less Let's you did three three projects in AI

versus five put it very sharply in so less is more. Uh I think you had a broader question on adoption etc. So I don't know if anybody wants to take the ladies question. Uh

but I thought I touched upon that a little bit in the 10 2070. Sar I'm there are many hands. I'm conscious of the &gt;&gt; I can't allow that. I'm so sorry. If the organizers give me another 20 minutes

then I can. &gt;&gt; No no no I don't think it's fair. &gt;&gt; That's not possible. Sorry. Uh so I think for the people who couldn't uh we couldn't answer the queries. If you can

catch the speakers outside please do so. Write to Ficky. We will be happy to facilitate. That's the answer. But thank you panelists. It was really lovely to hear all of you. The thoughts were

enormous. I'm sure we did justice to the time of the people who are sitting here even standing here like Nidas repeatedly said we value it. We really value it. So whether it's a JCT framework which being

talked by or we talked about AI for scalability or how AI needs to be embedded as part of the design or the financial ability. So I think there was lots of thoughts if I start summarizing

on each and everything which ne has already done. So I think that's something which really needs to ponder is important question nia did said talked about AI and jobs and you got the

answer from the panelist it's about productivity it's about your own reskilling it's about reaching high and the quality matters better than the quantity so that is very very very much

important with this and uh since it's in the uh ages of the ISBR and we started with that kind of an approach so we have talked about how we are talk the assisted lab models versus the

self-service models. So the combination of India and Singapore really caters to both sides of it and I think that's a really beauty of this forum that we are able to have those best practices across

the countries not limited to this sector but others also. So with this we'd like to thank the panelists who have taken out time uh with us. Uh of course I'll be not repetitive with all but Mr.

Suresi, Mr. Soral, Mr. Buman Loda, Mr. Sujay Gosh, Mr. Manish Aaral and our moderator Min Mr. NR Jagarwa. Can I have And a round of applause to all of you for being sharing your time and being

with us. I'd like to thank the AI impact summit. The organizers for giving Fiki this opportunity to organize this. My own team where we have a Singapore desk led

by Rajiv, Malvika, Amita and Reinda and my own team members with it love and Sudhi who has been participative with this. And we have Mitunj from the BFSI sector supporting it. List goes on. It's

a hard work of many people at the background which gets you here. Fick is delivering eight sessions. This is the second and we look forward to your support over before the speakers move

out and I have two minutes. Uh there's a moments from the organizers. We'd like to facilitate all of you with the same. Over to you love. Ma'am,

&gt;&gt; could you just present the moment to uh NRA sir? Next I would request you to present it to sur &gt;&gt; sir.

&gt;&gt; Sorry I need to get out of the way so that I don't. And next I would request you to present it to bhwan sir. &gt;&gt; Now may I request Rajiv sir to give

momentos to sij sir. next to Manish sir. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; Uh Soros, sir is left. Uh I'm so sorry. If you uh if you'd like to fill a seat

closer to the front, I' I'd welcome you all to come as close to the front as possible so people who are coming in a little late can occupy the rear seats. Uh yeah, so just to mention that we'll

be starting the next two to three minutes. Thank you. I can I can I can welcome you. All right. &gt;&gt; Uh good evening everyone. Good evening

once again. Uh I'd like to welcome you all to the panel AI for power uh accelerating the clean energy transition. We'd especially like to thank the Ministry of Electronics and

Information Technology, the organizers of the India AI impact summit for giving us this opportunity to discuss the impact of AI on grid transformation. I'd like to start by inviting Dr. Mesh

Patanka to present the work that MPEN systems is doing in the space. right in the sequence. Okay. So, good evening everyone and uh thank you again uh Rishi Nalin uh and

other co-organizers including BRPL uh new friends from other organizations and the audience here. Uh what we'll do is I'll just quickly run through what we have been doing uh as a part of systems

activities. So primarily uh we have been sort of focusing on multiple things including power sector, bringing of rural value chains, electrification on mobility and some of the things that

we're going to discuss today uh span across transmission distribution generation and also uh restore demand flexibility opportunities. I'll focus a little bit more on demand flexibility in

the next two to three minutes before I hand it over to uh Rishi. um primarily um there are several uh opportunities in which the power sector and the end use consumption techniques can be merged

together. So one of the key things uh that we have been focusing was focusing on is uh uh AI in the building management systems. So conventional wisdom of uh building management systems

is about optimizing air conditioning. But one of the key things that we have been watching is basically all the changes that we see because of the climate uh uh uh uh climate change uh

and the ambience uh changing the humidity levels, wind directions and everything changing because of which the renewal energy generation onsite as well as offsite uh and the requirement for

the specific uh uh comfort cooling uh changes uh drastically. So one of the key applications that we have been watching out for is basically how do we really predict the weather and how do we

predict the on-site generation offsite generation uh occupancy levels etc and how do we really optimize for uh the AI application in that specific zone. So buildings is a

uh already start developing some application areas uh through uh the uh AI applications and ML applications as well. Uh moving beyond uh we have been uh talking about uh uh uh the load

management and in this particular case uh the use case that we have been exploring is uh electric vehicle charging infrastructure. So it can happen at a large uh Delhi transport

corporation bus depot at the same time individual two-wheeler charging opportunities and here it's a sort of very interesting mix uh which is at the micro level which is at a home level

charging and if you can manage that predictively and if you can manage that predictively based on the power pricing as well I think there is a good uh inference that one can draw and then

also optimize uh so that two things can be achieved. First and foremost is electrons are available at cheapest rate and the cleanest opportunity that we see from the electrons um wherever uh the

charging can ramp up. So uh the charging uh the thermal cooling system, thermal energy storage systems as well as uh uh electric vehicle charging infrastructure is basically nothing else but battery

energy storage systems. So can we use the end use itself to also uh provide that provide for that opportunity and in the recent past there's an experiment that we facilitated and evaluated on uh

going from vehicle to load and vehicle to grid or vehicle to home. Vehicle to load is absolutely sort of important and here and now opportunity for the AI uh itself. The third uh thing that we have

been uh talking about is demand flexibility and this is very important from the perspective of the load shift that we see in the power markets. So typically in the past we would have seen

the load shifts which peak in the morning time and then you also have a peak in the evening time and uh because of the again weather changes climate changes etc. uh several discom

territories have started experiencing uh peak demands at midnight. Uh and that's again the cooling load that we are seeing and how do we really optimize for that uh peaking of the demand at

midnight and how do we really transfer that to the afternoon peak power generation from the renewable energy sources and here we're talking about solarization. So that's a very important

aspect and what we have been able to do is uh to get this variable infirm renewable energy to be absorbed in end uses. So there are several examples such as a pre-cooling or thermal energy

storage systems or even a water pumping a simple water pumping for a municipal corporation if you can predict what is going to be the consumption of water during the coming summer coming winter.

So it's not only about the dagal consumption and the changes thereof. It's also the seasonal storage opportunities that one would sort of see in that space. So that's another very

important aspect and uh also would like to mention you know there is a lot of regulatory support which also is required by AI and AI is also required for a benign regulatory framework to be

developed. So just to give a reference here if you're looking at subdistribution level uh investments new transformers new cables to be drawn and so on typically the regulatory space uh

starts looking at uh is this investment adequate. Now if you were to really look at the uh uh uh viability of the discom investments or you can even uh nullify that investment and all of that can be

done again through predictions and then that's where we clearly see an opportunity for the AI to come into play. So I'll pause here or happy to sort of take any sort of questions and

reflections later uh during the session. Handing it back to Rishi. Thanks Rishi. So sorry. So in addition to uh what what Mahesh had presented, we also wanted to highlight a very specific model or a

platform that is is focused on AI for power, right? Uh so I want so I wanted to introduce this program called Electron Vibe, right? Uh and I wanted to start by stating a couple of things,

right? One is that India has set very uh key targets right 500 gawatt of non- fossil fuel power power capacity 1 cr rooftop solar households by March 2027 and that EVs should should be 30% of

overall sales by 2030 right so what is the real link here it is the need for a modern resilient grid right one that can handle more rooftop solar, distributed energy resources, new

loads of EV charging, and more dayto-day variability while still delivering reliable service. That's why utilities need practical tools that improve the grid and and how

it is planned and operated. Right? So just to give a bit of background, my name is Rishi from Climate Collective and uh Climate Collective was actually started uh by renewable energy

developers, people who've built projects on the ground and built climate collective to support the next wave of climate solutions to be adopted and eventually scaled. Right? Today we're

the largest early early stage climate tech startup platform in the global south having supported all uh close to 1500 startups uh 59 of them being women led startups through almost 100

accelerator programs that we've run so more specifically our understanding of the power sector made us realize a specific need to incorporate innovative solutions

especially at the power distribution level. So the Electron V program was developed to focus on utilities deploying innovative solutions from startups that could accelerate the

pathway to a modern resilient distribution grid. I think you'll notice this this statement repeatedly a modern distri uh uh resilient grid. So since uh 2020, Electron Vibe has worked with 22

utilities and 63 startups leading to 20 pilots offered when we now that we're building on that experience uh having worked with a lot of these organizations uh we want to continue uh to work on an

AI for power innovation platform. The reason is simple. Even when a tool looks promising, it's hard for utilities to move from interest to real use. because of data gaps, legacy systems, uh

safety requirements and procurement uh challenges, right? So this this platform will actually compose of three parts. One, the electron program which is our open innovation platform to uh ensure

that pilots keep on uh getting deployed. Second, a knowledge hub so that utilities and other partners and key players in the space can share what has really worked and maybe what has also

not worked to ensure that the ecosystem continues to be developed. Three, the solutions platform, a place where we can utilities can find ready tools right now and over time find a safe way to share

anonymized aggregated data so that startups can build on solutions that fit utilities needs. Right? This is what leads us to this panel actually. What opportunities present itselves with

regards to AI that will help us on the pathway to a modern resilient grid. So with that I would like to invite the panelists up on stage uh Abishek Ranjan who will be joining shortly uh Sedat

Singh from IIA Sujit Nay who will be joining shortly Namita Mukharji from the International Solar Alliance um and I I'll welcome Dr. Mahesh Patanker as well to join uh and I'll hand over the mic to

uh Nalin Aagarwal founding partner of climate collective foundation. Okay, good. Hi everyone. Um, so unfortunately Mr. Gandon from IFC fell ill. He came here but he decided to not

attend because he has you know pretty hectic week coming up. Um, great. So without too much you and Sujit and Mr. Ranjan will join us. I think they are in a panel that's running late but we have

already so much experience and knowledge here that I don't want to um spend too much time not leveraging that. Um what we are here is to of course disco discover some new things about what AI

can do in the power sector. AI is obviously kind of flavor of the day but in power sector it's already been very active. Um all of us here have been part of the digitization of the power sector

in very different ways. Um I'll I'll I'll I'll ask each of you to kind of just spend a minute to introduce yourselves and your and your work especially around the digitalization and

AI for the power sector before I move into specific questions. So Mah, I think you've already spoken about MPN systems. Sudat if I can request you. &gt;&gt; Okay. Uh thank you Nalin. Uh so it's a

pleasure to be here and uh this is my first time walking in uh today for uh you know the AI summit and uh I'm glad it went smoothly after uh the entry &gt;&gt; after you got in.

&gt;&gt; Uh so I'm of course I'm Sadhhat Singh. I work at the International Energy Agency. Um I lead the energy and AI uh work program at the agency along with a colleague and uh we have a big team. We

have team of around 50 people from uh drawn from across the agency who deal with you know all aspects of the system. This goes well beyond electricity but of course electricity as you rightly said

is integral and core to uh the work we do right. &gt;&gt; Uh so I work in uh broadly in the team of the chief energy economist of the IIA. So I'm an economist by training. So

my my lens usually is uh is is economics as opposed to core engineering. But of course uh you know uh AI being a a technology uh it's important to understand the various facets of it

which include technology which include the technical aspects but also legislation regulation you know commercialization and so on. &gt;&gt; Got it. Thank you Namita question.

&gt;&gt; Hi thank you so much um Nalin and climate collective team for having me here. Um I'm Namita Mukharji. I am a strategic planning specialist at the international solar alliance. Um I

joined the alliance only last year in June and before that was working with the USA South Asia regional energy partnership program where we partnered with the climate collective in the

electron vibe program. So great work by the team there. uh at the international solar alliance um what we're doing on the digitalization space at least I don't know if it is AI so much but I

would like to comment that uh we have something called a multi-donor trust fund where we have donors like GAP Seoa Capital and others uh you know pooling in their funds uh the objective is very

clear that the solar deployment story is incomplete without the grids being able to you know sort of offtake uh the complex power which comes in the form of solar and other variable renewable

energy sources. So through the multi-donor trust fund we are trying to do um you know scalable pilots in Japur distribution utility where we're looking at uh you know de developing a digital

utility twin of the existing uh utility and then looking at how we bring in efficiency from a loss reduction standpoint. So that's the current piece of work that we are doing with um you

know international solar alliance in partnership with uh different funding partners. Thank you Namita and thank you uh Namita mentioned our work together as well in

the Maldes that was quite uh that was quite a pioneering uh program thanks for support there all right we'll jump into the the the discussion now the way we're going to structure this is in three

parts one is to understand what AI is really doing for the grid today right um and this is not what's happening in theory but really what's happening in in real life second is how are pilots

getting to become large scale deployments in India and across the global south. So we have international perspective here of course and then how do we ensure that the grid becomes truly

digitalized and AI powered. So that covers data compute trust and flexibility right. So so that maybe I'll start with you. So from global evidence and and the kind of work that you do

which AI applications in power are delivering the strongest system level benefits today and from that what do you see the key opportunities for India? &gt;&gt; Uh sure thank you. So maybe I can start

by taking a step back and uh just contextualizing and understanding why is it that we are talking about this in the first place. &gt;&gt; Uh what is it about the energy system

about the electricity electricity system and about AI that make all of this work? &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Right. Uh so we have been noticing um you know at the agency we collect data

we collect all sorts of data and uh we we the the data goes back for uh several decades and we are seeing a very strong trend of increasing complexity of the energy sector at large but specifically

the electricity systems right &gt;&gt; so what why is it becoming more complex one is that um in general the the electrification is rising so when I say electrification It means the end use of

energy is more and more electricity compared to other fuels. &gt;&gt; In other words, that there are more types of demand and more types of loads that previously never existed that are

now increasingly a part of the load. So, one is that there's greater electrification. The second is that um there is greater of course this is not news to anyone but there's greater

variable renewable electricity going into the system. So, that was never the case in the past. In the past the variability maybe came in the form of hydro power but that was also seasonal

in nature. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Uh most of the other sources of electricity were stable. That's no longer the case. Now in uh you know with

with solar and wind uh the share of variable renewables has gone from as low as 2 or 3% you know just over a decade ago. This is a global level right to uh and it's uh on track to hit 30% by the

end of this decade. This is a massive jump of variable electricity in the system. There's of course in addition to that there's you know increasing batteries to manage that uh that flex

the variability uh and uh there are new types of markets you know back in the day or everything was contracted for you know years at end. Now it's like you know there are derivatives of things and

you know it's it's a financialization of the sectors happened. So &gt;&gt; first trend is electrification. The second is more recent which is that there is an affordability issue that is

becoming more and more central to policy makers and regulators around the world. Um you know gone are the days when electricity was you know heavily subsidized around the world. That still

exists in many parts maybe even in India to some extent but uh that's less and less the case at a global level. So affordability is an issue. um you know especially with all the conflict and all

of that happening it is a the it's a priority for governments to ensure that electricity is cheap right &gt;&gt; um and and of course the third major trend is that now we have long-term

goals that never existed in the past that we have you know a 2070 or a 2050 or a 2013 net zero target uh you know be it at a company level or a country level or you know and so on and um and that

those long-term targets have short-term implications. So these three trends I think you know are the driver to why human intervention &gt;&gt; is not enough. You need uh you need

something bigger than that. You need something that is more automated. And this is where it comes in and again I don't want to take too much time but one final point on because and I want to

address the question that you actually asked. &gt;&gt; Sure. uh which is that um because of because the inherent nature of electricity and and electrified systems

makes uh you know AI applications the the most appropriate kind of technology layer that can manage that complexity &gt;&gt; and uh you know just naming one or two

things that are especially critical for India one is uh improved forecasting of variable electricity generation and when I say it's not just about you know Okay, the weather models are becoming more

accurate. Fine. But that's not enough. For solar and wind, you need minuteby-minut hour by hour understanding of you know cloud cover in the specific location where that panel

is is uh you know situated which is different from just having more accuracy you know around the world. So that's just one example. So that and then you know the managing the you know a system

that has batteries and you know on solar generation so those are the types of solutions that will be more relevant for India uh moving forward. &gt;&gt; Very nice. I think you so it's a very

nice framework. So complex loads variable generation and then the imperative of affordability. I think this is really some of the driving factors and for everyone this is the

right framing variable renewables versus you'll often hear intermittent renewables in fact variability is a far better way of describing what we see on the grid um great thank you so that um

um Namita if I can come to you um and this is of course your your broad experience this is this is you know it's your broad experience at RTI now at ISA um what are the real world application

that you're seeing going from pilots and obviously the duet you can talk about duet as well going from pilots to deployment and what has kind of pleasantly surprised you in that

&gt;&gt; okay thanks uh thanks for that question Nalin um look I think um from what's working well let's start from there and I think I echo what Siddhhat was saying the uh renewable energy phenomena now is

more than a decade old right I mean we started with a solar uh mission initial phases then we've saw a lot of wind uh coming on board because of the uh you know policy reforms around accelerated

depreciation generation based incentive and others. &gt;&gt; So the ingress of renewable energy in our grid is not a very recent story. It's been there for close to a decade.

&gt;&gt; And if we start looking at how the story has spanned over time, right? We are actually talking about a very large capacity now in our grid. More than 50% of you know renewable energy capacity

including you know hydro if you take how did that all come together right there? I would think one of the key things which has been happening over the last you know five six years very well is the

uh uptake of the forecasting in variable renewable energy sources and that's one of the key drivers for that is again generation is a delicensed activity right it's all private sector driven you

know that for renewable energy you don't uh it's not a regulated business &gt;&gt; which means uh the more accurate I am in my forecasting the more upside I have from a you know commercial gains

perspective &gt;&gt; so if you look at private sector uh so far in the wind and solar sector they have picked up very strongly on the forecasting uh you know accurate

forecasting of renewables and one key policy enabler over there has been our deviation settlement mechanism and the 15-minute interval you know basis participation of renewables in the

markets &gt;&gt; so that has all come together to somewhere now link that story as to why greater accuracy of renewables is even more critical because we'll be moving

towards more tighter grids right 5 minutes a you know uh frequency linked uh grids. So I think that is something which has started off well for us in India and is only moving towards getting

more strengthened but that also means that that has to connect to the larger story of us building the India energy stack having more open source data available so that more innovation can

come in in that forecasting. So that's the phase two of innovation if I look at from a forecasting standpoint. The other good thing that I would think that's happening at least in the Indian grid is

really the you know base layer of having data together. So if you look at the whole RDSS scheme and the fact of having 250 million smart meter rollout program announced by the government of India

right that's very ambitious to be honest that is really the backbone of anything that is digital digitalized and AI ultimately right &gt;&gt; so for me I think that is again a very

core layer that we are moving towards a lot of the smart meter installations are really starting to give the you know data that we would like to see from households and business level

&gt;&gt; so I think that is again a very good uh move in the right direction. It is now about how do you connect those again to the larger piece about making that data talk to each other interact with each

other connecting it to the distributed uh you know energy renewable energy sources be rooftop EV and others so that I would think is the next you know phase around where we are already starting to

make some moves but that's where the real focus needs to &gt;&gt; very nice I I like that framework um mah uh I want to bring you in as well um whether in DR maybe DR is a nice one to

focus on from uh specific applications you've seen and even the ones you've seen scale &gt;&gt; right so uh a demand response uh is a very interesting articulation of uh the

transition that we are seeing uh firstly uh the entire grid uh has moved from generation following load to load following generation &gt;&gt; and that's where the entire variability

and the opportunities to optimize the grid itself comes into the picture and demand response is a a very interesting democ ization &gt;&gt; of decision making in the energy space

if u uh a particular consumer base let's assume say all the uh air conditioner users in the state of Delhi if they are ready to participate uh in some kind of a demand response initiative uh it's

very import not only consumers but they're also proumers of one sort so I think demand response to me it's not only about giving a trigger uh whenever the grid

requires that trigger &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; uh to ramp down but more importantly the entire articulation uh Nolin in my opinion is now changing and needs to

change from demand response to demand flexibility &gt;&gt; wherein if you have more seasonal variation or I would say dial variations in generation coming up uh and

experience in the grid it's also important for not just to ramp down but also ramp up selectively and I think that goes back to the uh uh what what was mentioned by Sidhhat in sort of

increased electrification and that's where some of the end uses including for example foundry industry which conventionally use biomass right &gt;&gt; uh he's now moving towards electric car

furnace and that's where again demand response comes into picture so uh so the status currently is demand response there are several programs I'm sure obvious when he comes here we'll talk

about specific examples from BRPL but I think the entire narrative is now changing towards demand flexibility I'll just mentioned one very interesting uh solutioning that we came up with which

was uh which is being currently piloted by uh world bank in the state of Uttarakand wherein there is a lot of water pumping load that exists in that state because it's a hilly state so

there is something close to 40% of the uh entire consumption of that state comes from water pumping it's a big surprise isn't it we would imagine there's abundance of water but all of

that ground water which gets pumped into the gel scheme which is the water for all and uh uh has some kind of a storage. &gt;&gt; So what is currently being leveraged is

basically demand flexibility wherein one can actually bring up the water from underground water uh tables to the overhead water tanks and that has that has inherent storage capacity. So that's

the basically something which is being being planned and and we will actually be exploring the AI applications also there because at the state level you are looking at something close to one

billion uh sorry one uh uh 1 gawatt load which is available for ramping up and ramping down at least I would say 20% of that. So I'll just pause here that's probably the new way to sort of think at

a larger scale. &gt;&gt; Very nice. Um in fact this I would like to bring Sedat in because you've done some very interesting research um on data centers and perhaps how they can

actually be we hear a lot of like uh you know perhaps apprehension around what will happen with demand but in reality they can be very friendly uh loads for a grid operator because they can be firm

and flexible. Increasingly we seeing in fact we we spoke with Nvidia and Google at COP and they were mentioning how they've become increasingly able to shift critical and non-critical loads

right so just a few insights from the research that you did on data centers and how a little bit of flexibility can improve uh grid resilience and avoid added capacity as well.

&gt;&gt; Yeah for sure. So uh first let's talk about the global picture of how much electricity is consumed by data centers and then we can talk about how they consume it.

&gt;&gt; Um so firstly at a global level uh our estimate was that for last year &gt;&gt; about 1.5% of electricity generation goes into data centers. &gt;&gt; This is expected to rise to about 3% by

2030. Right? &gt;&gt; So it's a it's a doubling uh taking place. But what's uh what's increasing rapidly is actually the AI portion of it. So data centers do all types of

loads. They do not only AI, they also do traditional loads like if you're you know watching a Netflix movie for example. &gt;&gt; Um currently that AI load is a very

small fraction of it. I would say like probably less than 20% like well less than 20% of the total load of data centers today is uh uh is AI. &gt;&gt; This grows fivefold. So the portion that

is actually AI is growing fivefold. Everything else doubles but that grows fivefold. That that shows that where the growth is really coming from and AI has a different profile

compared to uh nonAI loads. So there's a greater flexibility potential uh especially when big tech companies are able to use data centers that are located in different places and shift

loads according to the signals that are given. But the big challenge there is that uh currently there is not enough regulatory I mean there's not enough information being passed down as to when

and how that should happen. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; So there there there needs to be you know a layer between data centers and the electric electrical system that

actually enables that kind of uh you know trade or flexibility or shaving off the demand. In fact some solutions have come in that space. There are a few companies, a few startups including one

that Nvidia works with since you mentioned them that is working on exactly this problem. So they're able to shift as much as 20% of uh or shave 20% of the peak demand when needed without

compromising on the actual uh competition capability of the data center. And the other issue is that um you know there have been some questions on what impact will this have on

electricity prices and so on. uh there are different takes to it. One is of course that data centers require infrastructure. Uh they require electrical you know upgrades maybe in

you know new capacity and so on and that can have an implication on costs. At the same time as you rightly mentioned they also have uh higher utilization rates right

&gt;&gt; so because they have higher utilization rates they can uh you know the the costs on the system are more absorbed. So they're high utilization rate then the rest of the grid you know put together

right in other words you're able to distribute the costs a little better. So with appropriate regulation &gt;&gt; you can ensure that data centers are more flexible.

&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; But then they're also playing a conducive part in the grid and not actually imposing costs. &gt;&gt; No imposing cost. Correct. Very nice. Um

Namita any any anything here especially given your view of of the world basically as ISA right and and and especially data centers being uh uh something that can drive

real economic demand in in in many emerging markets. So &gt;&gt; yeah no I totally echo what Sadhhat was talking about they are actually data centers will become the critical uh

demand flexible load for us supporting the grid as we move forward right and that's exactly &gt;&gt; when you start looking at the larger picture of um consumer centric grids

right where every every industry every consumer is able to contribute you know at the right time I think data centers will play a very very critical role in the times to come so I'll just sort of

&gt;&gt; yeah stop yeah and of course You may know ISA works in in how many countries? &gt;&gt; 126 &gt;&gt; 126 countries, right? So many of them emerging markets. Many of them

&gt;&gt; are seeing data centers as as as something that's positive for the economies, not just the load on the grid, right? &gt;&gt; Correct. Correct.

&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Please. I can actually come in on this. This triggered a thought, you know, as you were speaking uh you know data center uh companies and big tech companies especially have been

pursuing renewable electricity for data centers, &gt;&gt; right? But there are some very interesting angles to this right. So you know one question that people largely

have is why can't we power data centers entirely by renewables right? &gt;&gt; Uh now you'll be surprised to know or maybe you won't be surprised to know but some of the biggest data center

operators in the world so the top 10 biggest for example already claim that on paper 100% of the electricity &gt;&gt; in any given year is being met by renewables. In other words, they have as

companies purchased you know paper they have made paper contracts with uh generators of solar and wind and so on which is taking place in a third location. So it could be somewhere very

far away. &gt;&gt; Now the big challenge is this may happen at a yearly uh you know level but it's not happening on an actual basis because that electricity may be generated at a

different time of the day but the consumption load is different. It is flattened through the year. So how do you match that? &gt;&gt; Right. Right. So for this matching, this

hourly matching is the new trend that we are beginning to see. So some companies have taken a lead on it. It's not a global practice just yet. But what they're trying to do is ensuring that on

an RTOR basis, 100% of the electricity is met by renewables. And many tech companies have that target for 2030 and 35 and so on. I see. &gt;&gt; So they have met already the 100% yearly

target. &gt;&gt; But they're now moving towards a 100% hourly target. And that is when uh you know but having said that currently most u data centers are grid connected so

they do consume whatever the grid provides which includes generation from other sources. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Got it. Okay. Very interesting. Um so we may move to the

second section. I was hoping uh two other panelists would be here but clearly it's running over. Um NA I'm going to start with you and specifically on the policy side. So to get from

pilots to large scale deployments right or platforms what policy tools did do you see or have you seen matter most across across various countries you can choose India uh that would be fine. So

are we talking about regulatory sandboxes concessional finance pool procurement public data platforms or any others? &gt;&gt; Yeah thanks thanks for that uh Nalin um

you know it's interesting because what we're talking about is a transformation which is happening so fast right now. I mean I've been here in the sector for 22 years now but these last you know couple

of years have just sort of changed the whole dynamics of the pace at which things are changing right &gt;&gt; right right &gt;&gt; which means that if you look at our

discussion here today about digitalization about AI when we come back next year it would have taken a different form and shape altogether which means that it has an even more um

sort of criticality to bring the regulations policies regulatory policy makers you know up to speed with all the changes which are happening because of course

&gt;&gt; because to be very honest distribution and the consumer side is regulated that part of the business is regulated which means the regulator plays a very critical role in defining certain

standards rules and that's that's fair also right &gt;&gt; a lot of the policym also that we do is actually governs what is going to happen ultimately at the consumer level right

so what I see is that there are five or six layers to this and they are not sequential they have to go in parallel right if you're looking at scaling up the digitization story.

&gt;&gt; One is definitely looking at the data and AI governance for renewable energy &gt;&gt; which is essentially meaning that we have to now increasingly start making uh rules for the sector which allows our

distributed renewable energy sources, distribution system operators. We don't have something called DSOs but we have more like the transmission system operators and the distribution utilities

&gt;&gt; so that these entities can start talking to each other in in the form of data but with the right uh privacy security standards that we build and also the need for us to move more towards open AI

tools which will literally then &gt;&gt; add to the story of the India energy stack that we're trying to build in the form of the digital public infrastructure right so that is one key

thing that which is the governance framework and rules which has to be created. The second thing is um a renewable energy forecasting you know compliance framework because like I told

you a lot of the generation is private sector driven so it makes sense for them to do forecasting right as a business case but I think it's a it's a need for regulators to start specifying this that

you know if you don't have this forecasting then you know your tariffs get will get impacted and so on and so forth so &gt;&gt; for me it's very important that there is

now a explicit mandate for a regulatory requirement of forecasting for variable renewable energy. &gt;&gt; And just to understand, are you talking the signals that a regulator can send

would be like the UI charges, right? Basically, &gt;&gt; the the DSM charges which we now call the deviation settlement mechanism, right? Also the second thing around this

is updating the grid codes because we have grid we have built grid codes over years and with the way in which the grid is changing there's a need for really constantly updating the grid codes which

is then talking with these kind of disruptions which are taking place. So I think that's another key uh aspect which we have to be mindful about. Uh the third thing um on the regulatory side I

would think is a very important aspect about digitalization of utilities and grids which means that um how do you incentivize digital twins advanced analytics you know as

sujit please come &gt;&gt; come. How do you basically um bring advanced analytics that utilities are doing as a part of the regulated grid enhancing

investments? Because one has to understand when a utility goes to a regulator for its annual revenue requirement and tariff approvals if the regulator is not approving a digital

twin related application or advanced analytics then where will a utility look at these advanced mechanisms. So I think from a regulatory standpoint that's another key key aspect

&gt;&gt; then we have consumer centric distributed renewable energy sources which will now increasingly start coming on the grid. So how do you develop flexible market mechanisms so that these

you know start talking uh to each other which would mean that uh you know what we talked about we spoke about the demand uh the data centers right how do these contribute now to your peak

shaving congestion relief you know and voltage support mechanism. So moving towards those kind of advanced market mechanisms in parallel to these regulatory reforms.

&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And then two other things which are very very important is firstly planning because you know if you have to incentivize utilities to plan for

digital and AI options when they are doing their resource and network planning requirements to the regulator, &gt;&gt; right? And somewhere the regulator needs to nudge and tell them that where are

those plans, right? So that and then we could also look at something called a performance-based uh incentive for utilities who are um adopting digital solutions which are leading to

improvements say in a rec curtailment reduction. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Or um forecasting accuracy or outage reduction right so something along those lines.

&gt;&gt; It's thinking out of the box. I don't know if that's possible but this is a way of incentivizing. And finally, I would say um regulatory sandboxes play a great role in promoting innovation by

the regulator. You'll see DERC has announced the um regulations which are now talking about P2P trading for uh you know electricity using blockchain. U has already done that the UPRC. So things

like this I think uh are very important just so that you test and see whether what you're applying is possible to scale at a much larger. &gt;&gt; So I'll just stop there. Oh, sorry. And

then one small last thing is um I think the capacity building of regulators is extremely important because while we have a CRC in the center but we all know at the state level

&gt;&gt; I mean if you go and talk to regulators about digital and AI there there's a long shot so there has to be capacity building which is a constant &gt;&gt; that I think you brought up so many

points but yeah I mean the planning and the performance-based incentives there they they seem to have we've seen them working in other sectors for Great. I'd like to welcome Sujit as

well. Um, thanks Sujit. Um, what what we request is just 30 seconds so that people know specifically what it is you're doing in relation to digitalization of the grid and of course

that includes a lot of what you're doing at IS. &gt;&gt; Yeah. No, thank you so much. Firstly, I must apologize. Um, looks like I'm not the last one to walk in. I see Abishek

joining me so I'll probably, you know, probably get him thrown under the bus in some sense. But so sorry. But yeah, no, really honored to be here and I was just listening to some of the

conversations. Um, so my work seems to ask questions in those areas, but I ask questions more as a as a technologist. I see myself more as a infrastructure plumber, a dist plumber of sorts with

the work we have done in DPI and most of my work with DPI with Beckin as such particularly. Um so I think the work I do is essentially ask what does it take when things change pretty dramatically

&gt;&gt; and and AI energy are very interesting because on one side AI is taking off um definitely the models are getting better and of course there is there is a re realistic cost decline that's happening

in usage of that that's one part of it of course and I was saying that in the other panel it's still a lot of supply side hysteria we need to see the demand side value of it

&gt;&gt; and also So demand side pricing of risk of AI that's that's one of the challenges but energy is peculiar because about two years ago somebody reached out and said aren't you not

thinking about energy I said no probably as a trained electronics engineer I know a little bit but I understand kit's law but not more than that but the larger point about the massive decentralization

that's happening and the fact that increasingly more and more useful energy assets will be outside of the control of the grid &gt;&gt; geometrically scaling up and we people

are going to to be part of the grid because we are the ones with solar rooftop generating energy. So we are the grid in some sense as as a society at large.

&gt;&gt; Probably it calls for an opportunity to have a little bit of a systems level thinking without of course upsetting the grid systems. We are not literally trying to do an open art surgery of how

the grid works but see how do we manage and in and bring them together. So how do we make create open rails that makes this coordination happen and little learnings from what we have done with

all the DPI work in the past seems to be finding relevance here and that's that's the space I'm operating in right now. &gt;&gt; Very nice. I mean this is all pathbreaking work uh not just in India

but globally I think DPI has brought us a model that is very unique uh is the only alternative to big tech I think uh anywhere. Um so thanks Sujit for being here. Mr. Ranjan I mean I for many of

you he may not need an introduction. He's probably the leading uh energy innovation uh uh person in India especially in grids. I I definitely consider him. Uh Mr. If I can just

request you to take 30 seconds just to talk about your view of grid uh digitization and digitalization and I'll come to a specific question um especially because we have just 10

minutes actually. So where have you seen in Delhi's grid or even otherwise but since Delhi is very close to you where AI has created most operational value &gt;&gt; of course uh apologies for 30 minutes

delay but then uh we're talking about exactly the same thing in the last session &gt;&gt; uh grids have evolved what uh Sujit is saying

democratization has happened even if we are not aware it is already happening &gt;&gt; a grid is no longer longer a monolith or a unidirectional thing. It's already a biirectional multi-directional thing

already happening. So without our knowledge certainly the changes in the last mile maybe the production systems maybe the distribution transformer infrastructure

those things are taking shape technology is seeping in unknowingly knowingly it is seeping in it's not like on one fine day we are going to move there which already we are already moving there

&gt;&gt; sure &gt;&gt; what I always say is we are already in some kind of DSO we are moving towards that a deer interconnection giver and a deer kind of oper operator right now it

is a must run &gt;&gt; right but then as as soon as smart grids uh sorry smart inverters and the digital twin that we're talking about comes in we also have now to you know run that

symphony orchestrate that symphony that's what it is going to be when you manage all the deers together &gt;&gt; now one specific point where it has make a lot of difference is 9 years ago in

2017 we started with AI powered Machine learning was not machine learning powered models for demand forecasting that was spot day ahead and uh that is and intraday that is two hour ahead and

then it scaled up to forecasting the spot market prices which is realtime prices and dayhead market prices and uh it it makes up to 70 to 80% of the cost of a utility in India for example. So it

it made a lot of improvement in the last 9 years we have been able to save and quantify a lot of power purchase cost optimiz especially if you can see uh about 20

25% is short-term and about 10 to 15% is about on the spot market share in our annual energy uh purchase that we do that is uh hands down second now we are uh deriving a lot of mileage is from

because the scenario has changed the people are saying even a flicker is an issue. The government is saying give me a vix daily plan in the next 3 years. So sidi and cyi so close to Singapore if

maybe few minutes it can't be done without investing a lot in technology and that to last mile technology &gt;&gt; so we started with pilots again in 2018 2019 pre-COVID that was on uh uh AI

based platform for predictive and prescriptive asset health monitoring and maintenance now it is inbuilt so we are putting in all those 23 KV 11 KV feeders on the block

&gt;&gt; right uh baselining and then using drones or satellite imagery to capture and uh then trigger based MPT of meantime to failure and the complete workflow is getting operationalized. So

that is again yielding numbers on the Excel sheet. These are the two uh important things which we are already seeing the value. There are multiple other things which is in the customer

space uh yet to be quantified like for example &gt;&gt; before you apply for a new connection you can actually check it online like Eon does allow you we want to have a

customized version of the same here till now it was there in our internal so we hadn't made it public so now with the smart meters on on the DTS &gt;&gt; we have real life view so you can get to

know in few minutes as to whether your techn this uh connection of this much quantum at this location is possible or not. So this is going to be revolution because people say that you are a

monopoly and therefore we are suffering. &gt;&gt; Okay. So this is going to be other way around saying that yeah you decide your own place where you want to in the current shape.

&gt;&gt; Very nice. I mean that is for anyone who lives in Delhi that will be a big uh help I guess right. Um okay great I'm going to come back to you. Um we're all curious about u of course um you did

mention what it's about in a very uh you know uh yeah in a very fundamentally broken down way which is great right um I want to understand from you is what would success in in India's tax style

look like for the power sector if you were to include AI take a fiveyear view you know &gt;&gt; yeah I think um one of the things we were debating on i and AI is by the way

still a work in progress. We're discovering a lot more serendipitiously and that's a good thing about how you design things at population scale because you're not curating sometimes

this emerges uh from diverse set of use cases you're looking at but if I were to take a five-year view and ask this question of course grid resilience and flexibility being at the core and center

reliability being at the core of the center is there an opportunity for us to to solve for energy agency you know bring put people at the center of their energy lives people in businesses and

give them that agency and how do you solve for that? Most of the time I think the the the idea that energy is something that is an obligatory burden for a discom to offer

&gt;&gt; and fulfill puts a lot of pressure on the discom utility of the grid in general. &gt;&gt; Now the the equation has flipped with people having more and more energy. So

is it possible for them to be a participant? &gt;&gt; Sure. not just a beneficiary and and and is therefore a way of coordination that makes them participant and derive

benefits but overall makes it a more self-organizing self-reliance system and if that is that could be one of the visions of the energy stack and I'm not a sole you know speaker opinion maker on

that part there are others but I think that could be one way to look at it and what it means is that net the marginal coordination cost on getting energy accessible affordable to billion people

should come down to zero if if India is in the solar belt if we have the ad kind of assets &gt;&gt; maybe that's one of the visions to talk about and through that and and as as we

speak probably there is a prime minister looking at one of the early implementations of Indian stack the peer-to-peer interstate trading uh thanks to the work Abishek and all have

been done in the just in literally in one month's time &gt;&gt; is to talk about how does it creates new livelihoods you know telecom revolution created STD booths as a way of

livelihoods and banking their business correspondents I wouldn't be surprised if you then homemakers are actually having another you know livelihood. I mean maybe there's a point maybe

somebody in the village will start thinking should I buy a cow for livelihood or probably get non-selfused energy solar rooftop and battery to generate some income

&gt;&gt; and making that possibility &gt;&gt; and and and making that possibility and making people part of that story would be one of the big things about IS and I is not by itself a solution. It's very

very important we understand this. just the coordination layer the solutions will have to be designed brought up but we think that if more and more such solutions have to come it is absolutely

necessary to have that coordination fabric otherwise we will have as I was saying in the other panel &gt;&gt; uh we in digital the tendency is that &gt;&gt; we literally build a road for every car

that's how digital has been we didn't do that with energy we did not build one grid for toasters another grid for washing machine we build one grid for all but dig we tend to make that mistake

and that is why the cost becomes coordination cost become so high with this digital coordination fabric which essentially nothing but a bunch of standards and specifications we should

be able to achieve that sorry it was not supposed to be supposed to be a short answer but &gt;&gt; no no it's probably what &gt;&gt; I think your analogy of the grid as

potentially a complex adaptive system is is very nice for the future and uh yeah I mean there's so much potential of it being a an economic driver for individuals so that's great um I know I

I think we have a hard stop I hope we don't because we have so much to go through but u I'm going to come back to Namita once I I'll move to the last sections is um

just talk about given ISA's role and your own experience south learning how can this be leveraged to to to leaprog traditional grid planning and dispatch uh models right and in the context of AI

please &gt;&gt; okay thanks um Nalin I'll keep it brief look I think for ISA south south is a little overrated But I think most important is the fact

that we we have uh members across the sunb belt uh across the globe and with the type of disruption you know it was interesting to listen to the joint secretary Minar saying that in the last

18 months 15 gawatt of decentralized solar you know has got added to the grid &gt;&gt; which you can imagine in terms of the you know impact on the grid that you'll have if you don't have the backbone

layer of flexibility that we're talking about right at the distribution level. So I think um the way the story of the global south is building is very different from the way in which the

north has developed its stories right all our stories across the African subcontinent Latin America or other regions have a very similar historical legacy grid that you have built right

&gt;&gt; so I think from that perspective it's very crucial that these learnings are more south south to say so and it's customized more because so that &gt;&gt; um we don't um leave the rest of the

global south on their old journey but bring them up where you know countries like India are moving &gt;&gt; just a little bit of an issue I have with the leaprogging again uh

terminology because look I think grids are very different across countries uh you can't think &gt;&gt; uh you know African subsaharan countries move towards where we have moved as

India there has to be a basic you know building block of uh data digital layer that get built before we move towards that journey so I would say keeping that in mind but there's a lot to offer from

a south corporation &gt;&gt; perfect um so that in your view globally u what are the biggest bottlenecks um for powering an AI powered grid is it data access compute cyber security

skills or regulatory in &gt;&gt; so of course all of the above but uh I'll let the data speak for itself so we did a survey and we you know with energy companies and so on uh the the one that

kind of popped up more than any other was skills &gt;&gt; skills &gt;&gt; so just I mean the the the talent usually gravitates to tech sector.

There's no surprises there. We did another, you know, bit of desk research to find that &gt;&gt; for the similar role, you get paid 2x of what you would in uh the energy sector.

So the the going rate uh the going wage in the energy sector is half of what it would be in in tech for the same role. So that gives you an illustration of of how difficult it is to attract the right

talent. And I know the I see the clock ticking otherwise I would have &gt;&gt; I think the best minds of our generation have gone to sell ads. Huh. Unfortunately,

um, Sujit, if I can bring you in, um, governance principles essential for utilities to trust, uh, shared digital platforms. Just a few words on that. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it goes back to the point that we

may be probably the the biggest most powerful AI agent, take outage management for all you can. Um, but but if it's not working with the ecosystem and it's working in silos, just going to

take off. I mean if you want to so I keep saying this it's very very important that one of the lessons we have learned from India's transformation story has been

&gt;&gt; to rethink how we think about scale I mean one is to think about scaling what works &gt;&gt; because that's what all engineers love doing including myself uh but it's a

completely another thing to think about what works at scale the point example about the contexts are very different not I mean there are 84 discoms at different stages of evolution different

styles of doing what they're doing uh different motivations at some point uh different demographics they deal with. For example, what we seeing in Delhi versus what we seeing in a rural

district of Jaipur could be very different. So it is therefore you important to think about how we make them all agree on a common set of building blocks as a principle and if

you give them probably that's all that it takes just give these building blocks &gt;&gt; for them to contextualize it to create what is the solution for in there &gt;&gt; but having those common building blocks

across all is the part that is is the is is what is necessary and that's where these principles u will will become important the fundamental principles of interoperability India stack is just

doing that. India stack is saying there are these building blocks. It's fascinating to see out of 55 use cases that we went through mostly on the discom

for all of them are probably not more than five. &gt;&gt; Wow. Nice. &gt;&gt; And but each of them works at population scale.

&gt;&gt; Wow. So it also reduces the whole burden on discoms to saying oh one I have this electrification burden of the new load then we have this whole renewables on top of that you're going to make me

write another 15 RFPs on distriations I just finished getting my billing system done &gt;&gt; but that's not the idea that's not how we should think about it so that's where

some of these very very clear design principles make a big difference and that's what India energy stack intends to do &gt;&gt; very nice I mean I know some of the work

you're talking about is encapsulated in societal platforms I guess so it's It's a good one for everyone to read about later. Um &gt;&gt; yeah, I think societal platform is a

body of knowledge that has come out of all the work of design thinking we have done in India. I think India has probably its own design thinking which we have managed to come together and

call it as societal platform. &gt;&gt; I think it's it's more societal thinking because platform is so ancient now. We're more talking protocols but societal thinking and societal platform

is a body of knowledge which sort of embodies these principles and says probably this is how you should think about scale. Yeah, I would recommend everybody to you know give it a look.

Yeah, &gt;&gt; very nice. Thank you Mr. Ranjan. I guess if if we are on a if we are on a time I'll give you the last word. Um so how should utilities governments think about

AI data centers and unit? We we did have a comment from Sedat positive comment um as risks or system balancing assets. &gt;&gt; So uh it depends where you are. So in India we are just starting for example

even in US for example we are just starting. So if properly planned it is an asset and this is going to be a amplifier in terms of how do you balance the grid.

&gt;&gt; And uh if not then then you're creating another burden on the grid. &gt;&gt; So I'll be just as brief as possible. So recently uh there was an Hitachi event where we discussed the same topic.

&gt;&gt; Uh where we said that if you're sighting and sizing of the data centers is very very important. &gt;&gt; And so that you're not burdening the existing infrastructure. Yes. Yes.

&gt;&gt; While also ensuring that it is green. So the data centers can also flex. &gt;&gt; It's birectional both ways. &gt;&gt; Correct. &gt;&gt; Even the base load demand will be

somewhat fixed. But then they can peaks and spikes when you fire those lot of text heavy or voice heavy or some you know visual queries. No chat GPD kind of when the it spikes like this.

No. So those things can be taken care of by on-site and dedicated nuclear stations or battery storage or a mix of both. So yes, it is an asset. You can you can plan if you plan it properly, it

is an asset. &gt;&gt; It's an asset. &gt;&gt; Well, thank you. I there's many more questions and this is an extremely interesting conversation, but

unfortunately by the powers that be, I think we have to stop now. Thank you all for being here and it's been lovely for me. I hope it's been lovely for you as Is that good?
