## 📝 Summary

AI risks being shaped by a concentrated few, leaving the Global South as consumers rather than co-creators. When data, compute, foundational models, and distribution are controlled by a handful of corporations, innovation suffers. A competitive, open source AI stack, built on affordable compute, local cloud options, and locally trained models, is essential to fostering innovation. This panel explores AI resource distribution, barriers facing Global South innovators, and remedies through openness, competition, and South–South cooperation.

## 📝 Transcript

very important but often topic that we need competition to innovate and how does competition accelerate AI innovation and for a perspective of a competition economist who has looked at

the digital platform dominance very closely at the competition regulators office this is kind of a deja vu moment uh because uh there have been cases there have been uh um in not only in

India but in jurisdictions where the platformization of digital markets has thrown up issues where we see that platforms through their exclusive control over search engines, retail,

e-commerce, app stores, cloud storage and social media control the internet's bottleneck infrastructure. An entire ecosystem of multiple actors that is consumers, advertisers and app

developers depend on them from survival. one word which has come out from all the uh law currently dependencies and the story is a different this time in this new technological cycle as we have

stepped into the AI world. Uh there are concentration risks uh primarily stemming from the dominance of few major players some new but some old uh old from the previous cycle uh across

various layers of AI technology stack including hardware cloud computing foundational models and distribution. The challenge is about platform not only about platform dominance but I think the

underlying challenge is about the data hedgeimonyy that sustains this dominance. So how does a global south the fact that India AI impact summit is in the global south shape digital

sovereignity and sovereignity as we'll unpack in this discussion and unlayer uh the the aspect and the meaning of sovereignity is has various dimensions in the AI age that will be in most of

the g global south smartphone. So how does the consumer, how do individuals, how do businesses reclaim agency talking about autonomy and agency. So AI also becomes an operating layer or a

foundational layer of its own. If the base operating system and app stores are controlled still by a handful of companies and the infrastructure that runs AI models sits also on these

handful hyperscalers, the global south risks becoming a feature controlled by the platform. A competitive opensource AI stack built on affordable compute, local cloud options

and locally trained model is essential for innovation. I'm saying all this in the assertive but we can debate this discuss with our esteemed panelists here. So it's gives me great pleasure.

The names are already there but for uh formality sake we have Mr. Augustine Peter, former member competition commission of India. Shwar Rajpal Kohli, she is the founder director of the

startup policy forum India. Ambak who is the co-director at AI now institute US and Kash Amlani who is head and director of competition law or public policy at Modzilla.

So just to start the discussion and just to set up the landscape and the scene I want to get the perspectives of all the panelists uh that what are the key factors at play here is there a

concentration risk or no things are still shaping up the technology is still evolving and let us wait and watch. So I could begin with uh Mr. Peter you if having worked at the commission do you

see the same playbook laying here or is it different this time? [clears throat] Thank you very much pile happy to be here. Yes coming straight to the question

there is certainly a concentration risk in this area of AI. We have seen in the working of competition law in India as well as in many other countries

that digital firms and uh involving AI. They have been frequently involved in investigations and penalties. the digital or uh to be to be very

precise AI firms they originate or they uh from two specific countries the United States and China which have uh stated to be around 92%

of the sort of uh control or a resources. Now coming to I think I am speaking specifically again about India and the

developing countries. See India is in a position only to be at the last end where the consumer interface is there. While coming to the initial stages of AI uh protocol

even a country like India is nowhere in the picture. The issue of uh data sovereignty or uh is very real. Countries do not have the ability

to control the large firms which are vertically integrated and which are in a position to flex

their muscles, which are in a position to do to use their market power to overwhelm the competitors. If at all power is

there and also ensure that competition doesn't come up vertical restraints as also acquisition killer acquisitions which are rampant a country like India which is having

supposed to be having technological proess in many areas atomic energy space but Still India finds that there is no match. A number of uh uh

number of uh lot of efforts have been made but in the case of competition authority any issue is raised it takes long time and number of steps stages

coming from CCI to appellet tribunal to the Supreme Court by the time a sector like or uh AI or digital area there is a sea change where we started things are not relevant

by that time. So the question concentration is real and it has got implications not just for uh uh sovereignty but also for consumer

interest where uh exploitative conduct is very much possible and is happening. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thanks. And yeah, I think um so you set up the the prompt uh pretty well. Like I

to answer your question, I do think there are uh serious market concentration risks writ large across the AI supply chain and I think all of them are rooted not in the moment

starting chat GPT in 2022 but in the last 10 years of of what we have seen that that came before that and so uh it's not just a a question of like what can we learn from the last decade as a

theoretical question it is very much the source of understanding where market power resides today in the AI market. But yeah, I think to to kind of um get a bit more concrete, we're somewhat

familiar and I think the the kind of common intuition around the AI market is that uh you know the choke points and the barriers to entry are most heightened or most extreme at the kind

of foundation model at the training of these extremely large models and the you know the barriers to entry are obvious as are the constraints on input whether those are compute or or uh you know

chips or cloud computing the the vast eye watering amounts of capital required to train these models. But equally I think the intuition seems to be from many people that downstream is where we

will see a thousand flowers bloom and that is where you know everybody the global economy startups have a share a fighting chance at you know getting some of the the pie. Um and while I I want

that to be true and that sense is very much I think what guided judge meta in the Google search decision for example um I think instead of optimism what we need right now is is vigilance and and

rules of the road and the reason for that is it's just a simple hypothetical which is why wouldn't these extremely giant firms um as as was just pointed out that already control inputs but much

more importantly have an outsized uh role in controlling distribution and pathways to monetization. Why would they be content in sitting upstream? Why wouldn't they do everything at their

disposable at their disposal to cannibalize revenue um to cannibalize value uh downstream? And I think we're seeing uh you know big tech firms act out both defensively and proactively to

ek out with sharp edged elbows to to you know take what they can and uh the hopefully we get into this into the discussion but um maybe I'll I'll say one one more thing here which is uh the

in this idea that like the application layer is where we're going to see uh you know democratization um it's also important I think to track the ways in which healthare and finance

and education. The key sectors where we hear these big stories coming are also where some of these firms are moving really proactively and sometimes in stealth mode um to to to kind of uh

capture value not just um not just by playing in these markets but also in terms of how they're envisioning uh revenue share. So I the example I want to give is uh Sam Altman recently said

that his idea for how they make a return on these eye watering amounts of capital they're spending is uh you know actually buying equity stakes for example in any hospital that gains efficiency gains

using AI. Um and I think that's a good reminder that you know these firms aren't going to sit back and allow uh markets to prosper. They're going to do everything they can to I think both uh

get a share of and potentially cannibalize uh value downstream. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Thanks. Thanks uh Ama and thank you Mr. Peter. uh and that's where I think Shua comes in because Shua this is

we are very happy with what our startups are doing the applications which are coming out of the startups but the foundational layer again as I said in a smartphone AI would be the operating

system which is again controlled by a handful of players that's one so therefore the old issues of default search engine may now translate into a default chatbot uh self-referencing time

bundling etc. And the monetization question which has been raised by AMBA is that the app developers in the again sitting on these play stores were paying or expected to pay a hefty fee of 30% of

each and every monetary transaction. How do the startups then see their relationship with these big technology companies when they are doing the applications and is it a synergetic

relationship or is there some bit of expropriation? Thank you pile. A topic very very close to my heart and I can tell you that I wear many hats when I sit here. Of course uh we run the

startup policy forum which is an industry platform as the name suggests to do policy advocacy for startups and it was set up a little over a year ago with the idea of and holding the Indian

startup ecosystem on multiple platforms. And the reason why we decided to keep the term policy in our name is that we should not lose scope of the fact that that is what is what what is our main

icky guy. It's our main mission that we always want to be seen as as the voice of India's new economy and startups. But I think life has got complicated a lot in the last uh last year or so. Firstly,

a lot of people ask us who is a startup, right? I mean when we use the word startup people people have very different notions and it has become a catch-all phrase especially at a time

when you know you have a country like India where the head of the state prime minister Narendra Modi himself is such a champion of the startup ecosystem his startup India plank and the success

around it has led everyone to be want to be associated with the startup ecosystem at the same time our membership for instance does consist of decacons you know listed companies so are they really

startups and that brings me to the point of our new economy both in India as well as around the world is changing and that flows a lot into this whole competition debate. I think things are changing

faster than what we can even anticipate and that is leading to definitions being blurred and I also come from someone who's worked with big tech having worked with Uber, Salesforce, I understand how

big tech would would think um and I also having spent close to two decades in the media I also understand the significance of narratives and how those play out. So given what's going on I think first I

want to say that uh when when you talk competition the whole definition of who is suddenly a dominant player is changing quicker than you can imagine. If two years ago would open AI be

considered a dominant player and is it considered one today and if today Nvidia is investing in open AI how is that changing that landscape and how is that impacting a startup sitting here in

India. So the question I have is that while today regulators are grappling with how to manage concentration risks that are real and perhaps heightened in today's times because this is a

technology that is very capital intensive and plays out on the back of capital flowing in I mean you need the compute you need the infrastructure for innovation it's not one of those earlier

waves of of innovation ecosystem where you could just innovate without infra you need the infra and that itself means concentration risks have gone because how many people have access to capital

right and and capital will become a key determinant in this but I think what's also made this whole whole journey very very confusing and interesting is that the voices I'm hearing from startups are

more around collaboration than competition or concentration risk and that makes it very exciting because when I talk to some of the founders and I'm like are you worried about dominance are

you worried about these and they're like no hey can you get us a meeting with OpenAI, can you get me into the room with Nvidia? Can you get me into the room with Google? So, I'm hearing that a

lot more and that makes me realize the founders are like, you know what, let's embrace technology. Let's understand. So, when we took a delegation of founders to uh to the valley and to and

to uh DC and New York recently, I mean, just the palpable excitement of the Indian startup ecosystem to embrace what's going on in the world is right now so high that I don't even think

these conversations have started filtering down to their level yet. And I know I I'll hand it back to you to say uh of course during the discussion we would like to talk about how we need

those scapes in place and it's on the regulators today more than the innovators to put those safeguards in place because you know what innovators are just excited right now. We're all

like little kids who are very excited. We have a new toy to play with. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So a quick rebuttal because I want to get &gt;&gt; cushioned a bit fun. Yeah, I just I

think the two things I want to say to that point on on startups uh sort of approaching this with collaboration. One is that last year 75% of total startup funding came from three companies

Google, Microsoft and Amazon who also happen to be the hyperscalers that control the infrastructure in this market. And not not just that I think what we're hearing both in the

enterprise and consumer space again a very familiar story to all of you that have been in this space for a long time is that the pathway to success for startups often does look like getting

acquired by one of these same companies. So I guess I just want to put a a kind of a pinch of salt or a sobering note to why the startup community might not be be looking uh to to you know file the

the latest. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And just to add to the what she's saying partnerships are now being looked at closely even by competition authorities because these partnerships

don't come without strings attached uh when it comes to data when it comes to bundling when it comes to and again the own playbook. Kush I want to get you in now because you have to what extent you

think the Indian challenges are there in the other parts of the world but more importantly India has now taken another path that is combined industrial policy with competition policy where India is

wants its startups to uh uh get some agency and so therefore when it comes to compute infrastructure data infrastructure talking about openness so how is openness then an alternative and

And I will also uh move to sovereignity issue in in this discussion because sovereignity does not necessarily mean ownership but sovereignity would mean some kind of an agency and how do you

think then openness does is is that a good way to start to give some agency to the application layer. &gt;&gt; Yeah, thank you. So I I am here representing Mozilla which is the you

know best known for the open source browser Firefox right and we touched on on cloud we touched on compute what we haven't and we touched a little bit on the on the application layer but what

really matters and often isn't discussed in the conversation is the lower part of the supply chain distribution right where you're talking operating systems we're talking browsers we're talking

search engines we're talking apps right that's the part that really hits consumers and where is that world today where has it been for the last two decades? The answer is that those

markets have already tipped, right? So, we're not playing on a level playing field and so this foundation, this uh AI house is being built on wonky foundations already. So, what can we

expect is obviously a wonky house, right? That's how I look at it. And that's what we see every day in the markets that we compete in, especially in the browser space and in operating

systems. And the reason that that's often missed is because it's the part that impacts consumers. And I think if we put people and consumers kind of back at the forefront of our conversation,

then we will get to this answer. We will come back to this and we'll think about innovation in a way that really impacts people. You you asked about about sovereignty as well. So I might just

skip ahead a little bit and and and talk about that um just just very quickly because I think one of the things that that that really occurs to me in this space is that we're competing and and

innovating and startups are competing and innovating but how much of that innovation is really disruptive right how much of it comes from outside the market and really changes the paradigm

and from what I can see you know that there is great startups doing great work there is a lot of dynamism but I'm not sure that that true innovation really exists and you Union ministers in India

have said it. Um, you know, some of the data says it as well. And so, of course, a lot of these companies uh are seeking to collaborate um and in some cases compete, but the playing field is

already tilted. And so, trying to compete is is very very difficult and what we need is is real action in this space. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, I just want to push a little

bit more on the idea of sovereignity because I've been working now as as a researcher on that issue. Of course uh uh India's role of bringing in sovereignity through the digital public

infrastructure route is now uh going to the global south. uh digital public infrastructure is one way to uh uh en if you to remove yourself from these dependencies and especially digital

public infrastructure in the use cases in AI are leading to greater adoption in say agriculture, education, uh health tech etc. But again there we are back to still certain dependencies and how are

these dependencies blamed? So Kush has mentioned about being dependent on for distribution. Mr. Peter mentioned about vertical integration that and AMA also said don't don't be too surprised that

these partnerships lead to a situation where the so-called very widely open app field then gets also captured by some of these companies. uh my I again coming to the sovereignity issue. We may be

sovereign in certain aspects giving bringing out the solutions based on vernacular languages contextual etc. But still there is dependencies on the private cloud and AI infrastructure. And

there is uh a paper which I recently read which was very interesting sovereignity as a service where these large companies are offering these services for sovereignity in a defined

space. So uh uh Ama if I start with you again on this round about is this about first about openness is there some open washing going on when it comes to openness by the big tech companies and

secondly how should sovereignity be interpreted. &gt;&gt; Yeah look I'm a uh I think openness and open weighted models just to take a a narrow example of what openness could

mean I think should be a flaw. It's a it's a no-brainer and and there are baseline reusability and democratization if you want to call it that effects that come from that. But I also think that

often the the frame of opensource AI is sort of brandished as a silver bullet to obscure the much deeper dependencies that we've all talked about whether those are at the distribution layer or

at the infrastructural layer. So I guess like my one sentence TLDDR on on this is yes openness is the floor but also like don't let it become the thing that makes you look away from from these more

structural dependencies. But I think one of the uh interesting things I've been sitting with at this intersection of open source or open weighted models and sovereignity um actually came from uh

President uh Trump's uh AI uh ex export AI order which is maybe uh some of you have heard of it maybe not. I think it's really interesting because through that particular policy and the discussions

that have happened around it uh sort of straight from the horse's mouth what is being uh you know what we're being told is that open weighted models and open- source AI could just as well be a a tool

for reinforcing and spreading US hedgemony. Uh and so I want to put that out there as a provocation and explain that a little bit. So what does this export order say? It says that open

weighted models are is is a should be supported as the policy of the United States because we want to make sure that you know companies but really much more importantly governments everywhere are

building on a US stack and it makes it much easier to build on a US stack if uh these are I mean it's the meta open source business strategy right but now now take it to the US government. Um, so

I think that's I I want to I want to uh flag that because it's interesting to see the US put its diplomatic and financial muscle. What is contemplated under this executive order is that the

US government might be actually giving loans to to other countries, third party countries to procure the American AI stack. Um, yeah, &gt;&gt; stop you there because I want to bring

in Mr. Peter. Uh, how is India doing? because uh India's is following industrial policy uh heavily when it comes to AI by bringing in sovereign compute access to data sets. Um but do

you think is it sufficient or so can we do with an industrial policy? By the way, industrial policy used to be a cuss word when it came to competition policy because they were thought to be

antithetical to each other. But now industrial policy instrument is being used to bring in some bit of competition so that uh uh users in India at least have access to these uh resources

without the hedgemony of of of the large companies. Do you think India is doing sufficient? We have competing interests. Why should we be spending so much of money on AI uh or or more needs to be

done? &gt;&gt; Thank you. Actually, it's a very complex issue having sovereignty at the same time, having the liberty

have the consumers uh have access to uh services. At the same time, the most important thing is creating domestic talent and also promoting domestic investment

and innovation. These are all mixed up. We know for for uh for certain that the large firms which are operating in the country basically from the United States

they are they have spread their wings all over large number of consumers I think they are relying on that at the same time India being a country fourth the largest

economy in the world an aspirational nation. It cannot afford to depend on the uh foreign uh sort of uh the dominant firms forever.

So we have to do the our country has to do the balancing and where is the issue because sovereignty is important in not just in the sense of other products

here their interference is possible in different ways in the election process there have been reports different time different uh countries

in the case of also the the the confidential secret information of the country can be uh accessed. So a number of issues are involved. At the same time there is a social purpose

because if the country's uh uh 1 billion population is having access to uh the services of for example Google that is having some positive effect. Now what is uh government policy regarding

industrial policy versus competition policy? That is the issue you have posed. So we have to we cannot compare ourselves with European Union where they are more concerned about the consumer

interest. Even in United States we have seen in the recent past maybe four, five, six years consumer interest, consumers protection against the uh power of u digital giants efforts

are being made. In our case the issue is that we have to also develop simultaneously the capability within the country. I have seen that our minister who

himself is an expert in this area is stating that we will be we will be sort of uh showcasing some uh uh extraordinary

uh developments in the Indian space by Indian companies. I'm looking forward to that. What is what are we missing here? The most important thing is that we have talents but only in name.

substantiate the core of the talent the cream they just go out and the talent we are not able to while China was able to attract back they used to send hundreds of thousands of

engineers to United States at the cost of the government the conditions that they will come back they have been coming back in our case they don't come back what is the reason

industrial policy We cannot reduce it to industry policy versus competition policy. The the ecosystem has to has to change drastically. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So I just uh would like to stop

you there because uh again coming back to the compulsions there's always a binary made between the fact that we need investments. India need investments and loads of it and big companies are

investing a lot in this AI technology. So does that mean when there is investment we lose control on our laws or both can happen? India is a large country. India provides a huge huge

market but the laws of the land can still operate. So uh uh what is the investment uh handholding of these companies because as you mentioned uh does it then feeble us to impose and to

implement our laws just two minutes because I want to get to the next &gt;&gt; I I'll very quickly tell you what the government of India's thinking is around this and it was a very specific question

I had posed to secretary Krishnan a few months ago when we were seeing we were hearing confusing messages coming from the government right on one hand there was a very clear uh you know a little

bit Swadeshi message saying oh you know what Ashwini Vashna Minister Ashwini Vashna was saying I'm going to use only Zoho on the other hand we saw the top brass of the of the ministry uh at the

Google Visag $20 billion announcement uh there so I think when we tried to understand the government's very clear and the answer that I got very clearly from secretary Krishnan was we're going

to do both we will do everything it takes to build up our own infrastructure our own AI infrastructure to get the get the compute ready to support our and you know we've seen the fruits of that

everyone seemed to have dismissed India when it came to frontier models uh there was you know India has missed the bus oh India is too late and now today see the excitement around Saram and that's the

launch that is happening two days from now and and and that frontier model today many global experts are saying is is perhaps way better than some of the best that we've seen built so far at the

same time I think the message coming out both from the industry and the government is India is going to do AI the India way and that will not be the US way it will not be the China way

because you know what if LLMs don't work for us and small wles work for us we will go the small waddle way if it's all about voice AI then India will be the voice AI market if it's going to be all

about vernacular languages as well as uh you know the indic languages and building on Indian data sets that bring you models that are more suited to Indian audiences then that's what you're

going to get out of India &gt;&gt; right so let let us let us take what is saying So uh she says basically we'll do both. We'll build strategic capacity but and the government has made it clear and

is bringing means there are signs of it that we'll not lose our autonomy when it comes to enforcing laws enforcing contestability be it competition law and other governance instruments. So this

brings me to the next section and Kush I would want you to uh intervene because of your experiences elsewhere. What are the remedies? Because now the technology is uh uh evolving. Do we want to be in

the same place as in the previous cycle that wait till the harm occurs? Because that's that's the refrain which which new technologies uh and technology developers give that don't do anything

right now. It's too early and it'll harm innovation. Are there trade-offs or are are we have many lessons and we know it all and we should bring in new instruments and new remedies to address

this issue of comp competition? &gt;&gt; Thank you. Uh so just to pick up on on on Sha's last point, there was an interesting speech by Mark Carney which was picked up at the World Economic

Forum a few weeks ago, right? And he said that if you're not at the table, you're on the menu. And yeah, &gt;&gt; I want to push back on that because I don't think you want to sit at that

table, right? Like I think what you're saying is India's way and the way of of countries um you know in the global majority can be to build their own tables right not to to be forced to sit

at a different table and so I think I think that's the right way to look at it and I think that's the way that that you were describing but it kind of occurred to me when I was when I was thinking

about that that speech that he made because I've seen that phrase bandied about a lot in the context of this um uh of this summit as well and so to come to kind of the solutions

It's funny. This morning I I I was really scared I was going to um be jetlagged, wake up at 11:00 and miss this session alto together, right? And if you think about expost competition

enforcement, that's effectively what's happened, right? It's woken up. It's woken up way too late and digital markets have already tipped as we said earlier. And often what you find is that

you know the solutions are too late, remedies are too late, the companies that they're trying to um protect or to or or to you know remediate the harm has already occurred and the companies have

already exited the market. Innovation is already lost. And so in my view what's needed is exanti regulation in this space. Competition policy and industrial policy are clearly now, you know, two

sides of the same coin. They they achieve the same objective from from different angles. And we've seen this play out a little bit in in Europe in the context of things like the digital

markets act. And now I'm not saying that India needs exactly the digital markets act. What India needs is a law that works for India. But that allows the CCI and allows the courts and regulators to

come in um you know proportionately quickly and to provide solutions that avoid what we've seen for the last 20 years which is often waking up too late and missing the whole show. Right. Um so

so I think that's really what what we're after and that's really what urgently is needed not just in India actually but in other countries as well. It should be flexible. It should be proportionate and

forward-looking so that it can add new uh products to the to the regulation quickly. Um and so that it can react to what's happening in the market. It doesn't have to be heavy-handed but it

has to be quick. So, so let me get I'll get but Amba quickly what is the one thing as a legal instrument for competition if not a full-fledged cut copy paste of the DMA which a country

like India could do with to at least open up the system I'll say the one thing which is also the maybe in the the list of the boldest thing uh that we could do in terms of excante

interventions I think is uh some structural separations that get at the infrastructure layer. So if you're playing in the in the cloud market, you can't be playing in every other point or

any other point in the AI stack. Uh and I just want to say one other thing on this idea of strategic capacity and how we do it. I there's a really interesting quote from uh that has been coming up in

the context of the death of you know US aid and other development institutions which is that I think finally the the US realized that you know if the development mission actually succeeds

then it becomes quite threatening to the US to US hedgemony generally and I think the same is true for AI. There's this is going to be uh a fight and I think there is it is there is a lot of lessons to be

learned in the ways in which big tech companies I I'll name Microsoft because it's the example at the top of my head when the UKCMA was making moves. I won't even say say they were big moves but

they were you know [clears throat] opening market studies and asking questions about the AI market was just the moment when they announced extremely large investments into the UK uh

sovereign cloud uh mission. Right. And so I think that in both uh subtle and pretty unsuttle ways um the there's uh every interest in the world for uh big tech to to make uh sovereignity as you

said a a service yes you wanted to inter &gt;&gt; yeah no I I think just to add to that point uh and perhaps to what Kush was saying I think the thinking within the government right now is that anything

that is seen remotely as being more heavy-handed and anything which comes in the realm of a competition or exante would be in that definition. At the same time, I think the government's grappling

with the fact that things are changing too quickly. And the one thing we saw was for instance around deep fakes that came out just a few weeks ago, a few days ago with very short timeline

implementation around AI and copyright competition is top of their mind. The government is very clear. I mean, of course, there were the same noises when GDPR was there that oh India needs its

version of GDPR and we took our own sweet time of 10 years to come up with our own DPDP rules. I think the government's not going to emulate any one uh act or regulation. That is very

very clear in the mind of Indian policy makers. We're not going to go down the Europe route. We're not going to go down the US route. It will be regulation suited to India. And once they've

evaluated every single piece of legislation that currently exists in India, including the new data privacy uh rules uh the data privacy act as well as what exists, the sense is that it's and

the competition act. The sense is that right now it is sufficient to cover for potential harm as you mentioned and as and when there will be cases where they feel the harm is exceeding uh they will

bring in the smaller pieces of these notifications and regulations but I don't see an overarching change coming. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So Mr. Peter your view being you have worked at the competition

commission as a member do you think legislative tools are important or uh we getting tinker with the current law there measures available section 33 is available so so uh uh what is your view

on that &gt;&gt; no my feeling is that uh we have to strengthen CCI expose we have to speed that up &gt;&gt; actually there is an effort to build a

uh sort of AI team in CCI why don't why is the delay it has to be expedated that is one second [clears throat] I have an apprehension which many of us have of India having an expo system we have the

story of what the history of competition competition where there is a tendency to deteriorate into a mechanism where everything is stalled so I I think uh the the issue is

uh that for the time being no yes a specific issue has been stated specific uh issue and issues when they arise it can be addressed for the time being otherwise CCA has to be so if I because

Japan did it it did it with one instrument uh regarding the uh operating systems as a software operating system they brought out one law one uh to open up That's so so what is an alternate

scan? So India also do so that's why I said what is this one thing which can be brought up to one leg instrumental full-fledged

uh set of rules. So let me answer that question because the question is what is the outcome you're trying to achieve right and then work backwards from there. This is what we want. We want

interoperability right at every layer of the stack. We want uh open source encouragement of open source solutions. Again, every layer of stack. We want want open standards. We want user

choice, right? That's really really important. Don't forget people again like what is the best tool to achieve that I would love to hear how is able to achieve that. I would love to hear how

how we can actually do that in digital markets in an AI given speed that's moving. And if that solution exists, then they bring it to me. In my view, a sort of a narrow flexible proportionate

bit of regulation is really what will have that impact. Um, we've seen otherwise that you know courts and regulators will not be able to move quickly enough in the current framework

otherwise. So a narrow set will have that impact. a narrow proportionate uh expanded set of rules uh would be the way India could go uh rather than having uh across digital services across

markets but the principles of openness interoperability because I think interoperability is the key because open and openness where open datas open infrastructure uh talked about open uh

even the models not just opening but exactly what needs to be open such that they can be used properly by and innovated upon by the startups. So some some kinds of u uh uh consensus that

part of the table is is arising and if I I know we are short of time a quick question from the audience one or two questions otherwise yes and please introduce yourself.

Hi, my name is Baba. I'm founder of um I'm just wondering about why we discussing models when open AI and Gemini have already platformized and they're giving free services in India.

Why are we discussing models when Google search and AI more crawlers are exactly the same and there's no separation between them when WhatsApp is preventing external AI bots from coming is from

delivering services on the WhatsApp platform uh that competition debate is getting addressed by the market you know already and we still discussing models [laughter]

you go to &gt;&gt; example of why I think we need early intervention, right? Slowly we're seeing how the AI overview.

&gt;&gt; Oh, so I guess his point I guess we can all agree that it's already late. &gt;&gt; So he's saying the markets have tipped. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. The mark I mean the markets have tipped and and to be honest I I

don't disagree. I think that some truthtelling about where we are in this cycle is in is in order. I do think that market signals matter. As someone full disclosure that was part of the FTC

during uh Chair Khan's administration, I can tell you that market signals even when they were in sort of adjacent markets do change the atmosphere around certain killer acquisitions and whether

they are contemplated and how they are uh pursued. So I guess in the spirit of trying to do nothing versus trying to do something versus nothing, I think acting soon in in ways to uh for example, why

is AI overviews how is how are we sort of letting Google get away with renegotiating that bargain in real time and sort of you know seamlessly transitioning their search

of the &gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean as a default it's the same story. &gt;&gt; There's a whole long list I guess of low lowhanging fruit. Um, and probably

neither one of those things will on their own do much, but I think at least they will send a signal to the market that someone is watching. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Somehow, so therefore, I am a

little I'm a fan of the Japanese law. At least they brought in one law for something very targeted and at least do something rather than doing nothing. Uh, uh, yeah, one last round uh, of one one

thing which you would I guess it's a it's a it is a trick question. One piece of advice, Mr. Peter we'll starting with you the most senior person on this panel one piece of advice you would like to

give you have given about the uh strengthening CCI but in competition matters what should the policy maker look at or or do nothing and wait again &gt;&gt; I would suggest that there should be a

competition policy because um see there are number of gaps there have been committees set up Mr. Vinodal he is sitting here and later also but it has not been acted upon. I think what that

will serve a very important purpose by having a competition policy in place that will serve the purpose. Yeah, I want to actually quickly respond to Nikl because I know his positions on

most issues and a big fan of mediaama, but I just want to say that while I know he's being almost sarcastic by being fatalistic, uh I I also think it's about embracing

the reality and as Ambass said it is true uh the markets have tipped. So I think and that's that is exactly what I was referring to when I talked about founders because from a conversation of

oh like is big tech dominating oh are we seeing to now saying you know what let's get a piece of the pie you know so already that conversation has shifted but I also want to put bring in a caveat

because I may have sounded like I'm I'm in that camp I think that's when the role of all of us comes in because it's my job as much to speak to founders and say you know what this is great I'm

supporting you let's keep going on that path but you know what watch out remember this happened because if all of us don't do that then we're not doing the right service for our communities in

saying and and in in highlighting some of the dangers of where we're going. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So on that sober note uh that we have a responsibility as a community as well. So laws will will happen laws will

take their own time. Uh the competition commission in its current form will do what it does. Uh uh takes and all over the world take about three to four months before a case gets open. Six to

seven months before it gets investigated. Another 10 uh eight more months till the final order comes. Then an appeal process which takes another four to five months and then goes to the

Supreme Court and sits there. the first DFA case which happened in uh the order was out I think if I'm not mistaken in 2012 and we are in 2026 the final order is not yet out and this is DF this is

non-digital okay so on that server note let us take some responsibility as consumers also and perhaps I guess these optics also work that the government is now saying we will use Zoho uh little

bits small little efforts on each one of us and at least I think there is a lack of awareness what's happening because as Nicholas pointed out consumers are very happy and consumers so many of them are

very happy because the and therefore regulation which is a becomes a public good because the larger ramifications on economy state and society which will take time to manifest themselves uh need

to be understood by the governments need to be understood by the policy maker and therefore proper instruments legal non-legal guidelines soft law. All instruments need to be in place in order

to get an ecosystem which promotes innovation of and my concern is our startup community so that they move up the value chain not just in consumer tech but in deep tech innovation. Thank

you very much.
