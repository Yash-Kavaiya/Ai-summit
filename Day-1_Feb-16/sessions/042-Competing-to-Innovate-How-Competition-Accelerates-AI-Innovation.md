## 📝 Summary

AI risks being shaped by a concentrated few, leaving the Global South as consumers rather than co-creators. When data, compute, foundational models, and distribution are controlled by a handful of corporations, innovation suffers. A competitive, open source AI stack, built on affordable compute, local cloud options, and locally trained models, is essential to fostering innovation. This panel explores AI resource distribution, barriers facing Global South innovators, and remedies through openness, competition, and South–South cooperation.
