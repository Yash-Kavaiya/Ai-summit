## 📝 Transcript

a little bit what is going to be the financial structure that we can put in place taking into account the amount of money that is required for this and keep keeping in mind that it is going to be a

public and a private h involvement required to make sure that we have a quantum leap in in the usage and adoption of AI across the different sectors

eventually you know When when we were precisely thinking about the strategy uh of digital transformation within the Asian development bank, we were precisely thinking about different

layers. We were thinking about a layer associated to the fundamentals where we are thinking about the digital and the data infrastructure but also we were considering how cyber security how

critical infrastructure and information protection needs to be brought into the discussion and just in those uh two specific activities related to the first layer there is a financial decision that

we need to consider. The second layer is precisely related to the accelerators and we are these days in India which is one of the leading countries in terms of DPI. So I guess that the combination of

AI and DPI is also something that it may be worthy to discuss to make sure that we can incorporate this into the last but not least precisely the use cases. So from early warning systems to

capactor to how to make sure that we are taking advantage of the digitalization of energy, transport, social services. At the end of the day, AI needs to be considered because as I said at the very

beginning, you know, the computing power but also the algorithm is going to define and the level of success. So let me just conclude this opening

remarks. welcoming you to this particular session that I understand is going to be very dynamic with h different colleagues from the bank but also

representatives from the government that are going to precisely present concrete use cases taking into account the you know the role that the ADB is playing as a strategic partner in

supporting government decisions to move forward. Thank you very much Paul and over to you. [applause] &gt;&gt; Thank you Antonio.

Next up is someone who will talk about what Antonio just mentioned in terms of what the government should be thinking about building these shared foundations and different approaches of PPP or

whether government provides for compute or government act as a regulator and facilitator. So while we're all here and seeing the India AI summit but there is also an India mission which has done the

hard work of setting up the India AI strategy and policies as well as provisioning of compute etc. So I call upon Kushal to explain what the India AI vision is.

&gt;&gt; Thanks. Uh I think before I begin uh want to express uh our gratitude on behalf of government of India to the Asian Development Bank uh for curating this session today uh and to all the

dignities present. Uh as Rul said my presentation today is going to focus on how India went about building AI ready digital foundations. uh when we started uh just a little less

than 2 years ago uh we had about 10,000 crores which is $1.2 billion uh to start our national program on artificial intelligence uh and the idea was in a country that is as large as ours how do

we take this amount of financing and ensure that we are able to democratize uh both access to artificial intelligence as well as its benefits. So how do we ensure that every innovator in

the country has an opportunity to create a competitive AI solution uh as well as every citizen uh to be able to benefit uh from that set AI uh solution. Uh so before we get into a digital foundations

uh of course a lot of you here already would know that India started its digital public infrastructure journey uh much before it's been more than 10 years uh since uh we've been trying to build

digital public infrastructure in India. uh and now that it has been some time since the digital India corporation has been functioning with this mission uh we are able to see that digital public

infrastructure there is enough evidence to indicate that it helps transform public service delivery systems uh and ensure uh access to services for citizens. Uh

we typically look at uh foundational digital public infrastructure as uh data, payments uh and identity uh essentially uh elements that allow in an economy for individuals and entities to

transact digitally. So you need an identity proof for that, a digital identity proof for that. You need a payment system that is robust and you need flow of information to be [snorts]

streamlined. uh therefore the data empowerment uh element and over here we have of course these numbers uh in terms of uh scale that India's little public infrastructure ecosystem has reached uh

we have I think the most robust and uh largest uh payment system uh both in terms of monthly transaction value as well as overall value of payments uh that includes about 21.7 billion monthly

transactions and 290 billion uh in terms of value of payments monthly uh there is an uh application called digil locker uh it is essentially India's digital locker system for verified credentials and

documents uh today it has about uh 660 million users and is issuing about 9.5 billion documents and these are all verified uh so it eventually plugs into public service delivery systems uh so

for example If you to verify a driving license copy, a digital copy of a driving license in India, we have that system through uh through dig locker as an application.

And of course, much has been said about Aadhaar as well, which is India's digital identity system. In terms of its coverage today, it covers more than 99.5% of our population. And again it's

been plugged into public service delivery from an authentication point of view to enable direct benefits uh transfer which is leading to about 42 billion in savings as we speak today. Uh

so there there has been a long journey uh for uh a developing country like India in terms of first building its basic digital public infrastructure and from there why it is important to look

beyond and focus in art on artificial intelligence particularly for the global south and developing countries is because AI and emerging technologies are redefining work and productivity. uh we

are already seeing a lot of change in terms of future of work in terms of what a typical uh workforce readiness looks like and all of this disproportionately impacts the global south. There is also

uh potential in terms of enhancing governance and public service delivery. uh and we feel that if we are able to integrate uh digital public infrastructure and artificial

intelligence uh this can allow developing countries to leap from traditional development challenges and traditional development cycles. uh

key drivers of AI innovation. Uh so just like we saw that in terms of the overall digital ecosystem, you need uh identity payments and systems in terms of the AI innovation ecosystem that translates to

having access and affordability to AI compute uh data sets, models and talent. uh and recognizing this uh we designed the national program on AI or the India emission uh when we were looking at

building the AI innovation ecosystem in the country and access to these resources is not just critical from a country perspective uh but even globally to bridge the AI divide. It is important

that we work uh domestically as well as internationally towards making sure that these resources uh are accessible and affordable to all. Uh and around them you do need to have uh basic enablers

such as regulatory clarity, access to patient capital uh and I think those are also some things that we'll touch upon later in the uh panel discussion today. uh coming through finally the India

emission uh recognizing all of this uh the India mission which is essentially a 5-year program with a budget outlay of about 1.2 to begin uh how that is structured is it has seven pillars. Uh

again looking at building seven basic AI ready digital foundations. So the India compute capacity is focusing on ensuring that there is access to AI compute. Uh the foundation models pillar is looking

at building indigenous foundation models which are contextualized to our social, linguistic, cultural diversity and is ensuring that AI applications uh are as effective in India as they would be in a

predominantly English speaking population. Uh the AI kosh is the access layer of the entire mission. Uh so uh kosh essentially means repository and it is a repository of data sets models and

now we put a development layer on top as well by providing it access to the compute pillar. Uh so as an innovator you can come on to this platform. It is a lot similar to hunting face where you

have everything that you need to build a model right there and there from the development environment to the tools and libraries to the models and data sets that are required.

The application development initiative is where we are focusing on the end loop. Uh where we are actually focusing on ensuring that all of this is used for AI for good solutions. Uh we've followed

a very diverse model here in terms of what the role of the state should be when it comes to innovation. We've tried to ensure that across the India mission we are more focusing on the foundational

pillars and not going too much into the use case side which is where the private sector is supposed to innovate. Uh where we do come in is uh there are a lot of challenges which may not have immediate

commercial viability. Uh so we source problem statements from various ministries uh and agencies within government of India where they think that AI can act as a disruptor but there

is not immediate commercial viability and then those problem statements are thrown to the AI innovation ecosystem in India through hackathons innovation challenges

uh and we are looking at sourcing solutions uh from there. So a good example of this would be uh we have a lot of uh cases emerging of cyber crime in India. Uh and

there is one uh digital database that we maintain uh the national cyber crime database which is very sensitive and it is not easy to provide access to innovators to that database to be able

to look at AI based interventions there. Uh so we created a synthetic dummy version of that database. Opened a hackathon uh that was open to all innovators in the country. Uh move from

one stage to a stage where we could short list 20 innovators, get them on premise uh uh within a secured environment and get them to innovate on something that looks a lot closer to the

actual database. Today uh the ministry of home affairs in India is looking at potentially utilizing that solution. Uh the future skills pillar is focusing on essentially ensuring that the next uh

wave of workforce in India is AI ready. Here again what we're doing largely is how do we ensure that the jobs which are supposed to be which are presumed to be disrupted the first which is technical

jobs in terms of your plumbers, mechanics etc. They're all trained in India in industrial training institutions. There are technical education infrastructure. So how can we

go into tier 2 and tier three cities in India and transform these technical education infrastructure institutions and set up data and AI labs there. Uh so that is something that we're doing

there. Uh safe and trusted AI pillar is looking at India's technology enabled approach to governance. It is essentially looking at creating tools benchmarks and using the technology in

itself uh to govern AI. uh most important to ensure that we're not looking at governance of AI in a way that puts a disproportionate burden on our already stressed bureaucracy. So how

do we have technical interventions there as well to streamline governance and the startup financing pillar is providing patient capital again to AI startups where there may not be immediate

commercial viability. How all of this looks like uh in terms of ensuring development of AI for citizens is that you start with curating these data sets which would be most

relevant for AI to good uh solutions. So health data sets, weather data sets etc. That is what the AI coach pillar is doing. Then you have your models work on top of that which are again indigenous

and contextualized. that is what the foundation model splitter is doing and then finally we use that and the compute to build these solutions. uh my last flight uh as I said in the beginning uh

it's been just a little less than two years uh and the India mission has been able to do all of its targets with I think I have not had the time to go through uh this it would be about oneth

of the amount that we had NSR uh for example we had thought that we we used the computer pillar to provide access to 10,000 GQ when this mission had gone live at that time India's most

prominent AI comput infrastructure was about 438 GPUs uh and we're talking just about one one one and a half two years back uh in this short span of time we've gone from that

438 GPUs uh to about 38,000 GPUs uh and it's not 38,000 GPUs that government of India has procured all on its own money it's through public private partnership it's through uh demand aggregation it is

through price discovery. It is through transparency. Um and that could be a separate session in itself in terms of how how there could be various models to enable uh democratization

of compute that does not uh sort of require building these monolith compute facilities all funded by by the government in itself. Uh so 38,000 GPUs we have about 10,000 data sets, 250

models. There are 12 uh AI startup companies that are focusing on building indigenous foundation models. Uh across panels uh this week you hear a lot about the work that they're doing. Uh and

we've set up 30 of those data and AI labs. We planning to set up about 270. Uh so yes with that looking forward to the uh discussion today. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you Pashal. It's great to hear

what India has [clears throat] been doing and the progress of the mission. Now over to my colleague Carolyn to hear what is happening in the broader APAC region as to what our other DMC partners

are doing. &gt;&gt; Excellent. Thank you so much Rachel. Um and good morning I think morning. &gt;&gt; Oh no it is afternoon. The day is flying by. Um good afternoon everyone. My name

is Carolyn Flory. I'm a digital development specialist with the Asian Development Bank. um and very excited for this panel today and I think that we've had the best introduction that we

can to um the foundation's building AI ready infrastructure and so we've heard from one country's perspective which is incredibly impressive um and really we're going to take a bit of a step back

um so we've heard from one um and now we're going to look at some of the aspects of um of building the digital foundations and really looking at it from three maybe tension points So one

around readiness, what does that mean and what does it take? The second around financing and then the third will be looking at coordination and so I have a series of questions for uh from my

colleagues on the the stage. Hopefully we'll have time for some questions from the audience but we'll see how I do with with time management. Um so I'll ask my colleagues um when I ask a question if

you could also introduce yourselves um to the audience as well. So my uncle I'm actually going to start with you. Um uh so first you know we we've heard one perspective and we recognize that there

are massive investments happening in um in the west and so from your perspective as someone that focuses on private sector development um at the Asian Development Bank what does it really

take to make a country's digital foundations AI ready? uh where do you see some of the biggest gaps and opportunities in Asia-Pacific? Over to you.

&gt;&gt; Good afternoon everyone. My name is M Chri. I'm uh director for infrastructure financing for the private sector for South Central and West Asia. Uh so I'll start. So first of all I bit

of more of an introduction. I'm an infrastructure financing professional. I'm not a technology financing professional. So but it's important for us to understand what is happening in

this AI space is a lot to do with enabling infrastructure. So when we talk about infrastructure in our developing member countries, we also talk about the role governments play, the regulatory

environment, the the risk allocation on a public private partnership basis, the ability to to structure uh contractual arrangements with the private sector in a in a fair and transparent manner and

and so when we come to this specific question on AI readiness in in mostly developing member countries, we have to look at from the country's perspective. Of course, they want the best-in-class

infrastructure. They want the best available uh uh environment for their innovators and their uh young people to to create new new applications. But but they also have to have resource

constraint. Where do they spend this money on healthare, education, providing roads, uh clean water, sewage treatment? So you know you know so so they have to prioritize and and to create this

infrastructure certainly living environment is absolutely right. You have to have reliable power supply. You have to have water. You have to have availability of land

to [snorts] create these data centers. And then you start talking about data sets and and compute capacity and and and models, right? So first and that's where the role ADB plays, that's where

we come in, right? We support these governments to put in place this enabling infrastructure. So uh we have been doing that by way of provision of let's say data uh capacity to the

country supporting telecom networks expansion uh data center creation. Now going forward I think there is a role for us to play in in creating compute capacities and maybe not every country

needs to have its own compute capacity. You know you can actually have regional cooperation uh amongst uh neighbor neighboring countries and they can actually come together and create uh a

compute capacity. This also allows them to you know have a bargaining power in terms of access to chips and and and other other other infrastructure enablers. So that that is the

opportunity for us uh you know we need to to come together we need to create this uh situation where you can actually create this compute capacity infrastructure in terms of gaps. I would

say the most countries have actually not caught up with the pace at which this the the the the whole situation is unfolding. Uh between last year and now so many changes have happened. So I

think the first thing to do is to recognize that they need to step up alongside the changes you know so that then create an enabling environment regulatory framework for this to happen

and then of of course ADB will play a central role in in helping all of the governments come together. I'm happy to elaborate but I I think we'll run out of time so I'll stop here. Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Thank you so much Mike. Yes, definitely a topic that we can talk about for hours on on hour. So, but we'll come back to you. I think that's a great segue and I'm going to turn to Faruse um our

colleague from Tajikistan. really excited to hear about your country experience and also you know we've heard about the enabling environment from MAK and also the trade-offs that countries

have to make when you're thinking about digital foundations and also being AI ready as we see we're moving in this direction the the train has left the station so for you what does that look

like in terms of competing digital infrastructure investments and how do you prioritize basic digital foundations with more advanced AI investments Thank you Caroline. Uh hi everyone. My

name is Fus John. I'm representing the Jakistan. I serve as a deputy chair at AI council under the minister of industry and new technologies. So the jistan has a very unique case. Uh

basically when we started AI back in 2020s AI wasn't a big hype. So when we started we when we published an article that Tajjikistan is going to lead AI initiatives we had so many uh doubting

comments under the article saying that how come you are going to practice AI when no one in the world is thinking about it yet but what was our pitchan is very small 93% of the countries in

mountains so in terms of delivering uh tangible products we are not the best because it takes time it takes uh years to be drove somewhere and we don't have access to the sea. So when we saw AI AI

our pitch to the government was that like this is the way we are going to leap from our economy and this is the way how we going to foster our development. Why? Because the usual

developing country when it it develops it its industry in terms of production it goes to the middle trap where you cannot grow but AI creates a great opportunity. So what we have started

basically small academy like we had a first court of 50 uh students we got them we sent them to the banks after 2 months they come back sorry you are doing great job we are not practicing

anything you taught us then we thought about the startups why we can't make startup own startups so they can make products so after 3 years now so we have started the small use cases of academy

like credit scoring in finance now we have like around 10 companies some small come big but we are exporting products to like 25 countries AI products out of the jigistan most of the technical team

surprisingly from many uh of our partners also from the jigan now so uh it's creating a big puzzle for us so once we started AI there wasn't anything about AI compute data center now it's

becoming like major agenda and you know what we have another part of the puzzle is rich in uh hydro power green energy we We have solar potential and we are building the biggest dam in the world

right now. So now slowly our puzzle is being created into one where we have some talent where we have companies and where we have demand for the AI data centers and in terms of uh making steps

from small use cases to the bigger one. I think we have a really good example and as my colleague said like even though we have a great potential in building several data centers we cannot

handle all of it because there is not enough often just from the jigistan for all those data centers and where this concept of partnership in central Asia uh comes like one case uh I guess uh for

central Asia partnership central Asian countries were able to proceed with one of the very UN resolutions where It fosters partnerships for better uh partnership in Central Asia and gives an

specific case of developing countries where they can partner with each other as a both in talent development both in AI infrastructure [clears throat] and it was passed by the all the

countries uh within the UN. So now we are in a stage where we have passed like uh foundation which is important now we need to scale really big and we have like that ambitions and we have that

resources to do. I think uh over to you. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. Really appreciate it. Um and great to hear perspective and and how you're making that case in in Tajjikstan. I'm going to sorry for

shifting back and forth. I'm going to turn to um Aziz John Akramov from Usuzbekistan. Um and try and also get a Ministry of Finance um perspective. uh similar type of question really looking

at there again going to the trade-offs and how you're making that case internally um how do you as you're thinking about justifying long-term AI infrastructure investments when physical

space is constrained when there are [clears throat] trade-offs and what are some of the long-term projects that you're also focusing on in USPakistan &gt;&gt; thank you very much Caroline uh happy to

be here hi everyone thank you Uh I'm representing uh ministry of finance, ministry of economy, finance from uh I'm this is John Aramo. So uh I will give uh

some my views from a little bit different angle because I'm not I'm also not technic technical specialist but uh most years of my work experience have been in

banking and finance field. So uh I would say at first one thing uh finance is always tight you know from perspective of ministry of finance it is always tight but uh we uh uh if we want to

develop the economy and we we would like to move forward uh we should we must justify we must justify and I think uh there is no need uh to justify it now because the world time has already shown

the importance of modernization, digitalization and AI and and so on. So uh even when fiscal space is tight, investments in AI ready digital infrastructure must be viewed as

long-term economic and productivity investments. It must be viewed uh because first uh these investments uh improve fiscal outcomes. how better tax compliance uh

reduce fraud and more efficient uh public expenditure. Uh so we uh can take a view from that side uh public expenditure because this is one of the most uh part of the question.

We can earn a lot of money but we if we do not control the expenditure side uh our efforts are very not successful let's say. Secondly, they strengthen economic competitiveness by

enabling innovation, digital services and private sector growth as uh my counterpart um explained. Uh so we are both Central Asian countries and Usbakistan

double landlocked countries in the world. uh we in order to have access to the sea uh either we should go through Afghanistan then Pakistan then either through Afghanistan then Iran took so uh

a lot of questions there. Uh so is one of the two double land countries in the world. uh and we need to take right directions for our growth uh for regional growth as

well uh for central Asia. So uh and in this case regional cooperation is very important for us and uh we have got very similar situations in many cases. [clears throat]

And third, delaying foundational digital infrastructure typically uh costs more later. As I mentioned a little bit before uh if we do not start right now um we will

have to pay more a little bit even even not much later even after a year after a year because life is changing so fast uh today. Um so uh that's why insbakistan our

long-term priorities focus on uh building shared digital foundations, secure government cloud in infrastructure, trusted uh data exchange systems, digital public infrastructure

as such as digital identity and resilient connectivity. So specifically I can uh I can count with permission uh some of let's say one of our long-term

projects uh as our government now um doing uh Saudi company uh data wall is implementing a project to build 12 megawatt data center on the premise of

IT Park Usbakistan and Inashkin It is in Tashken in the capital city. Uh the project uh now it is valued 150 million US. Uh it is scheduled to completion by the end of this year 2026.

Uh this new facility will become the first data center in central Asia based on artificial intelligence techn technologies. It will receive receive the LED gold cification confirming its

compliance with international green standards and of course uh we hope it will strengthen position as a regional data hub. The center will have direct global

technology giants such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon and others. So uh by the way I would like just mention quickly that we have uh we have initiated the development of strategy

for semiconductors and electronics development towards this industry. Uh because this is one of the crucial points for the development of any country but not every country has the

capacities to enter the value chain. value chain global value chain of tech sphere uh and uh we have started this way and uh on the beginning of this way I would really

I would really would like to emphasize Asian development bank's help uh on our first stage thank you very much thank you and uh so uh we can talk along along like on this topic uh I think I

will pass We'll be ready to any questions. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. Um and it's been a real pleasure to partner um in Newsbakistan on the semiconductor

strategy, the IT park um with the digital sector office at the ADB. Um so last but not least uh of course so we've heard a lot about um you know the the readiness um and so I'm turning it over

to Adana to hear a little bit more about um the implementations that are happening in so excited um unfortunately haven't had the chance to visit quite yet um

although I think that's probably so cold right now but um but really excited to hear about how how you're thinking about moving from some of the pilots, you know, where there's a lot of

experimentation with artificial intelligence now and how you're really moving from AI pilots to AI integration into public services. Um, and what have been some of the most decisive changes

in the digital foundations or coordination that have allowed you to shift from, you know, testing out these prototypes to actually convincing key ministries to to back those changes.

So I done over to you. &gt;&gt; Thank you Caroline. Is it working? This is very important question uh because as you may know many countries do they have uh the air pallets but few

of them just managed to have the air in a large scale. Uh from Kazakhstan's experience the shift did not happen just in one. uh it happened when the digital

foundations of the government were strong enough uh so that AI can be u embedded in the the government digital government. So in that sense uh becoming AI ready uh is really about the

long-term investment in the system uh and not only investment in the AI itself. So I would like to highlight three big changes um that make the really big difference in our country in

Kazakhstan. Uh first is the uh um data should be usable across the institutions. AI do not work effectively in a fragmented uh information and um

or if the information is uh isolated in a separate uh system. Uh and one of the most important shift for us for kettle uh was building structured and government exchange.

&gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Second digital government infrastructure um had to become uh functioning as the national infrastructure. Uh just imagine if each ministry will be building uh

their own digital system uh independently separately it will be mess and um to scale the new technology including AI it will be very difficult and very slow. So uh in Kazakstan port

digital systems such as identity um integration layers service platforms are shared with most institutions and government agencies and that creates a stable environment for AI to be embedded

into existing platforms and to be developed further. Third one and this is the hardest one I would say um is the instit in institutional coordination.

Uh as you know uh AI deployment uh have many actors including the regulators um IT operators, service u agencies and um data owners and uh progress happens when they operate within the shared

standards and the government's arrangements and uh and it it really makes the impact in the real workplace &gt;&gt; and the responsibil clear in each level of the organization

and these were the main um structural changes in our country. For example, uh we are introducing AI in our um citizen service platform uh system. It's called um it's uh where the large volumes of

the public request need to be processed and analyzed uh &gt;&gt; and uh because services already operate uh digitally uh at scale and the data flows across the institution. AI can

help classify incoming requests, support the routing and process manage the processing uh efficiently and transparently so that the citizen get the help from the government easily.

So what matters here is not the specific tool um it is the environment that allows AI to be developed. And in terms of convincing key ministries um the turning point was the demonstration of

the actual operational value. uh when they saw the real impact the improvements uh the faster processing the less uh work uh manual workloads and so on

um support just come naturally and currently uh our interaction is just like became um to say uh like we just get used to it. So in Kazakhstan we are now seeing that

transition and u we are learning is that many countries are facing the similar moment and where the main challenge is not the experimentation of AI itself but the integration and that is where uh

shared learning and practical cooperation becomes um really important. Thank you so much. Really appreciate it and and it's amazing to see the journey that Kazakhstan has gone through and

really that that integration working across a number of ministries. Um so hopefully we'll get a chance to dig into that a little bit more. So we've had a series of questions around readiness. So

now we've explored the tradeoffs. We know the the difficult decisions that um that governments have to make. Mike, I'm going to turn back to you um to to take us into the financing side of things. So

would love for you to if you can speak to um what financing models or instruments um are you seeing that are most promising for AI infrastructure and how do you think development finance and

private capital can can work together in this space as well. That's a key question, right? I mean, uh, so, uh, that's where our our expertise comes in. Uh, you have various

models, right? I mean, you have a model of DPI in India where government funded the entire infrastructure and then it's available for free uh, to the users. The other other extreme is you have these

large technology companies investing in proprietary infrastructure which they do not share and they keep it themselves. Right? So, we are somewhere in the middle in our developing countries. Of

[clears throat] course, governments do not have that kind of budget to do it all themselves. They also don't have these technology giants who would be investing in their countries. So, so we

have to find PPP models uh which which can actually work. Now, for a PPP model to work, the private sector has to come in in a very clearly defined role. Private sector creates that capacity.

Private sector does not take regulatory risk. Private sector does not take the initial development risk. So governments and uh MDBs like us have to create that neighboring environment uh the initial

infrastructure pre-development work and bring in private sector. Now that's just not enough because this sector is actually evolving very rapidly. It is very difficult for the private

sector to actually anticipate what kind of demand and what kind of user charges will be there. So unless that is fixed, it is very difficult to then justify a return on the investment which one is

making. So the governments again have to step in. They have to basically guarantee demand you know at at affordable price and and it has been our experience uh I

I will draw a parallel to a a healthcare uh uh scheme which we did in India where we supported a company which is putting diialysis machines in hospitals on a PP basis.

[clears throat] The company doesn't know how many people will come uh for the dialysis and it's a very high capital intensive business and to keep the user charges low so that more and more poor

or lower middle class people can come you need assured demand. And so the government has come up with a PP model where they assure a minimum demand at that price and and and then the private

sector can go in and make that investment knowing fully well that certain level of demand is assured and believe me the government guarantee was never called because demand was always

more than the capacity but that show but that the safety net for the private sector to make the initial investment is important you know. So I think I think that same parallel can be drawn in in

creation of this GPU capacity or the data center capacity is to for the governments to come in and assure a certain level of demand at a very nominal user charges uh and and to make

that happen for us as multilateral banks. we are happy to support with uh also because considering the physical space conceptual financing uh on a long long-term debt which is generally not

available in the market and that private sector can bring in the equity investment. So I think in a combination of this actually a robust model can be created which will create this capacity

and also from our ADB's perspective we can bring in several countries and and create like a centralized uh infrastructure for several countries to share on on a on a on an honest and uh

transparent manner. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much Frank. I'm I'm actually going to turn um back to as you on the government side of the flip side of that. I am going to note those at the

back you cannot see there's a very ominous countdown cal uh timer here at the front telling us how much time is left so I'll ask my colleagues to keep our interventions really tight and

really specific so um Aziz from your perspective what are those financing needs um investment PPPs demand generation blended finance sovereign funds what do you think from from your

perspective are most realistic for AI infrastructure in a country For countries like let's say in emerging markets the most realistic approach is landing finance

model. So public investments for sovereign and security critical layers combined with DPPS and development finance to build data

centers, cloud capacity and connect and the project I mentioned data world is the great example of it. So uh this this is the um main idea our ministry is holding and

working on that right now and approaching to the government as a stretch as well. So we are trying avoid uh just hyping some kind of AI projects but coming more more and more realistic

while understanding the importance of AI projects and the importance of implementing them today not delaying just because of finance. So that's why uh we are trying to find uh different

parts different investments and uh more realistic is lending model which will best suit emerging markets like ours. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. Really exciting to

also hear you know from the financing perspective and the readiness perspective. There's been a real emphasis on on regional collaboration as well. Um so really great to see um both

on the infrastructure the readiness and the the financing side there. Um so we've heard about readiness and we've had a few questions on the financing side of things and now also

want to turn to a bit more practical on the coordination and implementation. Um so first I I'll turn to Bush John on from his experience in Tajikistan &gt;&gt; given I know that you wear a number of

hats in the country um working with area AI and the AI council as well. Um and just from your perspective, what are some of the institutional coordination challenges when there are multiple

ministries involved when we have to include a lot of different actors um in AI and digital infrastructure? &gt;&gt; Yeah. So that's a good question and good challenge especially for the authority

that implementing and deploying uh AI on the ground. So first of all uh the first reaction which we got while we created the product for many people especially in the different authorities the AI

looked like a black box they didn't understand it how it works and uh secondly when you have a influence on making decision on something you don't want to lose that so when you deploy AI

models of course you are going to lose it and you cannot make decision as you did before so that's why it's always a challenge and whenever you go to any ministry or any agency you need to

explain why. So in our case what was a big success is basically AI become a top agenda on the like head of state level. So on his annual address on like daily like meetings the president of Ramon has

mentioned that digitalization AI this is our way. So you want it or not as a CEO of a state company or head of department you have a KPI of implementing AI in any processes. So let's say in the ministry

of uh industry technologies one of the success cases has been using AI in uh providing licenses formemes before it used to be like a very long process and several people were part of

committee and you as a as a entrepreneur you need to wait for their decision for your review while with AI you just upload all your documents and you get instant decision whether you are going

to the next phase or not so that's why uh if you collaborate like agenda on the high level of the government and plus the readiness of the products by private sector for government sectors or any

sectors. This can be a combination of success cases where your life as a uh deployer of AI would be easier otherwise you have to backto back with each person explaining why AI is great and why is

most of all explainable. It's not like a black box. Thank you so much Fish John that um great to hear again I think looking at the K KPIs as well and making sure that

AI is integrated um really interesting way to make sure that it is you know just part of the everyday conversation and really um integrated into government services. So Adana I'll turn to you for

our final question. Um, and this is going a bit more into the implementation again. And you've already mentioned some of the work that Kazakhstan's been doing on data exchange, but I'm wondering if

you can go a little bit deeper into um, you know, data platforms as one specific example of practical design choices that that you saw made a real difference in in um, servicing and uh, transformation

and what do you do you think that these are transferable to other countries um, as well? &gt;&gt; Thank you. That's also a really good question. Uh in Kazakhstan, uh the real

uh digital service transformation began when digital systems uh stopped operating um in isolation and we started to work in a shared connected environment. So I would like to

highlight uh the main thing that before going or diving into AI each country should be developing their the foundations of the digital public infrastructure because as you may know

without the data exchange set in the country you cannot build any AI agents or the platform itself. uh so the case in Kazakhstan we as as as I said before the DPI issued across the institution

and uh our agencies or ministries they don't need to um build something from scratch they already have the data they already have the technology so and uh the thing is we al we need to embed the

AI into the existing platform and the projects so it it can be evolved further We also learned that connectivity alone uh doesn't give the um the doesn't change the outcomes. What

change outcome is the clarity um clarity about who can access the data, what condition can be used, what kind of responsibility that person should have and uh once this result became the

stable and predictable enough uh cooperation between the institutions became routine and today the results are visible in a daily operations in Kazan. We have uh

different data exchange system. For example, smart bridge is a national data exchange platform. Uh smart data commit is the national our national data lake where all government agencies are

sharing their data. So uh others can be easily be used and we also have systems like eel or ew witness uh as I told before uh where large volumes of the citizens request uh is processed and

analyzed uh efficiently and uh correctly and this uh system are used as a normal administration in Kazakhstan and these are not just pilot initiatives

they are embedded in how public services are working and ask answering your question what is most transferable to other countries it is not the specific platform and it's

not the specific technology it is the shift in how the system is organized um from separate digital service to connected operating environment first you need to set up the

environment the system like human body, human organism and many governments are now facing that uh and working in this direction from digitalization of the processes of the services to redesigning

how the public sector works as a system. So Kazan is undergoing this trans transition uh in practice and we see the strong value in the DPI not only as a national foundation but we see DPI also

as a partnership with other countries. So we are will be very open and happy to work with countries and institution uh so we can develop AI and DPI together. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much Adana. So I think

we're the clock is now at zero but um thank you so much to all of our panelists for the great discussion. Really appreciate looking at the financing implementation readiness

aspects of of AI infrastructure. Um [clears throat] so and thank you to all of you. Apologies that we didn't get a chance for Q&amp;A but I hope you'll catch our panelists after the session. Thank

Can I come with it? Sorry. Are you here?
