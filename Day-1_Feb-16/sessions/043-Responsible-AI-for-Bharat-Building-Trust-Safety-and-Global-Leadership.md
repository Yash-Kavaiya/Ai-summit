## 📝 Transcript

congitulate for choosing the title of this summit impact AI impact because the world was busy in declarations and summit around the world. If you see there is a competition in doing the

summits summits summits but this is an impact summit and also this impact for not for the selected but for all the 8 billion people almost on the planet. So it's

inclusive inclusive concept of this summit which I really appreciate and like the second thing I want to say that India third largest economy in terms of PPP

but remember that it's not today's the size of the economy which matters what you will be tomorrow if you look at the US uh GDP per capita income and the size of the economy 30 trillion if you look

at the European half a billion 20 trillion size economy and if you extrapolate the size of Indian economy by open standard around 70 trillion plus the potential by

American standard almost 170 trillion even more than the current size of global economy 120 trillion so what I'm talking about is not for today's India but for India of tomorrow the future of

India the future of AI I will be drafted and created by these numbers where is 170 trillion where is this 70 trillion and that's where I look into it. The the second point coming to the the frugal

innovations DPI and everything you see the western models are great there is a competition on the numbers of the parameters on which the system has been trained billion trillion sign everybody

is claiming which is fine for the accuracy point of view but what you need for your country because these models were created solving to a problem in a particular context train on a data in a

particular context India's is a different country complex um you know geographical locations languages different level of literacy and educations you need a very different

approach and India has demonstrated in the past if you look at the uh the DPI if you look at the digital payment revolution before that we were struggling rest of the world developed

economies is still struggle if I go to the many of the advanced economies so hard to make the payment for using the system but India's DPI payment revolution has brought in new dimensions

to develop ment using the digital technologies and that's where I see a lot of hope that how the backbone infrastructure created by India in the form of DPI could be a great enabler

India has already made a a great move in terms of making the data sets available for doing the experimentation for doing the testings and trainings and India has also come with the bhashnney so if you

combine the existing sets which India has created with the agentic approaches to these ones on I think India has its own indigenous model. You can use it. You can use his regional compute. You

can use these data sets and have an ind indigenous Indiadriven model. The only other approach I will suggest and and and and advocate is that you have a different India in terms of the level of

education. You have the largest higher educational system in the world competing with the China. So how do you use 40 million higher educational institute? How do you convert them into

the creator rather than being users? And then the bottomup approach which we are doing with the Intel AI chopal how do you engage who don't know the language how do you make them the creator using

the you know the bar breaking the barrier of language using the weddriven systems so I think these are the few way of uh creating a system which could be truly inclusive for the people for the

India as well as for the global south without creating without facing the barrier of resources which many countries are facing. Thank you and over to you. Great thanks Sur uh really

useful. Sush I'll come to you on this skilling question. And I think really uh I think important point that we should uh talk about education and talent but Navina if I can come to you next um and

maybe two questions right one is I think just bouncing off what kind of surly infrastructure this backbone that we're talking about and we often think about infrastructure in the hardware sense

right uh it's pipes it's cables it's data centers it's ships uh I want to ask you about uh governance as architecture or governance as infrastructure you do a lot of work obviously in this space. So

if you can talk through why you think you know having good robust governance architecture or infrastructure is important as we scale and two if I can ask you you know just going back to this

point about you know optimization resources frugality from an India perspective you know one point we hear often is that you know when it comes to governance risk and compliance um

because India often adopts kind of global models the compliance costs with this are very high we don't understand these models we don't know how to you know build compliance systems around it

so we're essentially outsourcing these costs right so would you then suggest that India in some way develop these governance mechanisms themselves internally inhouse so that these costs

drop and is there a model that you would suggest or an approach that you would suggest to do that &gt;&gt; so first and foremost so happy to be back in Delhi it's been a few years so

really excited to be here and what you're asking me actually is going to be a very very long conversation because there's an assumption and as I was hearing all the panelists there was an

assumption that this innovation just magically would work and it actually does not because intentionally you have to think about how do you embed trust in these AI systems and trust in these AI

systems is not just a compliance exercise it actually is thinking about what AI is and what it does and let me break that down for you so especially as you know for the

what's happening in the AI landscape and what's happening in India is right now India is a consumer of some of the large frontier models and when you are In that consumer state, what ends up happening

is you're dependent on a lot of, you know, third-party vendors. You're dependent a lot on thirdparty foundation models. You actually don't have a good visibility into what goes into the AI

supply chain. And similar to what we saw in the software bill of materials, it is complex. So unless you understand what is within your AI systems, how these models are built, what data they are

trained on, what is potential impact of these systems, it's very difficult to say whether you can trust these innovations. So you know I always encourage the builders to think about

the consequences of how they are adopting third party. But the second thing is what AI does is equally important. So as we are talking about the consequential population 1.4 4

billion people. You have to really think about is this AI system actually going to work for this very diverse set of individuals and I think that's where the opportunity for India lies. So I I hear

you you don't have any ask from the policy makers and I think I have a big ask from the policy makers and builders here that if you're going to think about governance and trustworthiness as the

last step in building AI, I think India will not have the opportunity to win in this AI arms race which is happening. I think the way India is going to lead is by focusing on trustworthy AI principles

which are all about you know thinking about the quality of these system reliability of these systems. How do you scientifically measure trust but also how do you make it work for the massive

population that exists in India? And so when we think about you know shift from being a consumer to now becoming a creator first and foremost how do you actually embed governance from the onset

as you're building these systems really thinking through who's going to be impacted and how these systems are getting built. Secondly, unpacking the supply chain because again in AI the

supply chain has gotten very complex. You might be using a customer service chatbot which is now powered by three other different vendors, four different foundation model providers and you have

zero clue into you know how these systems have been developed and how they've been tested. So there's a lot of blackbox nature that is getting shifted to you. And then the third thing which

is really critical as we think about this is just the impact like do you actually have you know the right benchmarks and evaluation methodologies because again what has worked in the

western world even if you think about fairness benchmarks unfortunately that does not account for what's happening in India. So when I think about India's opportunity, India's opportunity is

really around leading with trustworthy AI because guess what? The priorities, the demographics, the economics in western world don't apply to India and just making AI work I don't think is

going to work. What works is making trusted AI work for India. &gt;&gt; Yeah, great. Thanks Davina. Look, really powerful, you know, embed governance. It's not an afterthought. Start start

with that right up front. So I'm just going to hold that skilling question, the education question for a bit because I want to get Pratush into exactly what Naven just said, right? Benchmarks,

evalu, you know, multilingual capabilities, accuracy, fairness when it comes to linguistic uh capabilities is, you know, something that again is sometimes

thought of as an afterthought, right? So one, you know, why is this important to think about fairness, accuracy, reliability, performance when it comes to uh multilingual capabilities? And

two, uh, you know, what more do you need to be able to make these benchmarks work, right? You need better data infrastructure, do you need evaluation data sets? Uh, what more do you need to

make that happen? Um um u I mean if you look at a technology like how is a how a phone works right we've always focused on ensuring that it

is very closer close to how users will actually use it um but those are after thoughts that people put into design with large language models uh the interface between us and these models is

everyday language. So by definition they are very humanized [clears throat] in some sense. There's more work that needs to be done on the engineering side to ensure that it is actually gets more and

more humanized. But I I hope all of you are experiencing it. You're talking to one of these models, you're feeling you're talking to a coworker and actually getting things done. Now the

that is a plus side. The negative side to that is what is humanizing varies from people to people. what somebody in a village in Maharashtra feels versus what somebody feels in uh western Europe

or in Bay Area would be very different. So there needs to be a constant effort to create benchmarks which capture the subjective experience of people using these things. Right? And this involves

uh personal signatures like my voice, does it work with my voice, my language, my context, my vocabulary etc. Right? So there is there is a nuance to be able to judge a system is working well

especially when we intend it to be humanizing across the variety of uh cultural context. But I think this is something that is happening and I just want to put in perspective uh that AI

technologies over the last 5 years have become far more inclusive than probably the last 20 years. Right? These things are rapidly improving. Uh providing support for languages is rapidly coming

through. uh and and wherever there is focus we can improve these systems. I personally feel that uh the most fair thing to do is to make it available to all right uh and not gate it with too

many things you want to make it accessible to people and you want to make everybody builders of this technology right the interesting thing is now I mean in fact it's it's you can

all imagine it in few years the gap between who is a builder and who is a user will slowly diminish right and our job at least my job and I'm sure many people across the world have the same

mission. We want to make this technology available to all. Right? Uh and the faster you can do the better it is because it is actually a value ad for each each uh country, each company, each

community, each person. It's a value ad. Uh and and and then once it diffuses having the voice so that people can come back and tell what is not working and improving on that is something that we

should do like any other good engineer would do. Yeah. Great. So, lots of interesting points. Uh I'm just going to pause for a second because I was just informed that the honorable minister of

state is just going to arrive. We'll do a short keynote from him and then we'll resume the panel. Um this way. Should we pause or continue maybe if I can just follow up with one

specific thing till we wait for the minister of state to come in. Um look there's a discussion right now. It's a global AI summit. They're trying to you know build standards and you know

develop uh benchmarks and eval at a global level. This is something that prime minister once done. On this question of um fairness um accuracy of linguistic content would you be willing

to sign on to some you know commitments voluntary commitments of that nature? Just a short yes or no. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. I mean that's exactly what every every model builder would do. Yes.

Okay. Excellent. Happy to hear that. Namaste sir. &gt;&gt; So please &gt;&gt; Yes, you're on time. Please. If I can just request you to take your seat, sir.

Yes. It's my real honor and privilege to welcome uh honorable minister of state mitin prasada minister of state for both commerce and industry and electronics and IT. Sir, thank you so much for

joining us sir. U we have just been having a very rich discussion about what it will take for India to be from a consumer to a creator and so we have on this panel really uh esteemed set of

speakers across different layers of the value chain. Um so I wanted to just first welcome you and acknowledge your presence here sir. Uh I think there's some photos being taken. Um but sir if I

can now just request you to maybe say a few words sir. Uh we're obviously it's the first day inaugural day of the summit. Uh if you'd like to just share a few words.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. Uh a very good morning. Um I'm very glad that I have uh got this opportunity to speak to you and this is my one of my first sessions here uh at the beginning of the AI impact summit.

So not only do I welcome you uh you know this is a big event and uh a defining moment in India's history as far as the tech transformation is going. So uh you're all very privileged in fact all

of us should be very privileged to see that the AI impact summit is kicking off and it's truly historic in terms of the response uh and I hope to see um the outcomes during the next course of the

week where the whole world is descending and India being that u is that that promised land where the new trajectory of artificial intelligence will kick off and with me here is Santos Vishnuatan

Mr. Pratush Kumar, Narrina Singh, Suresh Yadav, Amlan Moanti who's our moderator and has been telling us that uh a very interesting discussion was happening on

uh on the way forward the next leap what is it &gt;&gt; consumers to creator &gt;&gt; which I missed out on because I would want to hear what's going on and uh

figure out uh from these experts as to um what they have to say because after all it's about um all of us. It's not only about government who makes policies uh but about every stakeholder uh from

the from the industry to to our startups to our young to our innovators to our researchers and every person um has a stake and a skin in the game and to be truly successful and to make uh India

that AI service provider for the world uh we all have to chip in and uh contribute in whichever fashion that you And as part of the government, I can tell you uh

this is a very agile government. It listens, it it fine-tunes its policies, programs according to the need of the hour, the situations that demands and and the trajectory and the speed and

scale of what India is looking at and that's what we have to offer to the world. Uh you know, we've got the maximum AI skill penetration. uh we've uh gone ahead with the with the policy

of ensuring not to overregulate but to uh so that innovation thrives uh we are ensuring that our GPU access is made available as far as possible uh at a cheap cheapest cost uh so that

especially our young our startups and our future generations who have the best minds uh and design capabilities they can take use of this high cost of uh of compute and design models and we

are not looking at and competing with uh with the big big models. We are looking at you know scalable models which are uh you know which have impact within our country and within you know the the the

the specifics of of the models which which show impact on a particular sector a particular region a particular community uh particular field and that's where uh the the the India focus lies

where you know we've rightly named it as the India impact summit from action to impact from Paris to uh to India which just goes to show that the focus now is on making AI and that technology

available to all as Prime Minister Narendra Modi Gi says that we want to democratize technology uh but it's not only about access to technology now we have to go deeper and beyond uh access

and make sure we have scalable solutions uh in every aspect and with a young population uh with a great skill force with the great talent capital of the world that we call ourselves. I think we

are rightly positioned and when we do these kind of events where the whole world descends uh the interaction the exchange of ideas the best practices uh and what India has to offer uh will

truly showcase to the world that India has arrived on the on the tech tech space and we are here to charter the course and bridge that digital divide which was there earlier in other other

occasions as far as the internet goes but as far as AI And as as diffusion and and its and its use is concerned, India under Prime Minister Modi is that voice of that global south which will ensure

that that there is no have and have nots. We will ensure that everybody starting from the from the bottom up uh especially for the global south sensitivities are factored in in the way

that AI discourse does take place in the future. So I think I won't take much of your time and I wish you all the best and and I want to uh hear a bit of what my what our experts have to say uh so

that before I head to the to the next session. Thank you so much. [applause] So thank you. Thank you so much for those remarks. Uh I have to say you know

it really resonated with what we've heard on the panel so far. And if I may, you know, just in a few minutes share kind of a little bit of what we've heard so far. I think one so the point you

were making about the very clear strategic objectives for India's AI strategy that you outlined right around inclusivity making sure that AI is accessible to all is something that

everybody on this panel agreed with. Uh so it's really about making AI available at population scale and for that we need scalable solutions. So I think it's really about how do we ensure that India

has the capacity to develop these scalable solutions. DPI has come up often the use of Aadhaar UPI of course but perhaps new models to be able to build those scalable solutions in the AI

context is perhaps what the next uh step would look like. Um you'll be happy to hear sir that we were asked very specifically is there any other support that some of these people building in

India need from the government. Uh and honestly we heard at least on this panel that you know you're already providing access to compute capital uh you know talent um market access. So at this

point at least there wasn't too much on the builder side but I have to say we heard from Navina which said the one thing perhaps she would make a request from the government is to think about

governance and trust uh as um from the ground up. So think about embedding governance into the into the system. So that was one and two just maybe one other point from Pratush that perhaps

was a slight deviation from what you were saying is of course you know you're talking about small models and the importance of frugal innovation that has been a very clear strategic goal but we

did hear from Pratush that uh he believes at least that India needs to do both uh optimize for resources approach frugal innovation but also compete with global models uh and you can do both so

I'll just pause there sir if you had any remarks any comments any observations beyond that and also if you want to share a little bit about how this all comes together uh in the course of the

summit and what you expect from the leaders declaration as well. &gt;&gt; Sure sir. So I think we've just been requested for one photo photo now if uh if that's okay.

&gt;&gt; Do listen. Okay. So then so if I can just maybe go to one question &gt;&gt; from what she had to say about policy. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. No thank you. Um I I think you said something which is so

consequential that India really not only has the opportunity to impact global south but also set the stage for what trusted AI looks at the global scale. So the comment that I made previously

around governance which by the way is not just regulation because I think we should not just focus on regulatory frameworks. We should really think about what measurable trust means so that AI

can work for everybody and that basically spans not only thinking about how India has an opportunity to create very sector specific uh standards but also the ability to create contextual

large language models rather than just large language models which by the way won't work for India and I think we uh I think at India have such a unique opportunity to lead the global stage

with the focus on context text as well as focus on measurable trust. &gt;&gt; So there's one other issue that's come up often I think which is really about education and there are people on this

uh panel of course who are working building partnerships around really skilling at the from the ground up uh India's obviously young population. So Sush if I can come to you for this

question that I've been holding on to which I think is really important right uh in this context of ensuring that India goes up the value chain right from being a consumer to a creator how are

you thinking about skilling and education and talent development uh we've heard often on this panel is we need to start thinking less about operating and more about building what

does that mean from a skilling and an education point of view &gt;&gt; yeah so if if I have to step back and see what was the biggest benefit that UPI gave us was not just enabling

transactions, it really enabled a lot of small businesses, you know, small sectors to start to come into this economy and participate in this economy in a meaningful way. Right? So, you had

a technology that was applied in solving payment problems or payment transaction problems. It aided to building finances. It aided to getting capital. It aided to data benefiting them. Right? The same

way we got to go and say AI just does not become a tool where we're just chatting with it or or engaging with it. That's one aspect of it. But how can it go back and change fundamental ways in

which we we do things in this society, right? Education is one of those sectors. It's 200 year old system that has been built. It is built for the industrial age and I think it's slowly

adapting to the information age. So we have this amazing ability to go back and rethink the way education needs to be done where it's not a one-way flow. It's not a fixed curriculum flow. It's a flow

where a student truly learns in its own way in a way that best benefits their own skills. Right? So that I think is an absolutely amazing opportunity where AI can really go fuel a change in the whole

system. I and I know that this is a a touchy topic, right? If you go and talk about the education system, there's so much goodness of the education system because it created people like me and

everybody else around the world. But I also think that this is the moment where it can definitely go and change and start to think of skills in a very different way.

&gt;&gt; Yeah, thanks Santosh. uh sorry &gt;&gt; education is uh something that the government is uh at the moment contemplating as to how to go about it and we'd be looking at um ideas uh in

the sense of it's not only you know inculcating it in the curriculum uh because you have to do it now and if you don't you're going to miss the bus because the next 5 10 years you might be

a leader at the moment India might be at the cutting edge at the moment but if we don't gear up for the future we'll be left out and our new young people will not be that capable enough to handle

what's evolving in this sector. So that's one area of concern but it's not only about uh you know inculcating it in a curriculum or taking it as a subject it's about the holistic 600 million

people who are young the demographics of India they all are need to be educated in whatever form they need to starting from schools to higher universities to uh to people who are venturing out in

the in the tech world. So these this issue is of critical importance uh and I think we need some outcomes on this as to how to go about it to ensure that we maintain the edge and our future

workforces are ready uh to handle uh what's what what lies in store for them. So I think I think I'll have to move to the next thing but I I wish you all the best and uh hope this discussion

continues. uh I'm looking forward uh for the outcomes and uh so that we formulate uh the policies way you know the for the way ahead and we see some concrete outcomes from this. Thanks.

&gt;&gt; Absolutely. Thank you sir. &gt;&gt; Can I request one photograph? &gt;&gt; Thanks. Can we have a round of applause for the honorable minister of state please?

&gt;&gt; So just a note to say we'll continue the panel. We have about 10 10 minutes left. So I just want to get to a couple more questions uh which I think has been really interesting panel and of course I

you know encourage any of you to respond to anything that the minister of state has said. But Suri if I can just come to you on I think another important like strategic point right which is you know

the this entire discussion we're having about moving from consumer to creator really is about India rising up the value chain but it's not just relevant to India it's relevant for any country

right a global south country so if you can just pan out a little bit and think about the global south context as a whole you can think about AI as a tool you can think about AI as a service

can you talk to me a little bit about what it might be to reimagine AI I as a nation building tool. I don't know. I'm just putting this out there. Uh but is there a way because you talked about you

know as it being a backbone infrastructure layer but that only means that it's serving some larger goal and that could be nation building. So if you'd like to share any comments on

that. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. Uh that's a fantastic question. Let me say that the current context the the the creators of the so-called the existing models they're

all pushing the countries to be the users and that's where I like this topic very much from user to creators that's the interest that's the model now countries like India or any countries in

similar position which are positioning looking for a development and have a goal to become a developed nation by 2047 what should be their approach and before I further delve dive. Let me also

caution one thing that when the west develops a model, there are no governance standards. There are no risk frameworks. They develop and it goes to the market to the global market. But

when the global south will start developing lot of new standards, lot of new barriers will come. So that is where the governments have to be cautious that which standards developed by whom are

you part of the process of developing that standards. So development standards any standards set by the others should not be a hindrance in creating new product and solution for your

developmental needs. If you look at the climate if you look into the trade everywhere the same thing happen. So the developing country has to be very cautious be on the table that where and

how it should be used. Now coming back to the other one the AI is a transformative technologies which is which is no doubt there's no dispute about that. How do you use developed

countries want to use in the context of because they have an aging population they don't have young people so their requirements are very different if you look at the India I mean the largest

higher education ecosystem large number of young people millions of people entering the job market the requirement of such countries are entirely different than the west so how do you engage them

how do you create a system which empowers them which then mainstream them into the national development journey and that's where is is the large models and the small models should not be seen

as a competition of the choice but a blend. India if you have a small models where you can have trained models on health agriculture where even a farmer can take a mobile phone like they do the

payment for to the vendors they just go to the crops see the disease of the crop they can see the satellite monitoring and the state of the health of the soil. So that kind of empowerment we need for

a country like India which which uh uh grounds these solutions for the people level and not necessarily at the at the other level. The other point that within the government if you look around the

world everybody talk about the silos in the government but if you have a data which enables the the application built up the systems it allowed you to operate within your departments one government

the truly it empowers you to make it one government and that's where the decision making is faster the decision making is truly based on the evidence so I think grounding the solutions based on the

reality based on the evidence and live datas for decision- making processes and creating an opportunity for entrepreneurs for the young people is something I will advocate for all the

developing countries and be mindful of our very intrinsic grounded development journey not guided by if you look at the India journey as I said in the beginning it has been its own journey organic

growth India is so not copied even our constitution is not copied it's a blend so India's model has to be the blend of the model which addresses the concerns of India which addresses the concerns of

the Indian people different literacy level different languages which I talked about India has all the ingredients now the only question is to bring them all together and create something which is

beneficial for India which is beneficial the global south I was very happy to hear from honorable minister that India is not only developing the solutions for India but for the global south as a true

leaders for this century so thank you very much and over to you &gt;&gt; yeah no thanks look I think I really appreciate this development focus it's been very clear that uh India strategy

has and for the global south is a very focused approach around development around inclusive development. But I think what I heard from you is not that think about development as a goal but

also as a process. Contribute to the process of development build develop think about standards development right and contribute to that process. So I think that's great. Um I'm just taking a

look at time. I think you know we have about eight less than 8 minutes left. We have four panelists. So I just want to spend maybe the last few minutes just getting you know your thoughts you know

one by one on what your hopes and kind of wishes are for this summit right you know we're at the day zero or day one how you want to look at it of the summit by Friday we'll have a or Thursday

evening we'll have a leader summit a leader statement a Delhi declaration that brings all of these ideas together so if I can just start maybe with you Navina um because you know you've been

very clear and forceful about the importance of trust and governance um you know I was just on the drive here I saw There were these flyers about how India takes you know ethical responsible

AI very seriously. What would a good outcome for you from this summit look like from a trust and governance perspective just in a minute and a half? &gt;&gt; Absolutely. So I think it's very focused

on three core things. One is if you think about again context matters. So you know we got an opportunity to meet with professor Sud who is the science adviser to prime minister Modi and one

of the key things is the AI governance framework that India has put forth which is really focused on technolleal approach is really fascinating because it's so much grounded in context. So I

would say the first really the goal is India should not just build AI. I think India should build AI responsibly and that's going to become the blueprint for rest of the world. The second is around

AI literacy. I think we've been talking a lot about just unleash AI on education systems, unleash AI on builders. I really would suggest that that needs unleashing needs to include what is

governance, what is trustworthiness, what is fairness, what is compliance, what is reliability and all these core concepts. It's not just about building but how do we actually build with the

outcomes in mind? That's really critical. And then the third thing is capital. Because if you look at just across the world, less than 0.001% 001% of capital right now is going into

trustworthy AI solutions. So if you compare to the amount of you know capital going into frontier model development is billions of dollars but if you look at how much is going into

actually measurable trust standards uh coming up with the right guardrails as I mentioned it's it's miniature so I would really encourage the Indian VC ecosystem and the startup ecosystem to invest much

more heavily in that &gt;&gt; okay so build responsible AI think about education around these principles of reliability uh safety and so on prushes um so at the summit uh it's a global

summit you know you're building doing some great work building foundation models in India for the world you also have people from outside of India who are at the frontier you know Google

Anthropic open AAI here you know as you see them on stage with the prime minister how are you thinking about both competition and collaboration and in the context of this larger summit and

outcomes what would be good for you I mean I know the geopolitical situation is a bit tipsy and we are talking a lot about countries but frankly from an engineers's point of view what we are in

the in the middle of is an amazing revolution where technology is compounding so fast and variety of things are happening. This is a celebration this impact summit is a

celebration of that. Uh the flip side to an engineer's delight I think is more the impact. I genuinely believe that what India can contribute to the world right is the narrative that this should

work for everybody right the survay surva I think has been well chosen it has to be for the benefit for the happiness of everybody right the India as a country

has absorbed everything right culturally over millennia right we are not at all I don't think if you ask an common person in India are you afraid of AI their answer would be no because we know how

to deal with things right we sort of absorb of everything whereas there is a little bit of a trepidation globally what's AI going to do what's going to be the business model who's going to make

money etc etc right I think India can give a clarity that the underlying thing is you need human flourishing right and how do you focus on that and ensure the technology is available to all and we do

it equitably we we do it in a way in which it becomes a common good right I think that narrative India can be a [clears throat] a global champion for and secondly I

think not always keep branding things as I I mean everybody should be a creator. My sense is that AI is going to the AI of today makes somebody a creator who 5 years back never even thought of being a

creator. Right? So I think everybody should be a creator globally. I think we should put that arrow very very strongly that everybody's on their way up uh and do it in a way that is globally I mean

equitable to all. Ag great happy to hear the engineers view is the same as any other's view. It's about impact. It's about human flourishing. It's about a humanentric view and I think we can all

agree on that Santosh. Um so obviously big focus in India around frugal innovation around optimization of resources. Um there are countries who are going to be participating in the

summit that have a very different view. They're all guns blazing. You know it's high capital investment. It's like we want to be uh Pratish mentioned the geopolitical kind of competition that

are obviously trying to a potential AI arms race. Do you think this summit could actually provide some progress on this idea that you know let's be measured let's be frugal or is it each

country adopts their own strategy each to each their own. &gt;&gt; Yeah I think I think the the first one is the fact that we are you know that India is hosting the AI impact summit

and and we are bringing the whole world together itself is a statement. So even before the event I think we've already made a statement that this is important and taking a leading edge technology

vector and then bringing the world around that in a country like India I think would have never happened before. Okay. So I think we've already made that first statement. The second part that I

think all of us need to think it doesn't matter where you are. It doesn't matter whether you're in the in the big countries or the small countries. If you can maximize without derailing the

resources of the world, then it's always a good thing for humans, right? So you use less power, you use less water, you build more efficient data centers, you build models that will help everybody

and scale everybody. It's always a good thing from the world. So I think that all of this audience coming together and trying to think about what's the most efficient effective way of doing

infrastructure, we've done that, right? 4G scaled in India because we thought of 4G very differently and we built data costs that are so frugal in nature but it reached everybody in the same amount

of quality. So I don't think that frugal and and looking at ways in which we can be efficient is a negative is not something that says oh you know what this place is always cheap and looking

at cheap things. It's not. I think it's the most effective way where we safeguard our resources so that our future benefits and we don't burn the planet in that process. So I just feel

like that's the right outcome and I think having the best minds uh in the same spot that can go exchange and interact and learn is a useful vector from this. Thanks Santosh and exactly at

time you know we're at zero but I do want to give you the last word s just maybe last 10 15 seconds right so just bouncing off what Santo said India obviously has a very interesting

approach do you think the rest of the world especially in the global south this is a good model to follow do you think that at the end of the summit we'll reach that conclusion just in 15

20 seconds &gt;&gt; so thank you so much u first let me say that if you see the global tension around the world the underlying theme is the AI tension there is a those who will

control the AI AI will control the who is the superpower economically by 2050. There is a prediction who will be number one, number two, number three. The diffusion of AI, the innovation in AI is

going to decide one two three slots. So that tension is not going to go away with that. But given that the tension is going to remain how the global south how the India as a leader of the global

south can position itself and I think this summit offers a fantastic hope for all the countries in the global south to be the part of the leading process not only a part of following process and

that's where I see the real impact and also I see that people talk about human in the loop but here it give the summit give the concept of human in the center so that's the fundamental shift which I

see and human in the center is going to make responsible AI by action by impact. Thank you very much. &gt;&gt; No thanks. Great point to end on optimistic note maybe you know a tagline

human in the center not human in the loop. Uh thank you to all of my panelists. If you can just have a round of applause for everyone here for a great discussion and to all of you for

being a very patient engaged audience. I also want to just thank the organizers prim partners Sunita Indraj Sakshi for getting us all together for this great session. Thank you everyone.

ending the session. &gt;&gt; Hi, uh we request everybody to remain seated. We have another panel starting immediately. Like there was supposed to be a 5m

minute break but the session overran so we are starting immediately.
