## 📝 Transcript

electronics and communications at the government of Telangana. At Telangana, she did something very interesting. She took the data that was in the government archives and made it available for

innovators to actually work with that to build new solutions. So, welcome. Next to her is Prashant Prakash. He's a founding partner of Excel and he's also a board member of ACT foundation. act is

the one that's the knowledge partner for this. Prashant has been involved from the very start. He's a pioneering venture capitalist who has helped shape the country's startup

ecosystem. He was awarded the praamshri in 2025 for his contribution to trade, industry and entrepreneurship. Welcome. On my left, I have James Walsh. He's a senior behavioral scientist with the

agency fund. He advances social innovation through strategic planning, cross- sector partnerships, and resource mobilization. He focuses on building scalable

solutions to complex global challenges, helping communities achieve sustainable lasting impact. He's also been involved with some of the work that we have done with one of our portfolio companies at

ACT in the area of education. Thanks, James. [clears throat] And then we have the people who are actually doing some serious work on the ground. We have Rama Kant. Ramakant is a

co-founder of Weissa. Weissa is one of the leading healthcare bots. It's for mental health. It's working across 100 million sorry 100 countries with a billion uh conversations that are

happening across multiple languages. Uh a quick background uh you know used to be in English only and during co we worked with them to actually bring it to Hindi and in that process they made

it multilingual so that has really scaled the business and last I have Utkash Saka Utkash is the co-founder and CEO of Adalat AI as the name suggests you know what this is about

it they work across India's justice and policy ecosystem including at the Supreme Court of India on court reform, marriage equality litigation and reducing judicial backlogs. He holds an

LLM from Harvard Law School and a masters from the Kennedy Harvard Kennedy School. Welcome. So on that note, maybe I'll just give a little bit of a sort of set the stage of

for what this discussion is about and then we'll do a short video after that about one of our portfolio companies. So the question that is in front of us is as AI adoption accelerates globally,

a critical question that we in India have to sort of think through is can AI help narrow a social and economic divides or will it deepen them. The reason why we're having this discussion

is ACT as a philanthropic organization has been working very closely with various entrepreneurs in this area of bringing technology-led innovation to either public education, public health

or the environment. All three areas are big problems and you know to do it at scale we believe that technology and now AI in particular has a big role to play but what we also believe that building

for Bhat is not necessarily just copying what is happening in Silicon Valley and we have to think about it differently so today's conversation is not what AI can do in theory but what it takes to

deliver real outcomes not just innovation but at the our smile in clinics, classrooms, courts, and communities. We'll focus on three things. What breaks when AI meets real

users and real systems? You all had lunch outside. Did you see any AI working there, right? That's the challenge. Second, how does trust, safety, and explanability

get designed from day one and with what end user in mind and front and center? And lastly, what needs to change across government, capital and builders for AI to scale responsibly. So those are the

three questions that we'll deal with. U I'll start with the first question, right? So ma'am, I'll start with you. You know, you have been very involved at the

Sorry, I I've been told Yes, the video. Can somebody play the video? Sorry. for [music]

mobile. So these are rocket learning and the team there has actually scaled very well. James has been very involved in that journey and James I'll come to you

after I you know asked this question. So ma'am from a government perspective you know what is the role that you have seen AI play and where have you seen things work and not work?

&gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Hi everybody can you hear me? &gt;&gt; Hello. Yeah. Yeah. So post lunch session is a bit difficult I think [laughter]

right. Yeah. uh coming to your question sep um like currently I'm working we have implemented a number of I would say I would qualify it as pilots you know AI pilots in different sectors ranging from

healthcare to uh forestry to education to you know mental wellness too so while you know some of the pilots have been successful some we couldn't scale it up I mean honestly many of them we couldn't

scale it up that's a different issue but the underlying core problem that we faced across all these solutions was the availability of quality data you know that was a single biggest roadblock for

us in fact to either initiate the initially you know even to start up the projects and then going forward even to scale up so uh and this we started way back in around 2021 you know building

these AI solutions at that point of time now everybody's talking about AI but it was too early for the government you know to even think about AI. So even the startup that work now it's a very uh

mature startup in India in the agriculture sector actually we work with them you know even they were not sure what kind of data they need. So that was they used to ask us data we used to you

know go to different departments get it give it to them then they used to process it but even getting the raw data used to take three to four months time for us you know then the startup used to

process it another 30% of the time used to go finally they used to come back and say no this is not the data set we needed so that really you know took us 6 months to actually uh get the right you

know quality data so that was the biggest lesson for us and based on those learnings you know in Telangana we build the agriculture data data exchange platform initially that made all the

data related to agriculture it's now this we did two years back it's now running up and running and you know startups and others are using data based on the success of that we actually

extended that from agriculture to other sectors as well just la this July I think just before I left Telangana you know they've launched the state has launched the Telangana data exchange

platform where data related to all the sectors is now made available I heard the recent number is about 1100 data sets are made available for in related to different sectors. So that's from the

learning you know that's what we built. Yeah. &gt;&gt; No that's great. Uh if there are any founders entrepreneurs that are sitting here you know that Telangana is one

place to go to go build your AI business. You know James uh going to the video that we just saw with uh rocket learning and you know you've been a big supporter of the of the uh work that

they're doing. What have you seen work on the ground? You know, your thesis, your theory of change in supporting them. What has worked and what what do you see going forward? What what would

work better? &gt;&gt; Uh thank you. Um so we have been working with rocket learning for about three years now or maybe four. Um &gt;&gt; sorry, can can everyone hear me? Yes.

Thanks. Um and so I I think there's a couple of factors that have made Rocket Learning so successful. they now are working with uh hundreds of thousands of Angabodyi workers around India. Um

they're work they've they've they're touching with millions of parents and and so there's um several million kids that are ultimately being impacted by the work that Rocket do. Um I think one

of the things that Rocket have done that has been so uh effective is that from the beginning they took a product first approach and so they have a suite of engineers that are really kind of

driving forward the capabilities of what they do. If if you're not familiar with Rocket Learning they have a WhatsApp product where they communicate uh lesson plans to anchbody workers and they

provide advice to parents. Um and the fact that they have such a productled approach which is quite unusual actually in the nonprofit sector um what that has meant has mean that they've been able to

expand solve problems uh figure out and track user engagement and really get like develop a solution that works for the folks um that they're trying to support. Um but I think there's another

thing that makes Rocket like particularly unusual which is that very early on they also decided to embed quite rigorous research into the work that they've done. So um you know like

within a year or two they began a randomized control trial with some of the top economists in the world um and to test whether or not they were having the impact that they were hoping to on

child development. And they found about midway through the course they were having some impact but it wasn't the impact that they were hoping for. And actually what they did in the response

to that was that they started to make adaptations. they started to AB test different variants of their of their solution um and ultimately improve the product based on that feedback that you

know they weren't achieving what they wanted to do. So I think research is the kind of second really exciting thing that they've been able to embed. The fact that they're both both product and

research makes them like relatively kind of in a very small number of nonprofits advancing at the frontier. And I think moving forward I think there are two real things that could make them um even

more impactful. The first of course is AI and thinking about how can you uh generate bespoke solutions that support the kind of very individual needs that an Angadi uh worker may need at their at

that given point in time. Be able to have a conversation with them. Uh be able to help them support them with their confidence or engage in the community in particular ways. These are

often things that are quite difficult for Anglebody workers and they often need a lot of support in in kind of uh in in in customized ways. Um, and I think the the kind of the the second

thing that would really excites me at least from uh from Rocket's perspective is like this is truly one of the best nonprofits in the world and I think um they have been an amazing uh uh kind of

addition to the to the ecosystem in India. What's really exciting is could large countries around the world benefit from these Indian innovations. So could you imagine these kind of supports in in

Brazil or in in Nigeria in other large countries? I I think that's the next frontier for some of these amazing innovations that have been developed in in India um and other countries to start

bringing that that skill set and that that that capability um that they have that has been is kind of indigenous to the Indian nonprofit tech sector uh to the world at large.

&gt;&gt; You know it's interesting that you say it's indigenous to the Indian nonprofit sector. Uh I think rocket is a very unique uh company in the sense that it is really behaves like a company. I

think pashant you know you've been involved with uh ACT from day one you've seen multiple opportunities to work with different founders right and obviously with rocket as well as you know we

hearing James speak [clears throat] it sounds like it's a VC company right Rocket is no different than any VC company would love to hear what you believe you know what from everything

that you've seen what has worked and where things haven't worked and you know how again as a VC as a capital provider across various areas. You I know you're also big in climate and and

sustainability. What are your thinking in AI AI's role? What will work and what will not work? &gt;&gt; So, SEP I think um um the pilot to scale um

has has been a has has been a challenge if uh like in the rocket case it has worked because they've day one thought about it like a product like you were saying. So it has been engineered like a

product and uh it has been built for scale. Now with AI this starts getting slightly more even more complex because AI systems even at the pilot stage um can be slightly compute intensive and

the capital allocation becomes a problem. So when you uh so so it's a very early days in AI only uh products what we are seeing is that's that's a that's an so unless it is something that

is uh very monetizable uh even even for bat even for barat unless it's mon like test prep very monetizable uh different price point even at a very different price point you'll be able to kind of

quickly do a pilot and see product market fit right uh but if it's not in in those areas then uh capital allocation becomes a problem. So that's one uh one one challenge that we see.

The second challenge is uh you know going from pilot to scale I think there has to be a lot more re-engineering for even more efficiency uh when when you with with with AI

compute again so whether it's edge bringing in edge edge compute related stuff you know SLMs and they're your own proprietary um

LLM technologies so so I think the it's not very straightforward from uh just if I mean if if you built technologies in the uh previous era I think um server costs won't disproportionately increase

when you went from pilot to scale right so that that is that that I'm we are starting to see is a problem the third problem is uh I think very much what m was talking about which is data and and

the environment the data environments in our country are extremely archaic and broken. So when you look at something like healthcare um so even if you do a pilot in a particular environment how do

you then actually integrate it into a clinical system and make it work across states across boundaries uh is is becomes uh you know you can make it work in Telagana at a pilot level but then

how do you take it to another state so that's the third uh problem and fourth I think just the engineering that is required to make it easy to evaluate, monitor continuously.

So it's not like your old products that you built, right? So you built the product and then you could have a next version three months from now. But AI products need continuous monitoring and

evaluation. And uh I think that's one way you can differentiate a a good AI team from a not so great AI team in terms of what kind of eval and monitoring mechanisms are built from day

one. I think Pashant you pick up a very important point that &gt;&gt; you have to retrain in some ways the donors because the donors need to understand how capital will get

deployed. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. Because if you're saying that there's a much higher compute requirement up front and donors need to

pay for that. Right. And donors don't understand that at this point. Right. They're &gt;&gt; So that's a [clears throat] because as you scale the cost will only go up. Um

but I think that's where the ingenuity and the ability to build frugally with as AI evolves for these impact sectors. I think teams have to you need to be able to judge the capability of the

teams to be able to do that because capital is not going to be available just like you have in these other sectors. You know, I think uh uh from uh Ramakant your standpoint with visa, the

visa was a for-profit uh uh from day one, but you were solving a problem that was huge impact, right? Uh how did you think about and you were AI first, you know, before AI became big, right? in

terms of how you built the bot, how did you think about this, you know, AI forprofit scaling, who would pay for it, how, you know, how did that all thinking evolve? So, I think the answer uh

obviously is different from India versus probably outside India and we started life as wise as a product launched in 2017 uh on direct to consumer almost as an experiment personal experience with

mental health. We said you need to have a um mental health intervention which doesn't need you to step out of your home and go to a therapist. Can there be a chatbot? This was 5 years before chat

GPT. So we were literally whistling in the wind. Uh and there was nothing there. And most people used to look at us and saying when we used to say oh we building a chatbot for mental health and

they used to say what and now it's not what it's how. So the question has changed because now it's become much more accepted and it's almost become I think the zeitgeist. Um I think

monetization monetization models have also evolved over some from 2017 to 2026 now. So 9 years initially we tried monetizing in direct to consumer covid happened 2019. Uh suddenly I think the

world woke up to mental health as an issue and I remember the email we got from uh clinician in the NHS the national health service. uh that was 2019 saying who are you guys? What have

you invented? Have you any idea what you have done? Because weight lists for therapists in the NHS in the UK are about as much as 12 months long. So you have to literally wait for a year before

you can see a therapist. So what do you do in the meantime? So she tried it tried this with her patients and she said this is the only thing which is sticking on their phones and nothing

else is. So you have done something special. Have you thought about clinical safety? That was the first time in 2019 we said oh we need to think about clinical safety when you're thinking

mental health and now of course that's the only thing we probably think about. So but at the same time the ability of I think advanced public health systems to absorb AI to to implement it and also to

pay for it has evolved. Uh I think the story became very different when we moved to India. &gt;&gt; So because the topic of this panel as well is AI for Bharat. So what what

broke or what what changed? So we started life as a chatbot for mental health and then we came to Bharat and one chatbot didn't work, mental health didn't work. So you're like what do you

do now? Basically we wanted to implement this as a um a mental health intervention for young people saying that it's a very vulnerable time in their lives. There's huge amount of

neuroplasticity. uh the intervention has a generational impact because it impacts families for many many especially if you're thinking about young girls so which is the target

group which we wanted to go after but then we also realized that you also have to go beyond the English language speaking you know the people in this room and if you wanted to go to say a

municipal school in Ryard in Maharashtra we are working with the women and child development ministry in Maharashtra right now so we realized that a chatbot format doesn't work because one the girl

doesn't have access to her phone she probably borrows a phone from a mother twice maybe 2 hours a day is also very closely monitored and uh the consumption pattern is very different. The user

behavior is very different and uh nobody's willing to pay for it. So you cannot build a business model around here. So then obviously lots of bloody noses later we I think a chance or we

created a product which said that this should not be a digital intervention. It has to be a physical intervention not digital which was combination of a physical plus digital saying that the

actual intervention which the child is receiving is a workbook which looks like a normal scrapbook or a journal which the say imagine a 13year-old girl which is getting access to a colorful book

like a scrapbook given to her by her teacher which has QR codes embedded inside it which take the child even if she's on a borrowed phone they take her do a very private anonymous chatbot

interaction on the web. So you're still delivering digital but you're delivering it in this blended format. And the second thing is nobody's going to pay for a mental health intervention. So we

said this actually has to become social emotional learning. So this is a skill building intervention and there are budgets for books. &gt;&gt; Mhm.

&gt;&gt; So schools pay for books. They don't pay for digital apps. So that's the direction we're going in saying that our intervention for mental health for India for Bharat is actually education. So

ma'am I'll I'll come to you before I'll go to Udkash later because I think what uh Ramakant is outlining here in terms of how AI will come to India you mentioned this a little bit but the

government will have a big role to play because to the point that Prashant made that the cost of rolling out AI interventions will be expensive and the government is already doing some work in

this but where do you see like for example if Ramakant were to come with Visa to Telangana or to come to Niti IO what would your reaction be? How would you see that being taken by the

government in India? &gt;&gt; I can actually share one example. We work with one of the mental wellness uh forgot the name actually in Talan. So and government of India is also doing

that currently subsidizing the compute. That's one way of you know helping the startups where the cost of compute is born by the government because at the end of the day as uh someone said you

know we don't look as a government we don't look at profits but we look at impact or you know solving a certain problem. So that's the main thing that the government looks at. So computer is

one thing and one of the biggest challenge startups face you know is access to if your it's an agit solution access to farmers because at the ground level even for the mental wellness

solutions that we implemented for uh substance abuse you know I mean in Telangana and many of the states this is one of the biggest problem where children are actually getting addicted

to these drugs so we actually implemented an AI solution where which is administered for you know children below 18 years. So one of the biggest problem the startup faced was by the

government also wanted to implement that how do we reach out to the students who are actually you know out there who uh really need the most that's where the government entire government missionary

can help the startup. It could be you may call it as a first customer or you know whatever it is but that scale and size the government can really number one in infrastructure number two you may

call it customer base or you know second third you know at the ground level there's certain nuances you may have the best product in the world you just roll out we actually had this

experience in the agit sector you know it was a marketing you know access to market solution like it's a very good product we actually roll it out to the in one of the districts in Telangana. So

what happened was nobody was using it except very few farmers. We didn't understand why they you know they're getting access to market very good information that they can actually get

price higher than what they're paying. So then we did a you know ground study and all our team went there and finally what they found out is the farmers they rely on local suppliers for available

credit you know getting credit and all. So they really I mean they don't uh see actually going beyond what is available because of those already relationships that they've

built. So these kind of nuances which the startups may not know you know that's another thing that the government can help them with. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Great. Uh thank you. Uh

&gt;&gt; I just want to add here while I spoke about data initially you know before we are working on a very interesting project in Odisha. In fact I was talking to you right? So it's in the health

sector where uh we are trying to actually understand the entire life cycle of data in the health sector because for any government you know uh we don't have the right data for

decision making right from the asha worker to the you know even the chief secretary level. So they the government actually wanted us to identify the prioritized list of challenges that

they're facing in Odisha and come out with you know suitable solutions in healthcare that help Asha workers and even I mean to deliver better services just wanted to mention this. Oh

&gt;&gt; great. So uh again taking off on that point about data uh Utkash I think I would love if you can talk a little bit about what Adalar does because you are fundamentally based on data right and

you have taken on the responsibility of digitizing this and bringing it into AI. Maybe talk a little bit about that and what are what have been the challenges as you've gone down that journey.

Yeah. So, uh, Adalat AI is a legal tech nonprofit that builds tech solutions for district courts in India to help them process their cases faster so that we can, uh, sunset that dialogue of Tariq

per tarik, right, which is so iconic of our courts. Um, and the idea is to identify the manual and clinical processes that become pain points in the plumbing of a court. We are the proud

plumbers of the courts that are trying to unclog the pipes of all these processes and paperwork. Um, I think in terms of the thinking and what worked and what started,

it's very sector specific. Like I'm quite envious of education and healthcare because there are all these incredible nonprofits that have done a lot of incredible work that's paved the

way for impact for us. We don't know other nonprofits that work directly with courts. That's a big blind spot. And so we had some responsibility to educate the sector on the role of civil society

in doing this kind of work. So our ethos was identify painkillers and not multivitamins. A lot of solutions are multivitamins. The green vegetables that would be lovely to have but I think we

thought that let's identify the high fever points in the courts and go with a painkiller to develop that credibility that hey civil society can actually help you.

&gt;&gt; So give me an example of that. &gt;&gt; Exactly. So our first solution was stenography which confused a lot of people. They were like, "You're going to solve delays and backlogs by expediting

stenography in courtrooms." It's actually a big pain point because in a cross- examination in a courtroom, if I ask you a question and you answer it and Prashant is the judge, there are no

stenographers in most of India's court. So, Prashant will write the question and answer. Then, Judge Prashant will get transferred and judge Jamie will come in and judge Jamie will be like, "I can't

read Prashant's handwriting." So judges have WhatsApp groups where they send each other images of depositions saying hey what have you written and judge prashant will say it's been 2 years I

can't read my own handwriting that's the kind of challenges the courts work with some states which were innovative came forward with a solution called the fair copy department and as the word suggest

they there's a department which will take judge prashan's depositions every day and fair them out in writing by hand and so we asked them saying why are you writing this you can type it out and

they're like We don't have Tamil keyboards. We don't have Hindi keyboards. And so we were like this is clearly a high fever point. Judges are developing spondilitis. It's phys

physical manual work. They will say we don't we're not judges. We are scribes in the system. And so we built a speechtoext legal transcription tool powered by AI. And scaling was not by

push which is what often happens in social in the social impact space. It was pulling us into the system. We were getting calls from states every day saying, "Hey, we need this painkiller as

well." And we were like, "Wait, we have to build capacity, get more compute, build more language models. This will take time." And I think once we established that successfully, the

states then started coming to us for the multivitamins. There was a relationship of trust saying, "Hey, you actually helped me address a fever in the system. Can you now help me build paperless

filings? Can you now help me build chat bots because we've proven ourselves with the painkiller?" So I think that was our approach and I think it's proven it's worked well to some extent. Um in terms

of challenges as you said we work in an extremely confidential setting. This is a courtroom. This is a judge dictating a judgment before the world finds out. Stock markets can move on that kind of

information. Um and so security is the highest priority and we have a three-pronged approach to security. One is we don't use any third party API. So no open AI, Google nothing. These are

Adalat AI's models. We are an AI native company which means a lot of compute for both experimentation for the fine-tuning of the models but also for the inferencing. The unit economics changes

when the API call is not going to Google but is coming to Adalat AI and that's obviously a big challenge. Uh the second is we have to think about encryption systems. This is extremely sensitive uh

databases and so we've kind of built a blockchain kind of decentralized encryption system where each judge gets an encryption key and to decrypt the database you need every judge's

localized local machine encryption key. uh and so security is a is a big challenge. Uh and the third is is just the peculiar nature of the domain and the language we use. Right? Uh as per

the doctrine of rest ipssa loitar per order 39 rule 1 and 2 whatever that means uh all conversational speechtoext collapses in a courtroom because the language is so pedantic so technical uh

that we are kind of building our own speechto text models for our own languages. Law is its own language. one is Tamil and then one is legal Tamil u and so I think all of these complicate

uh the work that we do but I think this is unique for sovereign AI uh and so we are really looking forward to more support on compute number one that if if someone asked me what's the one thing

that you would like more from from the system it's compute u and I would say to the c I would add coordination in the compute you know I was just standing outside and I was talking to someone

from an IIT I won't name which one and they were like we're building this amazing chatbot that does this thing to demystify laws. And I was like, I know five other IT and three other triple IT

that are doing the exact same thing. Why aren't the organizations talking to each other if compute is so precious? Uh I'm not sure that there's as much thinking going into like using it in the most

optimized and efficient way. Uh so yeah, I I I think uh we've now kind of got a foot in the door with the painkiller. The system is now opening the door for us to build more endto-end systems. But

for that to happen at scale compute uh is is prerequisite. Rashant, I'm going to come back to you uh and to you Jenny as donors funders in this. You've heard both. I think all three uh in some ways

talk about compute being a big sort of bottleneck for impact at least impact. You know, you're getting VCs to put money into other companies. But on the impact side, how do you see your

organizations, you know, act or in your case agency fund actually playing a role in in driving making that change? You know, either of you can do So I think like utkash was saying I

think this requires a very sovereign approach right so it's not even when you look at how to optimize some of this compute uh so there's a company called E6 data for example right so you're

aware of that now they are doing a lot of this optimization for the larger companies the flip cars swiggies you know I I don't know what it would take for to get some of that into government

stack sovereign stack which would be able to provide the same compute at a very differential cost so it's not just compute can the government AI stack look at compute at a very differential

optimize it to a very differential cost right that's one and I think over time I would say I think the solution is edge computing I I don't think there's I mean if this has to drop down to uh you know

110 kind of a price point. So, and we just launched something in Karnataka uh first AI kind of risk computer, right? Yeah. So, that this is a an AI computer where it runs on Chrome. The models run

on Chrome. uh 15,000 rupees. Um so it's going to be first deployed in schools for the teachers to person to kind of personalize curriculums for the classroom they're teaching. So you can't

give one of these for every student &gt;&gt; but can you give it to uh every every teacher uh so that the lessons are personalized and Microsoft is &gt;&gt; you can run like models on

&gt;&gt; the models run on that. So just just I mean it's totally off the grid. uh you can run the model. So so I'm seeing that come down to 5,000 rupees to 6,000 rupees uh such kinds of such edge AI

comput computers right and then in the I can see in a courtroom uh you know it's it's it's going to be uh very very practical to roll it out across the country. So I think there's there'll be

innovation on this the central AI stack that will the APIdriven stuff that's going to be of course made more optimal but there's more uh um um you know category specific compute solutions on

the edge that will also hopefully play a role. &gt;&gt; Thanks. So I so that that very much resonates. I think there is a there's a need for technological innovation to

come. Um, in terms of how we, the agency fund, approach this, I don't think we're radically different to other funders in the kind of philanthropic space. Um, we see our role very early stage. And so,

um, where we pay attention is trying to help early stage nonprofits identify a model, a product that that works. And that might mean model evaluation to get the actual AI to be

behaving as it should be. Um but all the way up to kind of getting user engagement effectively. Um this is something that is well understood in the private sector but not always um that

kind of muscle doesn't exist in the nonprofit sector in the same way and then ultimately helping nonprofits run randomized trials impact evaluations to show impact because I think ultimately

there we want to show be able to work with nonprofits to help them demonstrate to the ultimate kind of um payer which is going to be government that this is a cost-effective high impact solution and

I think that's that kind of is the second part of where we uh the solution from because we're a relatively small um funer uh to these big questions of large

scale fund kind of large scale costs ultimately like I would love to see a world where the user and the payer are much closer I don't think we want a world where like the gates foundation or

the agency fund or whoever else are paying for indefinitely for things not only because of the kind of the sustainability question but also because exactly to with Kush's point about, you

know, pain points. You know, if the funer is the payer, the pain points that are going to be often solved are the funers pain points. But really what you want is the the nonprofit or the

organization, the product to be solving the pain points of the government who are essentially acting on behalf of citizens and so getting that much more close to citizens I think is ultimately

better as well. Um so those are the two things. One is just helping nonprofits uh build products that work through evaluations whether that's te technical AI model evaluation or it's your

standard kind of evaluate impact evaluation and then the second is really helping find models where the user is the payer and I loved hearing about the two stories uh that you guys had.

&gt;&gt; I think that's a good uh either of you take take on what he just said. &gt;&gt; Um I'd like to probably add a different dimension. One is definitely because we are talking about AI and the cost of

compute but uh I think the cost of implementation or the cost of actually rolling this out in real life is not just compute or my sense is comput is probably a very small fraction of the

cost you would need to incur to actually make this roll out at scale in government or in the public sphere in real life. And I'm talking about the transformation. I'm talking about the

fact that you need to train people. you need to make sure that they're comfortable with whatever you're implementing. That's a non-trivial cost not just in terms of energy and

attention but also in terms of money and I had two or three different just in terms of our work on the ground uh both with uh in Maharashtra and now we are about to do something very significant

in Megallay as well and we're talking to the government of Punjab and we've just uh we just won a $7 million 5-year grant with the welcome trust to as a clinical trial to actually implement this in UP.

So there are so multiple places where we are doing this and I think um we are very quickly realizing that AI is not just tech it is tech plus people and in the mental health space or in the

emotional resilience and skill building space you do need to for for example gain the young girls trust and how do you do that you need to think laterally or you need to think very non- techwise

saying go with the teacher and don't go out and say hey here is an appear here is a digital solution which you need. You need to get the parent on your side. So how do you do that? So you need to

first get the government to say look we are backing this and then we are now sending letters to each of the parents of all the children in school saying this is actually supported by the

government of Maharashtra so that they allow their children to actually use the service. So these are non-trivial problems and if you don't think about them then the tech will just be a piece

of tech lying on the shelf. That's a very good point that the systemic change actually ends up in many cases stopping things and that probably is true for you more than anybody else, right?

&gt;&gt; Oh yeah, absolutely. I think any impact has behavioral change behind it and convincing judges who are pretty set in their ways who aren't usually told how to do their work to now be told how to

change their workflows is very radical. Um, and so it's a twin engine mission. I completely agree. Part of it is tech and that's only a part of it. The other big part of it is programming to actually

train and workshop with the audience and the population that needs to use the technology. Um because otherwise the product is not going to see that kind of uptake. So we actually work and workshop

with the judges but then with the stenographers, the court cler, the court recordkeeper, the whole team around the judge that operates in a courtroom so that the technology is internalized in

their workflow and is actually implemented in court. Um and uh that requires uh sometimes bottom-up approaches where you can kind of go and work with courts and do all of it. But

honestly in our setting because it's the law top down approaches also work very effectively. So we've seen very clear impact of things like mandates. Kerala became the first state in the world uh a

few months ago to mandate us as an AI solution in every courtroom to transcribe uh court proceedings. And while we had seen very healthy uptake till then the level up I mean after that

has been absolutely transformational and &gt;&gt; the government pays for that as a &gt;&gt; partly not entirely but partly and uh now it's become a precedent for other states but I was going to come to the

second point which is that the end goal for us and many other organizations is government adoption and today they don't have the compute to run these systems and not just compute they don't have

internal tech teams to actually productionize models and scale them. And so we are filling that gap now. But the end goal is at some point to migrate these solutions to state systems. Just

like governments have very routine IT teams, will they have routine AI teams in 5 years, 10 years that actually run these systems? And so how do you build systems in a way from the outset that

prepare you for that migration and future? Uh I think keeping that direction in mind completely changes how you design and implement solutions and it changes the engineering. Um on that

point I I think that's a very interesting point he brings up that the government IT teams effectively have to become government AI teams going forward right are you niti Aayog are you how are

you driving this &gt;&gt; uh well uh uh I mean please can I repeat that question &gt;&gt; no no so basically there is a shift in the mindset of the soak or any of these

organizations that have been building &gt;&gt; you know I ishushut and other applications in the past now have to start thinking AI First, how are you seeing or how are you going to see some

like NITayog is at the center of this right &gt;&gt; and working with all the states. How do you see that driving that change from a IT first mindset to a AI first mindset?

&gt;&gt; In fact, uh I mean I work with Frontier Techub in Nityog so which actually looks at different technologies how it's going to impact you know India for the next 10 years and we come out with a road map.

So one of the road map that we have recently launched uh uh a couple of months back two months back is AI for jobs you know wherein we have identified actually different profiles of

individuals you know what are the roles that are going to change uh different roles that are new roles that are going to be created and what are the jobs that are going to be lost and we actually

came out with certain recommendations to the government as to how the you know government should be prepared for it. I mean since it was part of the budget I'm not sure if I can speak it now speak now

about it we actually recommended setting up a talent AI talent mission you know across the governments so but uh that recommendation they actually it came out in a different way which government is

setting up a standing AI coming you know they are going to and there's so many fragmented initiatives across the country you know in AI skilling like so how do you actually bring all those into

one umbrella and create that AI talent pool for the government as well as for the private sector is what we think it's that's a very good report that has been launched

&gt;&gt; I think I think we need a AI just for coordinating government that I think is a starting bat we can start with that you know what I'll do thank you very much uh you know I I I can keep asking

questions but I'm sure people over here have questions as well of the panel uh we'll give some mics if anybody has any questions please uh just if you have a specific

question to a panel member please ask them specifically &gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Um yes. Uh so when we are talking about education and a person who is working in

in education, I wanted to understand from law to healthcare to the education system that we are talking about any individual that is going to be like taking a job in future how skills and

capacities are being changed from 21st century skills to AI skills. what will be replaced by the skills uh that are required to for a person to let's say work with AI or what what are all sort

of changes in curriculum are required per se to know where the students are going to head in future so that is one question that I wanted to ask &gt;&gt; yeah that's exactly what I said before

you know we came out with a road map which actually identifies all that you know at what level we need to actually introduce AI courses you know so that uh students right from certain level

understand AI first as you rightly said you know so uh and government of India under Ministry of Education they also actually set up NSDS national skill development uh you know centers where

they're actually offering these AI courses that's one aspect of it second MSM is that's one of the biggest sector in India you know they contribute almost more than 50% of the GDP but they don't

actually use technology ology and forget about AI. So that is one sector where the government is also focusing on to build skills so that their productivity increases. So one study that was done

earlier long back you know said that why is that the MSMES remain without you know improving uh their income uh and returns on so one of the biggest uh you know roadblock for them is they don't

just don't use technology forget about AI even basic IT tools also they don't use so you need to start from there you know build the technology and then come to AI so but again MSMES are into

different uh levels of maturity certain MSMES they do have technology then how do you introduce AI to them that's a planned approach strategic approach you know you need to actually adopt so right

from schools to colleges to undergrads to PGs to fellowships that's a whole life cycle you know level of uh educational programs we are actually recommending

&gt;&gt; uh uh hi I wanted to ask about the uh like how do you think the uh the the police or like the people who are uh protecting us should be trained in order to uh like find the upcoming uh

state-of-the-art uh like uh uh cyber hacks that are happening plus like how do you the my uh second query will will be it should be in those regional languages and like how should like uh

not just the training but uh uh the uh inference from from the inference sides of things how should that be done? &gt;&gt; Yeah. No, I think uh you know this is something that uh MHA recognizes is a is

a need this issue of you know obviously there has been cyber hacks and particularly those that have been targeted towards financial crimes and so on. And uh today I would say it's

probably the number one of the first topmost things that the government is looking at from a protection perspective. You you're seeing the RBI is involved in this. The you know the

home industry is involved in this. The various banks there's a lot more. It starts with awareness. Number one is you know in in cyber the the likely victim is the one that has to be made aware

that these things can happen. Um and there is a huge budget that is now has been created around awareness in particular but uh beyond that uh you know

&gt;&gt; some 25,000 uh you know what something is given as insight you know &gt;&gt; uh I mean people who lose money you know they're going to come is going to pay something like that

&gt;&gt; so so there is a there is understanding of that now the problem that you're highlighting is a global problem it is not just a India specific problem and the solutions are also So have to be

done at that level of scale. So I don't think this is something that is just a bhat problem. U the advantage that and obviously you are aware of what Saram and others are doing but the level of

voice capabilities that are getting built in AI and solutions in India is actually a very big positive for us. you know uh visa explained that but one of the things that we are seeing is voice

is going to become the primary means of communicating with technology in India we already seeing a lot of that happen you know Adalat is a great example of all transcription everything is

happening now voice makes technology accessible and these problems require that accessibility right somebody should feel comfortable being able to communicate and say this is what has

happened to me so I think &gt;&gt; and just to add most of these tourist departments. They have cyber security cells within their organizations and they're well equipped you know both

technically they have that kind of expertise also built within the organizations that's being done. &gt;&gt; Uh hi [clears throat] sir my question is to Mr. Uh Utkash sir uh I was reading a

newspaper report recently in which um there have been two startups which have come up um in which they have built an AI model which studies the material which is um published by the companies

which are listed on the stock market. So they do all those uh stuff to analyze. So they say there are 3,000 to 5,000 paper report that a single company submits to the stock exchange by which

people can actually analyze and make the decision to kind of forecast what and when they do need to put in money and when they do need to take it back. So I was uh seeing a startup pitch also on a

similar note in which these uh AI generated models are actually transcripting it making it short and making it worthwhile for the people to actually analyze and then make a

decision. But still people find it very uh &gt;&gt; what's the question? Yeah, but still people uh think that when they transcript all of this and make it in a

smaller uh decision- making forum, do we still think that AI is equipped enough alone technologically to make it as a decision making uh [snorts] forum for the people or the general public to

answer to that? &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, I'll I'll take this to the legal context in which I work because it's step one is transcribing what you're saying, right? So getting that

accurately which is already a hard problem because the language is whether it's finance or law it's technical it's Indian languages we don't have technology for those uh interfaces. So

that's one and the second is to build that intelligence layer on top of that material that leans and understands context right. So for example how to interpret a law reading section 2A with

section 10 of the act and drawing the import of the law is a human analytical skill which AI still hasn't figured out. So I think the the next step which you're talking about actually requires a

lot of work. It requires experts to become data annotators. Today data annotators are largely those that are tagging speech output and text output and training models. Now the work is

shifting to lawyers, financial experts training these models. So that the next layer of analysis comes in and that's where the harder part is. I will though say that in the law I am a little

nervous about this being given out as legal advice. There are actually very serious risks or challenges around it. First regulatory the bar council. How do you allow a non-licensed lawyer to give

legal advice and someone to act on the legal advice? And second you know you could be held for professional malpractice. What are the kind of safeguards uh that someone can have? So

you want to make this accessible but while within the import of the law and for finance, law, healthcare, the biggest uh challenge here will be how do regulations keep up? How does the

regulatory framework enable these to provide technically technical information that's otherwise inaccessible but also in a way that's safe and that's going to be a big

question mark for the regulatory space going forward. &gt;&gt; So we're just uh short of time so last question. &gt;&gt; Should I go ahead? Yeah, this question

is to Prashant and James. As philanthropists or funders of social impact, what are some key principles pre-AII and postAI that you're looking in the post AI environment that is

guiding your philanthropy? Um well I one of the things that uh so I work in development broadly and so the thing that happened contemporaneously with AI becoming very popular was uh

America decided it didn't want to do foreign aid anymore. Um and so that I think has transformed the whole conversation around what social impact can mean. Um in particular in contexts

where public funds have have are kind of are limited. And I think this what it has done is it has changed how people think about you know how are we going to address problems like early childhood

development, maternal health, moving really towards a focus on cost effectiveness um and you know uh delivering effective state capability uh in ways that are techn technologydriven

um and and and yeah ultimately much less much less expensive. Um, so that kind of focus on on on reducing cost by leveraging tech technology is what I see as the as the kind of as the critical

change. It's it's not so much that it didn't exist before. I think rocket learning are illustrative example. They are working with government and they are able to deliver highly cost-effective

interventions as a result of technology. But I just see that now expanding radically. &gt;&gt; Last words. No, I I think I'll just say that uh uh

the more hairy problems that we were never uh as philanthropists were uh comfortable taking on, I think we'll take on bigger bigger bigger challenges and problems and uh I think that's the

shift you'll see. So hopefully this diffusion of AI uh in a cost-effective manner to be able to solve these hairy problems is what we'll want to champion and take forward.

Well, thank you everyone for uh and thank you to panelists for a very engaging discussion.
