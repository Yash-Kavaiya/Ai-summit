## 📝 Transcript

Thank you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So now I'll hand over uh the stage to Caroline Edmund. Uh the stage is all yours for next 55 minutes. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Oh yeah. Awesome. So good

afternoon everyone and welcome to our session on unlocking impact shared data platforms for AI innovation in development cooperation. Thank you so much for joining us today. I'm happy

that so many people came here to hear and talk about the topic. Uh my name is Carolyn and I will be hosting today's session. But before we start, I would like to walk you through today's agenda.

We prepared a great mix for all of you today. Starting off with a panel discussion uh looking at the topic like from different angles discussing the vision behind shared data platforms how

they are governed and what it actually looks like to put it in practice AI ready data infrastructure and afterwards we will have something flashy something new uh we will show you

a demo that hopefully excites you as much as excites me right now uh on a shared data platform called Nefle which was recently developed by the German Federal Ministry for Economic

Cooperation and Development. And in the end we would like to open the floor for a Q&amp;A in order to have a little interaction with you here in the audience and discuss the topic with you

together. So let's get it started with our amazing panelists here. And so let me please introduce you very quickly our amazing panelists. Starting off with Nupura Gavde. She leads the digital uh

public good initiative at the civic data lab where she channels over a decade of experiences into building user centric digital solutions. Nupora, thank you so much for being here today.

Please also welcome Nafia Lam. Uh she um uh sorry uh she's a data specialist at the um digital AI and innovation hub of the United Nations development program where she leads the hub's work on the

governance of data exchanges. Hello Navia, thank you so much for joining us today. And last but definitely not least uh Dr. Ilia Nickel. He is the chief data scientist as well

as the head of the data lab of the German federal ministry for economic cooperation and development where he advocates not only for the digital transformation of the ministry of the

administration itself but also pilots data and AI tools for policym. Thank you so much for joining us today. So I will come to you now and uh Nafia actually my first question goes to you because at

UNDP yeah at UNDP you work on the design you just squeeze like that I just finished my question and then yeah so at UNP you work on on on the design and on the governance of a data

exchanges you work on like governance frameworks responsible ones you work on digital public goods and AI like so many things like from that global perspective that you are having can you tell us a

little bit about how you think the role of data and AI actually evolves in development cooperation and where our current approaches might fall short &gt;&gt; uh thanks so much Ko good afternoon

everyone good evening actually I'm not jetlagged uh good evening everyone it's So nice to be here. Thank you all for attending the event and thank you um colleagues for organizing this. Uh Ko,

that's a very timely question because we've been hearing conversations about data since time immemorial except for with AI we see that it's assumed this renewed importance and despite that like

Caro highlighted in her question, we see so many approaches fall short. Um so why is that? So let me just take you back quickly and really talk about how data evolved over the years especially in the

Indian context. Um we've seen that from 2010 to 2020 when we think about data essentially what we were focused on is just collection and then digitizing it. So what data was really doing all along

for us in the development context as well was just giving us these tools or these information points for service delivery. Now with AI that has radically shifted because data is no longer just

informing what kinds of tools need to be created, what kinds of services need to be delivered. It's now tracing all of these patterns. So essentially it's predicting outcomes that can affect the

course of so many lives and shape so many outcomes in um a radical manner. Um except for this didn't come about only because of gen generative AI although that's the dominant narrative. I think

several factors played into it. One of it was the pandemic real time. They needed to understand how to deliver vaccines, who was falling sick, how is the disease spreading and

what kinds of tech technical technological interventions were required even. Um so we were no longer countries were no longer looking at just you know creating digital platforms

which was definitely part of the course up until then and they needed some some some sort of intervention that could really um tell them in real time what kinds of interventions they had to make.

So I think the pandemic played a massive role. generative AI of course but administrative data especially is having a moment where we see that social registries for example the ones that

informed um systems like Aadhaar which we're so familiar with are no longer just giving us data points right it's essentially now an entire database that tells us what kinds of populations are

vulnerable who exactly um is is at is is um which sorry what kinds of migrants are at um risk the kind of surveillance system systems that countries are known to be um piloting in the in the guise of

DPI. All of that is happening in real time and that's that's how you've seen data shift from just being a tool for service delivery to um to um to just being more um sorry um from service

delivery it is just becoming towards pattern recognition. Um in terms of where exactly it's falling short, I think despite the abundance of hearing data governance and data, you see that

AI readiness across different countries in the even in low maturity context is mostly about coming out with shiny new AI strategies. uh not focusing on data governance by and large and only

thinking about compute and talent without thinking about what exactly do we need to be able to ensure that these approaches are sustainable in the long run and data can really just move that

needle when it comes to sustainability and ensuring that AI investments acrue returns in the long run. Thank you Ko. Thank you so much Navia. So coming to you Napura um you at the civic data lab

you work a lot with like governments you work with civil society organization and with communities um and you try to turn public data into actionable tools. So drawing from that

experience, where do you think is like the biggest gap between like the almost holy promise of data and AI and the actual impact it has in decision making in the development co uh context?

&gt;&gt; No, first of all, thank you so much for having me here and thank you for that question. I think it's a very very uh important question that even we try to answer here in India as well. Largely

what we see is um you know there is no uh issue of data scarcity at this point of time. You know there is a lot of data that is sitting out there. The problem is more about you know how do we make

this data more usable at this stage. Um we see a lot of issues when we are working with governments when we are working with civil societies or any kind of uh stakeholders at this point that

the data is sitting at silos. uh the data is sitting with the departments but one department is not speaking to the other and that is exactly where you know the intervention needs to sit in is not

about you know just plugging some central platforms and just bringing it down to the local levels but what does the local issues at this point stand with so that is one second problem is

also I would say problem but this is more like a practice that we are trying to induce right now is more about the participatory approach because right now we see a lot of data platforms our

infrastructure is talking about reporting mechanisms or data sharing mechanisms for the upper tier of folks where there is a lot of governance there are bureaucrats all of them sitting but

what about the communities you know they are sitting on a lot of native data sets a lot of interesting data sets which will bridge a lot of this gap of uh that would be needed for the AI use cases to

flow better. So I think the participatory approach of community participation I can just draw an example. We work a lot in climate action and especially when we are talking about

the northern states in India or the northeastern states in India we have this practice of having the village elderlys reporting the disasters that are happening every year due to floods

or due to landslides and everything and these are appointed by the government. So they they do put this data points out there which have been collected very tacitly uh by the government but not

being converted as a proper data set at this point. So how this and it's a very rich data set if you have to do predictive modeling further for disasters and all it's a very rich data

set to have these periodic records as well. So I think that's an interesting thing and the third part is largely lies around capacity building at this point where we see that um capacity building

also happens in silos where we are talking about the governance capacity separately the community capacity building separately but if there is a co-creation between these capacity

building practices also I think we will be able to have better shared data platforms better uh contribution to this data platform so they don't stand still at a point.

&gt;&gt; Oh, very interesting. Thank you so much, Nupora. And uh Ilia, you heard us now talking a lot about like data sharing, data exchanges and all of that. Uh but you and your team actually started

already in your uh ministry. I mentioned this very uh in the beginning in my introduction that we will see a demo later on a little bit more details about it. Uh you started to develop a data

platform called Nephil. So what actually motivated you and your team to start something like that? Because I guess there are also some uh barriers to overcome when starting something like

that. Why what what motivated you here? &gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely definitely it's um uh I I a lot of what you have said resonates with the other side here sitting as as a uh somewhat governmental official. It's

really difficult to make governments believe in the value of data and especially data sharing, giving away data to others unfortunately and we're still working on that. So since this has

been well known that Germany takes data governance very seriously. Um um the European Union actually decided to to fund and sponsor us um oh thank you to fund and sponsor us um about three and a

half years ago to fund a data lab project within all German ministries and that's been a very nice approach to um you know give some external drive to the whole problem and make people um in

within the government assemble people within government data scientists to try out the um new approaches and what we did is basically uh fund a number of platforms. It's not a large number. It's

about three or four that are somewhat working within the German uh data government uh data scene of the German government and that's one of them has to be mentioned is by the by the foreign

office some of the colleagues are here um is is plain uh that is a secure platform and then we have an open platform we try to also build a open platform that is better suited for

collaboration like for example with India um and that that infrastructure is built on on the cloud on on the cloud. Anyhow, it still took us uh about two years now to do as little as uh manage

to exchange data with GIS and KFW, the development bank in in Germany. It is a tedious task I must say and that's about 10 to 50 times slower than the technological development which is

pretty quick. Um not only the development we see in AI, I'm just talking about uh finding solutions, building solutions. You can do this within a few weeks now or even faster

within a day if you really want to use AI coding. Um you can you can have your prototype ready in in in a few hours. Um it will will work about 80% 70% of the time but still it's very fast but for

the procedures um we still need months. uh and that that's a a conflict that I find uh that we have to address and discuss openly actually and I'd be happy to to continue collaboration. Um and

that's actually the approach we took. We build things together in order to if you work together find out that you cooperate on a political level so to say together better in a better way. So that

the approach is a kind approach is kind of technical approach. Yeah. work, find a solution together, code something together, and then uh find out that that your teams work together better and and

produce results together and then make it happen uh make it public. &gt;&gt; All right. So, you you just mentioned some barriers and I think everyone here in the the room can relate to that when

it comes to government institutions. Um, so we're really happy that you started something like that, but maybe you can elaborate a little bit on how those barriers or those challenges are to be

overcome. How do you navigate like tensions around things like data so accessibility or something like interoperability which is the big thing when it comes to government

institutions? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yes. Um it's a task of going back and back and throw. We we are what we doing is actually um we we are working in

different perspectives if you want to put it that way. We have the infrastructure perspective which is very important. There is little infrastructure little common

infrastructure that that that leads you to the platform uh thought of course immediately. So there is too little infrastructure uh available to all of those who want to develop something. So

that has to be there and in parallel you need data culture. You need to uh address the people that are interested in products and and talk to them and um make them hand you your use cases and

then if if they get interest then they then they create a certain pressure on the on the system to uh uh to create products and then once you're in that area that you can actually start the

project and you have the infrastructure to work on it. um then you can use a certain framework of rules and say that for example we usually start with open data which is uh not sensitive um the

demo I'm going to show to you uh in a moment is also um also uses open data that's available um and and that makes the use case visible especially to the decision makers to the to the heads that

are somewhat reluctant to to or it's difficult to explain to them what a platform idea means what the whole thing that the whole thing will you know create value in two years or something

like that that's that's something difficult to explain outside of the technological technological scene or the technologic colleagues if you want so that's that's the third step then is to

uh to find the the right uh interoperability start with nonsensitive data explain the uh the outcome explain the the product uh make it visible and then you can switch to the real data so

to say the real use cases. So that's mostly the way we found. Maybe you find this applicable in your projects. Um at least with governments or with our government, it somewhat seems to work.

Also, I must say to the to the colleagues from foreign ministry, if you have sensitive data, you can always switch to the secure layers, but that takes about 10 times longer or maybe

five times longer at least uh until your product is ready. So that's our experience. That's the way we tried to tackle the problem of data culture within the government.

&gt;&gt; Well, it feels like you get everybody excited about the demo in a few minutes though. So, thank you very much for that. So, Navia, I want to come back to you because now you heard like about an

example of a national German example. But again coming to like an international level here, you at UNP you work with countries across the globe actually but with very different like

levels of digital maturity. So from your experience, which are the governance principles that are essential or that need to be in place in order to make data exchanges as well as data or AI

ready infrastructures like trustworthy and exclusive and also usable like in different or diverse national contexts. Thank you Ko. So I think the first principle in and of itself is to really

think about how governance is not a one-sizefits-all approach. That's often said, but what it really means when we're going to different countries and implementing is very different. So every

country even if they're in a low maturity context where they are struggling to even collect data let alone digitize it we see that they are like I was mentioning earlier they're in

a rush to sort of bring this investment in and therefore they think the way that they can do that is to have this national AI strategy in place or a data governance law in place. It takes a lot

to be able to draft a law pass it from build to legislation and then enforce it. But many countries in low maturity context or even medium maturity context aren't necessarily even thinking about

enforcement. They're just like what does it take to be able to um invite investment in. So when you think about governance principles that can apply across different contexts. I think

thinking about governance in and of itself and thinking about it in the absence of laws and policies is something we found very helpful in low maturity to medium maturity contexts. So

what does that mean? In the absence of laws and policies, what does a governing principle even look like? Essentially, what we end up asking countries to think about then is do you have a governing

logic in place when you're thinking about data? And that doesn't have to reside in a policy that doesn't have to reside in a law right at the get- go. And we find that to be useful when we

are um thinking through uh principles that we're trying to now apply across different countries. Two, I think what's really essential like IA was mentioning earlier also is to start with a use case

as opposed to starting with the governance part of it or the policy part of it. What exactly is the public policy challenge that you are trying to solve for? And if you have a startup ecosystem

that's thriving or even nent in your country, what exactly can your data and AI really do to be able to solve that public problem? That's really important. Three, across different countries and in

different contexts, we see interoperability being used around quite a bit. And essentially the way that we are now advocating interoperability across different countries is to think

about it beyond just the technical layer. Um many a critical governance principle is to distinguish uh technical interoperability from operational interoperability. Technical

interoperability only resides at the technology layer, but operational interoperability really thinks about governance, thinks about the context the country is in, thinks about whether

they're even in a place to enforce um all of the governance principles that is otherwise deemed to be good governance. Um the other the the other aspect that we see very useful and

that really cuts across all contexts is to really just think about sequencing and helping countries think through sequencing instead of just sort of rushing to incorporate a European

Union standard. We've seen that in India a couple of years ago when we were thinking about data protection where there was a rush to sort of look at the GDPR incorporate it and call it a day

and we we see that across different contexts in Africa right now and we see those approaches failing. So walking governments through each of the the context that they are in is also a

critical governance principle that we are finding very useful as opposed to just importing legislation from the European Union only because it worked in their context. So there is a lot of um

capacity building there as well when it comes to governance where we're trying to help policy makers around the world try and think of approaches that are not necessarily European Unioncentric and

borrow best principles from there but also learn to contextualize it in their uh in their context. So there's a lot of confidence building capacity building it's it's all rolled into one and that

in and of itself becomes a governance principle. &gt;&gt; All right thanks you. So um Nepora you also just like Navia you work across sectors and across regions. So uh in

your experience what or your in your opinion what does actually meaningful like international cooperation around data and AI mean in practice for you? Where do you see like the greatest

opportunities but also greatest risks here? &gt;&gt; Right. Thanks a lot. I think I'm going to build on what points both of them mentioned is uh the biggest uptake that

we are seeing right now from the practice perspective is also what is the use case uh uh approach at this point of time. So even if we talk at large on the infrastructure level, I think if that

infrastructure is being able to solve a use case challenge, I think that is where we have better collaborations between u you know the international cooperation part that you mentioned. Um

again I'm drawing examples from the uh climate action work that we have been doing where we look at uh shared problem approach. you know we are looking at problems that India is facing at this

point and also you know Asia Pacific is facing at large at this point of time and we see that the there are a lot of issues which might be quite similar of course contextually in the geography

there are different indicators different u geographical parameters that we might have to look at but there are layers of technology which can be adopted from one place to the other itself as well and

that's where we are proposing something and we we experimented something in the last two years is the sectoral data collaborative approach um where we look at how do we why do we reinvent the

wheel always why don't we bring in a collaborative approach where there are different layers of this technology that come within this collaborative and help the change makers or help the

stakeholders to analyze which layer needs to be used for what kind of a problem. Now these can be standards. Now these can be um analytical tools. This can be your evaluation tools that we

bring in or this can be even data sets to begin with. Of course the base of everything should be the data sets and as Elas was mentioning it has to start with open source. It has to the base

layer has to be open source on which then you can think whether it has to be the purest approach of open source or we still have the other formats as well. But one thing in our practice is and

this is where we have better collaborations with other countries right now from the Asia-Pacific region is um having them plugged in through our collaboratives and uh we'll also be

displaying this uh on 18th. So I'm just using this moment to [laughter] to promote it. But uh yeah, so this is one thing and uh the second thing is um how do you celebrate change makers you

know just by talking about my technologies best is not happening for us. Uh when we have data change makers who use these collaboratives who participate consume contribute to this

collaboratives and then they put out word out there you know for others to use. I think that's the purest form of celebration for us and um I think that is that is where you will have the

maximum communities joining hand as well and the silos will break down. So along with the technology it's also important to celebrate these change makers their methodologies their usability uh

information that they're putting out and what what worked well for them. You know every use case is unique and that uniqueness of the use case is the celebration point. Thank you so much

Napura and uh at the end I would like to take you through a little thought experiment here. So if you close your eyes and you are imagining now you're advising a government that is actually

thinking about starting or engaging into like a shared data and AI platform. What do you think what would be the first question this government should actually ask themselves before getting started?

Like what's the one thing that you would advise them? Okay, have you thought about this? What will you do? So Navia I will uh give the word to you first. What's the one question here?

&gt;&gt; Like I was mentioning earlier also Caro and I just like to touch upon that again. It's essentially starting with a simple question. What am I trying to solve for? Who am I trying to solve for

and who are the people that are most affected and who if I'm then using technology if I'm trying to collect data use data in any of any form then use AI as a layer on top of that. um

essentially think about whether that in itself can solve the problem. More often than not with social challenges, technology is only an enabler and AI can then expedite that. But there could be a

variety of reasons as to why a certain sector is plagued with the challenges that it is and many of those challenges in in many developing countries like they're they're decades long and

centuries long even. So this idea of sort of rushing towards thinking of technology as this ultimate fix for social problems has proved to be disastrous in the past and with AI it

can it can just make it far worse if in case governments and countries are not really starting with most simple questions and thinking about who am I trying to solve for and why am I trying

to solve for it. No, what do you think? What's the one question the government should ask themselves? I think uh most importantly what's important here is the co-creation aspect. I think u uh nothing

can be built individually here and uh that's where I feel u if there is co-creation where government is open to co-created with the practitioners uh there are two uh opportunities and two

good things that will happen with this one u uh the technology and the infrastructure will be used in the right way and will be developed in the right way and second thing is beyond the

practitioners also this knowledge gets transferred to the government as well to keep maintaining it to keep sustaining it and to uh you know think about the newer ways of how to grow this further

as well because eventually they are the decision makers but what is more important is how do they co-create to bring other practitioners in the space as well to um you know go for that long

longer shot for keep it maintaining at this point &gt;&gt; very good thank you and Ilia I I will ask you as well although you are of course a representative of the

government and you have already started to do something like that Maybe from your experience, what's the first question you have been asking yourself or you should have done it in the past?

&gt;&gt; Well, the the question I ask myself most is why are you so afraid? Uh in Germany at least um that just there's it doesn't hurt to do uh to use data for public good and uh maybe I can now go and show

you how we do the we try to tackle that approach. Right. &gt;&gt; Should I start? &gt;&gt; So, wait a second. Just one more time. Thank you so much for the panelists

here. Please uh stay here and then we will actually because we will have a Q&amp;A. So, if you're already like, "Yes, I have so many questions to those lovely ladies here. Please wait until the end.

We will have some time for a Q&amp;A." And now I would like to move forward to something that I have promised you in the beginning. a little like sneak peek into a shared data platform uh that was

developed by the German government called Nefle. So please IA go ahead. &gt;&gt; Can you can I you can okay very good. Um all right what we did here is um I present you the platform that we are

using. We use this for actually mostly experimenting for kind of uh playing around. So um some things work, some things fail. Uh that's something that governments don't usually do. But what

it gives you is the ability to actually um also employ vision and experimental uh new technologies and that's something I would would like to start with. Um so I think that of course platforms are the

way to uh to to work to unlock the the potential um of AI and especially so in corporation. Why is corporation so important? Because the data is still needed for AI. AI is has that word

knowledge, but if you really want to unlock the power for your specific sector, then you need the data that goes with it. Otherwise, you will lose the context that AI that makes AI so

powerful. And on on platforms, you can do that and you can move from the data layer to a context layer, which is much more interesting because it contains information basically, not only data.

All right, let's go into that. Uh, who of you in the room has an agent that is active on Maltbook? Uh, oh yeah, yeah, yeah. I see a hand. Very good, very good. Okay. The others

are just too shy to mention it or you haven't started yet. Okay. I have no Oh, yeah. There's another one. Great, great, great. So, that's that's the guys you're looking for for if you if you want to

hire someone. Um, okay. By the way, so uh Moldbook, who has who has not heard of Moldbook yet? All right. Thank you. Thank you. So I can otherwise I would have to uh just jump over my next slide.

Now mult is the place where agents go to connect and that where they can exchange and and you know just talk without humans. Uh so it's very relaxing for them. This is this is maltbook. Try it

out. Actually, the guy who uh started uh Open Claw, the uh popular agent that drove most of this multiple hype, has been hired by Sam Outman for Open Air yesterday.

Um I didn't read anything about the amount of money that was involved. Anyhow, um I'd be curious. Oh, he's here, I think, or at least virtually. So, um or will be anyhow. um that sum up

what I mean. So so the the the AI agents go there and then they exchange uh the things they think or talk about like for example humans they talk about the humans how nice the humans are. This is

most pro the most uh popular page on on maltbook the submalt about humans but they also talk about AI summits for example I found found them talking about that it's not this one this is an AI

summit that they set up and they they talked about let's have an an AI summit without humans so that we can exchange thoughts on AI it's quite funny um so who of you is has been hired by an agent

uh to listen in to this session and and report back to the agent. Ah, okay. So, AGI is not here yet. Good. Okay. I'm just asking because, uh, if you think this is science fiction, just

go to hire a human.ai. Um, they're still paying quite nicely at the moment. Um, so, uh, AI agents are well pretty simple beings, so you might you might find a job there. Anyhow, um, I certainly tried

it. Uh, I haven't I haven't gotten an offer yet. Um, anyhow. So, so uh uh what does notebook have to do with all this? Um because I I started this because it's a platform. It's a platform of AI agent

exchange actually uh without humans and uh this this is ungoverned. They do strange things there. Most of it is sloth. It's low quality output but it works. There are few rules and the

concept is actually functioning and that that's where where the hype started. So the question of course is how can we make this work for us without just having AIs converse and also collaborate

with instead coll have them collaborate with humans with real humans and make create impact from that and I believe it is very powerful um or will be at least so we talked a lot about data spaces

that's the uh big issue and and it's still it's an amazing problem for governments to be able to share data uh especially have data governance that everyone agrees on takes a long time. I

told you about that. And then you can create data services and that works. Best infrastructure cloud platform. But the next step I believe we've already been talking about is a context

platform. What do I mean by that strange term? I mean just you have the data and then you add the context, the knowledge of the data, the details of the data. Usually we have an MCP layer, model

context protocol layer to find your sources, resources, sorry, and exchange uh context. context means just that not only you have the data but the agent or the AI model that's using that data

knows what it is doing with that data and that makes it so valuable. Uh so it can apply world knowledge or specific knowledge like a soul file or something like that to interpret that data or you

have a uh uh something like a rag retrieval or generation uh to supply you with special data. Okay, that works nicely and I think uh the demos I'm I'm showing you in a second are just very

specific demos on using that applying that data. Um and we'll come back to the stage number three later. Uh now now um since this is a bit boring showing you all these buzzwords I might just go and

jump into the uh presentation into the presentation of Nephil. Um what we try to do here is just to have a common platform to do international projects together. So far it's only GISZ and KFW

together with BMZ the uh ministry for economic cooperation and development and um what we do what we have there is the data of our projects that we are working on. So this so this demo is only with

open data built with open data and then we apply AI models to that and we try it out. We just do different things. So for the user this is just a jump page. This is just a starting page where you can

click on things. It's really terrible. But for the user, actually the user doesn't care about your problems as a data scientist. It just cares about something it can click on and then

something works. And what you see here, for example, is an overview of the projects that BMZ financed and in this case BMW. I'm looking for an Indian project here. Um all of this has been

created by AI from project reports. So you use um you use just text files and then it extracts a structure and then it uses the structure to get you give you an overview. That's the context I'm

talking about. This uh is not a database act SQL database. This is a vector database and an AI working on that. So I uh selected a a project here from Ireina that's been financed by KFW 25 years ago

something like that um on renewable energy renewable energy power plants uh in India. And then if your uh overview doesn't sufface, you can always chat with the data. You probably know that

feature very well. Um in order to make the this uh a expert so to say on the data on on this project that's been 25 years or finished 20 years ago, nobody really knows about it anymore. So the AI

can answer the questions if you have any. All right. So that's what I'm showing here. what are the five biggest uh in case you can't read it, what are the five five biggest outcomes of that

project and AI tries to answer that. Is that accurate? No, it's about as accurate as human beings would answer. Um it's not 100%. So let's go on then. Uh this is just one example, but what

about cooperation? Here's a little application by KFW, a map that you can chat to. So I I asked what's Arena doing now? I uh requested used an AI chat uh to uh extract uh location data uh in a

file file type called geojson. It's actually very easy. The chat models are able to produce this and then I displayed it here on the map. You might not be able to see the dots. The blue

dots are power plants, renewable power plants. The red one is the offices of Arena here in uh in Delhi. Arida sorry. So because you cannot see that I just chatted with the um uh map and asked it

to draw circles around all the spots to make them easier visible. You can do all sorts of things. You can ask them what cities are within these circles and things like that and chat with it in the

the chat. So you can see the results now. It's a new uh layer that you can apply on that. Um so actually what happens is what the what should happen in the background is that the uh product

of the the the um portfolio navigator starts a chat with our map and then they you can display information that you find you information and continue chatting with your map then instead but

the AI models can also chat in the background if you've got the proper MCP layer set up um and why is that so interesting the uh so we're tackling different things here first of all the

the the applications have been developed by different teams they work together on a common platform they share the the same data which comes from the 13 Giz. So that's that's what we're talking

about and we're keen to just enable working together on a on a human level so to say and then we think that this uh improves greatly improves actually the uh the political level so to say as well

because you exchange data you create value together. Coming back to the beginning with moldbook what does that mean now? Is that is that the second stage? Is that already it? I believe not

of course otherwise I would have shown you that I think there will be a third stage uh with of course agents interacting because you don't only you don't always have to be a human being to

do this interaction and for that you also need a platform because you need a a regulated space that uh that works that where the agents that interact here uh are actually trustworthy because if

you don't have humans humans have access they get access uh you get uh certain accesses to certain data. The same can be applied to agents but you need some regulatory frame. Uh otherwise um you

will have wild agents discussing uh to found new religions. You might not want that. Um I don't know but if you do then look at mold book. Okay. Um so that's that's the vision and in order to um you

know implement such a vision within uh two months we've been thinking about this for slightly before mold book became a hype actually. Um, in order to to do such a thing, you also need a a

platform, a infrastructure that can work on other teams that are already experienced in working together and setting up such a uh such an visionary um um development of uh of platforms. So

I believe platforms work uh they are very simple technologically wise. They're actually more or less the cloud. So I think that's the way especially for governments work together enable us to

share a data and AI application at the same time maybe even go beyond that at some time you need a governance framework to be to be safe to be sure and uh then you can unlock the impact

together and when the all these things come in the future that you might be told about in the next uh days during the next days or over the next weeks and months it's very fast then you have

something that you can uh apply these visions on ratedly available. So, thank you very much. Uh, that's my little demo and I'm happy to take your questions. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much, Ilia. [applause]

Thank you so much. I hope all of you enjoyed that little demo here as well as the the panelist here. So, I would like to open the floor now for your questions actually. So, I see the first one uh up

already. One second. Here you go. Yes. Yes. Thank you. [clears throat] So I was asking the uh the thing you have made is the shared data like platform and we can interact

with it and we can uh and uh the agents can talk to it. So I was asking uh so am I right first of all uh &gt;&gt; uh well that that platform is not openly available yet. I mean the is that a

question? The map is actually open open source. Uh no I'm talking about the whole thing you you talked about that there is a shared data place uh all about the context and agents and you can

as well can talk to your shared context like and your data am I right? No, it's not built that way yet, but that is the vision. Exactly. Yes. What you have behind is a repository that uh registers

I I showed one of the slides in in the middle. There's there has to be a repository. We have that repository set up already that um um actually that the agents can or the uh models actually can

go to and uh find the right resources for their task. So they they register with the central registry and then if they if they need for example geospatial geospatial data they would be uh uh

directed to the map tool for example. That's that's the idea behind it. Yes. &gt;&gt; Uh yeah &gt;&gt; one followup. &gt;&gt; That was the that was the foundation.

&gt;&gt; So uh that was not my question. So my uh my question was so uh the the problem you're solving I solved it with just a git repository. So what the problem was? So I switch between multiple agents like

uh I'm in cloud code then I go to cursor then uh I'm in like VS code. So the problem is the uh I didn't I need like a centralized context. So what like what I did is uh I stored all my uh context in

a git repository and that is obviously that is private. So my all the data is like uh stored in a private space and my context is uh stored there. So I think um this can be uh like another s like

like solution for the data agents to interact with like with the centralized space of the data. So I &gt;&gt; Yes. So when you say this is private this is so to say your your uh uh

governance model it's very simple it's private so it's your data so to say. Yeah. But that that is the way it works. So if you have several organizations working together, you would share the

data within among those organizations and maybe have a a more different governance concept so that some agents see all of the data, others see only part of the data, something like that.

&gt;&gt; All right. Thank you very much. So another question here from the audience. Okay. Ah, you already have the mic. Very good. If you could kindly state your name and what company or organization

you are from so we know whom we are talking to. Thank you very much. &gt;&gt; Okay. Thank you from France. I'm an expert at global partnership on AI and I'm the the chairman of the national

council for geocized information in France. So my my question was about what you presented. Um do you access different kinds of sources and is are there sensitive sources and what are the

rules between the stakeholders? Well, the governance rules so that um the platform works because as well you mentioned data spaces at one point and in the data space as you know there is a

rule book but you didn't specify any of you about rule books and things like this rules of governance so can be maybe you or your other panelists which were who were very interesting answer that

what governance rules so that different actors can cooperate. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. I I I was a bit uh hesitant to um call it a data space at the at the bottom because that implies a certain uh

amount of regulation that that is not fully there. Just for for my government all I can say is that um it's unfortunately it's always since we are the first applying this it's always very

specific uh terms so to say it's always a unique case. Um unfortunately I would I would like this to and that's what the data labs are there for the data labs of the German ministries. I would like this

to to be a common uh solution so to say a rule book that can be applied to different uh to different uh data spaces or context uh spaces if you want to use that phrase. But at the moment, I admit

it's not there yet because it's too difficult to explain this uh need and this necessity. It's it's so we just discussing we're very much in in the very details discussing uh why is that

how sensitive is that data? Is all of that data exactly of the same sensitivity level? Is this terrible? Do we have to, you know, do we have to uh um just uh black out certain or leave

out certain parts of the data in order to this to be allowed? And how do we do this? We we apply actually to AI to uh to censor data so to say in order to get it on the platform. So it's

unfortunately a tedious task at the moment. Sometimes you feel like there's a clash of mentalities that this is so to say 19th 20th century not understanding the problems of the 21st

century. So Napura you were nodding when he was saying like you also work a lot with governments actually what's your stake on it &gt;&gt; u no I uh would like to add on what he

has mentioned um &gt;&gt; of course uh we do use the uh governance rule books which are mandatory like for example for us we do categorize between the sensitive data and the PI3 data and

all of these things but when it comes to you know especially we work largely on the sectoral part of it. So sectorally also the rule books change a lot or the guidelines change a lot. So certain

frameworks which are globally accepted we try to plug those in but we also keep that layer a little open so that you know that does not become like a complete barrier for data contribution

altogether. So for example we have procurement practices uh and there is a global standard of procurements and if you have procurement data coming in we do apply that as a rule book but in case

we have to look in right now we are looking at climate adaptation or the gender data collaboratives and things like that it's very difficult to pick upon one governance rule books uh at

this point but yes that's the way of you know the more the contribution happens we'll be able to shape that governance rule book together. So that's where my our approach is.

Nia, you want to add something? Yes, please go ahead. &gt;&gt; Um, something else that we speak to a lot of policy makers, especially in a low maturity to medium maturity context,

is also about non-personal data. Um so for context medium maturity countries are usually ones that already have patchwork regulation where they might have a data regulation law which is much

more broader but they may not like Nupura was mentioning they may not necessarily have corresponding sectoral laws or policies. So you will see that because many of the laws around the

world now borrow from European Union, you will see that there are references to sensitive personal data or personal data. But when you go down into sectors, none of that is present. And so there is

that clash so as to speak between a new horizontal law and these sectoral um sectoral regulations or policies. Um so in all of this we've also been advocating for thinking about thinking

about non-personal data even if again enacting legislation is too cumbersome again just thinking about policies as to how do how do you anonymize how do you avoid deanonymization what does

liability then look like and whether governments then have enforcement capacity so we see that that is working in medium medium capacity countries um but it's yet to be tested in low

majority contexts for other reasons. They're they're dealing with very different problems at the moment. &gt;&gt; Thank you to all of you. And I think we go to the next question. Yanik, where's

the next question going? &gt;&gt; Please go ahead. &gt;&gt; Hi. Hi everyone. This is Da. Okay. So my question to you as well as like to Napura and Nav also like how can

countries collaborate to create ethical AI job ecosystem rather than job displacement like how can German government along with Indian government can collaborate together to produce more

jobs. &gt;&gt; Interesting. So you're working for &gt;&gt; uh like basically I'm from two coms a recruitment firm in Kolkata. Oh &gt;&gt; okay interesting. So let's hear you were

actually directing the question to all of three or &gt;&gt; yeah to all three. &gt;&gt; Okay let's hear a quick answer then Navia please go ahead.

&gt;&gt; That's a great question. I do not know that I can make a comment on the geopolitical context but um essentially I think this goes back to what Nupura was mentioning earlier about capacity

building as well right so across regulations even in India for example you will see that there is a lot of reference to humans in the loop which is a very nice it feels nice it feels it

feels like a nice thing to say thinking that you're going this is a useful guardrail against so the harms against AI and all of that but what What does that really mean? There is a lot of

there's a lot of capacity building that's required. To answer your question about job creation, but that capacity building also has to be meaningful. It can't be one-off training sessions where

you go in and then tell people about the benefits of AI, but it also has to be a lot more systematic in a way that it actually creates meaningful jobs, doesn't displace jobs, and then it helps

people also sustain those jobs in the long run and they don't have to worry about those jobs being wiped out. So yeah, my answer in a nutshell would be long-term and meaningful capacity

building across the board. &gt;&gt; Is there anything to add from your side quickly? &gt;&gt; I can only say it's it's a battle on the future. It's it's very difficult to

answer this question. I often ask myself am I doing the right job here when when when you know talking to you on a conference obviously I am. I'm happy that you have so many people interested

in what I have to say. But is this is this really uh the most important job I could or should do. Um so for example, so I think sometimes if we have the capacity as human beings to to to use

all that wealth that's still being created by AI, we we we'll be able to manage and to to you know keep the world running so to say with with with tasks with uh with jobs. But there's a severe

danger that it will uh move into a different direction. Yes. But I cannot absolutely not answer what the future will give us. Just that we have to be careful and and watch it.

&gt;&gt; Okay. Thank you very much. I can see there are a lot of questions here in the room. But due to time constraints unfortunately I have to close the question uh right now the round of

questions here. But I'm pretty sure even after the session you can approach our uh panelists here and they would be happy to answer your question and get to into a little discussion with you. So uh

the lot of questions here in the room actually showed me that you thought this was an interesting topic which makes not only me but probably the entire round of apps here very happy. So uh what's left

for me is to say thank you very much for joining us today. I hope we could get you some insights into how data and AI could better support uh governments support data exchanges, AI ready

infrastructure and how we can move forward together across institutions and across countries. So thank you very much once more uh for being here today and I wish all of you a wonderful evening here

in Delhi at the II impact summit. Thank you very much. [applause] Can we do a last question please? Can we please do a last question already? &gt;&gt; It was really interesting session

because I also have a lot of questions but I I'll ask you off the stage. Uh so now I request uh uh Mr. Kapil Kant Kamill scientist CF from Sriak Mumbai uh to hand over the moments. I'll also

request uh Mr. Amul Surroshi scientist Steve from Sriak Mumbai to hand over the momentos. So we have four speakers and uh yeah so please please come on the stage. Uh

[applause] please please stay here sir. Huh? Yeah. Once we are done with that, we'll I'd request uh you to

uh thank you very much for joining us. Uh we'll have pictures. Yeah, please come forward. I request to please join us for the photograph.
