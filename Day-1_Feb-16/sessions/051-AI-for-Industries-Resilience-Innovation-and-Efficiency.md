## 📝 Transcript

Check check check check. Oh yeah, you can hear me. &gt;&gt; Excellent. Good. Okay. Namaskar everybody. Uh my name is

Upen Bar. I'm very honored to be here. Survita Sukaya. That means welfare for all and happiness for all. a fantastic get together of brilliant minds and um I'm

really honored again thanks thanks again for honorable prime minister Modi gi the joint secretary Sanjiv Singh gi uh of course the ministry of electronic um information techn electronic information

and technology I actually like their short form mighty that's pretty cool and uh of course all the coordinators to uh get such a fantastic get together uh a global platform really and uh our

partners Jaja Boore uh the German Indian innovation corridor uh together we are happy to bring in the session today. The session today is really about u yeah AI for industries

uh AI for industries uh with resilience innovation and efficiency. Uh JIIC is German Indian Innovation Corridor really focused on bundling many roads into a single super express highway or the

autoban as we call right. uh a very consequential uh innovation ecosystem between Europe and India with Germany being the central integrator so that we can shape the next generation of

progress uh for society and also economic progress with industrial digital and climate systems and not just uh through that there is a big opportunity and a mission to unlock a

potential 3 trillion euro opportunity over here not to think about 3x but uh 30x and to that um GIC has several key programs uh innovation scouting think tanks to landing pads deep tech hubs

many partnerships uh that we connect different ecosystems but let's go uh to the main topic here today and that's why we have fantastic people on the panel and the audience as

well it's really AI for industries there have been many definitions of it right so we like to always have a good working definition uh For me it's clearly uh you know application of all these new

technologies artificial intelligence to really optimize um these different sectors processes uh whether it's in manufacturing energy or aerospace logistics these are all related um you

know primary and let's say the secondary parts of the industry uh has been in the past uh growing a lot into automation right u automation with predictive analysis or uh getting getting

efficiency gains and so on. But what I mean to say is it's fundamentally very very different uh compared to the general AI that's being taught about a lot and that's entered your and my life

uh since since a few years. We need to focus on real world industrial challenges. Um and there are two things two A's that you can take uh together with human in the center. Uh it's the

augmentation. Who are we augmenting? which enterprises, which humans uh and and how can we manage that process from automation into autonomy and how can we have those autonomous ecosystems that

can work together uh based on the trust not only human to human trust but also human to digital and digital to uh human trust because we are living in an era where yes if something is not yet

connected it will be connected very soon. We're looking at new business models and economies where we probably don't want to own anything but we want to access everything and and AI has been

uh you know predominantly supporting uh that part as well but the skills of humans all of us around are very very important um this is a very unlikely scenario when when you look at um you

know core industries so how do we transform the industries now one way to really uh look at is articulation of futures and I'm a trained futurist and uh if you just take data um it will tell

you oh water water levels are rising there's a lot of rainfall there's climate issues so London can go uh underwater but that's just one dimension you look at the data put the data

together but that's not our job our job is actually that data plus our imagination and the inventions and innovations we are driving the same outlook turns into

something where we can be proud of where to focus on the new profit which is people, planet and purpose and this is going to help us shape the industries and think about shaping new industries.

uh we shouldn't forget that these are exactly the industries which sh which are facing the problems today uh with with skills with um a imbalance in terms of energy um but if you look at you know

friends in world economic forum um have done this and I I really like it AI in industries is is not a technology play right it can be so how do we look at because if you see the short-term and

the long-term risks here only two or three are actually technological we need to look at design we need to there is another problem I call it value of tears right it's lot of data uh is is just not

accessible look at the small and midsize segment which is going to be key in really adopting that AI how do we how do we you know take care of that uh the data bring it make it relevant make it

relevant for AI so AI becomes more meaningful for industries to start shaping the future shaping the future AI is also supporting another level where it's helping the scientists. Uh this

what you see is actually wood. It's transparent. Um the scientists have been able to uh yeah take out the opacity. But on the right what you see is actually a uh it's not a glass. Well,

it's a glass but it's a solar cell now. So what will it mean for the industries for the businesses that are building facades like that? You can actually produce um energy where it is required.

uh we are using a lot of u u AIdriven design and here's a example from metrica which enables us to reform and reshape a completely new industry and uh you know and and that's that's I think all for

all of us to discuss how we can shape uh transform the now but shape the future of these industries uh I believe we need a holistic approach we we need to think design not only technology And we need

to look at the new shop floors probably um with human machine teaming. There will be robots, cobots, machines and humans all in single play. How do we work for uh on on those scenarios with

trust but we will discuss this today and uh we'll discuss exactly how we can uh move forward and this was just a teaser for you to think about that the problem of adoption is a is a bit larger. Right?

So we have a a star panel with us today and I'd like to hand over to my partner and colleague uh CEO a dashing CEO Upasna Dash uh for running the panel now all yours.

Thank you everyone. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much Japan and uh on behalf of the German India Innovation Corridor Jajor Brand Consultancy welcome to what is going to be a very important and a

very very profound action panel. So firstly this is an historic week for all of us in India to have the AI summit here and you know the fundamentals of this summit are actually uh three-fold

people planet and progress and in line with that what we've convened today is a very important and strategic action panel. We're very lucky today to be joined by voices representing some of

the world's most important companies and some of India's most iconic startups all working under the framework of AI and also bringing together the innovation and the crossber exchange between two

very important economies Germany and India. On that note I would like to kick off and um my first uh question before I begin I would like to introduce our panelists. We have uh with us today Dr.

Lavnish Shana, Asia-Pacific head of government affairs at SAP. Welcome. Uh we have Madhav Krishna, founder and CEO of Vahan.ai. We have Miss Swati Shams Sundar, head of

research group, associate vice president, Semens. And we have Mr. Priyad Mahapatra, founder and CEO of Cube. Welcome to the panel everybody. [applause]

Great. And on that note, I will kick off and my first question is for you Dr. Chana. Thank you so much for being with us. Um, you know, you have a very strategic view of what's happening in

the ecosystem and from your point of view, where do you think AI is genuinely scaling today and where do you think it's really getting stuck? Uh, what do we really take to do to move it from

pilot to production? &gt;&gt; Thank [clears throat] you so much. U indeed a privilege to be with all of you on this very important topic on enterprise or industry use of uh AI as

we move from the digital India to digitally intelligent India. I think enterprise use of AI will play a significant role and that's where I wanted to start before I go into the

pilot to scaling uh discussion is probably the need to have a differentiated view to enterprise use of AI and consumer use of AI you know so that is where uh you know in terms of

the business use of AI probably we are looking at a far lowerhanging fruit in terms of quick adoption in terms of the boundary and and and and context in terms of the lower risks of

bias of safety of this vis. So I always use this analogy that consumer use of AI can be seen as the light bulb you know lightening everybody but it's the enterprise use of AI which is the

powerhouse which is the power plant at the back which is actually pushing all this and that's where it's uh and and if you see this power plant is already accelerated accelerating we did a survey

recently as SCP with the Oxford economics 23% of all business processes today as per Indian organizations are already supported by AI. That's where and the expectation is it will go to 41%

in the next 2 years. That's the velocity of uh acceleration. 93% 93% of the CXOs or CEOs that we surveyed believe that they will get a return positive return on their AI investments

in 1 to 3 years. That's the level of the uh confidence. No, but at the same time only 9% said that we are viewing it holistically because the experience from pilot to scaling is that's where we come

in. So that brings to uh the why part to the what more importantly is the how do we now scale it? How do we now take it forward that it becomes uh a journey from hype to reality. it it becomes a

journey from uh you know a verticalized approach that I took to a horizontal embedded approach in my in my strategy. So the first obviously uh step that all of us are now realizing as we as we

start absorbing AI uh into our business processes that we need to now move to hard metrics of measurement in terms of outcome and that is what will motivate people. That is what will motivate

industry peers to learn from each other rather than the the the sheer enthusiasm of technology pull or technology push that all of us were giving. Second thing that we are realizing is we need to look

at AI. If I look at AI as a tree, data is my soil. I think most of us are now realizing that you cannot grow roses in a rocky soil in a rocky terrain or you cannot grow a healthy AI on a toxic soil

of of data. That is where the realization and the same survey that uh we did um uh you know 72% of the respondents said that they feel they are still not data ready that's where is a

big issue and that that is a prescriptive way to look at by embedding AI into the business processes probably by converting into a horizontal the data layer we are automatically trying to

solve and third obviously is you cannot run faster faster than the ship you are traveling in. So the regulatory ecosystem, the regulatory guidelines, the geopolitical also have a big impact

and most of us have a different view but DPDP in India for that matter can actually provide a guardrail and and a boundary or or in which we can actually scale. So then somebody will ask hey

what's the next step forward? I think we have spoken enough on ROI uh you know initiatives that is return on investment. We now need to I can propose an impact framework that is the return

on impact that we are creating and if I expand this impact I to me frankly is infrastructure infrastructure that is uh the interoperability the digital uh uh platform M definitely is the measurable

outcomes that is where the pilots will scale and and mind you uh the experience is repeatedly showing that while the pilots can be underwhelming the return is nonlinear probably at the later stage

the return is exponential. So one learning that probably there is settling in is the return on investment on AI is is nonlinear. P obviously is policy and guardrails as I mentioned. A is AI as a

horizontal and not as a vertical. Now we have we have done enough on looking at it as a vertical. We now need to look at uh even as an enterprise user of or adopters of of AI we cannot do away

without the thought of C that is a citizen centricity and T obviously is my talent if I use this framework across this the scaling to pilot and mind you most of us are looking at this as a

value uh which is in the short to medium term we now need to look at a framework of strategic asset and that's where each one of us putting together will take it take us to a digitally intelligent India

with a vixit bharat the dream that all of us are moving forward. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Thank you so much for that some very important insights and I think a big

takeaway of that is that you know AI from a horizontal lens and not vertical. Um on that note Swati you bring to the table again a very innovative lens on looking at how both Germany and India

while separate economies also have so much in common and uh from that point of view I'd love to know from you where do you think both of these ecosystems can truly learn from each other and what can

they learn &gt;&gt; good afternoon everyone I I hope now you can hear me. &gt;&gt; Yes. Um it's um it's a very interesting question also to look at it from the uh

ecosystems and the economy standpoint, right? And um Germany and India both bring in very complimentary competencies. I mean on the one hand we have Germany which comes with its

manufacturing proess with its um rigor in enterprise infrastructure as well as regulation and um on the same note you have India with with leading u leading in um agility in R&amp;D

implementation speed as well as the digital edge that we all possess and um um Dr. Chana already spoke about the difference between consumer AI and enterprise AI and specifically when it

comes to industries and um scaling software as well as hardware offerings to billions of users. We believe that this uh handshake between both the economies has a key role to play, right?

Um, how do you build these scaling systems for billions of users but in cost innovative ways specifically in sectors like healthcare, like uh manufacturing, like process, like uh

automation, mobility and so on and so forth. And um at specifically Semens, a lot of these challenges have both the global dimension as well as the regional dimension, right? uh the problems of

data readiness uh were already articulated very well by both opin and by uh Dr. Chanana. Um it's not only about um the AI that has been democratized because I think today we

are able to see very nice looking showcases prototypes um and the goal is to take all of this to production to really the shop floor but there is still that gap that barrier that needs to be

crossed from taking these PC's these prototypes into action right while making sure that there is robustness that there is reliability in these operations.

Now um beyond data there's also the mindset factor right um we as humans we are no longer the only active workers on factory we are operating amidst cobots collaborative robots amidst um

autonomous agents and this requires a mindset shift in the way that we interface in the way that we interact and that I think from both the economy standpoint is not a challenge but an

opportunity that that we're yet to leverage fully. And here the ecosystem has also a crucial ro role to play. Um we're looking at it not only from an enterprise collaboration standpoint but

what we at Seammens also refer to as the research and innovation ecosystem. Right? were including startups um private and public uh partners partnerships uh with several companies

universities as well as research institutes on both sides and GIC also as a catalyst here uh in in making these many to many handshake fruitful right so um I think more than challenges we are

up for a lot of opportunity and beyond the democratization of AI that has already happened how we can leverage this in order to make industrial AI a reality Really

&gt;&gt; thank you so much Swati and I think you reaffirmed the fact that both Germany and India are more alike than apart and I think the next decade is going to show us a lot more of how they can both learn

from each other. Great. Moving on uh Prio uh you know you're doing some extremely important work in healthcare in India and especially in tier 2 tier three cities. um from your point of view

right what is your take on how AI is really going to change the way Indian healthcare is going to work and the work that you've already done so far what have been your biggest learnings

&gt;&gt; thanks thanks for asking me uh just to set the context uh we're trying to solve for rural healthcare and when you visualize rural healthcare you visualize this primary healthcare centers I heard

somebody saying dingy lighting you'll be very lucky to find doctors there most of the time there'll be no doctors you'll be lucky to find paramedics. If you visit the coastal belt, you will see

PHC's where probably cattles and dogs will be roaming around. This is a problem impacting a billion people in this country. Most of our healthcare infrastructure if you look at it, we

have world-class infrastructure is all restricted to the top eight cities of state capital at most catering to 300 350 million urban semi-urban population. So for us to solve this problem for a

billion people using technology and AI was not a choice. It was the only way because there is no way you could send doctors to these remote medically underserved locations. So we had to

think very differently. So we created an approach which was hybrid in nature. We built the platform. We set up clinics on one side a very robust tech platform. But to engage with a rural audience and

make them health aware was extremely difficult because unlike you and me and I call us privileged if we have a health issue our family our peer group everybody tell us take a day off go and

meet the doctor for them they're constantly debating it's one day loss of income can I procrastinate so when you're catching them you're actually catching them at a time when the

condition is either acute or chronic let me give you an example a lot of them chew bittlenut and when you start chewing Betlut you start developing early signs of oral cancer you will have

difficulty in opening your jaws. So to make it easier as an anesthesia you eat more bitlen nuts. So you're accelerating the process. Now we created a very interesting product. We trained

people in rural and we call them swastitas and say hey go meet somebody all of them are chewing bit just tell them I'll take photographs of your teeth upper jaw lower jaw and instantly I'll

tell you a risk stratification where do you stand and send it as a report now the idea was not to create fear because if you create fear you fail the idea was to tell them hey there could be a risk

by the way there is a clinic available right next to you which is completely tech managed walk in there and we'll get a doctor to see So for me using AI was part of the journey. The journey was to

reach out to billions to screen them create risk stratification but then close the loop by providing them healthcare intervention from the physical healthcare world. So technology

plays a very important role and I think that's where intelligent technology plays a very important role to handhold them through this frictionlessly from one environment to the other. I gave you

an example of oral healthcare. Look at breast cancer in India. One out of two people detected dies. 50% is mortality rate. If detected early, the success rate is 95% plus. How do you

even screen people? Expensive mamography devices can't be done. So you use technology, you use interesting AI products to screen and again do risk stratification but don't make it

conclusive. Figure out the high-risisk cases, get them to a clinic, get them to meet a doctor. So to AI for us was more about trust, transparency, translation and texture more than coding or more

than creating a fancy product and ensuring that it reaches the people. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much Prio and this is so interesting to see the kind of work that cure is doing on the ground level. So

thank you Mahav. uh you know no conversation on AI is complete without talking about the informal labor market and uh you know two things that you've done which is

very interesting is you chose to come back to India and build here and you chose to solve a very very difficult and unorganized problem so first off you know what what's that experience been

like and what role is AI really taking in shaping the way you're building this business &gt;&gt; thanks great to be here to talk to everybody um I'll contextualize my

response uh with a little more detail on what we do at my company vahan.ai. Uh what we are trying to build is an AI recruiter for India's massive bluecollar workforce. 80% of the labor workforce in

India is blue collar. And when we say blue collar uh obviously the definition is very fluid but you can think of uh people as um lowkilled right. So people who uh let's say work in a factory or

your security guard or the pe the the person who delivers your food these days right these are all blue collar let's say uh what we found was that and as you mentioned the uh hiring ecosystem for

blueco collar workers in India is very very fragmented in fact it turns out that there are hundreds of thousands of local recruitment agencies that do a bulk of the hiring in this space and

that's also because trust is a very very key element for people in general and especially people from Bhat when they're searching for a job. So you will usually find uh that you know people will uh

look for jobs through their mama cha network or through a local recruitment agency. So the question is how do you use technology to maybe replicate that trust

or or leverage that trust? uh it turns out that it's not really possible and so what we've done instead is we've built uh what was uh termed as an augmentation sort of approach earlier where we've

aggregated uh over 3,000 uh human recruiters who work at local agencies on our platform across over 900 cities in India and we are providing our AI recruiter as a tool to these human

recruiters. So the uh the human recruiter will typically source somebody who's looking for a job on the ground perhaps locally and then they will uh enter their

information into our platform which is when our AI recruiter uh takes over. It's uh it gives them a call. It's able to talk to them in multiple Indian languages. Uh it's able to ask them uh

basic questions uh what is their name, where are they from, what are they looking for, any educational background. it matches them with a job. It's able to answer some basic FAQs. The first FAQ is

always salary. So, obviously, you know, those types of questions uh and then it proceeds from there uh to the onboarding process, interviewing process, etc. And anywhere

where we see a candidate dropping off or showing signs of uh of slowing down, that's when we reintroduce the human recruiter. Right? This is called a human in the loop system where you bring the

human back uh into the the automation or the the workflow. Uh and we're finding that that is absolutely critical again in a place like India where trust is incredibly important to deliver services

especially services that are high stakes or that are complex. Uh a human plus AI approach works much much better than an AI approach or a human only approach. In fact, we find that if a human recruiter

was able to get, let's say, one person hired a day, when they use the AI, they can get five hired a day. And this is still very very early days. The technology is absolutely in its nency.

In 2 to 5 years, uh that five could become 50. That's our goal, right? So, we're able to help the human recruiter obviously earn more money because they are much

more productive. more people are able to get jobs in a shorter amount of time and of course uh employers are able to hire more in a shorter amount of time as well. Right?

So it's a very uh uh natural uh human plus AI use case or an augmentation use case which is driving much higher productivity and is also helping people gain access uh to

employment. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much Madav. It's so great to see this use case up and kicking in the Indian market right now. Amazing. Um, you know, while we're moving now

unfortunately to the second half and the closing of our panel. Um, I want each of you to actually give us a overview from your point of view and your expertise on how AI is really going to change what is

going to be that one seismic shift. And I'd like to, you know, start with you Lavnish, you have a very interesting macroeconomic point of view. So, if you were to call out this one big thing that

we should all brace for, what should that be? uh you know so there are two parts one is if I'm an enterprise uh outside in perspective and then the inside out

perspective the outside in perspective um you know uh is that you need to be clear on the data and the readiness and enabling uh you know uh ecosystem for AI then for AI itself that is a learning

that that all of us are are getting into from an inside out perspective I think the three Rs that are that are very important reliable relevance and responsible and we have seen that uh if

you have the data layer ready reliability is taken care of if you embed AI as a horizontal into the business process the relevance uh is taken care of and responsible that is

the ethics that is all we have now experienced that everything the maximum impact can be changed at the design state itself. The maximum impact can be achieved at the design stage and not

really at the implementation when you go back and correct. So the 3 hours from an inside out perspective and from an outside in perspective the ecosystem will for some time will remain

fragmented particularly for those uh who are actually working cross borders uh in terms of the data flows and and whatnot. The ecosystem will definitely remain fragmented. So don't expect that um you

know we will have everything smooth uh as we as we go forward particularly when it comes to the critical sector definition and the critical data definition as we are moving the impact

of geopolitics would be far more uh very easy for Madav to recruit a a person for manufacturing but very difficult to recruit for a security printing press which prints the notes the government

will say no no I want to check the person so that critical icality of data sensitivity and data criticality and the classification will be the next wave that all of us sitting in this room will

sooner sooner than later uh get involved and that's where we will see a mature curve evolving and all of us when we meet next we will be talking on a stable uh AI path then this uh zigzag path that

all of us are on. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much for that love. Um, Swati, I'd love for you to step in one big thing that we should be bracing ourselves for and also as a woman in the

ecosystem, right? Uh, what can we do to get more and more women involved in this conversation? &gt;&gt; There are multiple uh facets to this, right? Um, what Madha was explaining

earlier is this um concept of skilled workers. Uh, if we also talk about industry at large, right? Uh, there's there's a huge d of knowledge workers or what we call skilled workers, right? And

in um aging economies specifically around the Europe and and and the like um there's a there's really an aging population which makes it very difficult to also ramp up skilled labor and uh in

the industrial domain what this also means I mean if we take the example of manufacturing uh and specifically engineering there we're looking at people that uh that could build

automation scripts automation code and there's a handful of people globally that can do this in domains like digital automation and so on. Um now what this means is we have AI but could we

leverage AI in order to bridge this knowledge uh worker gap right that's one of the challenges that we face and um apart from that there's bringing together of these knowledge workers in

uh in an ecosystem where AI and humans can collaborate very seamlessly. So um we at Seammens we look at AI more as empowering for these factory workers as enabling these factory workers and not

so much to eliminate or to replace them human in the loop or what we um actually call expert in the loop. Right? So we're not looking at removing the expert anytime soon. So also going forward they

will have a much more stronger role to play. They will be reskilling they will be upskilling and a lot of personnel development uh is going to happen. Right? So we're we're not looking at um

jeopardizing the the job market, the workforce because I think that's um that's also a conversation that happens right with with AI becoming so prominent. Will we have a huge impact a

negative impact to the job industry? And that's I think not so much the case. we will have much more uh fertile workforce where uh these skilled workers can focus more on on more complex uh activities

and um what um what technology could mean and where we see promising research still upcoming is a few areas. Now um we um in in this session but also in the past sessions today looked a lot at

language models at foundation models and um when it comes to industry now we're no longer in the consumer space we're in the industrial space and therefore um we're looking at building the foundation

models for industry right what that means is to build something that the engineers that the operators that the technicians can interact with and can use to tackle challenges in in a

language language that they are familiar with and we're talking here engineering drawings engineering schematics 2D 3D simulation time series data from the edge from IoT and so on right so models

which can naturally understand which can naturally interpret and interact in these modalities so that's one area um the other area happens to be um in um in trust and governance right so um with AI

becoming more and more autonomous How can we still make sure that they are trustworthy, they are reliable, they are robust. So um there's the um EU AI data act, there's DP uh DP uh for India,

there's equivalence in almost all geographies including China and the US and uh building especially taking into mind uh these regulations and standard policies is imperative for for us and in

order to do this we also look at how we can bring together these more forward-looking technologies but also more classical ones like symbolic AI like neurosy symbolic AI and and so on

and and bridge the gap a little bit and in all of this how we can leverage the ecosystem right so we have at semens a lot of also um training engagements partnerships for vocational education of

the workforce um and um and and last but not least I think we're looking at moving beyond becoming AI ready to becoming more AI native and uh yeah I think that's pretty much where we're

headed &gt;&gt; thank you &gt;&gt; so much for that Swati Pri I'd love for you to step in right now and quickly tell us uh you know what

is the big shift we should be bracing for in the healthcare ecosystem from your point of view. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So if I wear the healthcare lens I think two parts. First is building the

right foundation for things to move from being a fashionable thing to do to be a real thing to impact life. Healthcare there are tons of data available with every hospital because a surgical

discharge summary is full of data. How much of that is usable? You don't even have the patient's consent. Can you remove PII from that data? Can you create homogeneous code? Answer to all

of this is no. So none of this data without a patient's consent can be used. So you need to build that foundation where you have consent so that you're able to remove PII work on that data to

create trends otherwise it's theory. Second most important thing is there's going to be a convergence of ecosystems. There's a met ecosystem which is advancing like crazy.

There is a variable ecosystem which is giving you data real time and creating very interesting dashboards. There is a digital healthcare ecosystem of EHRs. But then there is a physical healthcare

ecosystem of doctors, hospitals, labs. You got to frictionlessly move people's journey as a personalized curated healthcare journey which is going to move from seeking care to moving to

preventive. And this will only happen when you move them from this metaverse of different ecosystems to the real physical healthcare ecosystem where the final opinion is coming from a qualified

doctor. But that doctor's load has been significantly reduced because you have done screening, you have done risk stratification and given them inputs and insights for them to take a call and

probably similar to what Mada was saying be far more productive in a country from being doctor scarce to doctor amplified. That's the future I'm looking at. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much for that Prio and uh

Madav uh you know would love to hear from you. Finally, what is like the one big catalyst that you think is going to shape the way the infirm economy is going to work and the role AI is going

to play? I think India's biggest opportunity uh with this whole AI revolution is uh leveraging some of our key data assets perhaps

which uh of course in our context mean very different things. Language for example uh India has over 20 major languages, thousands of dialects but most of these languages have no digital

footprint. 97% I think of the internet is English for instance and I think Tamil is is the the most highly represented Indian language on the internet right most Indian languages

don't have any digital footprint which means that even building AI in Indian languages or for Indian languages is actually a very very difficult task right and then of course if you talk

about medical data you talk about other types of data sets right that opens up a huge uh Pandora's box so I think India's uh advantage will come from one ensuring we

can digitize some of these assets and then use them to create models that can serve our people in the most beneficial way possible. And I think the other thing uh that we sit on is a very very

large young population. Uh India has over 900 million people in the ages of uh 18 to 60. So we are the youngest working population in the world and growing. I think Swati mentioned uh a

lot of countries now are in population decline including Western Europe, including China, Japan of course India I think is the only country which has a large and growing young population. Uh

if we are to to uh really sort of reap our demographic dividend, I think AI will play a massive role in helping all our people uh many of whom of course do not have the education or skills

required to to be productive. But AI then can play a very very key role in bridging that gap. Right? And and I think AI could become uh perhaps the most impactful uh engine for exclusion

rather for us uh hopefully in the next 5 to 10 years. &gt;&gt; Great. Thank you so much for that. And unfortunately that is all the time we had on this panel. To all of our

panelists, thank you. A huge round of applause for them please. [applause] And you know like we said uh you know the idea of you know GI and us bringing this

together was this is not a conversational panel this was an action panel and all of these leaders here today really kicked off what is I believe a beginning of a very very

important discourse. Um on that note we have one very very special guest coming in to uh you know talk to us about a very special pathway. Uh Shin Masam Kulpar please do come up on stage.

Yeah, &gt;&gt; maybe this is better. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; this this works. &gt;&gt; You know, as someone who's been in the

startup ecosystem for uh you know, more than a decade, he's been responsible for building some of India's most important startup ecosystems, including T-Hub and is now working very closely in venture

building. So, Shinwasan, over to you. &gt;&gt; Um, thank you all for such an incredible um session. So many insights across so many uh different topics. a lot for us to decode. I just wanted to address a

few basic things, right? Uh the core of this session uh is resilience, innovation and efficiency. And I just wanted to talk very quickly about what those three things mean. Uh resilience

obviously means and this is absolutely critical in today's geopolitical system. Uh industries that can adapt when supply chains break, when markets shift, and when crises hit. Innovation of course is

fundamental transformation uh not just marginal improvements and efficiency obviously means doing more with less uh but intelligently not just cutting costs. AI is one thing that can

do all three of those things simultaneously only if we deploy it right though. And one thing I want to point out because AI to a lot of people is a technology

that's not enough. It has to be an industrial competitiveness conversation. [snorts] The next decade is not going to be defined by better AI models, although

that is what's going on right now. It's actually going to be defined by AI powered industries. We need a fundamental transition from AI adoption to AI integration. And as we've

heard from our panel, that is not easy. There's a lot for us to think through here. countries that adopt uh and embed AI into manufacturing, healthcare, energy,

logistics, they're the ones that are going to lead. And this is a global conversation. Inside this room, we have people from multiple countries in Europe and of course across India as well.

And I just want to bring to the table what India and Europe um have to add to this. Right? India brings speed, our digital infrastructure at scale. our engineering talent and the hunger to

build. Europe brings industrial depth, regulatory frameworks that create trust and they're leading the way on that one. And of course, capital that thinks long term. We need to bring some of that too

and neither of us can win this race alone. I just want to say thank you to GIC and JBC for building this bridge and convening the leaders in this room who

are making it real and adding value to all of us with this conversation. To everyone here, whether you're building in New Delhi, Berlin or anywhere across the world, we need founders who

understand both AI and industry. We need investors who back true transformation at both a local and a global scale. And actually that's a place I think India needs to step up.

Uh we need industrial leader leaders who are willing to move from pilots to production because that's where transformation actually happens and as we've all said

we haven't quite got there yet but we're on the path. Finally we need policy makers who industrial who see industrial AI as strategic infrastructure not innovation theater.

The opportunity isn't in one geography. It's in the connection between them and the opportunity is huge. Thank you again to both JIC and JBC for making this happen.

&gt;&gt; Wow. Thank you very much. Uh great great words and thank you to all the panelists. Uh before I really get into the closing u it's always we we said it's a action panel. So what's uh what's

what's next, right? uh what's next we know it's clearly that uh never in the human history has the present been so temporary so it's time to take action now uh we looked at AI for industries uh

we looked at its definition the transformation potential and everybody's ability uh we want to bring that together uh you know while getting all these key players a lot of them in the

room some existing partners some to be partners policy makers startups academia uh to to manage this change forward together uh with Europe and India as collaboration. Uh to that effect, I'd

like to make a quick few announcements that might uh interest you. Number one, the GIC agenda for 2026. Four focus areas, manufacturing, mobility, aerospace, defense, and health. Um this

is this is where we'll see lot of uh programs coming in. Of course we have um another big one where a lot of this will converge all the year round activities is I welcome all of you um to Berlin

28th and 29th of September that's where we will have the German Indian innovation summit edition 2 um on top of that what we're working on currently is a German Indian open innovation

initiative you see the full stack and different topics uh this is backed up by 10 corporates and uh VCs on on both sides as well as you know the right monetization models and we have the

complete infrastructure uh for that. Next up for all the Indian startup enthusiasts who want to come up and um explore Germany, explore Europe via Germany, we have set up a India desk at

no land which is a largest uh uh innovation space of Europe uh is based in Berlin. And finally in preparation and particularly today I'm very very happy to share that we're working on a

framework for democratic alliance on AI in today's this is very very important um with the strengths and you made the comments on the EU AI act but also the uh the Europe Europe which has made you

know it's going to be very very sensitive around all the usage and very good in regulatory ways and India on a very fast track I believe we have a good way to work on this jointly and we're

going to kick off during the course of the week uh the democratic AI initiative as well. With that uh I'd like to say thank you not only to uh you but first of all to the panelist as well. Big

round of applause please. [applause] &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. Before we close, a token of appreciation and thanks to all of our speakers. &gt;&gt; [applause]

&gt;&gt; Hello. Anything else? [applause] Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; All right. Thank you. SORRY. &gt;&gt; Thank you everyone.

&gt;&gt; Thank you so much everyone. Matey uh the noodle officers from Invest India. Thank you so much for coordinating. You guys might not be seeing these folks in the chaos outside, but there's a bunch of

amazing kids running around behind ensuring that everything goes on time. Please give a round of applause for them as well. [applause] Um, he left his laptop and Okay.
