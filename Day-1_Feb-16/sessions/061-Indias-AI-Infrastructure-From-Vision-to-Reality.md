## 📝 Transcript

to come. &gt;&gt; How can we manage this? Check out speaker. Sorry.

Good afternoon everyone. We will be starting the session in a minute. May I please request everybody to study on behalf of it is my honor to welcome

you all to the summit titled India's AI infrastructure from vision to reality together experts and partners who are

collectively shaping India's AI ecosystem Because building AI is not only about algorithms or hardware. It is about collaboration

and longterm. &gt;&gt; On this note, I would now like to introduce our moderator Mr. Harish Krishna, chair working group on AI and all our panelists Mr. Ranganas Sadasa,

Chief Technology Officer HP, Mr. Mr. Kishar Balaji, executive director and government regulatory affairs IBM miss vice president government affairs Nokia Mr. Sumit Bonga head government

relations miss director India government affairs Intel Mr. to formally open the summit. May I please request uh president to please

give respective remarks and on behalf of me and it's my pleasure to welcome you all to the summit. 2026

here at Thank you for joining us for the important conversation on India's AI infrastructure from vision to reality. In November 2025, May organized a

presummit for India's infrastructure ecosystem driving impact for people, planet and progress. That engagement brought together stakeholder across government, industry

and academia to align on a shared vision for India's AI future. Today makes the completion of the journey where we move decisively from dial to action and from vision to

implementation. Artificial intelligence is no longer a future aspiration. It is already reshaping governance, healthare, education, manufacturing and climate

action. AI can only perform well if it has powerful chips, fast internet, reliable servers and secure hardware to back it up. For India to realize it ambitions to at scale, we must build

resilient, inclusive and globally competitive AI infrastructure anchor and domestic manufacturing enabled by supportive policy frameworks and powered by strong public private

collaboration. We are privileged to have with us today an eminent group of industry leaders who will share their percept perspectives on India's AI I'm delighted to welcome our moderator

Sri Harish Krishna uh chair working group at AI make who will guide us this section. We are honored to have with us Mr. Sarahan Sadasha CO HPE District Balaji executive

director IBM Miss Viba Mea VP government affairs Nokia Mr. Dbaki Mahendu director Intercorporation Mr. Sumit Bonga head government relations denovo group Mr.

BA leader salescloud and AI team Cisco. Together they bring deep expertise across computing platform, [clears throat] hardware, policy engagement and

enterprise development offering a comprehensive present on how India can build scalable and trusted AI infrastructure. I'm confident that today's deliberation

will offer valuable insights into challenges, opportunities and the road map ahead spanning policy enabler manufacturing ecosystems, deployment models and real world impact. The rapid

advancement and development deployment of AI hardware presents both critical challenges and transformative opportunity that must be strategically addressed. has understand that this

technology consumes much power and it's challenging to build and run these systems along with the goal of environmental safeguards production. To counter this challenge, we need to

promote energy efficient solutions like liquid cooling for the chips. We call it very important is fostering strength and collaboration across the innovation ecosystem. Bringing together hardware

manufacturers, educational institutions, startups and government bodies to co-develop cuttingedge technologies and build indigenous capabilities. This collaborative momentum can also elevate

the visibility of India's hardware competencies to grow global AI conversations positioning the country as a key contributor. Finally, creating a structured engagement pathways formemes,

innovation, innovators and academia will enable broader broader participation in building India's AI infrastructure, democratizing innovations and ensuring that the

benefit of AI hardware advancements are widely distributed across the indust industrial and research landscape. Let me conclude by reiterating MAT's commitment to working closely with

government and industry to build a robust, inclusive and globally competitive AI infrastructure ecosystem ensuring that India not only adopts AI but leads responsibly in the development

and deployment. Before we move ahead to our discussion, M is pleased to re release today our white paper on parting India's AI infrastructure ecosystem which outlines actionable recommendation

to strengthen India's position interested AI value chain and as great development deployment across sector. Thank you once again for joining us today. I look forward to a thoughtful

and engaging discussion. Thank you. [applause] Uh thank you sir for your encouraging words and for setting the context of today's discussion. May I request all

the speakers and to join in for a group photograph we also invite Mr. to lead you with partner event to join us in the unveiling of the white

paper. The soft copy of this white paper will be shared by all the registered participants via email. You should start.

&gt;&gt; Thank you everyone. Uh we now move to the fourth segment of today's program. The panel discussion on India's AI infrastructure from vision to reality. This session will explore how

India can scale its AI infrastructure, enable innovation, strengthen public private partnerships and translate uh vision into execution. It is my pleasure to hand over the session to our

moderator Mr. Harish Krishna uh in order to take the discussion forward. Over to you sir. Thank you very much and good morning to all of you.

It is uh great to be at the AI summit. We all been in sessions at the presummit uh events across India and uh again uh It's what the government is doing is amazing to bring AI at a population

scale. We've never had a session like this where there is not even standing room available. Uh so so the government has done a great job of taking AI to the population. You know we have got for

example the Andhra Pradesh government which says they want every family to have one entrepreneur and one AI use case. That's the level at which the the government and the political class are

thinking about it. So welcome again. As Amrit mentioned, mate had done a pre-event uh for AI summit on 20th November 2025 and we had leaders from across the

industry participate in it. Uh and Mr. Krishnan was our chief guest for the event and talking at the event Mr. Krishna articulated some of the clear priorities of the government in

supporting especially when he's talking to supporting manufacturing of servers as the backbone of AI infrastructure making full use of the PLI for IT hardware 2.0 and addressing the gap

where India generates nearly 20% of global data but has only about 4% of the data center capacity. uh he encouraged the maids industry to turn these priorities into concrete

actionable steps. We just seen the release of the maid's uh white paper which brings the the teams these themes together and sets directions for today's discussion. One thing that the white

paper makes very clear is that India has moved beyond experimentation. AI is no longer just about pilots or demos. Enterprises are now moving toward use cases with measurable ROI asking

practical questions about how to scale AI, making it reliable, secure to ensure it delivers real business value. As AI adoption accelerates, India has an opportunity to scale its infrastructure.

This means energy efficient compute with security resilience built for the start. It also calls for moving beyond experiments to real outcomes, expanding access for MSMES and scaling AI use case

across sectors that matter most to India. And finally, it reminds us that AI is not just about technology. It's about people, it is readiness, about skills, reskilling and expanding

opportunities across the nation. Now explore how we turn this vision into reality. Like Amit mentioned, we've got a distinguished panel here and I'm now going to turn over to the panel to take

the discussion forward. I want to first ask someone how much time do we have for this? &gt;&gt; So I'm going to come to you first. So you you are in the whole

infrastructure business. So how do you see India balance the need for AI infrastructure at the same time make it affordable and accessible for all. Hey everyone uh good morning good

afternoon I would say nice to see a large crowd here but uh you know we are at the facet as you rightly said from moving away from experimentation into acceleration and that's a huge step for

all of us here because most of us have done that we bit of experimentation in our organizations right and most of it as I see has been very siloed it really didn't have an integrated view of AI as

a strategy uh so we I think understand that at this point of time and when you're talking of acceleration. Uh it is your ability to cohesively put a strategy together

&gt;&gt; and that strategy means a lot of things. You know many of the times when you see AI our first point of vision is a GPU whereas it's like a brick and motor stuff for building a house. You will not

be talking about uh you know what whether you want to use ACC cement or LNT cement or you know TNT rods and things like that right &gt;&gt; so the building blocks you essentially

would want to look at a strategy that will speak about how many rooms you want how many what is the dining facility you want and stuff like that. So core values of an AI strategy are being to being

brought into focus today and from a time frame perspective you know the last 6 to 12 months have been very critical where people have understood what AI really means. I think they've peeled the onion

in terms of understanding what AI constitutes. It's just not a GPU. It's just not models. It's not people alone. They understand the entire stack and how it it should be understood. that leads

to some very critical moves. Uh you know people have have taken to uh all of us would definitely agreed that data is the fulcrum for any kind of an AI strategy. People are now focusing around how they

can get their AI AI in place and with with the right data strategy. Many a times you just did that siloed approach which essentially meant you just use data from one one persona or one entity

not really looked at data being the fulcrum of everything. And I think beyond that they also understand that AI is hybrid by nature in the sense that there are diverse resources which are

determined by the use cases per se. So it's not that one sizefits all. So and the leverage of that diversity is something that people are put thinking about and most of it also goes back to

the core essence of where it was built in. The foundations rely on connectivity. The foundations rely on what kind of compute facility you have. the foundation rely on what kind of

cloud economics or you know the models that that you bring into focus. So in all of this I see people thinking about it. I think platform is where I'm I'm looking at organizations thinking of a

platform that can cater to various use cases. Like you said every Andra citizen wanted a use case. I'm sure it's true for everyone in in across the country. Everyone has a use case for themselves

but they have to work on a foundation that's built on data and that's where people are looking at using data to a great extent and also believing in the fact that private AI implementations are

coming into picture people are believing data is their core that's their strength how do I build on top of it and get leverage and that's where I think it's all headed towards at this point of time

if one does all of that I think affordability will step in it will also bring in a sense of you know propagating the AI story across the board. &gt;&gt; Thank thank you for that story.

Absolutely right and affordability is at the core and I think I think London said that Indians will become data rich before they become rich and it is amazing how the government of India has

rightly focused on building infrastructure in a in a way of creating a national AI mission and making it affordable for people to use. I'll come to you Kishor next. When you talk about

AI and innovation, there's always thought about regulation. &gt;&gt; You know, they say that a car that has got a good brake can actually speed more because you know it can break. So what

are your thoughts on framework for AI? Uh and how what how do you see this evolving in India? &gt;&gt; Yeah, sure. Thanks. Thanks for having me here and uh honestly AI has got people

worried or excited. The fact that there are so many is testament that either of it is playing on everybody's mind. Uh of course all of you would have you know read about the immense economic

opportunity that AI creates for you know ourselves. I for one believe that the next three years we'll see AI disrupt markets, jobs, you know all of it. uh no last internet time for about two

decades, right? So that's going to be the quantum of change uh and issue sets and opportunity that AI can acrue to us. Now that said, the fact that AI really levels up India's ability to orbit shift

in terms of opportunity and economic developed on anybody. elect to therefore congratulate the government of India to have taken a really balanced approach to regulating AI. Uh about two years back

there was there were debates about should we stop AI you know should so on and so forth. I think uh hard hammered approaches haven't worked any such opportunity which have been really

playing out as large economic opportunities. Therefore the government's gone for what we otherwise in industry call as precision regulation. Not all cases need to be

regulated the same way. The way that you would regulate a geospatial AI model for agriculture. It will be very different from the way that you would do it for let's say a cancer detection right

so on and so forth. Therefore I for one believe precision regulation not only in AI adoption but also in AI governance is a way to go. uh there is a clear need for

uh mandating uh transparency, accountability, auditability and explanability of AI. It can be achieved by uh several aspects like model documentation, impact assessment, so on

and so forth. And it's important to do that because once you set these guardrails well like you said Harish once you have the brakes in order the confidence with which in specific a

segments if I may people can move in faster uh are you know immense. therefore doesn't need to do that. Thirdly, uh on behalf of IBM and even otherwise, I've seen open-source as a

great way to look at how aspects can scale. Not everybody needs to go and build a model, right? People can come pick a model, folk it out, focus on deployment and you know uh get to the

path of profit than having to make the vertical stack themselves. Therefore, open source is good and uh it also helps governance because you have more people involved, more more the eyes looking at

the model, more the eyes looking at the usage, better the chances of removing bias and all of those issues that come with that. It's important to look at open source as a create key ingredient

to scaling it and uh uh also uh you know there are several global frameworks and standards like in the EU and this and so on and so forth. India certainly needs one for its own but ensuring that we are

aligned with some of these global frameworks will help us not only make an India for India but make an India for the world. And lastly, the biggest uh biggest truth of the moment is we

don't know what we don't know. Right? Therefore, it's very very important like never before for everybody to come together, the industry, the academia. We always speak about PPP. I mean Harish

and I have had a living in government affairs for like three decades and every time we've been speaking about PPP but never has it been more important than it is today for stakeholders to come

together to look at uh governance to look at such frameworks to look at ethical standards to look at what are those use cases that can scale faster than the others regulation and so on and

so forth therefore this is a very very welcome step to the point that I'm making will encourage people to keep the discussion on thanks for the opportunity &gt;&gt; thank you Kishor I think uh AI framework

I think released yesterday. I saw in the paper I've not had a chance to look at the document but I believe it talks about a light touch and also leveraging the existing regulations which are

already there not really recreating new regulations right we say this go when you connect the unconnected magic happens and we got Nokia whose by line is connecting the

intell so when what is core for AI is connectivity [singing] and the grow of 5G and 6G and Nokia the pioneer in this. So I'd like to have you your views on what are the trends you

see in 5G [clears throat] cop with AI and the the connectivity. &gt;&gt; Okay. Hi good afternoon and I must say really happy to see so many people in the room that shows the excitement of

you know AI in this world. Okay. Now specific to your question um uh uh you know harsh uh we feel uh connectivity has been the backbone of how AI has you know kind of traveled all across and

it's going to stay like that and the numbers are baffling the way you know and India has done very very well compared to the rest of the world uh you know the data used to be 1 GB data used

to be at about 287 bucks 2014 we are at about 9 rupees I think our our honorable minister just spoke about it is.11 the global average is about $2.5 okay &gt;&gt; that makes sure that there's a

connectivity available at the every nook and corner [snorts] of the country to make sure that you know uh people can do whatever they want and AI is touching everybody's life now what happened with

5G and what's going to be happening with 6G is another story by the way we we changed our logo we used to you know uh you know connecting everybody connecting people but we kind

of pivoted towards talking about ourselves as connecting intelligence because we realized that intelligence is going to stay at multiple levels you know some of my colleagues talked about

there's a there's intelligence [clears throat] at data level there's a intelligence at platform level there's intelligence at hardware level and there's intelligence at network level 5G

made that happen where AI was really not native to what was happening. So AI was still sitting as a secondary layer bringing that you know intelligence there but we still made things happen

with you know highest throughput low latencies uh you know these two things itself drove some of the use cases which is pertinent to India also and we saw this

application going all across you know industrial automations I think it still touched just the very high level it's still not going through you know SMMES SMDs but industry 4.0 Z would not happen

if the robust data connect was not available and uh you know this whole digital learning the machine learnings it happened because that you know low latency connectivity was available for

these applications to work now we should be looking at these moving across to e- health agriculture where you would need to have data coming in from multiple data sources somebody has to make that

happen that's a secondary issue uh intelligent um you know uh traffics you know the cases are pumping so much more can happen with what connectivity has enabled now as we move to 60 60 is

still far away and you know our operators don't want to hear about 60 coming in too soon we're sitting at about 2030 as uh you know starting of 60 adoption some of the countries North

Korea Japan let's say is uh you know happening maybe before that also but we expect 2030 onward 60 should happen all processively. Uh what's changing in the architecture of zigg is that AI is going

to be sitting natively at the network level. We will see the networks becoming more intelligent, more intuitive. They will manage on its own. They will monitor on its own and whatever will

happen on top of that you know by any application will be a added advantage. So things are going to be different. We will see more use cases you know emerging as they say what we don't know

we don't know this this world is going to be a very different world that's all we can say &gt;&gt; thanks absolutely connectivity is the core of all the AI applications that we

have like if you take healthcare and you don't want a heart surgery happening and the data buffering that coming to you infrastructure coming back to

infrastructure is absolutely again very critical So right now we are in a bit of a memory crisis this point in time uh a lot of memory going to the compute area that from the area. So how are you

seeing the whole making India progress India push towards manufacturing in India infrastructure of course is the bedrock foundational aspects what s also said

you see it is the experiential requirement that is there if there are delays in expressing your thoughts &gt;&gt; one loses interest similar is the case &gt;&gt; with the infrastructure required for AI

if AI cannot respond to you faster of course that's going to be a challenge people are not going to like it &gt;&gt; so infrastructure requirement is the basis for India when we say 20%

of data being generated but only 4% of data centers being available we can [laughter] well imagine what is the kind of latency what BMA also spoke about the physical distances that needs to be

traveled across the world for this data and the compute power to come back to us. So from that angle, we need more manufacturing to come up here in India. Not only in terms of the IT

infrastructure but even in terms of enabling that manufacturing through AI means. So from the governmental push if we look at it the government has already

provided a lot of facilities in terms of the production linked incentive schemes in terms of the India semiconductor mission now 2.0 has been announced in the recent uh budget data center push

has been given to support all this. It is how the infrastructure manufacturing will start happening and making use of let's say all the FDAs that are being done the import of components sub

assemblies exports electronics component manufacturing scheme. So all these things will start helping in proliferating manufacturing here in India. And on top of it, one of the

biggest criteria which will help India is the trust factor that India has amongst the global community. the trust factor for enabling the manufacturing of niche technology systems here in India

which at certain times we are not very comfortable with when uh people want to give licenses and other things. So from that angle India is well suited to actually start manufacturing and is the

right geography where the manufacturing for supporting air will happen. Like Kish said, we've been like watching the space for a very very long time in terms of manufacturing and the amount of

uptake has happened in the last few years has been phenomenal right and I think one of the good things that government is doing is to not only look at the what is needed in the short term

but also in the long term and they're talking about big bar 2047 you know chips are not made in a day. So that brings me to retail uh you know semiconductor at the foundation of the

infrastructure and on the government itself has a lot of focus on I'm sure Intel is inside the semiconductor mission so would like to have your perspective what is happening

on semiconductor &gt;&gt; thank you Harish uh so on the semiconductors piece and the way I look at it right uh up until some time ago we always and we continue to speak about

the number of processes is doubling every 2 years. Right? Increasingly a new metric is also coming in and that is the number of manh hours AI can displace in just about 1 minute and even that number

is now doubling actually every 6 months. Uh so when we talk about and again like Harish uh you mentioned processors by the end of it and form factor uh innovation at the processor level have a

lot of implications. The first one really being about increased computational capacity per real estate that you're using on the motherboard. Right? So we've already

10 nanome 14 nome 26 nome are now all legacy nodes. We're increasingly talking about 1.8 8 1.4 sub 2 sub4 nanometers right now with that computational ability really comes the entire metric

of how intelligent your machine however the flip side also is when we talk about AI chips AI data centers AI [clears throat] systems there is a certain energy imprint that it has and

AI is perhaps very notorious about that energy and therefore the second level of innovation really empowering all this is how sustainable or at least I would say sustainability

is still some time ago but how energy efficient can every subsequent form factor become and today if I talk about let's say Intel and I'm sure the other semiconductor companies as well every

next generation of processors that is coming in is able to give you a [singing] delta of anything between a 12 to 20% reduction on energy consumption while giving you a higher computational

power which I think is very very important which brings me to the third point and I'm just being mindful of the time also and therefore you know uh the third from an innovation perspective and

I'll build on to what Sadan mentioned is we're opening up the horizons to what is possible in the AI world. It is a myth to say that to run anything on AI or run

anything AI you need a GPU only. It's a beautiful technology. It's a very powerful technology but at the same point in time there are models that you can run on

GPUs, CPUs, NPUs, TPUs and the PUS and the XPUs is broadly how I would put it. They are just going to multiply because it's not just about how you can bring your AI model to life.

It's also about where you are hosting it. No longer is AI just going to be dependent on cloud and data centers. You're getting data centers, smaller, meaner AI data centers close to where

the data resides, which will have an important aspect of energy efficiency, cost efficiency, lower latency, but at the same point in time, AI at the edge is what is again taking the world by a

storm. Now, increasingly when we talk about individual productivity, individual contribution to economy, individual contribution even to the means of livelihood, you also have

ARDC's which are perhaps closing the loop on MSMES. It's it's a it's a boom right and uh from there primarily when we talk about semiconductors I would say it's just that we have to take a much

larger view of AI and that is where innovation really sits to close it in optimization of different technologies and optimization of how you access it and [clears throat] more importantly

what you use that access to bullet point. I'll I'll stop there. &gt;&gt; Hey thanks So I'm looking at the time so there's not going to be time for a second round. So I'm giving a heads up

to all the speakers that after tarandep I'm going to ask the next tarandep and after that I'm going to ask each one of you to one in the 30 seconds say what excites you about AI and what concerns

you okay this is a bit of an out of service question so thirdly now coming to you uh you know cloud data AI solutions are expanding that uh how can India ensure secure

interoperable and scalable cloud infrastructure over here &gt;&gt; I think India is at the digital evolution cusp where they have onboarded

how we have to go ahead and consume AI now if I think about what what should be the strategy it is not a single strategy it has to be a multi-layer strategy starting from sovereign AI it has been a

great debate for last 2 years do we take the data to the model or get model to the data we've been doing a lot of export data and import intelligence I think thanks to India AI mission that

that problem has started to evolve and solve where we have a pool of GPUs or accelerators to go ahead and solve this problem of getting the data local and intelligence also local. So that would

be the first critical step that how do we evolve onto sovereign AI concept and thanks to open-source models that are available and the output that we get out of it this is this this vision has

become true reality. Second key concept is securing AI. Second strategy should be privacy by design. You cannot have security as an afterthought. Be it any application or even our mobile phones, I

don't think I want to use something which is not secure. Right? Likewise, when we start consuming AI, even for the matter of fact designing AI or building applications or use cases for AI, we

need to have privacy by design. That's going to be pivotal to ensure and give 100% confidence to each one of you that whatever you're consuming out of AI is 100% secure. We will tackle deep fakes.

We will tackle unknown elements. We we've seen we've we've read about AI start with blackmailing each other and and stuff like that and a lot of a lot of things are there. So it's important

to not to have security as an afterthought rather infuse it at every layer possible. So that will be first strategy in terms of secure and sovereign AI. Second key strategy is

interoperability. As my friend spoke that there needs to be a strategy where you could you each model has to talk to different other data source. That's one of the key things for every use case to

be successful. With India AI push as part of India mission, a lot of data models and structures have been defined. But we feel that future is evolving an ecosystem where each data set can talk

to other data set so that we can kind of securely use it and build data for the models so that the end use case is interoperable and we can all make 100% benefit out of it. Third key strategy is

around scalability. Now this is an important aspect. Today I just spoke about India AI mission that has done about 38k GP GPUs and other set of accelerators. Is this enough at a global

footprint? We personally feel not not really there's lot more that we can add and it is predicted that this capacity will grow 10x in next next 5 years but but going by the going by the use of AI

and adoption we could already see 10x in next couple of years. To do this, it is extremely important to decentralize the hubs. What what what today the mission gets or the access gets is central AI

hubs. As we grow and build use cases across rural healthcare, we spoke about surgeries for to make all of this possible. You need to start thinking about edge AI hubs. Again, the first

concept of get your data and the user as close as where the operation is getting is happening. So that we feel will definitely evolve from a secure AI edge where we would build use cases right at

the edge so that people who are building agriculture use cases can consume right there and gain intelligence on top of that. Think about rural healthcare. We spoke about operations but the basic

healthcare you cannot wait with the latency. We cannot have latency during robotics. We cannot have latency during operations. Now all of this will start hitting us when we move to physical AI

world. Now this is possible only if we start thinking about edge AI hubs. To sum it up, top three strategies that I think India should evolve is secure and sovereign AI. Second is about making

more and more interoperable models from a data set perspective and third building scalable data center and a data fabric where you could we could train the models at the central hubs and then

inference them or use them at the edge in a secure and safe fashion. Thank you. Hey, thank you. Thank you very much. And again, I'm looking at the clock. So, I'm going to ask each one of you to just say

one word. You think of AI AI that excites you and scares you. &gt;&gt; Baji, &gt;&gt; one word is very very tough to do, but I'll try and say

super excited about this. That's not one word but that pretty much. &gt;&gt; Yeah. What am I excited with is this AI. What am I not excited with is AI without hack which is human intelligence.

So AI excitement is augmented intelligence which is actually augmenting human intelligence and disturbing it is being used as alternative intelligence.

influence for me um excitement is the potential of AI and as it what it can do today and future. The challenge which I feel is are we leaving behind a section of

Indians 200 million people not connected with a device which can even get a data connectivity. So that's my big one. I'll build onto that to say that I'm actually excited about how we can

channel the demographic dividend that we have. We are a young country. If we play our cards right, we are going to be the talent hub for the future if we play our card right. And what I'm scared about or

what I'm uncomfortable about is the fact that supply chains when it comes to AI, they are very very concentrated in some geographies which means we can't really be truly resilient. Till such time we

find our mark in the global value chain. Think &gt;&gt; what I'm excited about is India moving from AI consumer to AI producer. We will truly become the AI garage. And what I'm

not really excited about is uh not enough the thought around guardrails that we are putting across to consume safe AI. Thank you very much and you all agree

this is a fascinating converation. Thank you everybody for your thoughts today. &gt;&gt; Uh thank you to our moderator Mr. Krishnan and to all our panelists for such an insightful and a

thoughtprovoking discussion. Your perspectives truly highlight how collaboration between government and industry will be key to building a robust AI ecosystem.

Uh as a token of appreciation, may I please request Mr. Amran, President M to hand over the momento to Mr. Harish Krishna. May we please have a round of applause.
