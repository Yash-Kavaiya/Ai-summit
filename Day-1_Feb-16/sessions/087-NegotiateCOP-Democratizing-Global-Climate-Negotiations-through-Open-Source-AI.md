## 📝 Transcript

what is it? Is it already used and how is it functioning? And we will also have a little bit of look in the future like how could AI help in the future multilateral negotiations.

And to set the stage um for our conversation, it's my pleasure to invite Dr. Anur Rabba Gosh to deliver a short keynote. Mr. Gosh is an internationally

recognized public policy expert, author, columnist, and institution builder. He's the founder and CEO of the Council on Energy, Environment, and Water, which he has led into the top ranks of Asia's

policy research institution and among the world's leading climate think tanks. Among many roles, the government of Brazil has appointed him special envoy for the COP 30 climate negotiations and

he also shares the AI and climate expert group for the 2026 AI impact summit. It's a pleasure to have you here and I think he's one of the best experts to talk now about climate negotiation and

also some pain points. Over to you. Okay. Good. Um Gunda, thank you very much. Um good afternoon everyone and let me first start by uh thanking uh the organizers

for u not just organizing the session but uh to many uh arms of the German federal government that have come together I was just asking them offline who all have been uh working on this

issue and you'll hear of course much more about this but Dr. uh Ilia Nicollet and Mr. Yanek Susman, thank you very much for joining me and good afternoon everyone. This is the first day of uh

the AI impact summit and we are already into the most controversial part at least when it comes to climate negotiations. Um not for any other reason except climate negotiations are

perhaps uh one of the most complex multilateral decision-making processes in operation today. Why? Because it's not just about the climate. It's about the economy. It's about trade. It's

about investment. It's about technology. And increasingly, it is about geopolitics. So, when you enter a negotiating room at a COP, the process can feel extremely

intimidating. I remember going to my first COP more than 15 16 years ago and just uh wondering how do I even make sense of this? uh how do I I was not a negotiator but even to understand what

was going on to distill it and then communicate it to the world outside um it was difficult the process is structurally dense because there are multiple negotiating tracks there's

adaptation mitigation finance technology means of implementation increasingly new issues just transition carbon markets etc uh the challenge here is not just the that these are indep individual

silos, but their intersections also become more complex and it becomes a uh it it compounds the challenge because there's an asymmetry in the analytical capacity that negotiation negotiating

delegations have. Larger delegations distribute the technical, legal and strategic analysis across different teams. Smaller delegations from poorer countries do not have that luxury. The

issue is therefore of unequal bandwidth to interpret the evolving negotiation space. Now in this context it is not just access to information, access to the text that matters. The real

asymmetry is in access to interpretive capacity. What does a particular phrase, what does a comma and a full stop and a semicolon really translate into what it would mean for our economic

circumstances, for access to technology, for access to finance, and even more so as the global geopolitical situation becomes more complex. How do we deal with the recurring fault lines that

already exist in more than 30 years of the climate regime but with also accounting for new fault lines that are emerging and yet try to find uh ways in which we can bridge those divides. Of

course, some of this is uh dependent on our evolving economic structures, on our bilateral relations, on our plurilateral relations, which can then reflect in the multilateral negotiation. But the role

of AIdriven interpretive capacity can significantly at least in theory shrink the time and the brain space and the bandwidth that is needed for a negotiator who is already under

pressure. The last point I want to make is that this is not just about climate negotiations. I did my PhD on international trade and trade negotiations. And I recall more about 20

years ago similar challenges emerging when countries had to show up in in in Geneva, the WTO to try and make sense of what opportunities there were or not. We

could see similar issues maybe on maritime negotiations, on aviation negotiations, on international financial negotiations. Uh the central operational challenge is that this is about text,

about time and about political alignment. The cycles within which political alignment has to has to work out are perhaps different from the time horizons

within which we're exploring alternative scenarios for negotiation outcomes and yet bring it down to the real time issues of the actual texts that are under development. That means we need

real-time insights. We need to summarize but we also need to make sure that the language we use, the idioms we use, the interpretation we use in our local context

is enabled by AI tools and not disabled by prejudices that might have gone into the markets. So I would very much welcome initiatives like this and would love to hear a lot more of not just how

this tool has been developed on negotiate comp but how do we actually put it into practice in the real world how do we reduce the trust deficit that exists in the real world in the real

negotiating chambers through such tools. How do we ensure that the tr trust deficit does not widen? How do we ensure that representation and access results in real equity when it comes to the

opportunities that are presented with a changing climate and a changing economy? Um, with those words, thank you again. It's a full room. I'm sure there's a lot more you wish to hear and u learn from

and look forward to your provocations. Thank you again for having me and uh let's move forward between the artificial intelligence world and our own uh sometimes not too intelligent

world when it comes to dealing with the climate. Thank you. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Thank you very very much for this excellent overview and I think we have

now an understanding how complex negotiations are and we have we are lucky here I'm I'm happy here to have two um data scientists with me on my left side Dr. Yanik, chief data

scientist of the data lab of the BMZ, which is the development ministry in Germany and also to my left, Yanek Zasman, data scientist in this data lab at BMZ and they will present negotiate

COP what this tool is about and how it actually helps resist challenges or we will also discuss maybe what were challenges while doing this or while developing this

tool. So I would like to hand over now to Yanik um so that you learn more about Negotiate COP. [applause] &gt;&gt; Uh perfect. Um good afternoon everyone.

Uh and many thanks to Dr. Gosh for the insights on the negotiation process uh and setting the scene for our discussion. Um many thanks also to the organizers for organizing this event. uh

and uh also to every one of you to participate today uh and join us in talking about hope how open-source AI can democratize multilateral negotiations. Um as Gund said, my name

is Yanik Zasman. I'm a data scientist uh in the economic um cooperation ministry within Germany and I'm here on behalf of three uh data labs of the German Federal Ministry. Um that's namely the foreign

ministry um that's the environment ministry that's the uh economic cooperation ministry and that's also our implementing agency GIS who developed this tool as a whole of government

approach together. Um and um the objective that I have today is I want to demonstrate to you the potential of jointly developed digital public goods or AI commons in this conference terms

as a new form of international cooperation um that distributes the benefits of technological progress more more equitably. And in order to convince you of that potential I would like to

first show you what negotiate COP actually is. Um secondly, I want to tell you a little bit about the technical uh architecture and our conceptual framework that we used in order to set

up uh the tool and how it was perceived by actual negotiators at the COP 30. Um and lastly um uh I want to yeah help you understand um how or promote the co-development of digital public goods

and AI commons as a means to increase the access to AI and redistribute um the the uh and democratize the power as Dr. Gosh said it's about the information asymmetry that's being addressed with

with the AI and through access through AI. Um and now uh I would like to introduce you to negotiate COP. Um and AI might not only be the better negotiator but maybe also the better

presenter. So I have a little video for you uh with an AI generated voice. And there we go. Negotiate COP gives delegates and negotiators quick and easy access to key information from official

UNF triple C submissions. Use AI assisted tools designed to make your negotiations faster and more focused. Explore over 600 official submissions

from COP 29, COP 30, and their [music] subsidiary bodies, all directly sourced from the UNF C portal. Instantly [music] extract the main asks, compare positions between parties, and

navigate complex documents with clarity and speed. Using the submissions explorer, analyze submissions by individual delegations or groups of states. Find your issue and

submitter of [music] interest. Then apply smart features to view key asks and positions. The position comparison feature offers a structured overview of similarities and

[music] contradictions between two submissions. It lets you compare side by side where two parties align or diverge. Use the portal chat [music] to ask targeted questions and receive sourced

AI generated insights from all included submissions with direct [music] access to original sources. Negotiate COP is an open digital public good available to all delegations

equally. [music] We prioritize privacy. We do not store, track or log any user input. No personal or sensitive data are collected. Additionally, the app is hosted on

German servers that are powered [music] entirely by renewable energy. With Negotiate COP, we want to contribute to fairer and more equitable COP negotiations.

Discover a smarter way to negotiate at negotiatecop.org. [music] &gt;&gt; Perfect. Um, and don't worry, we don't only have a marketing video, but

negotiate cop is actually live and up and running. Um, it's freely available on the internet. I see someone already pulling it up. Uh, very good. Um, and um, I will also whoever is interested

um, we launched it for the COP 30. It's been tested there. Um, uh, whoever is interested, I have the QR code and the presentation at the end for everyone to also give it a try after after the

presentation and the panel discussion. Um after this introduction into the the the application I would now like to delve into the technical architecture and the setup or the conceptual

framework that we actually used. So our first feature is the submission explorer. Um it extracts kiosks and fixed positions from countries. Um and kas are the main demands or objectives

that certain countries put forward. And fixed positions on the other hand um they are firmly stated stances or boundaries. So something that countries insist on or will not compromise on. Um

you're probably asking yourself how do we identify these certain phrases and we definitely use you use language and we use a large language model. Um we've uh identified certain detection word or

action words um for the key asks. So the main demands it's must, should need not ensure or provide something along those lines. Whereas for the for the um fixed positions, it's more restrictive

language such as must not, shall not, cannot, uh unacceptable for instance. Um so that's that's a little bit the framework and the thinking that we've done in order to categorize all of the

country positions. Um more now for the technical people among you guys. Uh a little bit of a technical architecture. Um so we have the scraper on the one side. um that downloads actually all of

the documents and all of the positions, all of the PDFs from the official UNF C uh uh website. Um we then put it in our database. Uh we have an ETL uh manager. So extract uh transform and load that

actually extracts all of the meter data, the smart features and the indication of alignment puts that back into our back end. And then we have the two userfacing um applications. The one of them being a

rack, the other one being like the the the website uh and the the portal chat um and the uh submission explorer and the position comparison tool. Um now onwards to our second feature. Um that's

the position comparison tool. And um um here it allows you to compare the positions of the negotiation parties side by side. Um and if we scroll down a bit um the video will do it in a second.

Um we can actually see the analytical part behind negotiate cop. Um and here the the LLM provides an indication of alignment between the two positions. Um and how that uh how that works as you

can see it's the first of all it's a three-step um decision process basically. So the LLM first looks at whether or not it has enough good quality information to make a valid

assessment. Um it then as a second step uh looks at whether or not there are any contradictions between the positions. Um we actually worked with with actual climate negotiators to come up with that

tonomy um looking at where the conflict types usually lie. And as you can see I mean As in every negotiation, it's about timing, it's about instruments, it's about financing. Um, and the LLM

actually judges whether or not there any contradictions between the fixed positions and the kiosks of each of those uh countries. Um, questions later, please. Um, and then lastly, we have um

the the measuring or um an indication of similarity where the LLM actually looks at whether or not there are any similarities between the key asks. Um and here we also came up with analytical

dimensions so to say you can see them here down there. Um its goals, its instrument, its timelines, it's financing um that then are being displayed. Um and lastly um we do have

uh uh the portal chat. Um given the time uh I won't go into much detail here. It's a simple rack application. So retrieval augmented uh generation meaning chatting with your documents. Um

I mean giving your attendance in the conference today I'm I'm I'm I'm certain that you've heard about the technology. Um so yeah that's that's a little bit the the the the last feature that we

have. So how was uh negotiate cop actually perceived at the um at the at the COP 30. Um in terms of expectation management um this is the first prototype. Um we've developed it last

year and we launched and tested it at the COP 30. Um we've experienced a widespread interest across all delegations in using AI. Uh Dr. Gosh put it forward. It's such a heavy uh

process. It's so fastpaced that everyone is arching for some relief through some automatic uh information processing. Um and our main target group that we identified are young negotiators that

might be new to the uh COP process but are very used to working with AI. um challenges that we faced are um that in these fast-paced environments the usability of these tools is key because

no one has time to actually interact and do a training and everything. It needs to be as user friendly as possible. And um the other thing is that so far uh in our tests AI can mainly support the

factual uh part of the negotiation. So the information processing um but the main um or the at the core of the negotiations and are um relationship building trust building and everything

we do as humans and that's something that AI so far can't substitute for um and as I work in development corporation uh and build similar AI systems more or less on a daily basis I want to leave

you with a little bit um of food for thought um along with the timely conference and theme of this this conference um we see a concentration of of power in AI in terms of access data

talent and compute um and I probably don't tell you anything new here and this will be iterated again and again uh over the next couple of of uh days at this conference um but I want what I

wanted to show you today is how digital public goods and AI comments like negotiate cop um embody the democratization of digital infrastructure they are public they're

accessible they are co-designes designed to reduce information asymmetry. Um, and in this spirit, this is one concrete example um of how open digital public goods can contribute to distributing

technological progress uh more broadly by broadening access to AI. Um, and I'm becoming more and more convinced that the digital world is partly governed but mainly built. Um, I mean we write

international law together. We finance and implement joint joint initiatives together. So why not develop uh and co-develop digital public goods together cooperation through co code co-design

co-development and equal access that benefits everyone. Um and now I'm looking forward to the discussion. Um I promised you the QR code. Um if you if you're interested in collaborating with

us um we're happy to uh work with you. Uh just reach out uh via the email address. Um and here's the QR code for you. I see all of the good phones going up um for you to try it yourself. Thank

you very much. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Yanik. But to the audience, please test the tool after the session. Um so not now, huh? [laughter] Um in case there are any questions, we

will have a Q&amp;A afterwards. But I would like first to kick off the discussion here and then um you are happy to to ask your questions and the speakers will stay here also afterwards. Yeah. Yeah. I

would like to pick up some some words that were mentioned here. Um so we heard a lot about this trust issue and power dynamics and information asymmetry. What if these tools are used in a wrong way?

Like now we're speaking about open-source AI but um imagine like like could you also give us the other way or what what should be aware what should we be aware of when using AI for

multilateral climate negotiations? &gt;&gt; Yes. Um that is that is a a very important question also motivation motivation why we started building open tools of course um um if the current

rates for stronger and stronger AR models goes on then of course the next step would be that you use this as an advantage in discussions in preparing for your positions uh and in

negotiations. So if that happens then suddenly the access to those um very strong models becomes a form of power and I think that part of the bet that the world currently bets on and these

large models is is aiming at that exact precisely as that using LLMs for of course for uh the purpose of nations. Um so what we did here is is to uh use an open weight model open source model

actually use a public uh public good develop a public good it's open source um to do the to do the opposite just to um to give you uh tool to prepare especially those who cannot who do not

have the delegation to by themselves. Um I cannot really say what the future will be like just that we should definitely take care to uh an equilibrium between um the

development of which is which is costly of course of new uh models and to make them open as open as possible and available to everyone. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much. Um I would also

like to ask Arun Arunaba um how do you see like when you negotiate like what is the current state um how do you see digitalization at the moment there? How do you see our AI

models used and what future do you envision? Like concretely, do you think these tools are useful? Um what could be potential feedback? Could you please share a little bit from your experience

on the ground? &gt;&gt; So think of it this way. Um I'm not passing judgment whether this is going to be good or bad. I think it'll depend on the use case. But think of it this

way. Um, if you were a uh if you were a tennis player uh trying to get into the into Wimbledon um and say you grew up uh somewhere in the United States, very

likely you you're going to end up somewhere in Florida where a lot of tennis players go for training. Uh if you're a tennis player from uh India, maybe you will also end up there if you

had your private resources. uh maybe you will not. This is really so you even if you got a wild card entry the point is when you're entering that championship you're already entering with unequal

kind of uh resources behind you. It's much less about what you do on the court. It's a lot about what you've done before. What you could potentially do with tools

like this is fill the gap of the back end that you don't have but also in real time. So imagine your coach is now whispering in your ear as you're playing. Um that's

theoretically what could be possible which is why just understanding and synthesizing the texts as they come out and and understanding to what extent you you talked about it in terms of you know

what are the fixed positions and what are the variable positions when we do analysis. Similarly at CW we look at what are the red lines across delegations

what are you know open suggestions where might be in negotiating terms zones of possible agreement right so we do this manually across our negotiation team and you can uh you can do it faster there

are a few other things that can actually also happen number one you mentioned this yourself if we deployed this correctly it opens up times for the ne time for the

negotiator to build those interpersonal relationships as well. Ultimately, negotiations especially international arenas are about handshakes because we don't have a world government you know

enforcement is also dependent on moral suation. So deepening those personal relationships matter. The second thing is often and I have observed this a lot. Negotiators

especially in developing countries are often unaware of a lot of the financial and technological developments that might even be happening even within their countries or their geographies

because there's a negotiation story and then there is a decarbonization story that is playing out. Can we evolve these tools a little bit more so they get access not just to the text but they get

access to you know if I'm looking for you know 50% reduction in storage costs [snorts] is that an impossibility or somewhere the technology is developing so I can factor that in when I'm

thinking about negotiations third and related to this we increasingly see that climate negotiations are not just about what's happening in the negotiating chamber we talk about the non-state

actors whether they're from the private sector whether they're from civil society In the in the physical world of the negotiation, these are different zones.

There's the blue zone and the green zone and the negotiation zone uh and the closed door rooms and their open door rooms. In the digital space, those boundaries could be blurred. You can

draw on your the the the the power of the private sector. you could conceive and play out scenarios of new coalitions that your private sector and your civil society could strike with

others on the other technically on the other side of the negotiating table. I think deployed correctly, it as I mentioned in my opening remarks as well, we can begin to see new bridges that

could be created. Deployed poorly, like with anything with a digital divide, it could end up simply solidifying the divides that already exist. So uh the jury is out.

&gt;&gt; Thanks. And I would like to pick this up directly like how do you with negotiate make sure that it's supported correctly? Um what is your user feedback and are only Germans using it and how do you

make sure that not only Germans use it? Could you elaborate a little bit? &gt;&gt; Absolutely. And I mean that's that's part of the the access um equation basically. Um first of all it's it's

through outreach. um we were present at COP 30 um and and demonstrated the tool there um and so so the marketing aspect like you said Dr. that that people need to be aware that the solution exists. Um

but underneath of that there are loads of values that need to guide the development process in order for um yeah other countries um to to to find the trust uh in in using the tool. Um

because I mean it's an international process. Why would the German government uh just freely give give away the the technology? Um so there is some mistrust that you need to counter uh basically

and you do that through embodying certain values in your development process. Um first of all the the main and I think most important value is the openness. Um so it needs to be open to

all delegates. Um it's open source developed. We use open weights um um models. Um and um that's the next step. uh it needs to be openly published um as an open source tool so that everyone can

verify uh the technical architectures back doors if you wanted to there are none um and also the the the database um the second one is also the trustworthiness and the the quality of

information um that's so so whatever the LLM puts out needs to be true uh for this trust and the trustworthiness to work otherwise the tool doesn't have any use or it will reflect badly on whoever

had developed the tool or the German government. And so the trustworthiness is the second value that really guided us through the through the development process. So we only use documents from

the UNFC website. Um we put our or our the gu guide guils for the LLM are quite conservatively set. Um if you use the tool, you might see a lot of NAS. That's not because the tool isn't working, but

it's working as intended because we don't want to give out poor quality information that might not be true. So our LLM and our model needs to be not 100% certain but needs to be quite

certain that that the information provided is correct. Um and the last one um the third value that that guided the development process was the privacy um because we don't want to track anyone's

uh login data. We don't want to store or track any of the personal data any requests whatsoever and we don't do that. Um um because otherwise we come back to the trust uh issue. if we would

then look at all of the queries from all other countries would be a powerful tool but not used as intended um and and that would uh yeah defeat the purpose of the tool. Um lastly this is also important

um is the eco-friendliness. So we prov um renewable um energy servers. Um so that's the last one but mainly in terms of the trust building um and the cooperation uh its openness it's

trustworthiness and its privacy that guided us. &gt;&gt; Thanks. Are there any questions in the room? Ah yeah. Do we have another mic? Yeah. No no I think for the um because

it's recorded it's better. &gt;&gt; Hello. Yeah. Uh so on the second point trustworthiness right? How do you ensure that whatever output your LM gives right is 100% or maybe what percentage of

accuracy it is how do you you know measure it right because the output is coming out of LM which tool or which thing you will use to measure it accurately

um so what we've done um in the development process um we've actually worked with actual climate negotiator to come up with ground truth um so we uh gave certain questions that human

negotiator had to answer um and that was our ground truth and then in in LLMs um you have those email sets and you get a quantitative score for various uh for accuracy relevance for instance and you

can actually quantit quantitatively see how close your LLM answer was to the human-guided question um another point and that's something that that we've also heard from actual negotiators is

the fact that um even they don't get it 100% right and sometimes they are very happy to just have the information in the hand &gt;&gt; um rather than it being 100% accurate.

That's that's what I mean where the the human interaction also comes in um because usually and Dr. Gosh can can probably um speak to this um one of the first parts you do in in negotiation is

also the small talk and verifying your assumptions uh among each other. Um and that's and even if the information is right um the LLM made an assessment um and then you just cross it out basically

and you rework your your theory from from there &gt;&gt; it can hallucinate as well right sometimes &gt;&gt; it can uh the likelihood um with Rex

system is less than with uh with the preparatory models but generally yes &gt;&gt; and follow up on thing uh I mean when how much of benefit you get right in terms of that you are not using the LLMs

Right. And now you are using the LMS right. What kind of a benefit you are getting as compared to whatever investment you are doing on the LLMs, right? Getting the the trained or

whatever it is, right? In terms of cost. Um I mean so I work for the government. We don't think in return of investment. Um we think in uh social benefit basically. Um

yeah so far I mean like I said this is the first prototype so the costs of using the tool are minimal uh in re in this regard. If now all um I don't know how many delegates are there um 10

thousands probably at the COP are using it we would have to do another cost calculation um but I think if the work uh tool works as intended we would be more than happy without making any

promises looking at my boss over there uh to to to to keep the or like to to to to pay the bills whatever that may be. Yes, &gt;&gt; we we actually funded by the European

Union, I'm happy to say in the in the program nextgen EU. So it's actually the European Union we we all have to thank for that tool. &gt;&gt; Like I wanted to ask like there is so

much uncertainty in the geopolitics like world has every country has different widespread stances on climate. So how do you inculcate that in developing your LLM? So do you consider the political

question also in it? Um I mean this is this is a question um going into the direct probably of like bias um that's there and that's something that that we've also um have

been taken into into considerations. We honestly haven't really found a solution yet. I don't think anyone has found a solution to the bias bias issue within those LLMs. Um I mean what we do is we

don't have an internet search or anything. Um, so it's not like um the LLM doesn't guess what the stance of the European Union is on climate based on information like either the world

knowledge or whatever it finds on the internet. Um, but it directly pulls information out of those UNF C submission documents. Um, that's the main name part and that's the main

source of truth. &gt;&gt; Can I pitch in on this? Uh, because I I've neither developed the tool nor have I used it yet. uh let me use one word triangulation. I

don't think this tool uh substitutes for common sense. Uh I don't think this tool can substitute for interpersonal relationships and I don't think this tool can substitute for institutional

memory. However, it can make all these three things uh easier to do because you're getting the baseline information faster and if as described more accurately in terms of the submitted

documents. So the NA the not available will be if some if a country has not submitted its NDC for instance you're going to get an NA you're not going to get a research report from a think tank

saying this country's NDC ought to be this right but what I have observed in real time this is what plays out delegates are stretched tired exhausted and underinformed so often they will

grab each other and say so what's going on you know because they're running from one meeting to the next uh and then they're like they they might bump into me and say what's going on on this other

issue and I'll say you tell me you know so that is how information is traded right so but the thing is if you get access to this baseline information faster why I mentioned institutional

memory is often u say a delegate who's negotiated this in 2015 for the Paris agreement might no longer be part of the delegation team anymore. Might have even retired from government, but he can

maybe even just text that person and look, I'm getting this information. Does this seem right to you? Um, so it's it's this ability to use this baseline information for your own sense check for

drawing on institutional memory, right? And to then deepen those interpersonal relationships. One thing I would say, which is why I talked about the private sector, etc. I think this is not the

tool but I think an add-on to this tool or a separate is how do we play out different scenarios for based on this information now what if a major economy exited the deal two years after it's

negotiated what would that mean versus what if a major e a different major economy actually delivered on the climate finance commitments they've made. You can play out those different

scenarios to evolve your own leeway for giving concessions or holding your red lines, right? That's not I understand that's not the role of this tool, but at least maybe this encourages others to

start developing their own add-ons or in the digital sense of their own plugins for this approach. &gt;&gt; Yeah, just very quickly, this is actually the fascinating thing about

developing AI tools. So go ahead and do it. Uh wherever you think about whenever you think about something there's always a use case around that you can newly freshly apply because it hasn't been

done yet. And we've been thinking about uh prediction as well and there was was actually just has been a talk from the foreign office about that on that topic and yes AI can do that models can do

that that it's not as easy as you might think but they they can actually do this and uh what we are doing here is to present the first step of course now we going to watch now what the what the

most uh interesting use case will come up uh people will come up with and ask us to to do as a next phase. But certainly you can build on that and also there will be a feedback from the

tool from that tool or from the tools available to the processes actually what you've what you've described. So next time when you are relatively certain that you can quickly access the baseline

information then of course the uh the process of negotiation the human side will probably change a bit and adopt to that uh possibility. So we'll see what uh what the this process of um uh

continuous improvement will get us to. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Uh actually how many years data is needed to predict to develop a model in actual sense

&gt;&gt; for prediction you &gt;&gt; haven't &gt;&gt; data &gt;&gt; we haven't built a tool yet that that we can evaluate um that is It is not

possible to say. It depends strongly on the use case. I mean um what do you mean prediction of climate change or uh prediction of negotiations? It's it's very difficult to answer that question.

uh from farming side I'm actually speaking from a farming side and uh in the sector hoticulture sector we need to develop uh one AI app like that and further to predict forecasting further

forecasting of next five years prediction like that how many years data is actually needed for this &gt;&gt; whether it is 20 years or 30 years &gt;&gt; so again this tool is not for that

purpose but u I can tell you say at CW we are developing uh India's first highresolution climate resilience atlas uh for extreme events we have data um of over the more than 50 years for

precipitation we have data down to uh subdists the 4,500 plus subdists in India we're looking at precipitation changes again over the last uh about 50 years for heat stress this has you know

this data has not been collected in that way for for too long but the the the tool we are developing is actually for neighborhood scale heat stress heat and humidity so even in a city like Delhi

you will have you know what what is the heat stress of bhatan mandepam and supreme court was the heat stress situation in marovar neighborhood scale allows you to map these into the kind of

uh responses you need so when you come to horiculture, farming, uh you'll need a combination of precipitation patterns, heat stress because you know trees also and plants also catch fever as well as

extreme events. Um the more we can keep injecting that data into the evolving models, the more accurate they will become. But minimum half a century is what we think is needed and that's what

we're building and hopefully in the next uh two or three months we'll make our tool a digital public code for others to use as well. &gt;&gt; Great.

&gt;&gt; Um I wanted to ask this u in this negotiate COP tool that you have developed which models do you use? Do you use open source models or proprietary or some hybrid models? What

do you prefer? &gt;&gt; Um so we use two models. Um the one is for the ETL manager that extracts the smart data. Um there we use a model that was um purely developed for the German

uh administration. Basically it's an open source project called F13. Uh the foreign office is also part of it. Um and that was developed for the federal government or parts of the federal

government. Um and then for the LLM use so the the portal chat that you see um it is uh GPT uh open uh OSS uh for the rack interaction exactly uh with the 120 billion 120 billion parameters.

&gt;&gt; Thank you uh the panel for the interest. &gt;&gt; Sure. myself Aperna Jooshi I work in uh climate education as well not only climate science but also climate

education uh as Dr. Kosh mentioned uh at the co my experience was also same everyone is tired super bomb bombardment with lot of information so the tool will really help uh there is one question and

a comment the question is u uh it was mentioned that the tool uses data from UNF uh CCC however uh do you also use data from WO and IPCC this is the question and the comment is um as uh

discussed a few minutes ago if the to can have some simulation scenario of what if cases even for the negotiation parameters it will really help. Of course, one can build uh but that might

be reinventing few of the things. Uh but if the tool also can accommodate something like this in coming versions, it will be really helpful. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Um maybe I just quickly answer the

question on the on the database. Um we only use the the submission portal. Um they've been we we thought about also including other um data in there. Um but the more

diverse data sources you use the more complicated the technical architecture needs to be. Um and in my experience um building these models um it's easier to solve one problem at a time and solve

that properly rather than increasing the complexity by I think that there is this um yeah potential of AI because it's such a blackbox and magic that you just want to throw all of the problems at it

and hope that you get an answer. Um but I think you need to have a more targeted approach um on the specific issue with the specific problem that you're trying to solve and then solve that properly

before you move on and try to then come up with other other issues or use cases. Um on on the scenario thing um diff as a difficult same same thing my as a

project manager my thinking has been making the tool as as usable and impactful as possible. Um I mean there's always the potential and working in development corporation um it's the same

thing that we would like to have scenarios for development corporation outcomes based on evaluations that we've we've run um but it is a is a difficult field and I'm not very sure that LLMs

are necessarily the answer to these forecasting scenarios. I think you can use them for strategic foresight. Get your thinking going of like what might would happen the scenarios you can plan

them out. Um uh but I don't think you you will able to forecast them uh specifically. Um something and that's the last remark. Um something where um scenarios are very useful in the actual

negotiation process is um by setting up your for instance GPT as your counterpart in in negotiation and there you can actually run through the negotiation yourself and negoti

pre-negotiate basically and see how how how the counterpart would maybe react and then you get into or you you you become more prepared for the actual uh negotiation. So that's that's a use case

that I've seen in terms of the scenarios that you play out um to actually happen and that's already possible with uh with uh any kind of I don't want to name names right now but any models that are

out there. &gt;&gt; Sure. Thank you. I think I can now grab few of my students to develop the uh scenarios as well. Thanks. &gt;&gt; It's the last question we can take.

&gt;&gt; Are you uh describing this as AI commons or digital public good? I mean uh uh it's restricted to only the negotiators, the climate negotiators. What is public about it?

&gt;&gt; It's publicly available. Um I mean the use case is with the negotiators. Um so they are the ones using it, but you can uh get access to the same information that are on there freely through the

website. Uh you don't need to log in. Uh you don't need to register. It's just publicly available. And that's the digital public good about it. Um that's the AI comments. Um I know that the

digital public good alliance is somewhere here too. Um we haven't registered the tool yet. Um and they have certain guidelines. Um so it's a preparatory digital public good in that

regard without being licensed. &gt;&gt; I see that they Yeah, please you can make &gt;&gt; Yeah, I think one more and then uh &gt;&gt; one final.

&gt;&gt; Okay, one final. &gt;&gt; Hello panel. So myself Jagal and right now I am building a platform Genjas. It's an AI powered platform which is enabling the international audience to

purchase anything from the domestic market of India. So my question is to uh the Dr. Arunabos. So sir when competitor offers identical quality and pricing in the global trade what differentiators

create negotiation leverage and long-term advantage from your experience what builds the priority in the international partnerships I want to hear that from you. Sorry, you're

selling carbon credits. Is that the tool you're developing? &gt;&gt; So, right now we are just enabling the local market suppliers and the international audience to purchase

anything from the local marketplaces of India. &gt;&gt; But the local market is selling carbon credits or any kind of product. &gt;&gt; Any kind of product.

&gt;&gt; Well, I mean, if if if you have exactly the same product or service at exactly the same price, then it's going to be an inky pinky pony choice. uh but usually that's not the case right and therefore

the more you're able to offer let's let's just take this into a use case right rather than and since this is a conversation about climate let's say there is a forestry project in Brazil

versus a forestry project in Indonesia you will need uh uh verification of whether that project is indeed uh doing what it is claiming to do that verification is not going to come from

AI it's going to come from satellites and maybe some degree of ground truthing. Um on top of that there is you know then there might be other parameters. It's like um the buyer of

that credit might want to be looking at not just the reduction in emissions or emissions avoided but you know extent of social benefit how many farmers benefited as a result of doing this and

again you might have different numbers for that and then there will be a different numbers for the price. So I think uh this is slightly different from the conversation we are having right now

but there are tools that are being developed which are trying to digitize these processes and enable the monitoring review and verification of these um to embed a lot more uh both

granularity and trust in in in the system. when that happens you actually democratize the access to to carbon markets much more but the thought I have while I have the mic and I is that you

know we've talked about trust and I I don't belong to the government of India therefore I cannot speak for it but I wonder you know whether to reingject trust in an evolving tool like this uh

shouldn't the EU and India for instance uh be co-developing next versions of tools like this. Um then I guess the use cases will also become more specific to the circumstance of negotiators. Um and

then you can also uh assume that there's a degree of uh uh you know as President Reagan said there's trusting but also verification that's happening rather than just assumption of good intention.

Absolutely. Um that that is definitely the case and that's part of why we're here. The co-development part I think that is that is the most important part uh about the trust but also the

verification. Uh and we would love if someone from the Indian government is here. Uh we would love to also talk after the session. Um yeah so thank you very much for those closing works.

&gt;&gt; And this maybe [clears throat] brings me to my last question. We have three minutes left and I would like to have a look in the future. So if we meet in five years, how would negotiations have

changed um using AI or digital tools? Would they change or not? So what is what is your sort on this? Who want to start? Okay, &gt;&gt; I can do it quickly. Um I think I

thought the um the prediction part would be most most interesting to add to that. Will it change negotiations? I believe definitely it will because uh just AIs are just so very good in in in changing

the way we work. So this will change and I what I hope is that this will actually um this open approach will uh increase trust between those nations who who can uh who can rely on that who can use make

use of that because that is one of the counter models against the the market solution to have uh singular models being paid uh for supplying you with power basically and

and that's that's hopefully the way that things will change and yeah maybe we'll have the prediction part ready then &gt;&gt; um this is an AI talk and we haven't

used the bus word agentic yet um so um I think one of the the ways to also um that that might work or will work in the future and um in January um the Harvard University put together an a global AI

negotiation forum and I've seen loads of agentic use cases where um agents actually prepare and what I I will iterate that the factual part of the um the preparatory part of the negotiations

and I think that's something that um that agents in AI will potentially in five years um might be able to do to give them negotiators more time for for handshakes at the actual COP

&gt;&gt; if you give them the right governance. That's important actually. Uh at the moment uh they are very unregulated. So sorry to add this. And that's absolutely right because the

governance of climate negotiations are going to fundamentally I think change uh uh over the next four or five years. So I'm actually thinking of two things. one I'm going back to, you know, uh my first

COP uh 15 16 years, 17 years ago and uh negotiators asking uh me who was myself very much a novice in the game. Uh do we even have a list of you know these

this negotiating blocks position or do we have a even a list of you know uh what they have promised to do on clean energy or what they have promised on finance even the most basic information

was missing. What's happened now is you have many more sectors of the economy that have a say in what's happening. you know we weren't discussing maritime emissions or

aviation emissions uh at that time the nature of climate risks were not the same so I think uh it will all these will start getting reflected in this and maybe one way could be even if you're

looking at negotiating texts but draw on other multilateral environmental agreement negotiations like what what are they saying in the Montreal protocol on this what are they saying in the uh

uh IMO negotiations on this what are they saying in IKEO negotiations on this. They're all negotiating texts, official documents, but it gives a better understanding. The other is, and

here I'm reflecting on my role as special envoy for South Asia. South Asia has landlocked countries like Nepal and Bhutan. It has coastal countries like um islands like Sri Lanka or Maldives.

There when they approach negotiations, they're not just looking at it as, you know, do we have a large delegation or small delegation. They're also looking at our are our lived realities being

reflected in the negotiations. And I think democratizing both the information but also the interpretation of that information which I said earlier might actually not just help developing

country negotiators understand what's happening on the other side but maybe even help the so-called other side get a better understanding and empathy of what's going on at home in in our

neighborhood. Thank you. And with this positive future looking words, I would like to close this panel. Big thank you to my panelists. Big applause please.

And um I'm sure they will stay here around. So in case you have question, I saw a lot of hands still up there. So please you can ask them. Um thank you for your interest and your participation

and see you around here. Have a great summit. Bye. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much for participating. Thank you very much. Appreciate the opportunity.
