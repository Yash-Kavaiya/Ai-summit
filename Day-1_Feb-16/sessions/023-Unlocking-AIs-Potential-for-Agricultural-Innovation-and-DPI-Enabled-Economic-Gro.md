## 📝 Transcript

ation and economic growth. Um while we'll have the panel coming in a few minutes um I as your moderator today. So I'm Nita Bassin and I'm the CEO of digital green in India and we work with

basically small holder farmers and AI. Um we basically have today partners who will talk about how smallh holder farmers who s sit at the center of the global food system and how digital

public infrastructure DPI really provides a building block uh to enable AI powered advisory tools for farmers to help them manage risks, access information and participate in markets.

uh we will show how India is using the whole DPI infrastructure to ensure that the farmer benefits and gets impact from here and also how the overall south collaboration can come together

especially in countries like Ethiopia. Um before you know we really have a bigger discussion out here um I would like to invite Sanjay Jen out on the stage. Um

Sanjay is uh the director of digital public infrastructure for Gates Foundation and um before he actually comes on the stage I think this is also a amazing moment in India for us to talk

about DPIs especially as in the latest um budget the FM has spoken about and also have included resources for agree and stack and batistar uh we learn more about it today we'll

talk more about it today but uh I'll just hand over the mic to Sanjay Jen to deliver the keynote. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thanks Ni. Uh thank you for that uh introduction

and uh thank you everyone for being here to for this very important conversation. Uh the number of people living in extreme poverty has fallen by 2/3 today. However, the resources to help continue

that progress are being abruptly cut back with countries slashing more than $30 billion in aid over the last year alone. In a future of more limited resources,

we have to harness new technologies such as DPI and AI to help countries do more with less. As we know, many small holder farmers, particularly women, have long been

disconnected from information about things like best practices, resilient seed varieties, market information, not to mention up-to-date information on weather, pest, and disease risks.

Countries like India have been leading the way by building digital public infrastructure that's needed to enable better advisory services as well as to access services like finance, subsidies,

insurance and other tools uh to help increase productivities and income. We have seen states in India deploy digital services for farmers like Krishi Samriddhi in Odisha reaching 7 million

farmers at a cost of less than 18 cents per farmer per year to improve farmers income especially during climate shocks. uh Nidhi mentioned that uh the role of the government of India. See the

government of India has designed and invested in AgriStack to help develop national farmer registries, crop registries and plot registries. Building on this and utilizing Agri stack as the

foundation, AI solutions can be delivered to farmers via the Vistar platform which synthesizes content from many sources into a consumable product for farmers. Both these innovations

AgriStack and Vistar were recently announced as part of the 2026 budget and resources are allocated to them. Ethiopia is in the country that we can look to see how these technologies are

being deployed. Ethopia's digital ID system, FIDA, allows a farmer to register, geotag her land, and use AI enabled tools to get information in the language she speaks, tailored to the

soil and weather patterns she experiences so that she can boost her yields and grow a greater variety of more resilient crops. She can then see fair market prices for these crops and

sell directly to buyers using Ethiopia's uh e- payments app called PhD pass a direct economic benefit to them to impact those who need them most and make them secure and sustainable. DPI systems

must be designed for the public good, led by nations themselves and grounded in the trust of the people who use them. As nations invest in digitization, many partners have come forward offering to

help countries build digital tools. But we have seen that in some of these cases, these tools aren't as effective as countries hope. Either because they're designed to extract a

significant profit or because they're designed for a specific use case and don't integrate with other key digital services. So just to take a step back, we want to

define DPI so that it can be powerfully integrated and sustainable. At the Gates Foundation, we are aligning with the World Bank's definition on DPI uh which establishes DPI as foundational reusable

digital building blocks such as digital payments, identity, and data sharing designed for the public benefit. The foundation is also investing in tools like MOSIP that combine the best ideas

from DPI deployments around the world into open-source platforms which countries can adapt and customize to meet their unique needs. The countries who do have this foundational

infrastructure in place will have extraordinary possibilities at their fingertips to build next generation tools and services that can transform societies.

This is only possible if they focus on developing them for the people who need them most. In our panel here today, we'll dive into some of the particular examples. We'll discuss the usefulness

and impact that can come from strong DPI agriculture advisory services for small holder farmers. Our panelists each play a critical role in bringing together the infrastructure policies and partnerships

needed to bring the vision. I opened with uh the vision where providing timely, accurate, context specific extension advice to small holder farmers in their local languages is feasible,

scalable and has the potential to impact livelihoods. Uh this is going to be one of the biggest engines of the global south. In closing, these days people tend to talk

about how the challenges facing the world have never been greater. But the truth is neither have the opportunities. As long as there's trust in the system, trust underpins adoption and scale.

Trust in data, institutions, models, and governance arrangements is shaped as much by transparency, consistency, and accountability as by technical performance. This is the power of DPI in

agriculture. Let's open it up to hear from our panelists about their work to accelerate impact where it is needed most. &gt;&gt; Thank you. And back to you N.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you Sanjay. And may I request you to please uh you know stay on the stage and I'll invite the other panelists too. Um yeah sorry everyone. Uh so we still

waiting for one of our panelists uh Jagis Babu but while we waiting for him uh let me please invite um sorry our other two panelists on the stage. Um Fatima Al-mula

please on the stage. Thank you. And Nikka Shetti she's the CEO of PXT. Thank you. Thank you Sanjay and thank you and um sorry can you hear me?

&gt;&gt; Yeah. Can you hear me now? Yeah. Great. Um thank you Sanjay. Um you know that was a very very um convincing and a motivating keynote. I think it puts the right context for us to take this

conversation forward. But um before I take it forward I would also once again like to introduce both of you. So um Fatima is from the U presidential courts. Thank you for being here. And

Pratika um Shetty is the CEO of PXD. Uh while we'll wait for Jagdish I'll introduce him when he comes in. I think he's stuck in one of the queues outside. Um but Sanjay coming to you I think you

know I know uh you have spent last seven eight minutes uh and you must be a little exhausted but I would still want to pick up the context from how you spoke about and you gave the example of

Ethiopia also um you know from a point of view of um u you know how how do you really see uh uh you know viable business and incentive models for sustaining AI advisory and DPI

investments particularly in private uh public private partnerships or hybrid delivery arrangements. What models have shown promise and where they have failed and why they have failed? It would be

great if you can share some examples with us. &gt;&gt; Can you hear me? Uh thanks for that NI. uh so I think one of the points that we I wanted to first

sort of uh focus a little bit on the sustainability aspect of some of these uh uh services where we are looking at these models. So broadly what we have seen around the world is that when

countries um you know the default way of building software and systems has been that you build for each application separately and it's only when you sort of start to take a take a consistent

view that you want to build a common ID system like in India you have one ID that is used for all services. uh similarly around the world when you sort of say that each department should not

build its own ID system, its own payments, its own data exchange layers uh that's only when you actually start to look at uh building a uh DPI way of building systems and that then makes it

more sustainable. Um so and when you don't do that, you see the failures happen. So for example if you see um not an agriculture specific use case but for example I think in Nigeria you have got

about 13 different ID systems and each of them is sort of run independently and that's a big cost and so on the other hand if like in India we see uh Aadhaar in Ethiopia we see FIDA uh these are

examples where you're able to build a single system which can then deliver these benefits across the entire ecosystem and so that is sort of the counter example to the one that you

described right about failure. So which is really what I would say is that you need to have a very coherent approach to do that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Thank you. I think um you know a

little bit on on that building a single system I think when JB comes in Jagish comes in he's going to touch upon that but uh you know moving forward I also wanted to you know share with everyone

that we are trying to structure this conversation actually trying to cover three main points. one is around uh basically how DPI enables AI in agriculture something that um you're

already talking about Sanjay you're already talking about and uh secondly we will you know after addressing this point we will come to how AI powered advisory systems are supporting farmer

decisions making in practice and last but not the least the most important we are going to touch upon inclusion how do we ensure that tools reach the farmers who need them the most so that's how we

going infrastructure rest of the conversation but um you know picking up from what Sanjay said uh Fatima if I could come to you um we know that UAE is really investing a lot on um the overall

AI systems right and the AI capacity how how are you thinking about partnering with countries that may not have that kind of AI capacity and how do you see the you know how do you see the real

case for collaborations out Good morning everybody and thank you for having me here today. Uh first of all I want to um acknowledge the Indian government and say thank you. What an

incredible AI summit. Really we're so blown away by the scale um of this AI summit and to have it in the region is really amazing. Um and thank you to the Gates Foundation as well for putting

this um for this session together. I think it's a very timely um conversation to be having. Uh you know India has really established itself as a leader when it comes to digitalization

um infrastructure. We can see that with um you know the the the the efforts that have been built in the the Agri stack and Vistar um and it's really amazing to see that that has the

potential to really become the backbone of agriculture. So um congrats on India for for leading on that. The UAE is also as you mentioned Nidi um we're also investing a lot when it comes to AI um

and really leveraging digital technologies in order to um advance our own development as a country and one of the things that we're also doing um is uh really championing AI and agriculture

as well. So in December, we launched Abu Dhabi's AI ecosystem for global agricultural development. And this ecosystem aims to do exactly just that is to support countries and institutions

across the value chain of agriculture to be able to develop AI products as public goods and then scale them at large. Um, two key initiatives that came out of this ecosystem. Number one was the CGIR

AI hub where we're working very closely with them to translate AI AI um data into public goods. And the second thing that we launched in partnership with the Gates Foundation is the institute for

agriculture and AI which is a dedicated institute that aims to pipeline um all development of AI products within this institution and it's going to be part of the Muhammad bin Zed University of AI

which is one of the best universities of AI in the world right now. Um and this institute specifically to answer your question will do a couple of things. Number one, it will it aims to mobilize

large-scale corpus. So bringing together international organizations, multilateral banks, private sectors, um academia to house agricultural data. The second thing that it aims to do is to

mobilize uh compute power in order to train um and to host models to be able to support countries to develop these products. Thirdly, it will uh tailor these models through technical

assistance depending on language, location, culture and so on. Um and of course the last thing that it will aim to do is also prov be able to provide training to different countries so that

countries can have full ownership of these public goods. &gt;&gt; Yeah, thanks for sharing that Fatima. I think we all can see that really some of the countries who don't have that kind

of an infrastructure how can how will all these countries really uh benefit from there but you know I have a follow-up question for you out there um you know what are the concrete steps

required with governments to establish AI advisory systems that inform decision- making and what does it really take to go from pilot to scale &gt;&gt; so can you repeat the first question

please So what are the concrete steps required with government? So what does the government really need to do to establish AI advisory systems that inform decision- making? So one of the

things that I think is very important for governments to do is first of all to to take ownership and to champion in order to support farmers um and to build uh ecosystems such as the one that we

launched so that there are steps throughout that are supporting uh governments in order to develop these products that can eventually reach the farmers. Um so when we launched the AI

ecosystem for global agriculture development the the value chain it covers is everything from concept developing as a concept um AI research agriculture AI research and then the

actual product development of the public good and eventual largecale um scaling. Um once you're able to institutionalize all of these different areas, you're able to create a pathway to develop

these products and then eventually also while you're simultaneously working with the several countries for them to be involved in the decision- making as well and to be able to tailor it to um to the

farmers. One of the things that we did for example is uh through this uh through this initiative the the AI hub we've launched the agriculture large language model which is one of the first

large language models provided fine-tuned for agriculture and provided as a public good and we did this in partnership with digital green who was a main partner the CGI the world bank the

gates foundation embra um bayer so we're bringing in not just governments and institutions but also private sector sectors to be able to contribute this and to be able to finetune it

specifically for agriculture and for farmers. &gt;&gt; Great. Um I think I think that's definitely also addressing the need of the R to strengthen the whole advisory

system. Um Nisha I have many questions for you but I actually ideally wanted it to be a follow-up questions of Jagdish questions. So I'll still wait for five minutes otherwise I'll come back to you.

Uh Sanjay can I come back to you in the meantime? Um I think when we talking about uh you know reaching the last mile also the scale one of the biggest things which comes out is benchmarking right

and um you know for what do you think for better benchmarking approaches that reflect real world performance let's say contextual relevance safety trust all of that put together um you know what is

the evaluation landscape like uh what are the gaps in the current benchmarking let's say example of agribench and what public good. Do you do we need to keep up you know so from a benchmarking

evaluation point of view what are the benchmarking tools? How do you think we need to address what is happening in this whole system? &gt;&gt; Actually the value of benchmarks are you

know is manifold. Of course it helps for people to be able to evaluate those systems but also sets up a standard against which people can compare with each other. It also sets up a

competition landscape so that people are then competing to actually build to the uh to you know to compete with others on the same benchmark. Uh so I'm actually not completely on board with the

agribench effort. So I don't want to specifically answer that but we have seen that in general the broadly uh benchmarks serve as a very important public measure that allow coordination

across different actors to then be able to deliver services to the end go end user and so with that in mind uh I do think that's an important effort but the second part of benchmarking is it has to

continuously evolve so once you actually have a benchmark out there then you have people start to meet it then you have actually keep on evolving because users need keep changing and also their

ability to distinguish between the different parties who are supporting them in the field uh also keep changing. So that is a constant effort. So benchmarking is not a one-time effort

but something that has to be done on a continuous basis. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Thank you. I think um even even we are at digital green I think we are a part of putting that effort towards

benchmarking because we all realize and understand that as we are creating these solutions benchmarking becomes a very very important to have standardized evaluation systems. Um, let me just I

think uh, you know, uh, come to you right now and um, you know, PhD really works and supports with the government in helping them to create you know the AI advisory systems and you know if you

really accept the hypothesis that reusable templates and blueprints are the way forward and everybody doesn't need to really build from scratch. Um, what should the government prioritize?

what should they not prioritize and how do you make sure that you know systems reach scale. &gt;&gt; Thanks Niti. Um I wish GB was here to talk about the the reusable blueprints

because that flows really nicely in in here. But I think you know we've been working with the Ministry of Agriculture and several other governments on scaling uh DPI systems like Bhat Vistar. Um and

from that you know three three reflections on what I think governments should prioritize as you think about actually getting to scale. One is sort of riffing off what Fatima said um

institutional ownership and mandate. So focus on governance, focus on who takes accountability when things go wrong. Making sure things are resourced in the long term both in terms of people but

also in terms of budget. Uh so that these programs, you know, you don't set them up and then they just wither away and die out. So there's that constant innovation, constant learning. So that's

one. Um, second is continuing to invest in data pipelines and content pipelines. So, as the research involves, as the data gets better, making sure you're you have the investment in place to feed

that into those systems. And then last, and I think this is the most important one, is making sure the the feedback loops exist uh from farmers and from frontline workers. So you're not just

measuring you know downloads or how many people accessed a service but you're meaningfully thinking about you know did they engage with it did it actually uh create impact for the end user um and so

as a consequence of that I think the things I would say prioritize less is locking in on a particular model or a particular technology these things are going to evolve at you know frenetic

pace and I think we need to design systems um as most DPI is designed to sort of be interoperable to switch in and switch out what's working better um as the benchmarks improve and as they

tell us what's working and what's not. &gt;&gt; Um you know from there from there um you know um Sanji can if I can come back to you and uh sorry um sorry to put you on a spot. This was a question I was

planning to ask JB but I thought maybe you would be the right person also to say that you know especially in terms of what even Fatima spoke about in terms of the collaborations and partnerships

bringing from from there to uh you know how do you you know there's always a confusion between how do you really distinguish between AI infrastructure and AI solution and um um you know how

does this all relate to the DPI you're the DPI expert so I thought maybe you know let me just ask you this question and um you know why does this matter when countries really decide to invest

into something like this. So uh so thanks for that. The thing that DPI does is it allows you to go out at scale for the entire population. It effectively creates you know something

you would call a system of record. So you know you have the farmer registries, you have the transactions, you have those histories, you have those underlying systems and on top of that

you have then the systems that establish identity, authenticate it or create payment, subsidies, insurance etc. All of these are essential for the farmer services to actually exist and work. The

second they're also essential to customize the advisory services for the farmer. So if you are a farmer and you call a advisory service, you're able to identify yourself, your plot of land,

get the information that relates to the plot of land, maybe the soil health information or the historical what has happened on that piece of land over the last few years and then the weather

that's relevant to you. So it basically allows the advisory service to be very much directed towards you. So this extreme personalization for everyone in the um continent can only or uh country

or whatever scale you're looking at can only happen if you have the right DPI in place. So that's why we always say that DPI is essential for AI to be inclusive because AI systems can only work if they

have information about that particular user or that individual. And so for that reason for AI to be inclusive you actually need that underlying DPI layer first that then enables the

personalization context to happen. Uh and that is u and so that's really one of the key sort of separator. So AI and DPI have to work together for this. So, so from what I understand and correct me

if I'm wrong, a DPI layer is like a horizontal and it's it's a must, right? It's a must. And on top of that, I think your other AI infrastructure needs to be built or let's say solutions, private

players or government can come in and build the solution and that's how each country should look at it. Right. &gt;&gt; Exactly. So yeah, you have this big horizontal which covers everyone and

then on top of it you would have uh maybe uh different people or the government uh building solutions that then can work with the farmer or maybe with extension workers so that they can

give the right advice to farmers. So there can be different targeted approaches that build on top of that. &gt;&gt; Okay. um Fatima um you know as as uh you know we are sitting in India and we're

talking about a lot of DBIS and AI advisory in India but uh you know as you as UAE started talking about and investing into AI um is there a something that learning that you took

from India is there something that you know uh you said yes this is working right and let's let's use it and scale it up &gt;&gt; uh absolutely I think there's a there's

a lot to learn from India. Um you guys are much more advanced when it comes to uh AI and scalability and agriculture. Um one example that I can give is one of our uh co-funded initiatives called AIM

for scale which we co-und with the Gates Foundation. It's really an initiative to um to to drastically scale uh scientifically proven technologies um in order to uh reach farmers. and we work

with um we work closely with the Indian government. So one of our first innovation packages to come out of aim for scale is AI weather forecasting and um through this and through working with

the closely with the Indian government and through working also with PXD we were able to uh reach 38 million farmers to provide better AI weather forecasting in preparation for the monsoon season.

Um and that in itself was really an example of a true success and working and working handinhand with governments and with organizations such as PXD in India. Uh the access that we were able

to have, we would not be able to do that if we did not have such good partnerships. So I think that is a one great example and one success story and we do have um a goal to reach 100

million farmers hopefully by uh 2030. &gt;&gt; Thank you. I think I think that would be really very um motivating for a lot of stakeholders sitting in this uh auditorium today. Um I'll just make it

an open question for both both of you uh Sanjay uh and Naksha uh that you know when we you know we when I was introducing I spoke about the finance minister uh you know putting resources

for Vistar um you know what what do you think and since both of you work very closely with the government what do you think of course I know digital green has was also a part of this whole foundation

of Vistar but what do you think led to that uh success and how do other governments or countries replicate that? &gt;&gt; I think back to the first point I made, I think institutional mandate is

critical. Um I think I have seen you know from the early days when you guys were part of this having champions for this within government that buy into the value of DPI that commit to national

scale and that are willing to sort of put in the time and effort and resources that require bringing you know both doing the actual work but then also bringing the coalition of partners

together generating momentum for it within the government. I think that has been key. Um and you know we all work in government. There's a lot of shifting priorities. There's a lot of changes. I

think what has been key to the success here is that continued um championing of this initiative across different stakeholders within the ministry of agriculture.

&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think uh India's seen uh significant success with the DPI efforts over the last 15 years or so. And at some point I think the question was how do you think about all of the success

that we have had and translated to other domains and so I think the confidence that came from that journey uh played off into it but then the second thing is really the approach to say we need to

solve this for the farmer and the DP approach sort of says we don't want to solve it for the farmer we want to enable solutions for the farmer and so that then leads to this idea of building

a stack which has all of these elements on which multiple solutions can be built that makes it actually quite extensible uh to provide for all of these services on top and so I think having the

confidence that the DPI approach works having the u mandate uh to do it then also uh wanting to solve it for the farmer I think the political value of doing it is very high so I

think there's very important that 60% of our country depends on agric culture is taken care of and is not left behind. So I think all of that put together um allowed for a very long effort to try

out different approaches and to grow over time. It didn't happen overnight. I think it finally made it to the budget speech this year, but it's been many years in the making and it's been many

stakeholders, many people wanting to solve these problems and then taking it step by step to get us to this point and uh you know, hats off to all those people who have been working on this

space for so long just to get to this point and I think we still have a long way to go. &gt;&gt; We're not done yet. So I but I think it's a very good validation that we have

had successes on the path here. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay. Yeah, definitely. And I think in India with with also now couple of state governments taking it on with the Mahavistar happening this is

definitely a movement forward. Um I did say earlier that the last part is going to be on inclusion and and I think a lot of us sitting in this room do have questions and you know we are very very

conscious about what we building how we're building how this is inclusive. Um Ricksha you know touching about the you know on the interplay between languages and last mile delivery. Um is inclusion

beyond language. Um when we think about reaching the last mile the marginalized farmer we need multi- channelannel approaches. So one is of course language but we also need multi- channelannel

approaches and a broader set of choices. What does effective inclusive last smile delivery mean to you? &gt;&gt; Thanks Nadi. I think when we you know when when we design these solutions so

to speak, it's very easy to design for the average user or the most accessible user. And so I think the inclusion needs to be built in at the design stage. And so that's thinking about both what

content feeds in, what language you use, but even how you reach farmers at scale. Um and so you know for us that often means you're designing with farmers you're not designing for them and you

know that means you're designing for their unique constraints low literacy low connectivity you know there's a whole range of you know folks that are very happy to use smartphones and are

comfortable with technology to people who live in places where there is no connectivity whatsoever and I think any platform any network approach needs to facilitate solutions that allow you to

reach all those people um at scale. That of course looks partially like a like a multi-channel approach but it also involves spending a lot of time trying to figure out what's the advice is it

actually solving the constraint is it actionable um and constantly learning from you know farmer feedback what's working and what's not. So the service improves at

scale. It's not a static we've built something and we scale it. we continue to learn from different user groups to ensure that you know this idea of inclusion continues to evolve as we meet

different user needs at scale. &gt;&gt; Um yeah yeah I was going to actually say that you know uh both to both of you even Sanjay I would really love to you to both of you to talk about you know

how you look at inclusion and especially how do you as we are building everything that we are building the infrastructure how do you make sure that it covers diversity it is uh inclusive in all

ways. Yeah. Um so I think my my panelists have have said it perfectly. Uh but I I do want to give an example of how u we talking we're talking about solving for the

farmer and effective inclusive last mile delivery um through one of our projects which was the AI weather forecasting um and delivering the the forecast to the farmers through SMS messaging. Um I tell

this story often because on on our side we built um a great a great solution that could be provided to farmers. We worked closely with our uh partners at uh with the Indian government. We worked

closely with our partners at PXD to ensure the delivery and surveys. But when we actually went to visit the farmers to to to see for ourselves, we got very positive responses. But some

farmers were would say yes I received the the information and yes I received the forecasting um but it didn't align with a religious follow a religious holiday that I follow which is when I

know the rains come. So for me as someone who can see that there are solutions but then when I speak to a farmer and they give me this feedback that is even more important than the

technology and the solution itself because if they don't trust it or they don't trust you or the information then then what's the point right so really building for the farmer and with the

farmer is the most important part of &gt;&gt; we also at digital green as we are building our solution this is feedback mechanism is a very integral part of what we do uh ensuring that it's not

coming from what we think but we are making it along with the farmers for the farmers that's typically what we also do right Sanjay over to you &gt;&gt; yeah no I think inclusion as such I mean

very valid points out here about how we have to build with the end users in mind and not just with them in mind but with them actually building uh out together the solution and

when you think of India's scale scale. I mean, we're 1.4 billion people and, you know, even if you were to look at something a solution that would go to 99% of the people, you're still leaving

out, you know, many many million people. And so with all of that uh thinking, you have to actually enable the creation of these solutions. So it's not really about building the final solution but

saying how do I build a weather system which can then reach uh every farmer and maybe the way to reach the farmer maybe SMS or maybe a smartphone or maybe an extension worker because there's no

phone and so how do you make sure that you build a layer that then allows a customization which is more at the edge which is uh very different for each user uh and all of this requires trust. I

mean trust is an extremely important element of inclusion and because if you lose the trust of people either because you're not aligning to their beliefs or you're sort of you know you give them

advice and it proves wrong then you know all of those are places where you can actually go wrong. So uh and you have to make sure that you build that trust in and a lot of it comes from making sure

that you're taking the right advice from the right people. You have the right stakeholders. So having the government as a stakeholder is very important but so is it important to get agriculture

experts and to get weather experts into the mix and to build their solutions. It's not just about the technology. It's about all of this coming together. And so uh only then can you get to inclusion

but I think even then it's always work in progress. Right. I feel it's we still have a long way to go on that aspect as well. &gt;&gt; Yeah absolutely. I I you know I think um

I had I of course I can keep on asking questions uh but um um one I think um the other day I was chatting with Jagdish JB and I told him you all over and he took me too seriously I think

decided that he should skip this one but it could be uh uh the traffic outside but uh you know before I summarize our discussion um any quick remarks that three of you have before I summarize it.

I guess I'll the the only thing I'll add to this entire conversation is you know you can build the most perfect platform the most perfect network the most perfect technology

trust takes time and you know to Fatima's point as you're pushing newer information things that might go against you know knowledge people have held for years both designing with them but also

you know working over time to build that trust you know you you prove yourself right once you communicate uncertainty adequately there are different aspects that go into

building trust and I think that is going to be critical um as we think about what it's going to take for you know AI advisory services to go to scale &gt;&gt; and yeah I mean I I agree I think that

we are at a very critical time as AI is coming and growing very quickly there's a lot of excitement um but we also have to be very careful in terms of how we um manage data and build models and to make

sure that we do it um with the right partners. We build together um to ensure that these public goods reach the people um who need it the most. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Uh so welcome JB.

&gt;&gt; We were just concluding and you're there in time. &gt;&gt; Very sorry. No, I was just telling the audience that I've been telling you that you're all over and you took me too

seriously. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. &gt;&gt; I think Sanjay while you are giving your thoughts I think you can just grab a sip of water maybe.

&gt;&gt; Yeah. So I think you know we're at a very critical point as mentioned because you know we've been working on this for a while and AI is only growing in rapid uh you know in terms of capabilities and

so it's actually a good time for us to see how we can use this increased capability to better our solutions to maybe reach more people and to be able to really improve you know bring that

people the people who suffer for so long out of poverty. Uh I think this is the right time and so with that I'm going to give it back to JB. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Uh JB I had um so to introduce JB

JB is the CEO of Xstep Foundation and has been a very integral part of how you know DPIs are being involved and the whole Vistar story also. Um JB I think because we are just running out of time

right now but I think your experience your role has been a lot about building the DPI also I think I asked Sanjay this question since you were not there and I know you're very passionate about this

whole thing about DPI versus solutions and all of that. So would you like to cover that point and of course I know there was a question that I had for you on languages right from an inclusion

point of view. So you know if if in probably in one answer if you can sum it all and uh &gt;&gt; yes first of all um because of certain VIP moments the whole roads got blocked

and I was uh happily participating in the panel online. So so in some sense what I see is that there are many organizations institutions and organizations

developing massive amount of data in a very accountable manner. If you think about DPI in a simple way as data on rails, data on rails, right? Where others can access, other can use

accountably, authoritatively. What AI does is to supercharge the whole idea. If you can actually bring data on rails and combine that with accountable and responsible AI, suddenly you are

unlocking a lot of possibilities for population scale reforms. Think about a simple idea that an advisory sitting in a university becomes available at a fingertip to a farmer in

context in a very personalized manner where you can combine the identity, the location, the context, the crop and the season weather data from weather systems all of that together and the schemes

available for the farmer and the status. For example, Amul recently launched a DPI powered by AI where livestock identity is also part of the system. So when I say my cow is sick, I already

know which cow it is. I already know the medicines the cow is taking. So when you combine all of these, what makes it possible is such a inclusive AI system. Think about technology systems in the

past. They were all there but you needed significant digital literacy and knowledge to be able to use them with all due intentions. It was not very accessible. Today

the same systems when combined with AI supercharge inclusive access people. So systems get reconfigured for a question. Previously the interface was designing what kind of applications and workflows

were there. Think about an app. Any app workflow is decided by the developer and the person who making the offer. Today AI systems reconfigure itself for every question.

So million configurations possible with one interface. So this is a possibility and now what with language work that India is leading for last four five years one can

supercharge with the local tongue of the former. Recently in Maharashtra Bili is a language spoken in the northern belts of Maharashtra. It took four weeks maybe

five weeks to onboard the first data collection efforts to model building. Maharashtra will be launching it sometime here in one of the Maharashtra booths as well as in Maharashtra on 21st

bile persons speaking in Bili getting answers in BI on voice all in five weeks right this kind of possibility where systems come together in your local language is phenomenally supercharging

I'm very excited by that possibility &gt;&gt; uh JB since you know I've just been told we have less than 5 minutes but in a minute if you can just tell us that uh you know you took um the example example

for Maharashtra and I know that in terms of you know how things are getting implemented on open agriet and vistar uh you know how do you what's the difference between what's happening in

Maharashtra and what's happening in Ethopia &gt;&gt; wow so we kind of um and um Nidhi and her team in digital green has been part of Vistar for us three years maybe I

think so three years uh RKIN has been a very passionate supporter with open agreeet we kind of brought together all the building blocks necessary see Somebody I kind of took the I came here

because somebody guided me to come in certain ways quickly that means a path taken already. Open agreeate made it possible for somebody to create a path create a safe path responsible path and

others can follow. So Batwistar, Mahavistar, Amul and Ethiopia all are bringing their institutions together. Ethiopia in Amaric language, Maharin Marati language, Amul in Gujarati and

Bharatistrar is going to get launched tomorrow from Ajaur in Hindi and English and available as a network to all states. Bihar is actually parallely launching Bihar Krishi AI with Bharat

Vistar. So you see the possibility of how when you connect a DPI to AI, DPI can get interconnected and therefore data can flow on the same rails in a very interconnected manner. They're very

similar but different institutions coming together at a national level. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I think I think that's that's definitely a way forward for all countries. Um you know what what in the

last 45 minutes 50 minutes what what was basically um I think the word trust came up um again and again out here and uh you know it's it's it's about you can't create public value on its own. it is

about you know getting basically how AI can help you to build more trust uh and how the systems are more interoperable. So that's one of the key things that I you know took away from all of you and

also um the earlier conversation on how Sanjay was explaining things has to be horizontal right and then build up on that and then uh I think there has to be a little bit of uh you know um while

governments will build up the horizontal systems how private players can build up your uh vertical systems or your other solutions out there and uh also you know as as we are doing things at scale. Uh

none of these solutions really are effective unless they are done at scale. Um it doesn't need to be linear. Um basically you know good data uh standards and governance enable scale

while fragmented systems and weak processes create risk. So we have to make sure that there are the right kind of processes, the right kind of systems to ensure that there is of course the

earlier point of trust and uh good governance out there. It has to be built on good governance system. Governance doesn't need to be an afterthought out here. And uh just finally I think you

know while I've sorry uh finally uh you know u if I have to say that what are the key four points that we all discussed today or what our takeaway would be is um you know basically

start with public functions and not flashy use cases. um we have to identify registries, eligibility systems and advisory content that must work reliably before AI is introduced. So again

talking about the earlier point build the strong base before the AI system is introduced and I think that has been the success of some of the DPIs in India and um unbundle from delivery right so allow

multiple public and private actors to innovate on top of shared govern data instead of locking governments into end toend platforms uh so I think again it is a lot about the government basically

building a platform and then others building on top of that. I think that is the way the scale will also come in and um the earlier thing on benchmarking evaluations how that becomes extremely

important to make sure that there is evidence-based scale up and not just scale up generally for it and um and what I said earlier your governance sorry your governance cannot be an

afterthought right it has to be a part of your uh design principle it has to be a part of how you plan in terms of building in your DPIs and your infrastructure and uh with that I think

uh yes thank you to all of you um and um last but not the least what I said earlier uh ensuring that whatever you build is an inclusive AI right we have to make make sure that it's built on

good governance data trust and inclusive thank you everyone thank you for being here and thank you JB for finally making it uh and Thank you. &gt;&gt; I don't think we have time for

questions. Sorry. Yeah. &gt;&gt; No, we've been told that uh our time is up. Sorry about that. Yeah. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Okay. Lovely. I'm sure you can catch hold of one of

them later on and ask them the question. Yeah. Thank you. &gt;&gt; You made it. A lot of flowers. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much all of you for

putting up with my delay. &gt;&gt; I know I passed the exam. &gt;&gt; You You have to thank them. They answered your questions. All of them are super.

&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. They answer your question. You know when I realized the question was only 20 minutes up. I said now now I have to ask
