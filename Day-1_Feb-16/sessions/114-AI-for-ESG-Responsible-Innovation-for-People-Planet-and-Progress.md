## 📝 Summary

AI's growing role in economies and institutions makes its alignment with ESG priorities critical. While AI can strengthen climate monitoring, risk management, governance, transparency, and accountability, poorly governed use may amplify bias, inequality, and mistrust. This panel frames AI as a leadership and governance challenge, not just a technology, examining responsible, ethical, and policy-aligned deployment. It explores how AI can deliver inclusive, transparent, measurable ESG outcomes, especially for emerging economies and the Global South contexts.
