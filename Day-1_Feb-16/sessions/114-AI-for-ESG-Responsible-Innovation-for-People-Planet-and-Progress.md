## 📝 Summary

AI's growing role in economies and institutions makes its alignment with ESG priorities critical. While AI can strengthen climate monitoring, risk management, governance, transparency, and accountability, poorly governed use may amplify bias, inequality, and mistrust. This panel frames AI as a leadership and governance challenge, not just a technology, examining responsible, ethical, and policy-aligned deployment. It explores how AI can deliver inclusive, transparent, measurable ESG outcomes, especially for emerging economies and the Global South contexts.

## 📝 Transcript

I got you. You are a moderate. Justice. &gt;&gt; Why are you You have so many friends.

Hello. Hi. Can we please close the gate? &gt;&gt; There's a lot lot of noise coming in. &gt;&gt; So, good evening everyone. Uh, thank you very much for being here and uh I'm not

a lastm minute add-on. I have a moderator of this session. So, somehow my chair and my the name tag is missed. So, so I'm just like giving you a disclaimer that I'm not a add-on last

week on. So, uh, &gt;&gt; yeah, that's why it's bit different, [laughter] but thank you everyone for being here. Uh, it's it's a obviously very

interesting and overwhelming uh I would say event right now and we are here for our session. So, thank you very much. Thanks to India AI uh India mission for extending all the support. My name is

Dr. Maharaj Bharatwaj. I am a founding faculty member and head of ESG carbon markets and sustainability and also head of executive education at Diabani University School of Local.

We have a very interesting panel and we have a topic which is very close to the heart of people sitting here. Uh we have our friends from Israel. Uh thanks to the embassy of Israel in India for

bringing in the experts from from directly from Israel. We have uh Miss Sarit Felber with us who is the senior director office of legal council and legislative affairs ministry of

business. Welcome. We have professor Victor with us who is the director of AI center volcani institute government of Israel. Welcome professor Victor. We have miss Aisha pot managing partner

horizon and head of AI policy summit at ETR. Welcome Aisha. We have with us my good friend Maya Sharma uh who is a innovation and and I think almost everyone knows when it comes to AI in

India that Maya is the face of AI and she she's everywhere. So my we have a like we are very happy to have you here. It's a pleasure to have you here. We have with us uh our our mentor and guide

professor Dr. Ran Dadich who is the founding director of school of lammani university Gandhi. We have with us uh my uh colleague uh professor uh Dr. Vinnie Singh who is the head of AI uh tech tech

vertical at our law school. So we have a very comprehensive panel and I think we'll bring in more and more perspectives on how AI and EG u together. Usually I don't prepare notes

but since it's a very formal setting and we are representing India so I have prepared my notes for this particular session. &gt;&gt; So um how many of you have heard about

ESG? just want to understand. &gt;&gt; Great. Great. We have a very relevant audience. So I think uh when we talk about AI for ESG, the conversation often becomes abstract. Ethics, governance,

frameworks and global principles. But in practice AI for ESG is about three very concrete things. And in the morning I was on a panel of carbon markets. I'm sure a lot of you have heard about

carbon markets. So there also AI is very relevant when it comes to measurement, management and market credibility. So we talk about first measurement. Most ESG challenges begin with poor or

inconsistent data and we fall into the trap like face the brunt of greenwashing. So the inconsistent data is a problem. Then AI today is uh already being deployed to track supply

chain emission in real time, detect greenwashing through data pattern analysis, monitor deforestation and biodiversity loss and automate ESG reporting. A lot of us know about this

that this is happening but is it actually happening and where the AI and ESG governance intersects and where the regulators are using AI in a way to obviously see ESG reporting whether it's

happening properly whether the third party uh verifiers have done uh the reporting or verifying properly. So I think AI is the tool that can help uh ease ESG automation, ease the uh ESG

reporting and also make it easy for everyone uh for the investors, for the regulators and for the other stakeholders. So uh second is management and risk forecasting because AI allows

uh firms to model climate transition risk, stress test carbon exposure under different regular scenarios, predict ESG link credit risk and third is market

&gt;&gt; technology is really failing me today. So uh and third is actually credibility. So if your ESG reporting is credible or not, I think AI can obviously help you with that and u AI will obviously

enhance audit integrity verification process of realtime compliance monitoring. So that that was actually the concept of bringing in this panel and uh we have joined by again experts

in in these fields some people from AI, someone from ESG. uh so also uh the real question comes when it comes to this panel is not how can AI support ESG it is also how do we ensure AI itself align

with ESG principles. I was talking one of the uh senior delegates from the Israel embassy that one of the biggest polits uh like when we talk about going net

zero and we talk about AI to be a tool of helping us out. AI is itself is one of the biggest polit data centers. We use technology. So not not a lot of people focus on data centers because we

just see it in a very abstract form that yes technology is there but like you have cables in uh uh under the ground you have cables in the oceans and and then data centers taking uh the entire

uh uh I would say filling the carbon space. So uh if I think if we get this balanced right AI for ESG and ESG for AI uh AI will not just optimize sustainability reporting but it will

fundamentally reshape how sustainability is priced regulated and financed and there uh that's why we are here uh for this discussion which truly makes it important. So uh as we are time

sensitive I have again few questions to ask to the panelists but let me give uh four to five minutes uh to our every panelist to give their opening remarks and building on to that uh I'll ask you

a few questions and then we'll open the ramen for the panel for Q&amp;A. So uh Aisha would you like to go ahead first your opening. &gt;&gt; Thank you. It's thank you very much and

I think it's a great pleasure. So very very nice to be here. It's fascinating. The energy is fantastic. Um so I'll actually talk about something which is a bit more macro which is quite nice

because I think that that will help us then to dig deeper into the ESG. So my expertise really lies with uh policy frameworks AI and regulation as you say but also policy in general and I thought

to kick off the discussion of course which is uh you know about achieving responsible innovation for people projects as well as of course progress for the planet. um we have to explore

what is the role of policy right and here I think we first have to remember what is the real goal uh that we are trying to achieve when we looking at policy in terms of innovation and first

and foremost it's about mitigating risks and why do we want to mitigate risks because we want to build some trust and if we build the trust we'll have the adoption so that's the very first thing

the second role that policy frameworks and regulation has to really really do and I think more so now is to ensure that we have fairness and equity equity in terms of the gains that come from

these technologies and how exactly are they then distributed for all and I think this summit very much is about that as well and the third one and very important one I think is also about

creating an environment and more so the role of policy not just to mitigate the risks but create an environment that is supporting local innovation. So these are the three goals. Now the point is

that when we look at that um one of the key challenges we face today is how do we do that? There's a huge question with regards to how what kind of policy frameworks can we have that support

innovation and of course then how do we interact with each other in different you know geographies and here again going before we go into the answers which I'm sure my colleagues will also

talk about some of the challenges I thought would be interesting to share here as well and the very first one of course I think it's philosophical where people think well regulation doesn't

really align with innovation there is a there's a mismatch And so is that true? Is it not true? We will discuss that later. But what is most important is we need to still balance that in some way.

The second one which I think is extremely important then is to understand that when we look at regulations, when you look at policy across the globe, we all have different

values, we have different objectives, we have different cultures. And what does that really mean is that you have different focus with the harsh English. So let's take an example. If you look at

today the EU um you know EU really has a focus which is extremely regulatory focused when it comes to innovation let's have regulation happens you know trust and innovation and they're

focusing on human rights when you look at United States it's very marketled innovation very private sector driven innovation and the focus is on national security when you look at China it's

very stateled and it's very much focusing on you know control And then of course India you're very much looking at inclusion and infrastructure as an as as as one of the drivers. So again we see

these different focus and then when you look at equality because how do we actually combine them and I think I will not take so much time but one last thing I did want to say here was which is

important is um I will you know when you come to the the the the innovation versus regulation and and how do we actually balance that I would just quickly like to say coming from

Switzerland we are of course a very innovation friendly country as well the way we look at this thing is to say we really need to move is a very flexible framework. It's not going to be top

down. It is going to be really uh something where we say let's look at the laws we already have. Let's not make any new laws. You know, let us look at for example um coming up with with test more

testing, more red teaming, more regulatory frameworks. And the last thing that is extremely important is to use AI and I think that's what you're talking about as a tool to help us

regulate to help us to actually come with some of the answers and use our infrastructure that we have also in Switzerland to the to the best in order to help us to achieve some of the goals

that we have and and one more last last comment which is linking to the ESG today in the policy world there is a huge question mark around you know we need more data centers we're going to

have but there's It's using a lot of energy. It's using a lot of water and there's a lot of questions now around how do we even look at that question. So saying that I'll stop it here and I'm

sure I mean other people will have things to say and then looking forward to continue the conversation. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much for the opening remarks and thank you very much for the

time. May I now invite S to share opening remarks and and you come from the law of justice. So how do you look from a I would say from a from a government perspective that how I would

say climate compliance or social or like overall comp. &gt;&gt; So first of all thank you foring us this important panel with this distinguished guest and thank you all for being here.

I really appreciate it. And first I want to say that I um I don't need to speak much because Aisha said a lot of things that uh I agree with. I think I think there's a great question with every

technological innovation that came into the world in the last 50 years. It it comes with a set of philosophical and practical questions. The internet changed a lot about the way how we

communicate, how we consume um um transportation before that impacted the environment and so on. Um I don't think AI resembled uh this uh this technological re revolutions but it's

not something new that technology entered and we have to think of how it changes it. Does it change the laws and at the end of the day I think there's a question for uh I'm I'm a governmental

lawyer not a policy maker but policy maker will have to decide how do they balance different values there's in as as said there's innovation and people think that regulation um perhaps cycle

innovation but regulation also prevent risks so you have to manage these risks and you have to decide where the right point is it's not necessarily a legal question it's a question of of values

and priority and AI will come and uh will impact the environment and it will impact um human rights and we all have to decide and and policy maker will have to decide where are the drawing the line

the work of a lawyer is very much to balance between different interests different rights and I think AI will demand of us to do that do so I don't think that in the very near future but

definitely in the uh in a year or two um Uh there's a big question of when when do we import the European did it quite uh quite fast you can say

and and time will say whether they they uh it was right and and they focused on on a specific specific thing they wanted to make sure that these products or services uh made by influenced by I are

safe and trustworthy which are noble causes and and but they're also the question of environment and the question of the impact of the labor market and I think these are more these are uh as

important questions and urgent questions that we will have to address now the Israeli government is very much uh some of you am I on &gt;&gt; okay [laughter]

yeah I just I I would say that I think there are similarities between we're much much smaller country than India but there are similarities in in terms of the

importance that we give to innovation for for our economy for our economy. And so the question of regulating technology is a question of not just um a theoretical or philosophical one for us.

It's about um jobs. It's about the safety of our country and our ability to uh sustain our economy. So uh that's in in a nutshell. I hope the question Thank you. Thank you for your opening

remarks and sharing your perspective. Now let me bring in professor Victor coming from uh volcanic [clears throat] more broadly into the sustainability ecosystem framework. So

what what what are your opening remarks on on this issue? &gt;&gt; Thank you very much. Um [clears throat] I would like to bring a totally different perspective of what we've

heard here until now. Uh we heard about the macro and I'm going into the micro. I'm coming from agricultural research. I'm a scientist. I'm researcher. I'm not a lawyer. I'm not a policy maker. I'm

not &gt;&gt; I don't know. &gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; and &gt;&gt; and I'm looking at the

ECG. It's a like a um an abbreviation here, but uh it's environmental sustainability. Uh do we know what is environmental sustainability? Uh do we know from the agricultural

point of view? Of course, I'm looking at the agriculture. There are a lot of people who say that agriculture is the the most polluting um discipline in the planet and because

of the pollution that agriculture brings then we have this uh non sustainable way of having our our planet. So um when we are we want to bring sustainability into agriculture in and environmental

sustainability usually what we have in mind and what we see in our vision is uh people who do not really overfertilize because that it pollutes the groundwater.

Do not spray chemicals fertilizers. Do not spray herbicides and pesticides because they pollute And u the first and the direct result of that is that the yield reduces by 20 to

70%. And then from the other side we have the food safety. We have to keep the planet safe in terms of food to supply food to the population which gets larger and

larger. So sustainability in the conventional way of agriculture of not applying too much, not spraying, not polluting and on the other hand keeping the food safety aspect in mind is not

vital, does not work. So do they contradict those two? Do we really have to uh risk this the food safety of the planet if we want to have an environmental sustainability in

agriculture? And of course, I wouldn't sit here if the answer was yes. The answer is no. We do not have to compromise because there are tools that we can use in order to

overcome uh this uh conventional sustainability approach and use what else? AI tools in order to do the things in a better way and uh I'm not going here to talk about all the tools that

they are present and that we can use in order to improve sustainability but just uh as an example um the vision and the motivation and the definition of modern agricultural practices like digital

agriculture, precision agriculture. The first thing that they they define is to have a sustainable management strategy and the sustainability is built within those high technology management

strategies that they are used in order to uh uh com to to get to the food safety to all the planet. So we can use AI tools from the sensing to find what we have to do and not do things that

they are average and and not applicable to the whole fields. We can use AI tools detect diseases early detection of diseases. We can use AI tools in order to detect what is the soil, what are the

soil properties, what are the things that they exist and those are tools that they're not similar to the LLMs that we use every day in our forms. Those are genai and other um AI tools that they

are more advanced or different type of tools. The second type is the type of advice to uh to farmers. Can we give advice to farmers according to what we know with

AI systems? And here again uh in order to be sustainable, we have to be robust. We have to be general and uh there are no such really systems in agriculture today. Not because the algorithms of AI

cannot do that but we cannot train our systems in a sustainable and and real way today. So we have a lack of data that we need to acquire and to train those systems. So sustainability and

environmental stability can be achieved in agriculture with the AI tools that we know that exist but we have to improve them. You have to develop them and it takes much more time than any other

discipline but it's possible and this is the promise for the food security in the future. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much. food security

I think she's I can relate food security and also the head will take a lot of time for me to relate that but thank you very much that how AI can also help ensure food security and

uh overall uh like I would say uh take the they take the sustainability agenda forward as Maya has to leave for a second panel and sometime so Maya Why don't you go ahead and share your

remarks? &gt;&gt; Surely first of all uh on behalf of the embassy it's wonderful to partner with Durban University. Thank you for all the work you've been doing for the

ecosystem. Also grateful to be here with the wonderful analyst. Um I think that in many ways um ESG and AI have brought something quite similar which is the fact that we are trying to do some

interdicciplinary work across domain that we want to fulfill some promises. Think on what ASG kind of made in the end. It brought people who are trying to deal with environment, social aspects,

ethics and governance into one table to be able to hold to this promise. AI is almost in a similar vertical. We are now trying to use AI in so many domains because we are trying to find the way in

which we're connecting teams. I mean I think for instance on this panel alone you have wonderful practitioners from the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Agriculture and there is something in

common and it's the fact that we're trying to use innovation in data in a way that we're able to fulfill certain standards. Now EG came out of a certain void when you're thinking of it. Um it

came out of a void that we needed to have a certain gender parameter. We wanted to have 50/50 in the workforce. uh when we wanted to have much better monitoring of of climate production,

protecting the environment, the thing is we needed to make it enforcable. We needed to have some guidelines and something magical for people to come and say we need these parameters to have a

better environment metrics um and metrics are wonderful because they help us do things. Now the beauty is that AI is a wonderful tool first of all because it does something quite similarly we're

speaking on AI in health AI in law and in climate in ESG in many ways AI complements quite perfectly we're able to monitor better we're able to keep this kind of track

over parameters across disciplines there are problems with AI in plenty this is a whole different topic for discussions we don't need to go into this but the beauty is whether is thinking on AI and

transparency and governance. AI in agriculture AI is a wonderful addition um to making sure that we're able to keep our ESG agenda in a way and I think that the

beauty today is that both revolutions ESG and AI are complemented because we are trying to bring different disciplines different theories into one and more importantly we're trying to

bring some measures something concrete that we can rely on today we want to have 50/50 recruit in terms of gender, ethnicity and what's not. We want to have better monitoring of crops. AI is a

great example for this. I can give you plenty of examples for AI startups in the ag space um that enable us especially in Israel enable us to do this better monitoring of the crops.

Cropics is a wonderful example. One of our strongest startups in the ag domain and indeed there are many as well. I think that's the beauty. AI and ESG help us turn some of this broader vision that

we have for society into some measurable and concrete um deliverables that we're looking into the future. That's something that I feel also both countries are sharing in terms of the

future the vision ahead so that it won't remain just a vision going forward for a better society. &gt;&gt; Thank you Maya. It's always enriching uh hearing your experiences and and how you

connected both AI and ESG. Uh may I now uh request Dr. Professor Dr. Sadish to share his remarks on this. Oh nowadays I'm quite confused person

&gt;&gt; when I start talking about AI in 2016 and how it's relation with the law. Many of my friends laughed at me. They say what is AI law? Because first of all nobody knew about EA in 2016 17 in India

most of the people in the legal sector and especially if no absence of the law what is the EI law gradually I started learning more and it gives me more confusion and nowadays not only I'm

confused I am little bit angry also angry because lot of things are happening at the global level and when you read about AI you always get two perspectives.

One is very extreme positive, the other one is extreme negative and as a human being we always like to try some balance and when you are not able to find out that balance it makes

you little bit confused and that confusion brings little bit anger. So to counter that these two emotions I started reading history and a little bit philosophy also. So this ESG

environment, social and governance. So environment means nature, water, river, mountains, trees, air, soil. That's environment. So we didn't create environment. Environment was created by

whom? That's not our concept. But someone else created it. And that environment created people, society. the people you and me that's a society and this society of the

people humans we can say we created G part the governance part we created corporations artificial organization so this is not the first time that we are creating something artificial we have

already created something called corporation which is very much artificial in nature but has legal rights and duties and enjoying a lot of power also

and under the G part we created lot of liberal ideas like equity gender you know all the liberal ideas we created in last 300 400 years. So this ESG is very much in our DNA in our society but the

first time now the humans and corporates one uh human intelligence and the corporate I can say it's not human intelligence it's a corporate intelligence it's a non-human

intelligence which is not having that human empathy or emotions as a corporate if you see the structure of the corporate they are not supposed to have empathy or emotions the purpose of

corporation ation by and large is to make profit. &gt;&gt; That's why we created artificial organizations called corporations. But now these two people people and

non-people called corporations are creating the third artificial entity that is the intelligence and now how to deal with AI how it's going to impact ESG

ESG means environment definitely it's a very big concern because every time when we ask we interact with JPT it consumes energy maybe we don't see heat it here. It's

not your energy in your electricity. It's energy somewhere in the data center. A data center is consuming water. Okay? So every time when we do something

with AI, it's making some impact on environment. Every time when we develop or deploy an artificial technology, it makes positive and negative impact on us that society

on the people. in their body and mind and soul. It's making some impact. And finally, the third part is corporations. Corporations are also highly impacted by

AI. You can see today's 100,000 people are here. Why do you think that they are all keen to learn about AI? 80% of them they are here to understand that what they can

take something from AI how they can make more money how they can make more efficiency in their business so AI is a tool where corporates are seen as a opportunity to make money I was talking

with my friend Aisha it's like a old days you know gold rush in California that everybody was looking for gold so this AI somewhere is like an AI gold you know that let's go and understand AI I

how to make more money out of AI, how to make more efficiency in AI. So I think with these words I will stop but Mr. I confused I thank you so much for having us

to get to hear the insight of these people but thank you. [applause] Uh thank you thank you master uh for

giving us that historical perspective and how AI and ESG inter something like that because it's it's both both are like the complementing or like intersecting at one point with each

other. Uh so now I move to my colleague Dr. Venice Singh and uh she's heading our AI tech and cyber security data anything tech she's heading at the law school. uh she has been working with uh

big big corporations training them uh in our executive education programs. One of our executive education student is here. Some of our LLM students are here. So I would like to hear it from Dr. Vini

Singh. Uh and what are what are thinking about about this? &gt;&gt; Uh thank you so much Dr. Manush. Uh probably what I am going to say is going to be a repetition of lot of what the

panelists already said. uh but then uh maybe I am able to offer something new. So uh both ESG and AI governance sort of run parallelly. There are many ways by which they intersect. Uh data protection

being one of them. Uh we have human rights being one of them. Then human centered technology also uh is something where both of these areas intersect. Um on another aspect people have been using

AI tools for their ESG reporting. uh we have multiple tools now on the market that can do end to end uh data collection and reporting uh maybe some of them by IBM Microsoft

and uh these tools are wonderful but at the same time uh there is a negative impact also like uh we we've looked a lot at the positive side of things like &gt;&gt; uh agriculture uh the benefits of uh

technology and agriculture or the benefits of technology in waste management even in labor management I would say uh yes uh

can be very beneficial &gt;&gt; uh but there's a negative side also because when you're collecting data from so many sources across the supply chain then there is uh then the data is very

captured and there's likelihood that the ESG report that we are receiving at the end as the end product uh is not necessarily showing us the correct picture. And that brings us to the idea

that how can we ensure that we can trust this ESG report and the principles of uh AI governance will come back to them again. Uh so responsible AI or trustworthy AI uh comes back into

picture again. So as Mah sir just said I mean it's it's like a cycle ESG AI for ESG and again for AI governance again u so these are you know uh some of those aspects um also I'd like to add that uh

when we are looking at u AI governance as a whole uh multiple aspects of AI governance are anyway part of the governance aspect in uh ESG G and the same set of uh principles apply in both

these domains. So that is obviously an overlap. Um and uh with that I would like to end my comments. Uh thank you so much for listening patiently. &gt;&gt; Sure. Thank you Dr. Vinnie. uh while

when I was listening to all the esteemed panelists I was also thinking that uh if we think about AI for ag we can we can fragment it into three uh sectors or like I would give three divisions so

first AI can be used for things that we have to do to meet our EG agenda right so it's not just the reporting but for example if some of you might have of like removing the or combating or

reducing the emissions like scope one scope scope two and scope three now number we are talking about so AI can also help you in doing that right uh just before the reporting uh you want to

uh create metrics of uh your organization being socially responsible you can use AI for that uh you can obviously do a lot of compliance of uh laws labor laws and and and various

social protection laws through uh AI so uh before you get into reporting uh for ESG I think uh what you have to do under your ESG agenda and uh I think ESG framework that is

given by uh in India by semi and other regulators in in foreign countries. So that's one phase one uh I would say division. Secondly, it it obviously everyone knows that AI is being uh used

for ESG reporting. Now whether it's a greenwashing uh or or real actual reporting that's a different thing and that brings us to the third part which is the uh monitoring. Uh now combinely

in in uh basically I would say environmental ecosystem we call it MRB monitoring, reporting and verification. So in third party AI can also help you to verify the reports. For example,

regulators can use AI models to use these uh or verify these third party reports that third party verifiers are doing for various organizations. So I think three categorizations are there

when we look for uh AI for ESG in in three different ways. So just wanted to add that but again coming back to questions to the panelists. I would like to again go back to Aisha and ask Aisha

like how do we see that we are doing innovation when it comes to AI and we are using innovation for like AF for ESG. How can we prevent like any uh policy or governance fragmentation when

it comes to this because this these are both I would say volatile things and both are regulated highly going to be highly regulated and ESG being a very uh big buzz word I think we need to use AI

in a very responsible manner. So how do you think like uh to prevent uh governance fragmentation when it comes to AI? &gt;&gt; Thank you Anita. That's such a valid

question because of course I talked about the fact that you have all of these different you know um geopolitical approaches but then of course as as humankind we need to think and have some

sort of red line some sort of you know agreement where we go forward. I think the operator word there is international standards right I mean I think more and more and I know that it's happening also

for ESG specific uh standards but for policy in general I think uh the this is really where the discussions are now and you know one of the things this is we're talking about at the ISO at the sen

in United States and there's more of a move towards um sort of sociotechnical standards this is a new buzz word that's coming I mean again there the sociopath is also the planet and these kind of

things taking account. So I think what we need we are seeing more and more is that people are coming to a realization we're not going to really have the same loan around the world right that's not

going to happen but we can somehow get you know and these technical solutions as well as you know are use case specific so it's not going to be a general across the blanket you know this

is how we are going to look at it but depending on the use case depending on the topic there are standards that are currently being uh you know worked on and I know that for energy for reporting

for ESG It's a lot of work that is being done even in the ISO in fact. Um and then the idea is for these standard organizations to talk to each other as well and and again there was a question

I was in most recently and there was big concern to say with the neutral and geopolitical general sentiment are these standard organizations for example sense are they coming to NIST or not because I

mean even if that's not happening then we're in trouble but actually it was very very good to see that there is a positive momentum there despite what is happening because these are technical

experts and they can talk to each other and they are trying to move forward So I think that would be maybe the way forward uh that we can approach this this topic and I think work is being

done and so and the last thing I would say apart from standards is actually technical solutions. technical solutions would be the ones also where you use AI and you use the technical expertise and

that is something which is not necessarily having the geographical sort of geopolitical sort of sensitivities and I do believe that even industry now is coming with many many of those

solutions and those if they share that's the issue uh it could be something could be a way forward also to help us to steer this whole thing together into the right way that we would like to

Why don't you come to you and ask like you are from the ministry right? &gt;&gt; Yeah we'll have we have some more time for that also. So uh you've been working with the ministry of justice you're also

the head of technology and law division. So how do you see like any best practices or anything that you're doing would also be beneficial for a country like India? any regulatory approaches

towards these emerging markets or to these I [snorts] would say reporting framework especially like &gt;&gt; um so um I I again I agree with Alicia that

there's a nice article that I like that the title is the race for AI regulation right like there's the race for AI uh to get uh the GPUs and and and the talent and everything and I think that

governments around the world has realized that in order to win the race regulation um is is key and I think that's why we won't see international AI law.

&gt;&gt; Now a country like Israel we have uh approximately 10 million people living in Israel. We're not &gt;&gt; uh but comparing to Delhi we're a tiny market. uh there is no if we'll do our

own regulation a specific regulation the people in Israel will probably be divi avoided from uh AI products or AI services because no one will no one will adjust their products and services to a

specific unique Israeli regulation. So um and that's and that's something that we have to think about when we think about our approach. We have to think about that and we have to think that

we're a country without almost we don't have any natural resources. What we have is mainly our tech sector. That's one of our cultural cost and not um so when Israel develops its uh it its

regulatory approach we have to take this into account. That's why I said we have to balance between different purposes values and everything. So what what we've done in Israel for now is we

decided that our approach to AI regulation will be sector specific. We're not going to think about it as an horizontal technology that we have to regulate. Um and also I I have to say

that for years you you spoke about history legislation tried to be u technological neutral right we didn't do an in most countries didn't do an internet law right we we thought about

the impacts of the internet and try to uh deal deal with them &gt;&gt; so when we think about sector sector specific regulations is um for example I I worked a lot on financial regulations

We looked at the financial regulation and we thought that is the current regulatory framework can deal with the challenges of AI, the risk of AI but at the same time is it a barrier to adopt

AI because AI can contribute uh to the finance. So what we what we're thinking now is that every and and it's also um I think it comes up in the the working group of the summit every regulator in

Israel uh the instruction is to make sure that your regulation can answer the risks of AI and the risk and there's different risk right if you're in in finance you can speak about social

exclusion of people from the credit like not receiving credit uh energy envirment environment has to have to think about the impact of uh data centers um on the environment on uh our um energetic

sustainability in Israel and to talk with other regulators on how to preserve that. So our approach at the moment is sector specific and to use as much as we can current law. Uh the EU for example I

I maybe I'll go on to later but that's that that's our approach and what we do in terms of best practices. We try to do a couple of things. First of all, we try we encourage sandboxing and

experimentation. I think that's first it's an advantage of Israel. We have an ecosystem and and we can can do sandbox experience but that's also give me as a lawyer or the regulator some sense of

the technology other than other otherwise we we don't know we can assume only the worst or the best as you say about the result of the technology but once you do once you see it once you see

it in like real uh life setting you can um appreciate more what your so experimentation and sandboxing that's that's one thing um We in Israel we one of the leaders of the AI revolution is

actually the government. The government adopts AI in its services in its internal work and I think that's leading by example and also the government because we're a government we have more

duties than the private company right uh in terms of administrative law and constitutional law. So when we do that and we take upon ourel higher standards, we hope that that will lead the market.

It will give good also good case studies to the market. So that's that's in a nutshell. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much Sith. I think uh that's also same with India. India is

leading by example. So I'll see the posity of time. I'll take one more uh like one more question to uh professor Victor. Uh I I just want to understand like you work with AIdriven science in

the agriculture sector. How do you think like AIdriven these I would say science can easily be converted into policy outcomes or or easily maybe I mean you can also share your

views on that but how the aiddriven science can be transformed into easy ESG policy outcomes when we see especially the the agriculture sector &gt;&gt; yeah when you're talking about policies

&gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; and uh I think in agriculture We are quite far from that. We're not there yet because in agriculture we are still struggling to adapt the appropriate EI

tools and appropriate EI procedures to agriculture. Um there are many barriers there in agriculture. The legal barrier is one of them. One of the main barriers is the

data sharing. In order to do and produce AI systems and they have some milling, you have to train them in in data. In agriculture is very difficult to share data. Tell take two Indian farmers and

tell them okay I'll give your data to your neighbor and you give your data to your neighbor. Will they share it? Probably not immediately. that if you convince them that if everybody does it

then you'll have a system that have some more insights that can help all of you and the environment and the sustainability and have food security in the future then this might work. So

maybe the policies would be in how to share the data and make the IP the intellectual property of data more basic and and everybody will will accept it. Sure. The reason I ask you because

uh we talking like I was in a conference again and talking about a lot of farmers those who will be involved in like uh obviously for the for the emission reduction their their uh skills will be

used like for developing carbon markets. So I think that's one of the hiccups that we have that to bring in agriculture to bring in that sector uh as a part of the entire sustainability

agenda it it's still struggling especially the technology and AI a lot of sensitization is very important so with that uh thank you very much fellow panelists uh for for your insights and

uh answering the questions we have uh some time so we can take a few questions if you want please u briefly introduce yourself and and brief questions

Thank you. Thank you to uh for giving me the insights for AI in the in this AI impact summit.

&gt;&gt; Okay. My name is I'm from working as a consultant in MS. Now I have one question.

We have a AI impact summit and whenever I see AI is what is meant by AI is And we are seeing AI as an artificial intelligence. So as said that we are

confused. So let me please give me some. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. word inclusivity that's what you &gt;&gt; how I can be more inclusive inclusive

&gt;&gt; alreadyclusive &gt;&gt; it's impacting everyone &gt;&gt; so what I mean are we focusing small part of this we are taking only

techology part &gt;&gt; or we are trying to make more better for our global &gt;&gt; so sir uh please please uh I'll tell you so

when we we say about all inclusive uh our honorable prime minister is obviously very well known for giving fantastic acronyms and talking about public welfare so when he talks about AI

AI for the improvement of betterment of living for everyone in this country for overtly alleviation for infrastructural growth for economic growth for industrial growth. So by AI obviously AI

means artificial intelligence but when he says about all inclusive he means like every sector included in every class that's why &gt;&gt; and one thing I think I was talking with

Aisha Aisha attended EI summit in London and Paris both and she was appreciating the fact that this is the only EI summit where the common man is being invited. Okay. London and Paris those EA summits

were very exclusive I can say. Yeah. Very elite very high class people were only allowed to attend. I think this is the initiative of India. I think it's a great signal. Maybe little bit

chaos because of that. But that's okay. That's also Indian experience you know because chaos and order it works together in India. So more than 100,000 people are attending this summit and I

believe that the AI is just like a very interesting I think uh okay this very just take a minute in 3rd century BC there was a very good poem written in Sanskrit about elephant in the dark room

and then also wrote the same poem in 13th century so AI is just like an elephant in the dark room everybody's trying to understand I think all these 100,000 people will be learning

something about AI and they will develop some common understanding. Okay. What is AI for me? Okay. What is AI for a tech person for a business guy, for policy people, for an agriculture, for any

spiritual leader? Because the previous session was about the spirituality. So I believe that this EI is for all and EI is for inclusivity. So I think I I I think Modi has done good job

especially in this draft. Yeah. ES But lately, And my question

is where it needs to be the integration of sustainability rights and technology and more in the context of agree also

that you know it takes massive costs. I'm a big fan of it. How do we ensure like carbon credit to ensure farmers get incentivized in you know AI technology?

So where do you think all this come together? You being jurisdiction of the world. No it's a fantastic question and I think that that this is really going to geopolitics of all. I

mean I think the kind of elephant in the room we all know as well right I mean we are at at a very crucial time right now where where there are certain players in this world who are going another way and

somehow I think we we are at a a place where we need to decide what we have to do about it. I think one of the things you know as you probably understand as well the United States is also pushing

for is to having more data centers more development of AI outside of which will be in maybe in Africa maybe and of course that is going to have an impact &gt;&gt; with regards to the resource constraints

you're talking about in places where we today actually don't even have access to water and we are like trying to solve those issues. So I think um in United States we have seen already a backlash

on that. We have been having you know states that are saying please hold on because our electricity costs our water bills are going off the roof and we don't want to have more data centers

here and we don't we need to stop there. I think it starts with awareness and then again you know um we need to all be aware of this impact. We need to raise awareness of the common and I think here

it's not just about the common man but about the politicians about the government officials who are the ones ultimately who will be letting all of that in and again it's going to be at

every single local level a question of tradeoff so there is going to be a trade-off because on the one hand I would say that in agriculture is probably one of the places where we have

the most impact that you know and health is another one where most impact for AI but then how we go about it and what is the pace of that that deployment ment is what is going to be very very important

because we do need to think about our planet and the people that live in there and maybe just this fast moving thing and you know short-term gains is not in the best interest so I think it starts

with awareness and then it starts with putting some breaks and sort of reflecting do you do that through policy or do you do that just by awareness building of the common citizens and I

think places like this where we can openly discuss it and you know I'm in Switzerland where it's very neutral environment to bring out and actually build bridges with even those maybe who

are not necessarily thinking the same way with us and I think it's in each of our interests to do that and we are all should be empowered to have those discussions and I'm really personally

very very passionate about that um to play a role there so that's what I'd say &gt;&gt; very quickly to what uh Mong asked like uh I'll be talking about technology development uh this thing and that thing

there are a few concepts as lawyers because we are lawyers we should think about Because when this debate goes geopolitical and I come from a intergovernmental multilateral

background uh always the Indian inside me jumps up with the with the concept with the principle of right to development climate justice common but differentiated responsibilities and

respective capab we'll catch up with you thank you so much thank you so uh we we need to also think about these

and when we are like into debate ates into conversation with our counterparts abroad when we are building a project for example we work with VA like the university so the world's biggest carbon

developer and India like world second India's first one we talk a lot with them like how we are going to increase the income of small holder farmers we have partnered with the government of

Assam now we are looking at a model where the Assam tea farmers will be utilized how we can increase their income through carbon market so internally we have to think about that

but when it comes to external debates Okay, we we I mean as a lawyer I think our duty is to like obviously bring on these concepts because these are very important. We are a country which is

just 70 years old in terms of country country &gt;&gt; I'll tell you an interesting point on that we just just so my de you need to understand that We

are in we are already in a different world. Okay. So the easiest solution is the community engagement. If you believe that we need to raise some voice, we need to go back to the people somehow

somehow. No my dear you need to understand. No, no, not absolutely comp. I am saying when we made reporting requirement mandatory now the protocols

environment 199 we made international labor organizing it nowhere &gt;&gt; no no that's good but yeah no absolutely

no absolutely But the point is the politician at the top level they are seeing this thing in a very different manner. talking global I'm part of bricks

&gt;&gt; no global global also the same situation right now &gt;&gt; council of bricks I'm part of we talking at global I'm not even talking about Indian regulations I'm talking global

where no are relevant with technology no laws across the globe apply all I'm saying is that it needs to be there &gt;&gt; I'm noting EU or India I am saying at the global data

I mean are we saying that I mean I don't know I think you are the president. &gt;&gt; No no no that's not a we are [clears throat] agreeing with you. &gt;&gt; No sometime it happens with lawyers when

someone says I agree with you and still you are not understanding but we are completely agreement with you that we need global standards. We need global standards because these technologies are

beyond boundaries. You know what is happening in one country is definitely impacting everyone. Otherwise there will be confusion and &gt;&gt; we need to be able to resolve this.

No, no, absolutely. Yeah. &gt;&gt; I'm not a lawyer, but I'm advising what are the expectations of the farmers that are coming up in how are we

Yeah, I I I I absolutely and I think this is great. What you're saying is very much what I was trying to say as well. I think whilst we will not see just to answer

the global thing, right? I mean, I think whilst I don't think we're going to see something at a very global level like alignment again because of what I said the geopolitics however more and more

we're seeing sort of region specific approaches coming right for policy. So certain countries getting together and saying look you know what this is how we believe this is how we're going to

approach it we're seeing it in Asia we're seeing it in Africa we're probably going to see it you know you're working about bricks or some others and I think this is the way to move forward and I

think in order to do that it's about just finding another country which thinks like you or two or three or four getting together and we had this discussion recently and that's the way

to go and it's the how did we say the the the the alignment of the few or you know the the what is the name that even President Mron came with in another contest in security but it's about uh

you know the the coalition of the few of the willing right and here it will be the coalition of the willing for specifically this and I think it's us we can do that and industry has a big role

to play to bring that forward to bring the issue forward to the regulators to our politicians to say let's have a coalition of the winning to basically protect our planet and I think this is

what we have to do and that's the way forward Okay, &gt;&gt; last we can have more discussion offline I

think outside. So I I think we will stop here or &gt;&gt; Okay, last question. oil. More

compaties for the data centers. So [clears throat] we'll see in you know where it is being complied or not complied and how can that you also said we need

so I think that's a very perfect example my point is that that's a very growing conversation firstly we need is carbon uh sorry a greater sentence I

looked at from environmental perspective now ESG is not just environment S is I I feel S is the biggest component in ESG and obviously G is is is also important so this is a conversation that I've

started on uh these data centers how they can be like the carbon can be offseted so that's uh a debate to go towards or like a point to understand carbon markets right that how they're

offsetting now there's a debate again in offsetting and insetting in setting is like reducing your emissions right at the uh center where your emissions are happening and also taking measures. Now

what a lot of companies have done and it's also green washing that without even reducing your emission without even putting any effort in reducing your emissions they do offsetting. So that's

uh I would say uh green washing right because you don't and that's what your ESG persona that under your e pass you didn't attempted like to reduce your water consumption your energy

consumption or like to reduce your scope one scope two and now scope three emission so yes there's a growing conversation but and since data centers are going to be so important so I think

with this kind of session and with this kind of dialogue I think we can create this conversation most relevant and before it gets too late uh very practical

&gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Thank you very much everyone and thanks to the audience for this amazingation. Thank you for all the you like forgot my name but definitely

the photo &gt;&gt; because I I understand the clarity of your thought and the integrity behind but we all in a learning place and we're fighting for

that month which is exciting exciting
