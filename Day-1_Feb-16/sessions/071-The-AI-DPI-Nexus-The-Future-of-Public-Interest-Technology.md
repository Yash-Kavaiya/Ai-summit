## 📝 Summary

Global policy discourse largely treats AI and DPI separately. AI discussions focus on model safety, compute governance, workforce displacement. DPI conversations center on digital identity, digital payment, data exchange. AI-DPI convergence can create exponential value and new risk categories. While this convergence accelerates, critical questions remain: How can DPI lower barriers for local AI innovation while preventing new forms of exclusion? How can responsible AI systems be built in resource-constrained environments using DPI approaches?

## 📝 Transcript

years. So, we now have a much more narrow focused mission which is really on um how do you create more value for more people from data? And so with that focus, you can see why we really um love

this intersection of artificial intelligence and digital public infrastructure. Digital public infrastructure is obviously kind of the the foundational rails that allow these

basic inclusive services to reach into populations that have long been excluded from uh from the formal economy and from public services that they're entitled to. And of course, they also produce

really, really rich data about people and communities that have frankly been almost invisible digitally. And that is so incredibly important um to AI impact in the way that we're here thinking

about it this week. How do you have AI solve real problems for those who could benefit most? And then the last thing I'll say before uh we get started with our um speakers is that I also have

noticed this real urgency and um excitement that AI is causing even among policy makers who tend to be very slowm moving. And so I think there's a real way to think about AI almost as a

catalyst for uh laying down DPI foundations. And we're going to probe into that a little bit today. But uh that's that's my hope at least um that the kind of fear of missing out on the

AI excitement is really going to have countries much more focused and much more deliberate about getting their digital foundations, their digital public infrastructure in place. I'm

going to end by quoting uh Nandan Nilani who said just a few months ago at the DPI summit that talking about AI without DPI is like thinking about how you decorate your penthouse when you haven't

even built the first floor yet of a building. All right. And with that, um I am very pleased to introduce you to our very distinguished first panel. Um first we have Dr. Sadena Indai um who is I I

can't even begin to describe his bio because he has so many affiliations but let's just say he's an academic he's a very respected adviser to the governor of Sagal I mean sorry the government of

Sagal and he um has led many initiatives including on digital skilling uh among many other many other noble initiatives that are quite relevant to this. Oh, and of

course you're on the UN high level advisory B body for AI and um part of the global partnership on artificial intelligence. Um, next we have Quzam Masali who is the

director of UNDP's AI hub for sustainable development, but she also before that role um spent a lot of time working with me and others on um thinking about how to accelerate uh DPI.

Oh, sorry. Okay. And next we have Howard Lunga um from the Gates Foundation and he sits right at this nexus as well because he's part of the digital public

infrastructure practice at the Gates team but he's also one of the driving forces behind the foundation's approach to AI and he's been a very important thought partner for us and some research

at dial that we've been doing over the last few months and uh let's see next we have Vanti Desai another old friend who has uh spent a lot of time at the forefront of

DPI when she was setting up and leading the ID for D initiative practice at the World Bank and she's now the director for the digital programs for the World Bank for South Asia. Last but not least,

uh, Kamia Chandra, who is one of the co-founders of the Center for Digital Public Infrastructure and I think one of the most strategic thinkers about uh about DPI that I've met. So, it's really

a pleasure to have you all here. I'm going to start with you, Sadena. Um so you know the uh based on the research we've been doing which is really through the dial lens of how do you help equip

uh African policy makers to understand their choices and the implications of their policy choices um around data architectures and data sharing. And so I'm wondering as you've been navigating

um this from both an academic perspective, an advisory perspective um and watching the government of Sagal. How do you see these two very important imperatives? one to roll out digital

public infrastructure so that you have inclusive digital economy but two to start moving on AI before it's too late right which is a big part of the prevailing narrative I'm wondering if

you could give us some insights um from Sagal and then maybe a little bit about what you're you're seeing b u at the global level &gt;&gt; okay thank you hi hi thank you for the

invitation first uh I'm very excited to be here. Uh I will be uh answering be uh from my um uh experiences with some African government and uh in Sagal also and uh

there is a lot of excitement uh on uh having AI because uh a lot of ministries or or government representative are asking what to do with AI if AI can help to to

to to have more efficiency in the in in their work or in their sector in agriculture or in uh in finance or so on. Um but at the same time um there is a challenge to to have um to have uh uh

AI working well in this context because the government uh don't understand how to do AI. They want to do it but they don't know how to do it. So and there is a huge gap between

uh grassroot communities. they are working a lot on on AI having a lot of pilots but the pilots uh are different with uh what you should do if you're

talking about government and so the this gap between uh grassroot communities and uh uh policy makers uh it's um It's it's why we are we are seeing uh that a lot of policy makers

because when you talk about AI in uh in Sagal uh the AI strategy is leading by the ministry of ICT and most of uh the the need or the the the excitement is coming from uh all the ministries. So as

they don't see uh things going fast. So and for the for the ICT ministry the first thing to do is to to build DPI before going to AI and for um for the other ministries uh the the the

excitement is more in AI than in DPI. They don't know. Yes. They don't know about uh about DPI as and they don't care. They just want to have a AI working.

&gt;&gt; Yeah. The boring versusactive shiny [laughter] new thing. Yeah. Exactly. And the ministry of ICT is talking a lot about sovereignty, about having their own uh infrastructure and

so on. But uh the the the the skills on DPI is not there. So uh talking about sovereignty but they don't um give the they don't have the ability to work with uh local

communities to build their own DPI. So, so it's a it's a big it's a big problem and I think that if you don't have um enough uh enough skills on uh on the government part, it will be very very

difficult to have uh DPI and AI uh mixed in this context. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, you've described some dynamics that are even more complicated than just trying to do two things at once. That's

really important to keep in mind. Okay, I've never done this in a panel before, but we are going to take a very quick break and take a photograph for our for [laughter] our very kind organizers.

&gt;&gt; And so we need we need our other speakers to come to the front quickly. &gt;&gt; Right. So that's Dr. IO Olivier and Antonio. Yeah, sorry. [laughter]

All right. question. &gt;&gt; Back to the show. That's what &gt;&gt; Okay. So, Howard, I'm gonna turn next to

you since as I mentioned, you really sit at this nexus within the Gates Foundation, which has been one of the strongest champions of DPI uh for many many years and is now also very heavily

investing in how to make AI work um inclusively and safely around the world. So I'm wondering are you seeing kind of the same struggle within the foundation and how you work in a coordinated

fashion with um organizations that are feeling the imperative and urgency both to build out DPI but also to create effective um did I say DPI to build out DPI but also to create very effective AI

solutions. What's your perspective? Thank you, K. This is a fantastic question. Um, well, I want to start first by saying thank you to Dial and Dial team for bringing us here together

today and I want to say how honored I am to be on this panel with folks that I have tremendous respect for. So, thank you all for for this opportunity. Um so for us at the foundation the way

we think about DPI and AI as we see the two technologies being more and more interconnected is from a perspective of understanding how the technologies are being developed

how the technologies are being governed and who are the stakeholders that are governing those technologies. We know we're here in India. So we know DPI enable us to build the society scale

digital rails which is governed by strong principles of interoperability, a strong principle of openness, right? Like the example of DPI you have here in India and in many other countries the

digital ids and the entrop payment system and the data exchange. Now when you layer AI on top of it, you start to open opportunity for personalization for um inclusivity

right because you talk about inclusivity for instance you have you can bring in people that have low digital literacy you can bring in people that have that speak different languages in the

previous session someone was speaking about the fact that in India there is more than 20 scheduled languages and thousands of languages that are spoken on the continent of Africa. is also the

same thing, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; So, layering AI on top of DPI enable us to bring inclusivity and to make sure that everybody is represented

&gt;&gt; and we are already seeing some example of DPI and AI working together creating a flywheel that strengthen each other like one example that I really one of my favorite example is Syncpass in

Singapore, right? Where Syncpass is connected to Singapore digital ID system, right? But they also leverage AI to make sure that the population can access thousands of government services.

Last I check Syncpass is now doing 41 million transaction per month. This is really how DPI and AI can work together to create population level scale, population level impact. That's why the

foundation we excited about DPI and AI together. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Yeah, that's that's exciting. and um getting that virtual the virtuous kind of flywheel going does feel like

the holy grail that we're trying to reach in all the countries that we partner with um which then begs the question of can you do DPI and AI at the same time and if so um how not to turn

those into silos because it is so important for them to actually be working together. All right. Well, jumping from the Gates Foundation over to the international

organization world. Um, Quaison, uh, you now are the director of UNDP's, um, AI sustainable hub. Yeah, AI hub for sustainable development. And I think you have a very unique perspective on going

from a focus that was all about DPI from the U from UNDP for many years to now a focus uh that is uh more narrow on AI. How are you seeing uh the two interact? How would you say they're similar? How

are they different? Do you see opportunities for the worlds to come together? Hi uh namaste um everybody good afternoon it's such a pleasure to be

here uh at the AI impact for summit and I'm just reading the theme again for us welfare for all happiness of all what a remarkable way to start off this amazing week that we're going to have and bring

the focus back always on the impact that we can use technology for for people for society for communities and for our planet. And this is why K to your to answer your question uh at UNDP and and

just a brief correction is that you know I serve as the director of our AI hub but I'm also still the director of our global programs on AI and DPI. It's just that we're going through some reforms

where you have to you know double up [laughter] &gt;&gt; and do many jobs. But it's great because uh it's fantastic to see the intersections and I wanted to share

&gt;&gt; austerity has brought them together. it's having a an an influence on work life balance. But you know sometimes work at our multilateral organizations and certainly

for Harvard and others is about devotion devotion to impact. And I wanted to say that the arc of of AI's beneficial use or for development purposes which can be job creation, economic growth, better

reach of public services really is defined not by how quickly technology is moving but but by how it's getting adopted, who benefits, how is it governed, some of the things that

Harvard spoke Harvard spoke about uh just before me. And so for both AI and DPI, it is through deliberate choices that countries will make things that uh this

this uh our wonderful uh friend from Sagal touched on and that is going to shape the arc of impact for AI and DPI. Now when we talk about the diffusion of both AI and DPI across countries, we

know that there are over a hundred DPI like systems being built across a number of countries. We had a fantastic G20 presidency in India which you know really brought front and center the

agenda and the benefits of digital public infrastructure. But there were also many questions around beyond technology what is the local ecosystem required what are the safeguards and the

guard rails required and it's not a fixed goal right because we've seen in the instances of Aadhaar that when you build a system with a digital public infrastructure approach over time you

are you have the ability to improve grievance redressal mechanism over time you have the ability for that system to identify where risks are emerging and improve

whether it may be you know the touch points that need to enable more offline on boarding to you know risk of uh privacy and so on and that is I think the fantastic opportunity that digital

public infrastructure as a foundation brings to what AI can do uh to improve outcomes in people's lives whether it's bringing radiology services closer to community health centers many of them in

low connectivity areas whether it's bringing you know thousands and thousands of jaw uh languages spoken by AI so that actually a student in Uganda or a student in in uh um you know

Paraguay can actually use AI to learn better to you know uh sell your services better to engage in the market economy and move from informality to the formal economy economy you know generate

livelihoods create jobs etc etc so I think the nexus of DPI and AI as we're seeing in the country is not detached it's linked together very much but of course there are some fundamental

questions around choices around sovereignty sovereignty in the form of uh having choices and having the agency to make your choices and to being able to see some of the guard guard rails and

the governance of AI and DPI systems being integrated in a way that we look at it from a user perspective. What are the risk of small holder farmers facing? How do we make sure that AI combining 18

different sources of information to give realtime weather or crop information to a small holder farmer is actually a trusted source who is accountable when something goes wrong? Because it cannot

be the user, it cannot be the person. it has to be distributed across these systems. So we're we're really thrilled that this is coming together at the country level. Uh we also know that DPI

beyond some of the foundational systems include you know AI in uh AI ready data voice data and when you combine the power of DPI principles with the AI potential to really create change and

impact on the ground I think it's just like going to be phenomenal. Uh so we're very excited at the United Nations development program and we're so grateful for all the partners including

our partners in India who are testing, learning, sharing because there there is no fixed pathway forward. We need to co-design these powerful pathways uh to create the impact.

&gt;&gt; That's great. I have about a dozen follow-up questions for you, but we're going to move on. And that's a perfect segue over to Vaganti, who um has gone from leading a global practice focused

on DPI for many years for the bank, but now you're looking at this through more of a country, a regional lens with a little bit broader of a mandate that includes not only DPI, but the AI

innovations. So, I'm wondering from your experience, how are governments dealing with this almost onslaught of um both opportunity but also some of the being able to make these choices and and

evaluate some of the risks as well. I mean what we're not able to get into very much today is you know if we have governance of DPI happening in a completely different space than

governance of AI what are the you know what are the implications there so what is the view from on the ground here in South Asia &gt;&gt; so thanks Kay um and as you rightfully

say many countries are starting to get excited by the promise of AI um but at the same time continue to work on some of the DPI foundations And I think on the DPI foundations, it's no longer a

question of whether they should. It's it's sort of where they are in the journey on DPI, we're seeing country after country at various stages of the DPI journey. Um and so uh when I think

about these two and you know while while the DPI journey is at various stages we we see in this region Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bangladesh all with the intent and in many ways already further in the journey

but at varying stages um and they are also many of our client countries are really interested in testing and experimenting and piloting on AI and so the question is these two interconnected

distinct interconnected and how do we make sure the I see it in two ways. One is um thinking about how AI and everyone in this panel has already said how AI uh can really be at much greater scale and

impact when um built upon DPI foundations. And then the second is how do we take the DPI thinking that we've worked so hard over the last decade the more open modular interoperable and then

apply that to some of the new AI thinking. So on the first with you know I don't necessarily need to repeat a lot of what is said but the AI built upon DPI where you know how important data is

and without interoperable data with clean data sets AI is not even going to be uh of much use but it's going beyond it's linking um ID and uh data sharing and others and you think about a farmer

link having the farmer registry with land registries weather data and others and not not only making that beneficial for the farmer for delivering services but then just thinking about a lot of

the innovation that can be built on top of that and you think about new markets new services and how data the data trails that they have can then be used for credit histories and then for access

to credit lines and so that's sort of thinking about AI the layer of AI on top of DPI and and how important that is but if we move to where I think there's more work to be done is how do we take the

thinking that has been where the principles and so much of the the work over the last decade on open modular interoperable for public benefit for DPI that most

countries now are moving um towards and apply that to the the AI layer. I think we're starting to see some real new uh innovations and but much more work is to be done. Think about the open network.

We're we're talking about open networks layers above some of the DPI layers and making that a truly competitive open ecosystem where you can have and we're we're supporting our agriculture

colleagues um both in this country but also in uh in other regions. I'm thinking about the role of having different AI applications being able to be um sort of modular and swappable so

that uh you can have for example a farmer be connected to market linkages to weather advisory to uh others but that you don't necessarily have to have a wall garden approach but a more open

competitive uh approach and that's where I really do think many of us it's a wonderful opportunity at this point to see how we and shape that uh area further.

&gt;&gt; I think that's your that's an excellent point. You know, for with DPI now for years, we've been wrestling with where's the line between collaboration and competition, right? And I I hope that

much of that learning and evolution is also going to be applied to AI where I think that conversation is far more nent far more nent. All right. Well, last word over to you Kamia. And so I guess

you are our um unique panelist and that I don't think you worked directly on AI. In fact, you're at the Center for Digital Public Infrastructure. So you've been able to maintain your focus. So how

are you finding uh this kind of you know FOMO and excitement around AI? Is it a distraction or does it help you make the argument for DPI? the question uh the question is like

hype or hope right is it [laughter] &gt;&gt; that's what we're choosing between um and I think look the the way that we think about it you know AI is replacing engineers um AI is not replacing swift

AI is not replacing passports AI is not replacing digil locker in India right so while there's quite a lot of energy around oh look at this cool stuff I can build which you know it deserves its

due. It is cool stuff right? the the at a national level the question you have to ask is uh you know what do we build in the next few years that can uh accelerate our uh you know progress on

income inequality reduce poverty drive uh economic growth I think it's very very clear to me that at scale um you know the countries that have DPI and are building AI on top um are are at a very

high advantage uh to those that you know are starting from scratch because agent IC AI rewards countries that have a good data exhaust and penalizes the citizens of countries that don't have data in a

digital form uh that don't have consent built-in that don't have verifiable identities uh that don't have abilities to to close any transaction because you don't have digital payments uh at a

scale uh that is actually inclusive to the whole economy. Uh so I think it's very clear that um that AI needs to build on top of DPI uh in order to really drive value to a citizen. Of

course you'll get your you know your cool agri use cases your cool you know take a picture of your soil and you can tell me but who's going to now um en ensure that uh you know you don't just

have fancy screen scrapers because that's what agentic AI will do if you don't have consent layers built in if you don't have identity authentication. they're just going to be screen scraping

for data um and and then the guardrails on that are too scary to think about. So I I think it's it's really important for nations um uh you know as they're moving ahead to really think about this. I

think the second point you know which I think vendi distinguished it well which is like how can we use DPI before we build AI but then how do we apply the DPI thinking to AI. I think on this

second point, it's it's very interesting that a lot of the tech sector is already doing this themselves like without us uh even nudging. There's parts of the problem they're solving. So things like

the model context protocol or the web MCP which was released just two weeks ago. Um those two really show that the sector is thinking about interoperability of agents when it suits

them. Right? So so when the big tech sees the size of the network and the size of the scale of entities they can interact with, it becomes really clear that you need a a protocol. But the real

question for public service delivery is am I going to buy a black box that's an LLM that's going to be now the foundation of all of my public service delivery. Um and that's where some of

the thinking that DBI put into place on interoperability uh on open standards like for model inputs and outputs uh on thinking through all of the different components here auditability

standardized logs right what are the minimal layers that then we can impose uh is coming back to this philosophy of what is the public rails that drives private innovation which is the core of

of sort of DPI thinking. So I think on the whole at CDPI we're very excited uh we we sort of have started thinking through it's very obvious in a lot of different sectors once you doubleclick

uh how AI and DPI can be layered very easily on top of each other. Um in fact most engineers don't distinguish right there's like here's an API there's another API and I'm just stitching this

together. Uh so I think it's very powerful to see that coming together. Uh I think we need more of it. &gt;&gt; So it sounds like you're coming more down on the side of the equation.

[laughter] That's not what I would have guessed, but I think you make such an important point about um the consent and trust layer in DPI, which has been given an awful lot of thought and um no

thought whatsoever in the AI world right now. And that is an incredibly important um part of this nexus, especially for countries that have so much to gain from actually effective, authentic, safe AI

solutions. Great. Well, please join me in thanking this allstar panel and we're going to move to the second session very quickly. Thank you guys so much. &gt;&gt; All right.

So, Dr. Bio, please. Antonio, please. And Olivier Still not working. I'm just too quiet.

Yeah, I just need to talk more into it. &gt;&gt; All right, great. Well, we have exactly 19 minutes uh to go, so I'm gonna keep us marching along here. Um if you thought the Oh, okay. Great. Apparently,

I'm very soft spoken today. So, we have a second allstar round here that I'm going to introduce very quickly. then we're going to just dive right in. Um, so first let me start with Antonio

Zabios who is the director of the digital sector office at the Asia Development Bank. Welcome. Thank you for being here. Um, to his right we have uh Dr. Bio who has requested that I not try

to pronounce his name and so we're just going to stick with Dr. bio um who is the founder and CEO of data science Nigeria. And uh last but not least, we have

Olivier. And do you want me to try your last name? &gt;&gt; Try it. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Twio. &gt;&gt; Very gross. 60%.

&gt;&gt; All right. 60. [laughter] That's fine. First try. um who is uh with a dial partner the center for fourth industrial revolution in Rwanda and most recently is the new

director of the AI scaling hub in Rwanda. So thank you gentlemen for being here with us. Um, and you guys are really kind of on the front lines of this work from a couple of different

perspectives. And so I'm going to take a few minutes to see if we can uh dive a little more deeply into a couple a few of the issues that were raised by the first panel, especially thinking about

inclusion and thinking about consent, thinking about governance. So why don't we start with you and this is the rapid fire session. Um so we'll try to stick to one minute answers and

this one is for both um uh Olivier and Antonio. And this is really thinking about the nexus of API or AI and DPI. I guess maybe it is APIs the nexus of AI and DPI really when we were thinking

about inclusive digital services both in the public and private sector. Do we have a volunteer? One minute. &gt;&gt; Let me go for it. &gt;&gt; All right. [laughter]

&gt;&gt; All right. Thank you. Uh since you give the one minute, I start by thanking D for having us here and we jump right into the fire. &gt;&gt; [laughter]

&gt;&gt; So one I think the the most important part to look at in in the perspective of of Rwanda and uh most likely what actually should be important for for for even other countries.

The approach of Ronda when it comes to inclusion in AI innovation is uh the AI policy and the strategy emphasize inclusion not to be a secondary objective but more a

fundamental or a foundational principle and this foundational principle is uh seen or is basically standing on three key pillars. The first one is to make sure that inclusion means uh designing

for the underserved right from the outset. Uh as we think about AI innovation, we need to think about women. We need to think about uh the young, we need to think about uh uh even

the digitally disadvantaged and uh the people living with disability right from uh uh uh the get-go. And that being said uh even with this uh as we go on with uh uh with AI solutions they need to be

available in local languages. Ronda have an advantage of having one language for the whole population but you have different intonations. If you produce any solution in AI which does not speak

or it does not interact in Kenya which is the language you've already left out a good uh part of the population. So that that that is the first. The second part is to make sure that uh inclusion

is also actually guided by the governance. So that means that uh like currently Ronda have a data sharing policy that make sure that these since we are talking about AI there is a lot

of use of data. So how do you protect even the people who do not know about their need for protection of personal data. So this needs to be in the governance and it's there so it's

practiced. So and the last point is to make sure that when we talk about inclusion, how do we measure it? So uh basically we take the approach of making sure that measuring uh the inclusion is

not only about measuring the technical performance but measuring the impact that those innovation those AI solutions actually produce uh uh in the population or to what at the very end because the

belief is if you create any solution to public uh to save public interest but you do not have this part of including the digitally disadvantaged right from the

you've already, you know, you are off the put if I can say you've went to to to to the wrong way and this is going to cost you at the end uh by trying to redesign a system to bring into the

people you left out at the beginning. Thank you. Well, and I would argue that's a lesson we learned almost the hard way in DPI because there was so much focus on access and usage without

really thinking about how do you design for much less measure outcomes for people which is the whole point. &gt;&gt; Great. &gt;&gt; That's good. Thank you.

&gt;&gt; What would you add to that? &gt;&gt; Yeah, thank you so much K. Let me just stick to one minute. So I would say just two things and I'm trying to be provocative in here. [laughter]

&gt;&gt; There's no AI. there's no DPI, if there's no trust and if there is not human capital that really understand the benefit of that. So to me those two are the I would say the two key nexus that

are linking AI and DPI. I hope that we have opportunity of discussing further. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Wow. Very succinct. Love it. And um I think you're making the point that some

of these distinctions between thinking about inclusive and safe and these are kind of false distinctions, right? They rely on each other. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Correct. I think that at the end

of the day the people will be using whatever is the solution and the use cases in the way in which they really trust that the data is somehow protected. So it is very difficult for

me to think about a successful AI or a successful DPI if there is not coming together with a data privacy with a cyber security more importantly with a critical infrastructure and information

protection that needs to come together. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So I couldn't agree with you more that this AIDP nexus like the you know the third leg of that stool has to be data governance, data protection, data

sharing. um which is actually something that I think Nigeria is starting to focus on quite explicitly. Um but Dr. Bio maybe you can jump in and from the perspective of actual engineering firm

that's really at the forefront of innovative solutions and works closely with other partners. Can you um comment on how do you think about driving private sector innovation through these

government platforms whether they're AI foundations or DPI? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Uh thank you very much. Uh um I I think first um we need to see the interlock between DPI and AI. I always

believe that why DPI makes it possible AI makes it personal. So we need to move from the registry mindset that DPI provides to the relationship mindset that AI makes possible. And I think it's

the interlock of the two that makes it work. AI is a standardized infrastructure. You know DPI is a standardized infrastructure but AI gives to us personalized experience

contextualized knowledge that can pick other data point on that individual on a DPI and make it work for that person in the context of service delivery or value uh construct for an individual. So for

us what we have learned and great thanks to gate foundation project in Nigeria is that government should move from being an operator to becoming a facilitator where anything called DPR should be seen

as a rail that is made available to innovators to come and build on and that's one of the success story we've seen in Nigerian fintech for example where nibs which is a national

infrastructure has powered the national uh fintech uh revolution in Nigeria but it should go beyond finance. It should go to agriculture, health and so the fundamental is made infrastructure

available allow the private sector to build on it and then what do we see? We see more personalized you know interventions. So if there is anything to take away DPI gives us the real but

AI give us the trail and that trail that gives the value. It is that trail that gives the economy multiply effect. It is that trade that allows all the young innovators in this room to leverage to

build creative solution that advance the economy and that for me that's the point of intersection and that's what we have learned in Nigeria with uh some of the works that Gates Foundation has

supported us. &gt;&gt; All right so we're coining a few phrases here today we've got hyper hope possible to personal and now will to thrill. I love that. Um great okay well why don't

we keep you Dr. bio in the hot seat and then I'm going to turn to Antonio to do the same thing. Give us a minute or two of thoughts on consent. And um Antonio has already brought this

into the conversation by talking about trust as being key to both of these um efforts. &gt;&gt; Okay. So what we've seen consent because I'm bringing AI and DPI together too

much information about an individual is now made accessible then that individual must be more empowered to be able to give consent concept must be revocable and concept must become more democratic

and more digitally literate in terms of an individual knowing that this is what is at stake. So some of the work we're doing in Nigeria is now taking DPI to voice level where people can access DPI

via voice infrastructure in local languages so that they can use voice to either give access or not give access especially when you come to information exchange within data exchange platform.

Let individual be able to call a number in their local language and be able to and the next question you ask is that how we able to collect so much data set that can allow us to localize. Of course

there's a lot of work that Gates foundation has been doing around that around collecting local data but the startup that a part of equalizer we've gone a step further to say we can even

collect people's dialects and assent how do we do that these people may not have a smartphone but they may they have a phone and a phone can call so we can use phone now to collect data as if you are

leaving a voicemail behind. We just built an infrastructure that allows anyone that has a feature code to call. They receive a prompt and they drop a message and a linguist can label it. So

what that means is that people who ordinarily would have been cut off from using AI power language technology to be able to do consent can now do it not just in their language but also in their

dialect because the truth is the more personal it becomes the more easier the whole uh empowerment of the user becomes. So what we are saying is that there are more technology now that makes

it easier for user to be in control because they can talk to DPI, they can talk to AI, they can revoke, they can allow, they can permit to the extent that language is now a channel of

communication, not necessarily that you can read, you can write or you can click. Now you can just talk. &gt;&gt; That that's a really good reminder. I think when most of us think about AI, um

we're thinking about the the downsides, right? the deep fakes and the way AI can be used to improve um scams. But your point is that especially for communities that have long been excluded that

actually there are innovations that are being enabled through DPI and AI that um are going to make things much more powerful and trusted. &gt;&gt; That's great. Antonio, what would you

add to that? &gt;&gt; Yeah, thank you. Thank you, K. I would say that there are two specific aspects in from the perspective of the Asian Development Bank. First one as I

mentioned before is the human capital. So every time that I'm listening about the AI around Asia Pacific, you know, I have the same feeling for

whom who is going to be the end users? And we had to keep in mind that at the end of the day talking about AI is a way to make sure that we are contributing to inclusion

but sometimes it could be also a way of excluding people and there are several reasons why we may be excluding people from using AI. Erh one of them I was mentioning could be the trust the people

literally they don't really want to use because they are afraid of that and this comes together with the need of h creating the understanding that AI could be a tool for a particular purpose. So

the bank is precisely working on a center for AI around Asia Pacific that is precisely trying to create the awareness on the benefit that this could have. But second we cannot forget that

there's a lot of investment there's a lot of infrastructure that is required to make sure that AI is democratic and the doctor was mentioning about the devices sometimes the problem is

affordability. Yeah, &gt;&gt; sometimes the problem is that the operators that are putting at the everybody disposal the infrastructure the affordable

it may come a tradeoff between the level of investment that is required and the willingness to pay from the the users. So at the same time we need to come together with a concrete policy angle

that incentivize investment. May the people really h understand the benefits that they can get out of that which again needs to h bring together the the I would say the the the human capital

angle and at the same time contribute to the you know sustainability of that investment that that is going to be put in place. So there are many different angles that we need to individually.

&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean all excellent points, but I think you just really summed up the level of nuance and interdependence in both the policy sphere and the marketplace

um regulations that it's going to take to make this work for people. So I I hope I mean I think that the multilateral development banks have a huge role to play in bringing these kind

of complicated questions together. All right. So, Olivia, we are going to wrap up this session with you and I actually think this is one of the hardest questions. So, sorry I didn't

write it. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, another thing that in the digital public infrastructure world we've been thinking about and debating now for a long time is who bears the

liability, right? But it's more clear because you kind of understand where the public rails end and the private innovation begins. And of course I'm oversimplifying,

&gt;&gt; but how do you see these issues of liability um when you're thinking about scaling AI solutions and are they at all related to what you were talking about with

inclusion, right? Like where does the data come from, right? How do you know that you're actually um providing services that are going to work for all Rwans,

&gt;&gt; right? But in terms of liability, when things go wrong, who bears that uh that responsibility and is accountable? &gt;&gt; That's a good question. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Sorry.

&gt;&gt; No, no, it's a it's a good but very important questions. So there is a number of things that we need to consider as we jump into that revolution. uh first we need to have

I would say three key policy choices that really guides our innovation and implementation and that's first of all even before we talk about reliability we need to think about the technology that

we are delivering does it have a purpose are we delivering to a public purpose or we are making technology just for the sake of technology so that needs to be clear it's like the more you are

delivering to the purpose the liability again we've already passed the first layer of risk the second part now becomes to make sure that as I I I said it before the data governance needs to

be there as an enabler not to block the innovation. So then the third part is where we need to make sure that as we go through this implementation

we need to have the owners. AI can help us to accelerate. Uh but AI should work well when there is an owner of the decisions behind it. &gt;&gt; And that must be a human not a machine.

Yeah. &gt;&gt; Uh so there comes actually when it comes to the liability because there is basically the institutional ownership behind a certain technology or

application then when it comes to liability that's the people to go for. That's that's the best way of looking at it. And obviously we need to think about continuous improvement because we cannot

deliver a full solution right from the get-go. &gt;&gt; I think those are all terrific points and I guess I would only said that I think one of these foundational pieces

that we need to be adding it's not just solving for compute it's not just solving for language but I think making the safety standards and impact evaluation frameworks part and part part

and parcel of what we're providing as ecosystems &gt;&gt; feels incredibly important to making sure this works &gt;&gt; definitely

&gt;&gt; listen thank you all so much this is wonderful &gt;&gt; and before the group gets up I just want to make sure that we're flashing a QR code here because I didn't um I didn't

advertise this at the beginning, but we're actually doing some research on this right now and thinking through the lens of what do policy makers need to be thinking about and we would love um your

feedback. Get out of the way and then I think we have to get out of this room.
