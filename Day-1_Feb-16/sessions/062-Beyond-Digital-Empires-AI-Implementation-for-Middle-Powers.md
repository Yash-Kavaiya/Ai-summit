## 📝 Transcript

my colleague Akash Kapoor who is a senior fellow at New America and at New York University's Gov Lab and he is also a visiting research scholar at Princeton University. So without further ado, I

will turn it over to you Akash. &gt;&gt; Thanks. Um are we waiting for Pablo? &gt;&gt; Gordon, we wait for Pablo. &gt;&gt; Yeah, let me see if I can &gt;&gt; Yeah, he'll be here. I I can actually

start just kind of um with a little bit of of background um on how I'm seeing the title of the talk which is not up there but um so the the title of the talk as Gordon mentioned is beyond

digital empires AI implementation um for middle powers or middle countries. So I was thinking about how to structure the talk and um I think that there's two basically two

strands in there. The beyond digital empires signifies a kind of big picture, geopolitics, questions about sovereignty, questions about agency. Um, oh hey, we have one more panelist.

People are trickling in. You guys all saw what it's like at the entrance. So, thank you for You came straight from the airport or Okay. Do you want to introduce Natalie real quick?

&gt;&gt; Yes. Our final panelist straight from the airport. Natalie, thank you for making it rushing in. Um, this is Natalie Black. She is group director for infrastructure and connectivity and an

executive board member of Ofcom, which is the UK's communications industry regulator. And that includes leading offcom's work on the implications of artificial intelligence. Is that all

correct? Okay. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, yeah. So, I was saying there's these two strands. There's the kind of big picture geopolitics strand um in the

first part of the title of this talk beyond digital empires and then after the colon we have AI implementation which signifies something very different. It's much more granular. It's

much more nitty-gritty. It's much more on the ground. And I think part of what we are trying to figure out in this talk and more generally in my work and my work with new America is how these two

actually fit together because um you know middle inome or middle countries or smaller countries ability to implement AI and then the effects and the impact of that AI is constrained in some cases

perhaps enabled by the broader geopolitical picture and the sort of broader uh issues around sovereignty and agency. So um I want to just I'm going to structure the uh conversation today

around these two strands. I'm going to start big and then kind of drill down from there into more granular. Um and I thought Shashi since we are in India and al not only because of that but also

because India's a very important player in this context both &gt;&gt; and he's also the smartest person on &gt;&gt; and you're also the smartest person on the panel. [laughter]

Um uh but also because I I just want to emphasize that India also is it's not just because we're in India. India is a is a very big player both as a middle power. I think some people would even

reject the label as a middle power uh but also it is innovating so much on the ground in AI implementation. So I wanted to ask you if you could sort of talk to us a little bit about how you and how

India is kind of thinking about these questions around AI sovereignty AI agency um particularly in the context of these big sort of digital empires uh around the world.

&gt;&gt; Sure. Thank you. uh happy to be here and I think I'll first take up on the topic itself uh you know the middle empire labeling I'm sure the prime minister in his speech will strongly reject that

[laughter] but yeah but more seriously I think the the question of sovereignity I think is uh is very important to India uh and I think there are two very different

reasons why it is important uh one is of course the the geopolitical context and we've seen that uh during co with vaccine availability uh we've seen that with recent conflicts be the you know

Russia Ukraine war where overnight a a major big tech platform can take a policy decision and then shut off the you know the the voice from you know one of the parties to that conflict right so

you definitely don't want a situation where uh India is dependent on foreign platforms uh to to get its message out or you know to do various things that that that we do in the digital economy

so sovereignity is clearly important also also from a supply chain standpoint and we've seen that you know there are serious risks with with the with the uh whole semiconductor supply chain. So

sovereignity to us is not just about uh you know trying to you know beat the race between the US and China but it is more about uh de-risking geopolitically and and it goes across the entire stack

all the way from the chips all the way to the platforms. uh but there's also another very important reason why I think sovereignity is very important for us uh which is the the cultural

diversity and nuances we've seen that especially with all the the uh the models that have been trained on data which is available publicly on the internet be it chat GPT be Gemini and so

on uh it is very common that they lose out and miss out on the Indian cultural context the nuances uh you know India is not just 22 official languages it is nearly 100 plus languages anguages and

dialects. Uh AllIndia Radio which I was the CEO of a few years back creates content in this entire diversity of you know Indian languages and dialects and it goes beyond just written text. In

fact uh a lot of Indian dialects don't even have a digital footprint right so so that is the kind of nuance that we don't want lost. So hence it becomes all the more important for India to build

its own models. So that would be I think the broad context I would &gt;&gt; Okay, I like that a lot. The sort of uh context and relevance as a form of of of sovereignty. Um Pablo, you've worked a

lot on sovereignty and we've talked about it. Can you maybe situate um India's [clears throat] efforts within a sort of broader context of what what other countries are doing um and how

they're approaching these questions? &gt;&gt; Yeah, I'd love to. And first of all, thank you so much for the invitation. It's wonderful to be on on this panel. It's wonderful to be here in New Delhi.

By the way, can you guys hear me? Okay. Is this okay? So, um I think that that everything that Shashi uh said is uh correct in that um it really captures this idea, this growing idea of of AI

sovereignty. And um Akos, you and I last talked in public about this maybe kind of like mid 2025. And I think the question came up at that point like is sovereign AI or AI sovereignty however

it is that we can define it and and we can get into that is it a real trend right um and you know and if so how is it manifesting itself um I'll spend a couple minutes giving you a preview of

some work that I'm doing that will be released in the coming weeks uh by a think tank that I'm affiliated with called the center for new American security effectively it's a sovereign AI

index um that um over the last couple of years has been tracking uh every project that I've been able to find that is um a an infrastructure a model building or a data um AI data

project funded by uh governments um over the last couple of years and I'll tell you that in 2024 those projects that I just articulated um they there were 30 countries that were doing roughly 40 of

these projects at by the end of 2025 so the beginning of 2026 that number had grown to roughly 130 projects across over 50 countries. And just to bring it back a little bit

to to India, um India is absolutely in in that index. Um as a middle power and I mean you're G20 country and 17 of the 20 G20 20 countries are are on this list. Um but one thing that I find very

interesting about India and perhaps this is something that we'd like to talk about is that there are different countries are doing different things uh in terms of building up their sovereign

AI capacity. India as far as I can tell is among basically four countries uh that are across the three uh parts of the stack that I'm tracking again model building infrastructure uh development

and and data projects. India is right now um one of four countries that is doing projects across each and every one of those. The others are include South Korea um to a lesser scale Taiwan at a

smaller scale um Sweden. And so this is absolutely uh a real trend. Um it is motivated by you know all the things that Shashi just mentioned. Um and and so I think it's good to kind of ground

it a little bit in some some of the the the data that's out there in terms of how this trend is growing. &gt;&gt; Yeah, we'll look forward to seeing that work. Um Natalie, I wanted to come to

you. You you've worked in international trade. Um and I was going [clears throat] to, you know, ask you to sort of situate this conversation within the shifting landscape of international

trade. I think from my point of view, it's moved me from being a a skeptic on sovereignty to understanding like, wow, maybe actually it's some I see why countries would need it, right? Because

it creates there's a [clears throat] much bigger sense of vulnerability. On the other hand, I'm also wondering if it makes it harder to secure sovereignty given like chip export restrictions and

things like that. &gt;&gt; Um, well, firstly, it's just so exciting to be here. I've literally just landed in uh from London, arrived here in Delhi and the energy is just incredible. Um

and I'm really really excited about the next couple of days and and what a great way to kick things off. Um so my background is a mixture of of trade and and now I'm at the uh UK's

communications regulator and there's sort of three things I would say are on our minds when it comes to the debate about sovereignty. Um because first of all of course there is no definition of

actually what sovereignty means. I think it really depends where you sit at the table. What are the things that you're worried about either from your own perspective or from what others might do

to you? Um so at Ofcom the communications regulator some of the issues that we think about are for example innovation. So how is sovereignty going to drive

access to innovation or potentially prevent it? So if certain companies are doing all their innovation in their home country and not in your country, what does that mean from a trade point of

view or how do you retain R&amp;D in your own country or if there's the risk that it's going to go elsewhere? Number one. Number two is from the point of view of the user, be that individual consumers

or businesses. What does sovereignty mean for those individuals? What do you want to make sure that they can access, they can't access? Of course you quickly get into issues of privacy etc. But I'm

sure we'll sort of talk about this a bit more on the tactical side. Um and then thirdly it's the issue of security. So I spend a lot of my time thinking about cyber security sovereignty in this

context brings a whole another level of complexity which we probably haven't quite thought through yet in terms of how does some of the security uh implications of AI manifest themselves

in your own economy when maybe you don't fully control the whole stack and how realistic is it actually to control that stack and I think that's probably the biggest question for sovereignty in

terms of what does that mean for you where you sit but also how far does it have to go it's a spectrum it's not an off or on switch uh and so where particularly again I would probably you

know have some questions about the definition of middle powers um but depending where you sit in the world you'll have a different view on where you want to sit on that spectrum

&gt;&gt; yeah thank you I'm actually the security thing I want to come back to the question of risk and sovereignty in in a little bit but first I wanted to move to Kate thank you for being here and Um,

you know, Kate and I u met at the DPI summit in Cape Town a while ago and we had a really great conversation and we were I think we were thinking about sovereignty and AI stack in a very

different way there, right? Um, Kate does really fascinating work with what I think of as frugal infrastructure, light infrastructure. Um, and so maybe you can talk about that. You can talk about your

work a little bit and also talk about how that's a kind of how countries are approaching sovereignty or how you're thinking about sovereignty through that perspective.

&gt;&gt; Absolutely. Thank you for having me today. It's a pleasure to be here. Um, so when it comes to sovereignty in my company, we're seeing more as providing governments and institutions across the

global south to have choice over their infrastructure, but also control over their own infrastructure. What does that mean? You know, not every country has the power to build gigawatt

infrastructure, invest hundreds of billions of dollars. Um, we mentioned it, um, Shashi mentioned it already. You know, a lot of the large language models today are trained on data coming from

the internet, but you still have 2.2 billion people that are unconnected. That means a lot of their data is actually not represented. Their culture, their languages, their knowledge systems

are not represented and integrated in um the large language models that are the most widely used today. So when we thought about sovereignty, we actually looked at how could we support

governments to understand what it truly take to really have infrastructure that resemble um your local context that integrate your local context but also support um reaching the people in your

country. That means being in control and having the choice over which infrastructure you invest in whether it's buying GPUs from the US or buying GPUs from China or looking at

alternative chips. Um be it also understanding what is the minimum viable compute infrastructure that you need to equip yourself. You know there's parts of data that needs to stay sovereign.

There's part of data that needs to stay resident in your country. um really understanding how much truly how much infrastructure you need to build to support that equals sovereignty for a

lot of the countries we're working with and then you go up the stack looking at the models a lot of advancement in open source today but also looking at some of the research that goes into

underresourced languages Africa has 2500 languages and a lot of them are still not written today right a lot of them are spoken so how do we go about reaching populations and amplifying and

diversifying ing the amount of data and the quality and the diversity of data that goes into training those models for countries. So we now deploy that stack across countries in Africa, in the

Caribbean, in Latin America and also expanding into Southeast Asia. And truly the goal is providing countries a way to generate value locally rather than exporting it, but also supporting that

economic transition into a digital economy. &gt;&gt; Yeah, thanks. I guess the question that I don't really fully grasp about sovereignty and that comes up here is I

mean to me the AI stack is as we know AI is not a single thing and so it's fundamentally interconnected layered and the problem I have with sovereignty is it just seems like a not a very feasible

goal unless you're like literally controlling I'm going to ask this question is for you actually right so um I'm just trying to understand like are we talking about degrees of sovereignty

is that the issue here or are we talking about you know finding points of vulnerability because we're clearly not talking about like a total cut off sort of otterarchy like independent sovereign

stack for any country right &gt;&gt; no I agree I I don't think we're talking of complete islands which you know but yes it is about degrees of sovereignity clearly

&gt;&gt; uh let me give uh couple of examples that will probably set this context right &gt;&gt; uh in India you have a population with you know one of the highest penetration

of mobile devices right nearly a billion mobile phones and one of the highest data consumption on an average the Indian mobile user consumes anywhere close to 20 to 30 GB of data every month

and it's all video right so the kind of consumption that's happening in India is very different from the kind of consumption of content that happens in the rest of the world similarly when it

comes to the kinds of use cases for example in India you have UPI for digital payments now there's a large part of the population which I would you know very strongly relate to what uh

Kate was saying who are comfortable with the spoken interface they are not comfortable with the UI interface the way it's designed with a you know with a very different user persona in mind

right so for those kinds of use cases for those kinds of users you have very different needs and different workloads so your the chips are perhaps need to be optimized differently uh the the

sovereign AI infrastructure on the cloud needs to be optimized differently so I think those are the kinds of motivations why you would want to think differently on you know sovereign Right. C. Do you

want to say something? &gt;&gt; Yeah. But but I think that that your point is is well taken and it's something that we really do need to keep in mind. I mean sovereign AI is a is a

headline, but it doesn't really I mean it doesn't capture the reality of of many, you know, so so-called sovereign AI deployments. Um again kind of pointing back to to the research that

I've been doing. Um the vast majority of public sectorled uh sovereign AI projects uh that I've been tracking um include partnerships with foreign technology companies. Um and and so I

think that that's just simply a reality of of building of a country building a stack that it has more control over. But what you what you do see though is is countries rather than kind of treating

to your point rather than treating sovereignty as a monolith, they look at the they think of of sovereignty, think about it this way. It's not necessarily a goal. It's more like a strategy for

how you um minimize risk in in the parts of the stack that you as a country really care about. For example, if you care about data, then you organize, you know, your data in a strategic way. If

you care about models, then you're going to deploy those in a in a particular way. Um but but the the the reality on the ground today and probably for the foreseeable future is that sovereign AI

will involve partnerships with third parties outside of the the country and it's just going to be a matter of managing those relationships. So I mean moving on a little bit into the

nitty-gritty of implementation and this is for you Kate you know talk about how the tools you're developing fit in within the broader ecosystem right and how you mentioned you know there are

open source models and your and your models can be plugged into those or built on those how do you fit in with like the big players who might be seen as perhaps threatening or impinging on a

country's sovereignty. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So we're looking at it from a more frugal and and smaller approach. So when we when I spoke about the minimum viable compute infrastructure, this is exactly

what we're doing. We're looking into how can we deploy micro data centers that can be powered by renewable that support countries hosting just the critical type of data that they have or they consider

critical and and sovereign to themselves. Then we do a lot of work around the data transformation. So most of our countries today still rely on very analog fragmented scattered

ecosystem data ecosystem um and a lot of our countries are still run on paper format. So how do you go about transforming that form that that um that data um digitizing that data structuring

that data so that you have contextualized data pipeline that then can be used to train um or fine-tune local models. From a model standpoint a lot of countries wants to have choices.

So they want to have choices to potentially be able to use global models that are fine-tuned to their context using their data locally or they want to be able to support local ecosystem of

startups developers to train their own model locally as well. So we also look at those two approaches on one side um supporting local ecosystem of startups to build smaller model. You would look

rather than building models that are billions of parameters, you would look at more specialized, highly contextualized models that are deployed for very specific applications, be it in

education or in agriculture, in climate resilience and such. Um and um and that four countries actually um provides an agency uh and choice over really what they want to have or define sovereignty

which is generating value locally and making sure that their developers and their ecosystem is empowered um in this AI economy. You know, when we think about infrastructure, and I'm going to

piggyback a little bit on what Pablo was saying. We look at it in the global south within the next decade, you will have we will add 1.2 billion people to um um who will enter a working age. But

if we don't have infrastructure or if we don't build infrastructure today to support those 1.2 billion people in an AI age, how are we going to support them and um empowering um our economies? And

a lot of countries in our regions today are waking up to this idea because for centuries whether it's our natural resources they've all been exported out of the countries and then shipped back

to us and sold at a premium [snorts] and we about to enter a similar um digital colonialism I will call it um as we're getting into AI because the truth is most of the compute infrastructure sits

outside of our countries today. Africa has le less than 1% of the world's compute capacity for 18% of the population. So there is a balance that needs to really um be achieved and we

can only do that if we look at AI sovereignty and AI infrastructure in a different way than what the global NOS has been trying to push us to. &gt;&gt; Yeah, thank thanks for that. Um Kate, I

wanted to ask you um I mean Natalie, sorry. Kate mentioned something about choice and it seems to me like one of the sort of often implicit ideas here is is creating a more pluralistic diverse

AI ecosystem as a way of maintaining count's choices. So I wanted to ask you because I know you do some work with with offcom where presumably you're looking at competition law and and and

things like that and you know that's certainly one view that you can promote sovereignty through competition and diversity. On the other hand, like I would say that has so often not worked

out for countries because what it leads to is consolidation and and we know that the large companies can come in and monetize data and do loss leading and things like that. So I'm wondering if

you're looking at this from a kind of regulatory lens and you're trying to sort of promote sovereignty. Is it choice and plurality or should countries be throwing their weight behind kind of

national champions the way like the Asian tigers built themselves up back in the the 80s or whenever that was? &gt;&gt; Um thanks cash. I mean this is such a good question. Um, and I don't at all

pretend to have the answers because actually this this gets to the fundamentals of how do you protect consumers and businesses in the marketplace today. The traditional

economic models that we've used like competition exactly as you say arguably won't work in the era of AI sovereignty because you've got oligopies, arguably monopolies in certain areas. So you

can't promote competition in the way that you might have done traditionally using competition law. um some of the mechanisms that we've tried in the past for example sharing of infrastructure u

we've done that in the UK through the sharing of telecom's infrastructure to help drive competition in the marketplace is that realistic um in the AI stack could you imagine a world where

certain companies would be up for sharing some of their infrastructure that's a question so I actually think that in terms of where we go next of protecting consumers and businesses this

is going to be the big economic debate in terms of what models actually work uh for regulation. But there has to be a big injection of reality. I think that's sort of the theme that's coming across

from everything that everyone said. We have to work with the world as it is, not how we hope it will be. And the way that the stack is structured at the moment, and I'm afraid that will

probably be more consolidation, not less. Uh it means there are going to be very few intervention points for government. So they're gonna have to be very very smart about where they choose

and when to try and drive specific outcomes. &gt;&gt; Um how much time do we have left before questions? Like five or six minutes. Yeah. Okay. Um I wanted to drill down

just a little bit on the question of open source because it seems like such an important question um in this and I guess I'd throw the question open well maybe Shashi or or Kate whoever wants to

take it on the role that open source plays in both in the question of sovereignty but also in enabling or possibly inhibiting meaningful and impactful implementations in middle

countries. I'll bring it back to the first theme around geopolitics because from where I'm sitting um we see our countries battling with two sides. On one side um

they're being pushed a lot of technology that's coming close source technology that's coming from the US and on the other side actually in Africa the most widely used models today are actually

the Chinese open source models. So the quen the ki is the deep six of the world. Um so it show it actually shows that um you know you today you can't actually decouple AI from geopolitics or

technology from geopolitics and um open source is playing a large role into enabling communities who historically have been marginalized and haven't had access to um um a lot of the computing

power to be able to train those those large language models um to be able to now basically build for themselves. Um, so a lot of developers we're working with are actually adopting those open

source tools because one is what they have access to and secondly right now they're some of the most performant tools that they can get access in the ecosystem. So even us as a company, we

made the conscious choice that every foundation models that we're training, we're building, we actually releasing them open source because we know that one of the power of our um region is the

smart developers that are already have already been practicing AI and machine learning for decades and they just need access um and they just need empowerment around that technology. So in my opinion

across the global south uh open source will win &gt;&gt; I just to I'm sorry go ahead please. Yeah. So I'll just add one more point. I mean open source is important. Uh but I

think what is also more important is compute at the edge and I think that is probably where you'll see a lot of innovation coming out of India where we will try to optimize AI models for edge

devices. uh and what also becomes very important once you have an edge computing scenario be it laptops be it you know mobile phones and so on is that you have a secure and safe way of

ensuring that the right models are being pushed and that's where I see another innovation that's happening in India called direct to mobile broadcasting or D2M where potentially you could push out

AI models and data sets to these edge devices in a very secure and reliable fashion so that way you know you know that you know there's no you know malicious ious, you know, models going

around and so on. &gt;&gt; Just two last things on on this. Um, just building on the other speakers points. Um, you know, there there kind of two sides to the open model um issue

on on on the input side. Um, roughly 40 of the the model projects, sorry, 40% of the model projects that I've been tracking are built. They're essentially fine-tuning of um models like Llama and

other open source models. Interestingly, by the way, um the more recent ones are really more Quen and other Chinese models. So, Llama seems to be kind of like falling in terms of of popularity.

Um so, that's on the input side. On the output side, roughly 70% of the um model projects uh that I've been tracking are open source, which is fascinating, right? Because these are projects that

have the moniker of sovereignty and yet they are open. Um they are released to the world. And you know to Kate's uh excuse me to Natalie's point about um you know what markets look like um I

think that that might be a predictor of what what's going to happen over time that more and more of these open models get out there you know assuming that they have capacity um you know to

compete with proprietary and more you know and larger models then you know then perhaps that levels the playing field a little bit or gives more choice in in different regions. Um so yeah so

that's what what I'm seeing in the data. Yeah, I'm gonna one last thing I wanted to come to and then I'm going to go open it up. We talked about risk um a little bit before and um I was actually reading

Dario Amade's essay on risk on the flight over I don't know if any of you have had a chance to look at it but so I think like the in this question of sort of like use case and implementation. And

there's a weird thing that's happened with risk in the AI debate, which is that it started off being the only thing that everybody talked about in that kind of like hyped up Silicon Valley

existential risk. And then there was like a reaction to it and then like now we sort of scoff at people that talk about risk. And so this I was thinking as I was reading this essay um about

risk and about our conversation today. And I guess I'm thinking, you know, there's a whole gamut of risk that runs from kind of existential risk to the cyber sort of risk that you're talking

about to just like social and economic disruption risk. Um and the question is sort of are we in focusing a lot on use cases and implementation now are we in danger of overlooking risk and how

should we be thinking about risk within within this framework. &gt;&gt; So I think it's a really good question um at the moment and and you're right there sort of swings and roundabouts

right in terms of how much um attention people play and of course the original AI summit was very much focused on uh safety and security. Um, I think the challenge is that a lot of focus and

attention can go on the the extreme end, the thing that gets everyone really really excited. Um, and actually when you're thinking about AI adoption, the thing that we all want to do is make

sure that our businesses and and consumers are making the most out of AI because we see the economic advantage. But the challenge is from an individual point of view, it's still pretty scary,

right? you're putting all your data out there, you probably don't quite understand what's happening. In the UK, around 28% of the population say that they're sort of comfortable with using

AI, which I think is actually surprisingly high, but of course that means over 70% aren't. Um, and so I think there's a lot of value to focusing on actually what risk feels like from an

individual consumer and user point of view as well as the systemic and of course the global uh risk that sometimes we jump to because that seems a bit more exciting to discuss.

&gt;&gt; Anybody want to say anything about risk before we open it up? &gt;&gt; Just add one perspective right in in India. I think the bigger concern is not so much about uh the risk of existential

issues but more about the divide right because you have the the elite urban segment of the population which is very savvy with technology has the judgment to know you know what to trust AI with

and what not to but then you have a very large part of the population which is not does not have access and you know their understanding of these tools is very limited very shallow very

superficial so that divide to me is the bigger risk from an India standpoint &gt;&gt; so kind of societal risk Yeah. So, um, okay. Thank you all for that. And I'm It's a It's a pretty crowded room. Thank

you all for turning out. Um, and I think we can open it up to some questions. Um, Gordon, do you want me to flag people down? Okay. So, yeah. Do you have a you want to go?

&gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, I just want to ask because there's a lot of people here and limited time. Keep them questions rather than commentary. And as pointed as possible

or as short as possible. Not necessarily pointed. They don't have to be pointed. They don't have to be pointed or sharp. as short as short and focused as possible. Let's put it that way. Yeah.

Right. &gt;&gt; All right. Yeah. Thank you so much for your time. Um so I wanted to ask open anyone on the panel. Um I'm just speeding off my phone here. Um how does

the goal of AI sovereignty deal with the fact that optimal discretionary consumers both at the institutional and everyday person level will choose the best system for them which as it stands

exists dominantly in western economies. uh we know how fast implementation arrives in AI and so I wonder if today's AI companies uh will build these deep data modes with regional economies which

makes it much harder for them to kind of build their own AI uh models or infrastructure later on and then more importantly have consumers that are already integrated and familiar with

these current western dominating models swap off for a domestic competitor like how how do we think about that uh as it stands right now? Anybody want to take this?

&gt;&gt; It's a packed packed question, [laughter] so I'll try to pick on bits and pieces and I don't have a crystal ball, so I can't tell you what's going to happen in the future. Um, but I can

tell you what I'm seeing today. And what I'm seeing today, the truth is a lot of our governments are still doing deals with western models because these right now the most performance, some of the

most performant on the market or they don't have the capacity to fine-tune and train their own. So that's the reality of today. But at the same time, they're waking up to the idea and becoming

conscious of that potential digital colonialism um cycle that might repeat itself. you know WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook are some of the of the widely most widely used applications in our

economy. Yet the economic value of those applications is generated somewhere else and when we talking to government the first thing they're telling us is we know that AI is supposed to add billion

to the economy but how do we do so? Um so they're not now starting to rethink the way they're seeing those global technology partnerships and also looking into how can they demand for those

global models to one invest in the local country or economy but then secondly potentially um go for choose local or regional rather than global. So we seeing that shift already happen and

this is a shift in the mentality of our governments um that is also driving the way the implementation and the diffusion of the models is happening um on the ground locally.

&gt;&gt; Okay. Um yeah the lady then &gt;&gt; um first of all thank you for the panel discussion. So I'm Anushka from IMT Gazabad. I'm doing my MBA. My question is basically that given the disparities

uh in the middle power countries and the smaller countries uh will this uh and especially Pablo made a point about the third parties so uh partners that will be there. So how will you know govern

the sovereignty of these countries? How will the negotiations take place? Will there be a global south block which will uh talk to the western counterparts or will there be uh you know because

smaller countries if they go for negotiating tables they would not get the best of the deal &gt;&gt; uh &gt;&gt; so kind of collaborative type approach

to AI an alliance type approach to sovereignty &gt;&gt; anybody &gt;&gt; yeah no it it's it's a really thoughtprovoking question I'm like

trying to find pen and paper to like figure out like if I can write this as a paper you know in the week or so. Um the look I I'll tell you that there are there are definitely examples of uh

blocks coming blocks of countries coming together um to to to start developing right. Um so for sure bricks is is an example and and and there seems to be a fair amount of of cooperation there. uh

you know there are other examples of like for example like the South Koreans and the Indonesians are are uh cooperating on a Southeast Asian um AI project. Um but I think that like

fundamentally um the the the thing that that I have really kind of uh been watching recently and Kate kind of keeps bringing this up which is that look most of the sovereign AI development is

happening in Europe uh you know Middle East um Asia uh and again I'll mention that that India is you know is a major major source of of of sovereign AI projects Africa is way way behind. Uh

there is basically I mean there's very very little um happening um there. Uh a little bit more in in the Americas throughout Latin America. Um but but I think that that you know as we think

about these kind of um you know kind of collections of countries perhaps there might be an opportunity in places like Africa to to do that where where there is clearly clear I mean the data shows

that there is a need there. Um the lady behind that you Yeah. &gt;&gt; U very good afternoon to all of you and thank you for this insightful

discussion. Uh being a corporate lawyer I am very much into competition law. So when you said that sovereignity can be achieved with the uh you know competition law. My very simple question

is like we all know that AI models work independently and at the same pace with all the countries. So as far as AI is concerned. So with respect to competition law can we have a harmony or

a common or a universal law applicable to all the countries despite we waste our time in inculcating and accommodating in each law because as far as I know you know India is only two

decades old with respect to competition law. it passed in 2003. So can we have an harmonization at least in this concern? &gt;&gt; I think this is

&gt;&gt; Thank you. Um I mean firstly uh just clarify that uh unfortunately I don't think we're in the place where competition law can solve all of these problems but you raise a really

interesting question. What what is the mechanism we can use to achieve the outcomes that we think we need in this space? Um, and for Ofcom, the UK's communications regulator, our approach

actually has been to be techn technologically neutral. So, we do not regulate AI. We regulate for the outcomes that AI AI might be driving. Um, so fairness, transparency, etc.,

etc. Um, and personally I think that's where we will have to go more and more because the technology is moving so fast there's no way that the legislative process can keep up. And obviously there

are examples um in in Europe uh where we've had similar challenges. Um your second part of the question around sort of global harmonization uh the track record for any of this is

is is not great. Um, and again, I think a bureaucratic response quite often misunderstands how this technology is revolutionizing day-to-day interactions, let alone uh global interactions. Um, so

at least from our point of view, increasingly our emphasis is on outcomes because the outcomes we want for society are still pretty much the same. You know, back um to the excellent point

Shashi was making in terms of we want a more equal society. We don't want a less equal society. So how can you approach regulation of the um outcomes in that way taking account of technology but not

being too prescriptive? I &gt;&gt; I want to just ask a a clarifying question there because one of the the things that comes up a lot a lot in sort of discussion of regulation and

competition with technology is the difference between Xanti and X post X postregulation and that X anti-regulation is quite dangerous and can stifle innovation. So when you talk

about outcomebased regulation, do you see that as postregulation or do you see it as how how do you see that? &gt;&gt; So as much as possible, we are trying to flex and adapt. Um because I don't think

you can be too prescriptive, right? Um uh and so back to the earlier point about none of us have a a crystal ball. Um so instead what we're trying to do is create for example sandboxes. So you

might have individual innovation licenses to tackle specific problems because then you don't have to either define Xanti or or XPOST too prescriptively. Um but more often than

not I think actually the biggest challenge for a regulator is is not where you sit on the legal spectrum but actually trying to identify the problems you're trying to solve. And you need

industry to come to you and say we would like to do this but we're not quite sure how you're going to feel about it. How can we have a conversation which is not going to feel like a legal conversation

but one where we can work together on the outcomes that we want to achieve and that kind of trusted conversation is where I think regulators need to be more and more.

&gt;&gt; Thanks. &gt;&gt; So everyone I'm an independent researcher working on like AI policy and one of the things that we're looking into is the possibility for middle

powers to collaborate on building sort of shared compute infrastructure. uh what are your thoughts generally as a panel on the idea and its viability especially you know maybe picking up on

earlier comments that you made about the relationship with hyperscalers uh can a regional block have better bargaining power perhaps right &gt;&gt; so there there are examples of this

right uh so the European Union right now is uh is building compute capacity throughout um uh throughout the continent um uh India is another example of uh you know kind of common compute

right where where essentially kind of like they're bringing together resources to um you know to deploy in a strategic way um you know kind of depending on on uh you know nonprofits or research

institutions or not or or startups and and I I guess and I would say that there are there are plenty of models that exist right now Canada is another example they're they're they're doing

this um these have started I think the question is you know have we seen enough to know whether there's going to be success and I just don't I we're we're just getting started. So, we should have

this conversation maybe a year from now or, you know, 18 months from now because right now it's it's too I think it's too soon to tell. &gt;&gt; I I also um want to just say we have

somebody in the back here Josh Tan who is leading who's doing a lot of really interesting work in this regard in Europe in particular. So you could talk to him and I I also like within this

paradigm there's different models emerging and I think correct me if I'm wrong but India's model of not necessarily building the dedicated compute but buying compute and

fractional time is a very uh interesting one. &gt;&gt; So I think the what the India AI mission has done is they've empanled the hyperscalers with certain compute

capacity at a certain price point and then they've you know selected startups and researchers who want you know who are applied for this compute capacity and they've been you know giving it to

them. So that's one model. Uh since collaboration came up in two questions, I wanted to give one more example of collaboration which is of a slightly different kind on uh in the area of edge

uh you know intelligence and direct to mobile D2M where you have a standard which was built in the US ATSC3. You have a chip which was designed in India by Sanka Labs and you have one of the

biggest markets in Latin America in Brazil now you know adopting the standard. So there's a different kind of collaboration that's happening around edge AI which will I think something

again we can look at six months down the road. &gt;&gt; That's great. Um yep &gt;&gt; back to the blue shirt. &gt;&gt; Hi um

&gt;&gt; I think you said blue shirt right. &gt;&gt; All right. Thank you for the wonderful discussion. So my question is that in the pursuit of the third way, how do we distinguish

between the strategic partnership versus structural dependency especially given the fact that most of the frontier models that are coming up are owned by foreign entities which are private ones.

&gt;&gt; Yeah. So Microsoft and Open AI probably feel the same way, right? [laughter] How do you who wants to take that? strategy strategy partnership versus a dependent dependency relationship.

&gt;&gt; That is a tough question. [laughter] again it depends on um I guess the outcomes you're trying to create for your country right um the truth is today most of our countries don't have the

choice but uh to rely on structural dependencies. Um so I was talking about the uh statistics about the compute in Africa less than 1% which means all our data is processed on a cloud somewhere

else um in in US China or in Europe um so that's the reality today but then um how do we move into a place where we lessen or I think it's about the question of risk and resilience right we

build more resilience um locally we try to edge against the global risks especially around geopolitics because if tomorrow um more regulations comes in like the US cloud act that says that

basically um any uh US cloud software that you're using as part of your stack is can be open um by any US intelligence agency or the US government if there is tomorrow more restrictions around more

export control restrictions in certain countries all countries will be the one who will pay the price um so the question is how do we lessen our dependency on on those structural on

those structural um realities and but also how do we start building locally and I think going back to the collaboration um approach we actually seeing this

happening in Africa as well because a lot of our countries don't even have the necessary energy to power a lot of that infrastructure so you have echoas for example which is the west African region

composed of Nigeria Togo Benin a couple of other countries like Kivoir who are now trying to pull resources to build regional infrastructure. So you would have hub and spoke where you would have

a larger infrastructure that could be in a country that has abundant of abundance of energy which will be funded by everybody else but then you also have smaller compute in country that can

guarantee the sovereignty and the residency of the data. So we're seeing those models kind of now um emerging and it will take a couple of years for them to materialize. But this these are steps

that are being taken to low lessen our dependency on on larger um scale infrastructure. &gt;&gt; Um yeah,

&gt;&gt; thank you. I know I'm running out of time. This question is specifically for Kate. You contrasted um technology in Africa being pushed by the global north but in contrast uh Chinese models

enjoying popularity. Could you speak more on what aspects of China's LLMs or AI stack uh the global south finds very attractive? Thank you. &gt;&gt; I'll be very brief. There are two

aspects and these are very simple. The first one is that they're open source um and not closed source. So a lot what's less known is that Africa is a large population of developers that is that

are very savvy. Um if you look at years back the tiny machine learning movement that look at edge computing and moving intelligence closer to where the data is collected. Kenya was actually the third

largest chapter in the world after US and Europe. So you had a lot of developers who could only get access to like ARM based um compute platform who started building edge model edge models

basically running on smaller um compute um um um infrastructure. So open source is key because open source provide access so developers want to be able to you know cook their own food per se. Um

and then the second one is performance. If you look at performance benchmarks today, a lot of the top models are actually Chinese models, including Quen. Um, so when developers look at access

and performance, the choice is quickly made. That's why they've been choosing Chinese um models today. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, when Llama kind of or when Meta stopped kind of focusing on this,

um, that really gave Chinese models an opportunity. &gt;&gt; Um, yeah, the the gentleman in the back, you Yep. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Uh my name is Arjun Sendal

and I'm a student at the Indian School of Public Policy. uh so I've come across the word sovereignty into context that is the national context which attracts the bulk of the attention in popular

discourse and then there's the individual context individual sovereignty and I think this is something that Natalie touched on a little bit where I as the individual end

user have the agency and the tools to decide how exposed I am to these different AI platforms models whether they are foreign or domestic. Uh, so shouldn't this be our ultimate

objective? Wouldn't by addressing individual sovereignty, wouldn't we ultimately address national sovereignty? I mean, if I can control how exposed I am to these models as a individual user,

wouldn't my country be secured as well? &gt;&gt; Yeah. You want to take that? That's a great question. The the individual agency. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it's it's such a good question. Um

from the point of view of the individual, I think one of the most interesting debates at the moment is obviously a AI agents and the extent to which um individuals will be informed

enough to understand how their their own decision- making is being influenced in time by the agents and to what extent you might see some discrimination of individuals um through the fact that

they have um devoid a lot of agency to their AI agents. Um the challenge is and this has been the history of foreign policy forever. Cumulative

um uh work on individuals points of views doesn't necessarily work at a maximist level in terms of what's in the best interest for a country. And I think that's probably something we haven't

even started to think about. I'm sure it will come out over the next couple of days, but it's not necessarily a given that what's right for an individual is right for the country or vice versa. Um,

and that's where the debate will need to go. &gt;&gt; Um, yes. &gt;&gt; Thank you. A lot of value actually gets created by the business applications. We

are really looking at the large like Kate you reflected on that and in for business applications you really have to build local models using local data local problems local uh you know

modalities like u you know you talked about so would that make the entire case for sovereignity irrelevant if you actually start building business applications rather than focusing on the

existing popular B2C models &gt;&gt; so yeah thanks for bringing the focus back to this is the implementation question to some extent um who anybody want to take that

&gt;&gt; I I can add a very brief comment that uh you know there are large number of public use cases and defense right so those are not the same as your business use cases so you will still need

sovereignity I don't think you know solving for business will solve for you know national security or for any of the public services &gt;&gt; healthare for example you know healthare

issues localics Um, you want No, I mean I Yeah, I I would just say that healthcare actually seems like one of those areas where so because of the sensitivity of the data

sovereignty actually becomes a big issue but but I I take your point that maybe more focus top of the stack um would would be a good interesting way to go in this conversation. So um I think we can

do a couple more questions there. &gt;&gt; Okay. Yep. &gt;&gt; I don't I sorry I can't &gt;&gt; we are generally pointing to a lady in the back

&gt;&gt; from my from my seat but &gt;&gt; if you're a lady in the back please uh &gt;&gt; okay uh thank you so much I am from Anoha Parika Institute for defense studies and

analysis. So a lot this question is coming a little bit from that defense military background of mine. Um a a significant problem that we face in terms of discussion uh regarding global

regulation is the uh is the question of halves and have nots that often comes with it that uh once you have regulation there there's a certain amount of exclusionary behavior that happens

especially with the global south. So my question because uh regulation and the approach to regulation was discussed here. My question is how do you see specifically in the current geopolitical

environment and given the history of regulations that we have seen so far how do you see uh AI regulation is supposed to shape up uh given the discussion we are having thank you

&gt;&gt; okay I'm told that despite that clock in the back our time is actually up so we have to answer this really quickly &gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; you can do a little better than that

&gt;&gt; okay I'm sorry apparently Apparently, we're out of time because the next session has to come in, right? Okay. Thank you all for being here today. Thank you for to the panelists, all your

respective time zones. [applause]
