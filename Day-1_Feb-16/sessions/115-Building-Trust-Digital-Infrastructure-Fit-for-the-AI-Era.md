## 📝 Summary

AI is reshaping how sovereignty is understood for individuals, communities, and nations. While governments played a major role in building the early internet, private actors have also shaped the digital economy. Today, AI development is largely led by the private sector, raising questions about how to align innovation with broader societal goals. This panel will explore how to build trustworthy infrastructure through public-private alignment and governance approaches that prioritize users and accountability. Key takeaways will be distilled across international policy platforms.
