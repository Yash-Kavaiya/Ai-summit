## 📝 Transcript

the last mile connectivity is concerned that is a huge concern and uh there is still thought processes that are going on and I don't think there is a readym made solution as of now I must admit

that but uh you have raised a very important point and for ashas we are trying to give them tablets and we are holding hackathons and we are holding you know competitions amongst youngsters

startups who are trying to create models which will suit specifically say Asha because you know these are very very specific needs. So after the need assessment has been carried out we are

we are throwing open a competition and we are asking the public and the youngster startups to come with solutions and then we would look at it and then adopt it but not any one size

fits all. So thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank thanks a lot. So as a conclusion, professor you said the evening we really wanted to hear the panelist I'd like to [clears throat] bring back

thank you very much first of all I will say that I'm not expert in the health on the other hand mentioned that even the population don't

even recognize and speak about health system. I think

we know that we need to go up and there we have to see that very good learning about

we are studying what we are talking to information. We have like more than 156

We finet Cooperation with global countries is noted anticipated. There's no use of reinventing the

missing already. So that is why And if it sits down, people get to know more about it, they start using it and they work on it. So

you know uh we are working uh as we started it was about all about transcending the language barrier but uh as we move forward it is now a situation where we are bridging the digital divide

bridging the literacy divide because we are using voice as a medium uh you know uh people are using for increasing productivity again because voice is there and then obviously the language

barrier anyway is gone. Today we operate this uh for uh means we touch every citizen in the of the country through our partnerships like UIDI. We touch every village and panchayat uh through

our partnership with ministry of panchiati raj and we do about 15 to 18 million inferences a day which is uh uh that means 15 to 18 million times. Our system is requested for a translation

uh there and almost uh 100 million a week or 400 million a month and we are growing at a rate of approximately 15 to 20% month on month. Uh that means uh there are there was a latent need for

this kind of a system and uh one of the reasons why we are able to pick up or work with most of the customers is our commitment to look at continuous improvement and look at how do we

actually build this entire system together with the stakeholders and the community. We feel that every end user is a contributor as well. He can things that's happening in India. So

thank you Amitab. Um I think Mit you had you needed a second convert it into a momentto Okay. So, like they say, break your bath. [laughter]

We'll we'll get to the next uh uh question that I had. So, I think Amitab, you talked a little bit about the voice uh AI technology being critical. So, I'm going to go to Santosh a little bit. Um

in terms of uh what do you see in terms of speech technology and its reach uh for truly population scale? uh what what is it that you're seeing uh you know progress wise what are you seeing

challenges wise &gt;&gt; yeah I think first of all I mean so far many people used to think that voice is just a convenience I mean we have built these great technology systems which are

available to people lot of apps u government private apps have been built they used to support English and then we added languages but still we thought that adding few more languages to apps

may be sufficient but how many people actually know I mean India still has 300 million people using feature phones there are much bigger number of the people who are digitally

like Amitab was also saying digitally not literate they can forward things on WhatsApp they can watch videos on YouTube but they can't really interact with these apps right definitely ask and

I'm a Cindi if you ask me do you know how to type in Cindi mobile phone no I don't right it's not I don't even know that feature how easy it is or not. So um and that is where the voice and

language becomes very very crucial right I mean voice is probably the oldest technology that we have I mean voice is how people connect to each other um in their own language in their native

language so it's u for technology to be truly inclusive it shouldn't be harder for people to adopt it by making people learn new thing in typing or using smartphones and

know understand how these these buttons operate we are actually not necessarily including everyone we are um it's it's not just inconvenience it's an exclusion of know people

um and same goes for AI also I mean globally there are about 7,000 spoken languages in India alone we have about 100 plus spoken languages uh but if you ask me how many these how

many of these languages are there on the AI map I'm sure they are in hundreds right not even thousands so there are a lot of languages which are not in AI I map um in last couple of years I think

so obviously we need to accelerate the not just in India and global south I think in African nations everywhere to bring these languages onto AI map which means the LLMs that we are building

shouldn't just understand few languages they should be able to understand any languages the there needs to be urgency of building these voice models which can understand not necessarily

22 official languages of India but every other language of India and India is a unique place just like I think south global south also for every language we have so many dialects the same Hindi

that we speak in Delhi is very different than in Lucknau than in no uh Bihar so how can AI understand all these languages uh like Amitab said I mean there's a lot

of work already happening uh on language side but I think there's an urgency and criticality to accelerate that work on the language side. Um and good news is the technology is evolving faster than

we anticipated and it's moving very very fast. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Absolutely. Thank you Sant. Thank you. Um I'm going to go to Vijay a little bit in terms of um so obviously

language technology is supposed to bridge the divide uh amongst the halves and the have nots. Um do you see this happening in particular sectors or is it something that you're seeing you know

broadly across multiple sectors? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Um the Gates Foundation plays the role of a convenor. So we've been looking at making lessons learned in India apply to

Africa. The same going the other way. Um some of the work we've done so far. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Some of the work we've been doing so far is in um training data. It's more fundamental. It's not sector specific

work. Uh it's been uh taking African languages and creating very high quality training data. So you could bring the word word error rates down under 10%. Um some of the uh languages we tested with

with 200 hours of uh high quality data you could get it to that error rate. So, so our work has been primarily more fundamental, not sector specific. That said, um one of the initiatives uh that

we supported kurbo in Rwanda is to make um voice- based access to government services. There's 240 services that would normally be available to someone that's literate and through by building

voice-based capabilities now it's available to a lot more and the costs come down substantially. That's one which is about government service delivery.

Uh the other one is um I would say in health uh it's another project in Rwanda called Horizon 1000. Uh it's just getting started. We've we've kicked off some pilots and that

one is about primary healthcare and that has a voice and chatbot component too. So as um Santos was saying it's no longer we need to do voice it's not a nice to have. It's it's a core offering

and this is how we deliver u inclusive solutions. &gt;&gt; Thanks. Thank you. Uh Chennai, I'm going to come to you because obviously like I mentioned earlier in your introduction.

So you there's a lot of focus on research on your side as well. So I wanted to ask you uh how do you see the translation from research to production systems and what is your experience with

that? &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. So firstly I'll start by saying it's good to be back in Delhi. I actually studied at JNU University a couple of years ago. So it feels like a

[clears throat] full circle moment to come talk about languages here. Um so what we've seen so as Masakane what we existed we exist as is a community of practitioners interested in research and

trying to then see how that research that we do but not just research is where we started from now we are investing into the ecosystem looking at the creation of data sets um and the

governance around that data because that's quite critical as well as enabling the ecosystem through understanding research for innovation and benchmarking um and then as all

innov ation itself. So particularly looking at from research to practical use. One of the key things that we actually just closed as a request for proposals was trying to understand how

we benchmark this work and then how it can be applied because the biggest issue is that um some of these innovations as mentioned you can't have a system that only represents the national 22 national

languages. People speak a whole lot more. So which means that when some of these models or technologies are introduced into different context they don't work

and particularly [clears throat and cough] particularly for global majority countries because their technologies we are often c playing catch-up or left behind in the

innovation. So this is part of our purpose then of saying how do we evaluate the models that are out there? How do we create a systematic standard that everyone can then assess to see

this is what works within a context of diversity and cultural nuance and difference? Because that I think is often times what is the um beautiful part of global majority context is that

like what was being mentioned um soil spoken in Kenya in in Nairobi is not the same as sahili spoken in uh Tanzania because they actually grow up learning to speak that. So that is the essence of

this work when we think about from research to practice and then also kind of like as Masakany one of our core pieces of work is actually to connect with the tech entrepreneurs on the

continent. A lot of innovation um on the continent is actually driven by tech entrepreneurs in addition to the standard um big tech companies. So the question really becomes how do you

ensure that what you're creating in terms of is it high quality enough to be able to go to market um and also thinking about what is the business case that we often have to make with

entrepreneurs. I was in a conversation with an entrepreneur who was building um a a voice solution for lawyers and they were like I don't see the value of building for African languages and this

is was someone from I think they were from Kenya. So we were actually then having a conversation with them to actually show that the value of work as particularly that it's already been done

in India for example. So citing Bashi to actually then say there is a value in actually being proactive in ensuring that African languages are represented in the product you take to market and

then this is the importance of connecting to the researchers so that the work is not done in siloed efforts. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. That's an excellent perspective. Thank you Amitab. I'm going

to come back to you with a question. Um so the two questions actually I have because Bash has been doing a lot of work in this area. Uh are you seeing particular sectors where the adoption is

more is the impact more in certain sectors or domains like agriculture or education or where are you seeing the proliferation of this technology? And the second thing is this is an important

question only because of the experience you have. What remains stubbornly difficult? Okay. So what remains difficult is a very long list of things actually and uh

although we have progressed a long way uh with obvious Santosh we are working on uh Mah Mahavista which is actually giving you know lang you know voice advice to the farmers in Marati. The

complete journey is voice enabled but then uh obviously the challenges remain uh the challenges remain in multiple areas. Uh one is that you still do not have the digital dictionary of the

country. There are lot of words which are not known in the native language to the digital systems. It includes even the names of places because uh when we worked with ministry of panchiat we got

270,000 panchiatas onto the delta systems but when we talk to survey of India they also do not have they have they say that there is about 16 to 18 lakh places which they want to digitize

into the system. Those are the number of places which are there you know either it is a kaspa or a suba or whatever it is basically not there in digital systems and that is something which we

are working upon. So that's one area. Emotions is another area and emotional rendering of voice is uh also changes the meaning. And uh there are some languages like miso or uh or kasi you

know those are more or less phonetic languages. Same words mean multiple things spoken differently. So that's another uh area of challenge. So there are multiple issues which are there and

those are to be sorted out over a period of time as the technology progresses but what we have you know you we are quite encouraged to see that option that's the brighter side of it because

it's delivering value right and uh social sector because of its very nature that it is uh you know the service delivery and governance can actually happen at the last

is the biggest uptake for that. So sometimes the systems are pushed that means it is from the governance and service delivery angle. Sometimes the systems are actually adopted because

it's giving certain actionables to the people as far as information is concerned to help the person. So you know uh social sector happens to be uh agriculture, education, health. These

are the sectors which actually need that because of their very nature and also you know uh because there are there is information available which can be delivered but obviously

uh you know taking it to information delivery or service delivery or governance to actionable impact will take some time because we still need to be uh getting very familiar with one of

the very important things in voices about dialects. You know as she said that every there can language can be same but it can be spoken in different ways by different people and sometimes

it also different differentiates between one person to another person. So that's another uh challenge which we have but uh whatever results which we are seeing is exciting and it should prompt the

researchers and all of us to do more work in that area and ensure that you know uh we are living in better tomorrow because when we we had recently you know uh were in some of the you know district

areas and AP for example in Copam or Aco Valley and we you know we were running these systems because people were speaking in English and uh only two people understand English in the entire

district you the collector and his uh assistant rest of the all people understand Telu and the only way to survive there is to have a language bridge and fortunately the person which

we whom we had sent he was a Malali so he didn't have any of the background so he was using the app to actually communicate so it's important when we look at uh uh when we of course sit at a

metro we find that it is a cosmopolitan and we switch over languages as soon as we see there is objection or there's a non-understanding from other side but uh 100 kilometers from here the world is

different and uh there's lot of divide &gt;&gt; absolutely thank you China I'm going to come to you for a follow-up question so Amitab talked about some of the challenges from an India standpoint

Africa has got infrastructure challenges too so can you kind of elaborate on what is it that uh you know you you see from that standpoint? &gt;&gt; Thanks so much. Um so thinking about the

challenges across the continent, one of the key things will always come at from an infrastructure of resourcing around compute. So do people have enough compute and if they do have it how well

is it used? But in addition to that there are legacy issues that are consistent when it comes to connectivity on the content anyway. So I think um a point was IA mentioned about people

having access to feature phones. So there is still that reality that people are still connected to um you know like feature phones or at least lower-end smartphones because there's an

affordability aspect to it. What which device can they um afford? And we specifically talk about phones because people's first access to a digital device is it is a mobile phone. Not a

computer, not a laptop, but the mobile phone that they have. And then secondly, you're also looking at issues around electricity. So actual access to the power to power the models that you're

going to be building, the technology you have. So that's a key issue in terms of then um needing that infrastructural intervention beyond even if if you build the greatest data set and the greatest

model, if there's no power to run it, there's no power to run it. Um and then also just really thinking about we've been having conversations about capacity. Can people actually um do we

have the skill set on the continent? I think we do have it but we're always also faced with the reality of brain drain and people traveling and leaving the continent. Um and then I think

lastly in terms of thinking about an infrastructure challenge and again I will take this to being about to market is then the adoption of the services that are created in people's languages

and this is determined by I think at a national level if a country already has that type of policy in place. So coming from South Africa, the government recognizes 11 um Africa 11 languages um

across the contin across the country and they have launched um digital services through digital public infrastructure work where they do recognize those languages. Then the question becomes to

what extent then do are people creating tools and resources not just for information giving but also knowledge exchange because a lot of the times then that is the question of you can be told

what to do but can you actually interact with the platform in your own chosen language. So that again is one of the um connecting the infrastructure issues to the end use and to the market. So those

are some of the um challenges we face but I think most critical which I had almost forgotten is also high quality data. So we have seen earlier investments that were done um Gates

Foundation GIZ where then we have seen languages such as Kisohili and Kenya Rwanda and Luganda move from being low resourced languages to at least well resourced languages. So there's quite a

number of data sets you can find there but there are over 2,000 languages on the continent. And so then that's just like a drop in the ocean of what is there. So then there is that need of

actually creating highquality data sets that allow for people to actually build on top of them to have that foundational basis. So those are some of the core issues that we face um across the

continent and they always have to be placed in context dependent on what is the actual national drive for this for these interventions to take place. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Thank you Shanai. Thank you.

Now Vij which I'm going to come back to you. I think from a Gates Foundation perspective obviously you're looking globally now you're looking at Africa you're looking at Southeast Asia looking

at India you're looking at you know different parts of the world. How do you prioritize what you actually want to focus on? It's a hard question. Um I mean there's

7,000 languages and uh I think over 80% are spoken by less than 100,000 people. So it is hard to go after all the languages. I think there's a a bread first approach and a depth first

approach depending on what you're pursuing on the broader side is multilingual models that can address multiple languages in one shot. Those are the kinds of like collecting

training data. Um that's one approach where you address multiple languages in one one shot. On the depth first it's more sector specific use cases like the integrated government service in Rwanda

um or the agriculture services that we work on in India where you go deep and uh address them. So um we we are as a convenor we're more use case driven uh we work with the uh what the needs are

and it's not a language first approach but more a use case first approach and the languages come so if we're working in uh Nigeria you know uh we would choose the languages that are most

spoken in that area if it's a like an agriculture advisory uh for for a government service you would choose the most spoken language and target that Fair enough. Fair enough. Santo, I'm

going to come back to you with a question for low resource languages in India. I know that you're working on some low resource languages currently and you're trying to kind of create

something that will happen for uh you know remote areas, remote languages etc. Can you talk a little bit about that? &gt;&gt; Sure. Um so yeah I think and like everyone in the panel is saying the

um getting all the languages included is so critical right for AI systems to work and to be inclusive uh for the last mile population and u we recently I mean actually did a

project uh along with government of Maharashtra and agree it's called Mahavistar AI and one of the I think showcase project to uh in the AI u the Mahavistar app already has been

downloaded by about 25 lakhs downloads have happened. some u 15 lakh AI queries have been done some five lakh AI interactions and this is entirely built in Marati for Marati right

um this been a journey of last five six month obviously there are a lot of partners who came together to build it but then we got a call from the one of the district collectors I mean in fact

government mahan nandurbar is saying in my district there are three languages tribal languages are spoken and bi is among one of them and can Mahavisttar agree app support Py

said okay uh it's not even a 22 one of the 22 official languages spoken by less than I mean 1 cr people and across Gujarat Maharashtra Rajasthan and she says whatever support is needed I'm

going to know bring it onto the table but u I want this language to be part of the Maharashtra agree and that's when the journey started and u there were partners ers like Karya I think Bhashni

Amitab's team AI for Bharat uh everyone came together with a mission that can we bring the PI language onto an AI map right and it's been a journey of just last 6 to 8 weeks not months

um with the support of the local administration we got lot of local community people who came together to um what we call donate their data or the voices to be part of the community right

it's not a trivial task by the way to bring a low resource language onto AI map you need to have a lot of data collection exercise and a data collection has to be in a certain way

you have to have a spoken speech spontaneous speech you need to have a translation bi also doesn't have an independent script so it relies on the dvag script or the other scripts so you

needed a translation um from bil to marati or bili to English you needed somebody who could speak pely somebody who could read pil and then whence translated verified provided uh

it's a hard job right and uh you require typically it takes a year or longer for bringing a language to an AI map but with the support of the local administration and the teams like Kia

Bashni we were able to know do this job uh in less than 6 week and and what we are also saying is it's not just about one language uh bringing onto an AI map can we create a template that can be

used for bringing all the other low resource language not just for India but even for global south I think we're talking about 11 languages official languages in South

Africa alone so can this be a template uh to collect data annotate data which is the hardest part by the way build models and then integrate into applications

u it's not just if you build a model the job doesn't end there you need to also be able to apply into a real use case and what we are trying to do is to bring it into a Mahavistar Agree app so that

people in Nandhurbad district or in Gujarat they could interact with this agree bot and get their local farming uh advice. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Thank you Sto Amitita. One

question for you. Uh there's a lot of talk about data security and data privacy. uh what is your perspective on how do we adhere to those norms that are nationally mandated and how do you see

this going forward? &gt;&gt; Yeah, this uh you know currently to of course you know uh we have a DPDP act in India and we are supposed to abide by that and we are abiding by that but uh

this will become a big challenge as we go by because as the systems will use voice and uh voice being attached to a person and becoming a personal information. It

would be a there would be a way we should be looking at to handle this particular situation. Now uh currently of course when we are looking at data contribution by on voice we are looking

for a consent from the people who can actually say that you know this data can be used for training purposes. But when the users actually come to the system and they start using it and specifically

for the system which are quote unquote free of charge then there is a obvious risk that the data is actually going into the system and is being used for the purpose which is not it's supposed

to be. It becomes very also more difficult when you're looking at kind of health data. Right? Health data is something which you are uh giving means normal health data as well as voice when

you are putting your voice into it. Uh means you are consenting to give the data to the doctor for a purpose which is treatment but should it be used for AI model is not for which you are giving

the consent. So now there's a second dimension. The first dimension was that you're giving the data that is a consent but the purpose has also got to be defined and if the purpose is uh to

train the AI model perhaps a consent has to be taken for that also then when we are looking at uh the you know perhaps the granularity will again come into picture because uh you want to perhaps

give the data to do it but do certain activities but it should be a portion of data not the you know not not the complete data. So I think there would be complexities which will start coming in

over a period of time and uh we would have to basically just as AI you know when the technology progresses you don't have uh you may perhap perhaps will not be able to think of all the things you

know there are known unknowns and there are unknown unknowns which will keep unfolding over a period of time and we would have to handle them as they come by but the uh thing which we have

currently adopted is to ensure that we start we keep ourselves on opensource domain. So it helps in two things. It is we are socially auditable. So that's one good part. So somebody wants to raise an

objection that can be uh taken up. Second is it also ensures that we compete with ourselves because to stay relevant you know you already have put out what you know so you have to stay

relevant so you have to do better than what you're doing otherwise shelf life of any AI system is about 6 months or so so some way we have to find mechanisms

which is uh which is easily monitorable or whatever otherwise we are going to be in a situation where we are continuously looking picking up nitty-g gritties and trying to solve them rather than looking

at the technology development which perhaps would be far more has has a very fast pace today. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Absolutely. Mij I'm going to come to you because I mean we talked

about this earlier. Um I think uh you had this whole debate about whether we use the global models that AI companies offer versus sovereign models created in countries. your thoughts on you know

what is what is your viewpoint on that? &gt;&gt; Um I think I would point back to the uh the actual use case. Um how quickly do you want to get it to market? What are the economics of it? Um and sovereignty

how how important is that? So that would determine whether you go build the model yourself or you use one of the off offthe-shelf ones. Um I think uh longer term building your own is is the better

way to go. Um and may I piggy back on what Amitab Gi said um one of the things in the health sector is that voice is always considered identifiable data phi. So um um federated approaches have been

a solution that has been widely used where the model travels to the data and you learn from it but the actual data never is made available um to the users of the data. So um I think there's some

precedent in the health sector that can be broadly used for voice solutions. &gt;&gt; Fair enough. Fair enough. Chai I'm going to come back to you with one question. So we talked about uh the differences

between what India is doing, what Africa is doing etc. What's your how do we create a south south dialogue to make this faster? How do we accelerate the process of benefiting wholesome uh you

know across the sector? &gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely. Thank you for that. Um so one of the core things we always talk about is actually breaking down the silos and the fragmentation. So how we

do this is uh as we gather in this room so at least you know people are connecting people are learning about masakane. Masakany actually means to build together uh loosely translated

from Isisulu. So we live that way. Um so we are often in conversations actually with partners from um speaking to course speaking to um I think carrier and then also facilitated by our funding partners

but it's not just thinking it's thinking about south collaborations from those who have created in Southeast Asia from those who've created in India from those who created in Latin America and finding

the similarities um in the issues that are there so we often try to engage at firstly that research level. So um co-creation of knowledge but also engaging um in spaces of actually

[snorts] creating the solutions. So um working in spaces where they're collaborators the tech entrepreneurs we bring them together. Quite recently we were we supported a conference called um

African machine learning days. It's comes out of the um students from Tunisia based in Switzerland. So it actually did bring together and it was held in South Africa. So that's already

three different um countries coming together. But in those spaces what they managed to do is also bring in multistakeholders even from the private sector big tech um like when I say big

tech I mean Google um into the conversation and what that actually created was an avenue for young people to have because Africa is quite a youthful continent. So whenever I talk

about collaboration, I'm starting from how do I ensure that young people actually do have access to these spaces. And the critical questions they were asking was if I build my model, can I

actually then be able to make money out of it? And so then to have someone in the room who can actually give an example of how they can build up that scaling for purposeful impact is quite

important. So I think the south south collaboration and this is our call from masakane comes in thinking about what is the practicality of impact and how do we ensure that we do not repeat um the same

mistakes or the same areas that other people faced before. Of course they have to be nuanced into context. We're not all the same but there are lessons that we can learn particularly thinking about

privacy and data protection. That's a significant issue everywhere. So um as VJ mentioned we can look to health. That means that we don't have to recreate the wheel. We can actually look at to what

others have done. And that's only possible if people are also connecting with us as Masakane and our role in enabling the ecosystem. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. And this summit is a good

way to actually start that dialogue. Yeah. Thanks. Uh I've got uh very little time so I'm going to take two questions. Yeah. Go ahead. The lady first. Yeah. spoken together.

So we work with Microsoft and is one of the states where we work. So, so basically what one of our biggest challenge of building the model and also from the research perspective has been

the lack of even the digital dictionary of exact kind of words and even very specific word doesn't have a digital or medical terminology.

the beneficiaries out. So how how are we even that same thing we face in Rajasthan? So how are we looking at solving this problem in terms of bringap?

&gt;&gt; Yeah. So anybody in particular u &gt;&gt; okay so maybe I'll take a stab at it. So uh I think one of the things that we found was for example agree terms in Maharashtra were not some things that

were the same across. So we actually have started using glosseries up front in terms of saying XYZ mean the same thing kind of the you know framework. So that's one way to do this to essentially

translate it up front before you actually feed it to a model. But I left any other person in the panel actually. &gt;&gt; So I think [clears throat] I mean this is a real problem and that having the

right glossery uh vertical glossery as well as the language glossery. It's not like uh Amitab also said that uh this doesn't always exist right in terms of uh and there's no easy answer but I

think the the best possible way is to work with the local administration the department if you're working with healthare then the uh the local healthare department would be the best

place to create a glossy if it doesn't exist or validate a glossy to say yes it makes sense if it is spoken like that rather than and then for that also you need lot of uh linguistic expert which

again the department can bring in they have access to the school teachers, professors, the linguistic expert. So the best way that we have found out working for us is to work with the local

uh state governments and their corresponding departments. &gt;&gt; So one of the very high value uh you know challenge which is there which has got a very high interestic value is land

records. you know it's an example where every state has its own terminology for the same thing and uh there's no other way but to you know ensure that uh these departments start preparing the

glosseries and uh fortunately for us that we have been able to create that momentum the land records glossery has been prepared and it would soon get digitized so that you are in a position

to actually you know inter be interoperable as far as land records are concerned Same is the case with uh the food grains and other things. There are

terminologies which are mismatching. So uh yes you know there is an active work which is going on in the government and the departments to build those glosseries which will actually help us

take out these anomalies and if required you know the experts can sit and say that key what should be the case you know we are doing that for uh auditor's office we're doing that for multiple

places as of now of course we are not doing it because we are not experts we work we are experts in technology But we have currently we I think that you know uh every state would have perhaps a

million words which has to be digitized right and every line ministry would have approximately a million words which digitized so it's a massive work actually

&gt;&gt; I'm going to give this gentleman a chance because I think he's been very persistent so it's one last &gt;&gt; and I'm student. So this is the second time I'm

attending your session. So my question is for Vijay sir and sir Vij you have said that rather than using some others model you need to have your own person so we smallreneurs coming to you with

but when it comes to again we need to compare with Google and who have already came up with 1,600 plus languages that And as S said there are 7,000 plus languages. So how

do you sgest us to come into play in this big thing and coming to Amitab uh you have said about Baji doing the translation and all sorry to ask uh how much accuracy is it there and isn't it

possible it can raise a global war when doing the translation because translation is a big thing and this is uh even though we have all recently has come into play because

&gt;&gt; we got your question so let them answer. Yeah. &gt;&gt; I mean I I I think let's let's chat after it's probably better. Yeah. I mean you're asking about

how startups compete with big tech. It's a it's a classic problem that all startups face. How do you differentiate yourself? So that's what you need to focus on. So find your target audience

and can you build a killer solution that's better than the the big &gt;&gt; do you say that just use the wheel that has already &gt;&gt; Oh absolutely don't reinvent the wheel

but if you have uh uh something that that's unique that you can add as a startup go for it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So uh so you know uh going by the what you talked about is know accuracy

per se. So I was in the other session where I was saying that I we experimented with speechtoech translation uh in in front of our minister as well as the Gujarat

government officials. The officials felt that it was 80% right while as the minister said it was you know beyond uh his imagination. It was so good. Now the point which is there is not about uh

whether it is accurate or not. Accuracy is all about whether the people are able to accept it not. But the pertinent question which you have raised which is basically what do I do it is to go back

to the basics and as I said you
