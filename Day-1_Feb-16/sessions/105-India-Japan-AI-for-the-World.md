## 📝 Transcript

the today's timetable. First, we will have an opening limmers from the government of Japan and India. After that, we will invite three speakers each from representative company of Japan and

India to uh uh participate in the panel discussion. In the latter half of the panel discussion, we will have a question and answer session with the audience.

So now let us &gt;&gt; Okay. So sure. &gt;&gt; Okay. Um sorry for that. Um the first um let us move on to the opening session the keynotes address. Uh let us welcome

the first keynote speaker. The first speaker is Miss Sho Nagano the director for information policy planning meti of Japan. So, Miss Nago, please [applause]

&gt;&gt; namaste. Uh, thank you for joining this brilliant event held by India AI and Matei Japan. Today, I'm Shiho Nago in charge of AI international affair and digital governance. Now, I would like to

introduce Japan's recent policies. First accelerating AI industrial development, Japan is now promoting a comprehensive strategy that integrates foundation models, domain specific AI models and

company specific AI systems. By leveraging uni unique industrial data, we aim to drive innovation across all sectors from manufacturing to services. A key pill is strengthening computing

infrastructure through national projects such as data center deployment and semiconductor uh semiconductor supply chain reinforcement. Japan is building a

robust environment where AI and hardware can co evolve. This includes initiatives like ABCI and what bit collaboration which enhance domestic computational capabilities.

Another major priority is advancing frontier AI development for the coming AGI era. Japan encourages the creation of competitive foundation models and promotes community collaboration

including sharing model weights and data sets. Gen is our flagship initiatives. &gt;&gt; Geniac is the generative AI accelerator challenge launched in February 2024. Geniac aims to support the originality

and ingenuity of private companies and research institute as they develop fundamental generative AI models. The program is built on three pillars. First, the subsidizing access to

computing resources such as GPUs and crowd systems. Second, promoting collaboration between developers, industry users, and data holders. Through events and technical

matchmaking, we encourage the practical use of high quality data. Third, strengthening the developer community. Genia fosters an environment where researchers can exchange

knowledge, build networks, and accelerate innovation together. Through these measures, Japan is nurturing an ecosystem that supports both model developers and database builders,

enabling sustainable growth of our AI industry. Finally, let me highlight Japan's recent progress in AI governance. In 2023, Japan launched the Hiroshima AI process

at the G7 summit, which produced a comprehensive policy framework by the end of that year. In February 2024, the information technology promotion agency AC established IPA established the AI

safety institute AC to serve as a hub for domestic and international AI safety research. [clears throat] Furthermore, in April 2024, Japan published AI guidelines for business

providing practical guidance for responsible AI develop deployment. The most sign significant milestone is the enactment of the AI act in June 2025th.

This law aims to make Japan the world's most innovation friendly environment for AI development and utiliz utilization while ensuring safety, transparency and alignment with international norms.

In this way we are developing various kinds of AI policy rapidly recent years. Hopefully in this event let's learn cutting edge AI technology and discuss AI challenges of both countries to

foster the strategic relationships between India and Japan. Daniela Bart. &gt;&gt; Okay. Thank you, Miss Nago. And before uh we move on to the uh the keynotes address from the Indian side,

uh I heard that um the secretary want to take the photo session uh of the panelists. Um so we would like to uh move on to the uh p photo session first and okay uh let us uh introduce um the

six distinguished panelists one by one um so dear dear panelist uh when you call your name please come up to the stage and I'm sorry for that uh some four time speakers um due to the uh the

speaker was changed but okay I would like to introduce um okay the first uh panelist is the Mr. Sid Madan are the managing director from the BCG. So

the second panelist is the Mr. Shingo Okuma, the global partner sales manager. Hi Leo. The third panelist is the Mr. Shates Tajan, Country Head, Tata Consultancy

Service Japan. [applause] The first speaker panelist is the Mr. Lucas Haywood, the vice president of the global strategy once action inc. The fifth speaker panelist is the Mr.

Snow Gupta, the managing director and the CEO of Yota. [applause] And the last panelist um the Mr. Hi Rohira, the senior manager research management center research of India

private limited. [applause] &gt;&gt; Okay. Is that okay? Okay. Um, so dear panels, uh, could you kindly stand up and then it's time to photo? So, dear audience, please take a

lot of the photo. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, so dear Palace, um, thank you, but uh, so could you, uh, student? Okay. Okay. Please have a seat. Yes. Yeah,

sure. Okay. &gt;&gt; Sorry for that. &gt;&gt; And then, uh, I'd like to move on to the keynote address from the Indian side. Um, let us welcome the speaker from the

Indian side, uh, Mr. Golovja, uh, from the NGI. So, Mr. Golov, please. Thank you all for being here. It's wonderful to see the enthusiasm in the room for AI in general and for India and

Japan working together in particular. Very grateful for your time. Uh what I want to do over the next couple of minutes is talk about why AI is important to India and the work that

India AI mission has done to create the enablers to really power the AI ecosystem of the country. So AI is extremely important to the country as a whole because it's impacting the way we

work. It has huge potential to make the country a lot more productive. India over the years has been known for a strong IT workforce and even with respect to AI, it has emerged as a big

hub and a talent powerhouse. Uh what's important to make AI work really is to have the right governance in place and see how we can use the potential of AI across spheres, right? It can help

businesses, it can help academia, it has already started helping public service delivery. There's a lot that can be done and as with a lot of technologies like 5G for instance or the way we use UPI to

drive financial inclusion AI can be another tool another technology which with which we can use to lease drop on the development parameters. Um if we see the way India has grown on AI we were

ranked seventh on the AI vibrancy index. uh we had the India AI mission launched in March 2024 and that has helped us improve the ranking to third overall by 2025

and not just the vibrancy index we see that we are very strong on the skill parameters we have almost a 200 plus% growth in talent uh the research output as well has grown over time and what we

need to focus on next in terms of taking India to the next stage of development of AI is uh these four parameters. One, if you think about what you need to really make AI applications, you need to

have the right foundation models in place which are customized for the country and not really from the west because they are able to work better in our context. So that's one thing which

we need to get right. The other is having data because data is really the lifeblood of AI and there's a lot of data in India but until we began the work over here, data was mostly

scattered and siloed in different places. So making sure that people are able to access data to use it collectively to create AI applications that's been an important endeavor for

us. Uh we also need to make sure that the country has access to compute infrastructure. We have started giving that in a subsidized way and of course all of this needs to happen within the

ambit of responsible AI so that we do the right thing and this is what India AI mission has been focused on right. So we have um AI kosh which is our data sets platform

which now provides access to more than 9,000 data sets. It also gives access to compute a small amount which is given for free. It has a set of toolkits which you can use to prepare data and it also

has open- source models which can be leveraged by the AI community. We have the compute pillar of the India AI mission which provides access to more than 38,000 GPUs which are given at more

than a 40% subsidy. There's the innovation center which works on creating indigenous LLMs and we have the safe and trusted AI which focuses on responsible AI. Beyond this to make sure

that once the AI applications come up the AI startups emerge we have enough people to work on them. There's a future skills pillar which makes sure that we are working on skilling across the value

chain of AI. So right from people who can work on data annotation to also supporting PhDs who can do cutting edge research. So that's been the focus of the skilling pillar and we have the

startup financing pillar as well which makes sure that we are able to give the right financial as well as non-financial support to the startups like acceleration go to market support to

make sure that these AI startups don't fizzle out but are able to do well in the long run and come to the market. The last pillar that we focus on is the application pillar because typically if

we leave things to the market they may not focus on the right problem statements which are important for a large populace. Hence what the application pillar does is that it

sources problem statements from different government departments and we run challenges and hackathons to make sure that AI solutions are developed for them. So that's a little brief on the

India emission. Uh you can read more on our website and we have a large exhibit at the expo as well as a part of Bharat Pavilion. So I invite all of you to come and experience there is there's a very

large exhibit on AI coach that I had personally worked on. So I'll be excited to see all of you there. Uh but yes it'll be great to hear from the panel next. Thank you. Thank you so much for

your time. &gt;&gt; Okay, thank you Mr. Golav. Now let's move on to the panel discussion. Uh as we introduce area uh today we invite the six distinguished panelists and today's

theme of discussion are following uh two points. The first one is that where are the strengths of AI development in Japan and India and the second point that what kind of collaboration is possible

between Japan and India and the developing this AI. Um today uh since time is limited we would like to discuss both point together rather than separately. Uh we

hope to hear from as many panelists as possible. Um so we would like appreciate it if each panelist could keep their first remark to within three minutes. &gt;&gt; Three minutes. Please understand that if

uh speakers comment is tremendously long uh the MC might interrupt. Sorry for that. But uh now I would like to hand over the modulation to Mr. Okira from Fujitsu. So Mr. Aid please.

Uh uh uh one two one two okay can you hear me? Okay, thank you. Thank you Mia Kasan and uh thanks everybody. So actually I'm very overwhelmed to see such a huge

audience and sorry about the people standing backside. So if you are okay come and sit on the floor here. Okay by the way my name is Hirohira. I'm from Fujitsu Research of India. I'm based in

Bangalore. I recently shifted to India. So namaste and namaskar if there's anyone from Bangalore. So okay. Okay. Thank you very much. Okay. So welcome to the panel discussion

today. So on behalf of the distinguished speakers. So again I'd like to uh say big thank you to all of you. So this is a these are today discussion. To start with discussion let me reframe the uh

theme of the this uh discussion. A simple question. Why must Japan and India work together for sovereign AI? That is a key question I think. All right. So, let me uh share the Fujitsu's

perspective first. Okay. So, what is a sovereign AI? So, I think the Japan has a lot of strengths in sovereign AI. Sovereign AI is not just a technology. Sovereign AI is a trust long-term

commitment and long-term the engineering discipline uh built over the decade. So Fujitsu celebrated the 90 uh 90th anniversary 90 anniversary last year. So we have grown alongside Japan. So I

think uh we can say uh which personifies the Japanese strengths in sovereign AI. So what is the focus of Fujitsu for sovereign AI? So there's a many definition of sovereign AI. So Fujitsu

define the sovereign AI as a security. So security comes first. Okay. So centered on the AI and AI security technology. Now also that we are developing the supporting infrastructure

that is a energy very uh energy efficient uh computing sustainable comput technology as well as hybrid computing uh I mean the we are developed in the quantum computing also and

network technology. So I think Fujitsu is one of the very few companies that can cover uh what uh everything that the sovereign AI uh needs. That is our strengths. Now also that we are very

working closely with a global partner like Nvidia uh to achieve our uh so technology uh particularly the domain specific uh under the uh very secured environment that is our strength. So I

mean the we to cover the full stack of the capability of for sovereign AI. Okay. So but the technology uh needs the talent that is important. So I just uh uh discussed the uh

technology part and uh on the talent part so we really appreciate the highly skilled talent in India. Let me share uh some context here. So Fujitsu uh is a research comp uh technology company and

uh we have a research center globally that we have uh 1,500 researchers on staff in the world and uh we are again I'm from the free research of India based in Bangalore we have 400

researchers on staff so 400 out of 1500 so we are the biggest research center uh in Fujitu So that is show that is prove that uh uh we are strongly committing to the Indian talent.

So I think the India is the most richest talent pools in the world. Okay. So that that's why the future research of India was created. uh we we are leveraging the power of

trend in India and uh to be connected with a very capable very promising uh research ecosystem in India that's why we created our research center in India so recently the so we successfully

acquired very capable talent the from top university like IIIT and ISC also uh from through the lateral hiring we successfully uh uh obtained the very

talented people from industry and academia. So with that uh we have a strong capability that is uh supported by very capable Indian talent. The also uh we are have we are bridge between

Japan and India right that is our uh another purpose of the establishment. So let me show one example. So Fujitsu has engaged in the Japanese government program called Lotus program that is

aiming to invite the Indian student to Japan and the collaborative research between India and Japan. So Fujitsu have as a long uh established partnership with Japanese university also uh Indian

university. So we help them to create the best matchmaking. So we engaged in that program as a industry uh facilitator. So successfully uh uh our application uh was awarded and uh uh

several student from India coming to Japan so soon uh they will be financially supported by Japanese government. So with that as a strategic research half uh we are now doing as a

bridge uh between Japan India uh for talent technology and uh uh working together with academia. Okay. Uh let me uh stop here. So my sense is that uh one answer for this discussion scene I think

uh Japan can bring trust and uh uh engineering discipline uh while India uh bring the scale and talent with that I think we are totally complimentary we are missing pieces for

each other that is why uh we must work together I think okay that is uh okay uh my opinion Then uh I'd like to invite my good priests here starting with Sunan. Okay.

Thank you Daniel. Thank you. Thank you. Uh I think India's contribution in AI will be seen has to be seen from two perspective.

India as a source of supply and India as a source of demand. India as a demand I think nobody doubts that I was in a previous panel in the morning and I was talking about if we

are 1.4 billion people more importantly out of which 1 billion people are carrying a smartphone and who are enabled with internet we are all creating and consuming content every

single minute. No other country in the world has got the type of digital savviness and adoption which Indians have. UPI is just one wave which India has seen and it has drastically changed

our lives. It has gone to 40 countries by the way. Right? Imagine if AI is able to bring 50 such moments into different parts of our life into agriculture into education into healthcare into

entertainment into banking into finance into so many things because AI by nature literally can revolutionize any part of our personal and professional life. So India as a demand

uh any use case of India. The second part is any technology we Indians adopt late but once we adopt late when the technology has reached its top point and the cost has just come down to very cost

effective level then we just adopt it at a mass scale whether it was a computer revolution or a mobile revolution or a 5G 4G revolution. I think we all seen that two years back nobody could have

imagined that in India we'll be having a AI impact summit of the scale which you can see here. You can just see how the things have changed. India has created its own large compute facility which is

growing. India has created its own sovereign models which are getting developed and getting announced in this uh conference. So much of data sets have been actually created. In fact, Kabishek

G from Mati actually talked about government of India has created more than and compiled more than 8,000 data sources. So across tech India has come a long way. So if you are able to create a

frugal AI economy in India, you are able to create a voice-based economy in India, which means that Indians, 80% of Indians who don't speak English or who cannot write English, but they can very

well speak in their own language in their own Hindi English mix or Hindi English or whatever language they speak. You have literally targeted the largest market in the country and those use

cases if India and Japan work together and I'll come to that how we can work together. You have the entire global south and the whole of APEC to target to because AI at the end of the day is a

complex technologies people are still learning across the value chain. Few countries will be able to excel on this. India will be one, Japan will be one. So if India with its scale, India with its

innovation, India with its skill sets and India with it large market on which you can test the use cases. Combine that with the diligence with the deep engineering R&amp;D mindset of Japan, lean

came from Japan, industrial automation came from Japan, Kaizen came from Japan, right? And I could see the presentation from the Japanese representative. They are talking about how they are bringing

factory auto automation, how they're adopting enterprise AI at a large scale. So if you are able to combine the scale and innovation and skill sets of India and the use cases of India with the

diligence and the governance and the deep focus on trust and reliability of Japan, we can not only serve our respective countries, we can serve the whole of AP and global south. And I

think that is where this collaboration is very very important. Thank you. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; THANK YOU SENAN for inspiring uh insight. Thank you very much. Then

Lucasan. So I think from our perspective. So there was a little bit of a comment earlier around you know India and Japan are like puzzle pieces that fit

together. I think India and Japan are very very different countries but the puzzle piece analogy is very very true. So first I think there are common challenges. So both India and Japan we

are middle powers within the world and so in a world that's becoming more and more sort of extremely polar I think these you know there was some uh speeches at some of the world economic

forums around the middle powers coming together these kind of collaborations are really really important and even though we're very different countries we have similar challenges so Japan

obviously we have Japanese as our sort of main language and India has you know even more scale when it comes to languages AI solutions that are able to adapt to those languages effectively

become very very crucial. And so best practices that I get developed for tailoring language models towards those individual languages can be shared among our two countries because they're

practices. They're not necessarily just tied to one language. As well as that, there's the kind of puzzle piece aspect which is that Japan has strengths, India has strengths and

they're very complimentary. So Japan has very very strong domain knowledge. So manufacturing, construction, we've spent a lot of time um you know some may say not very efficient time but a lot of

time in developing up standards and best practices and industrial knowledge but where we struggle is with scale and it's with agility and speed and the ability to develop very very quickly and India

has all of that right there's no mistake that India is the top IT talent in all the world it's not by mistake that you know the top IT CEOs are all Indian, right? And so the ability to one bring

the structure and the domain knowledge of Japan into India and then the ability for India to help Japan scale and accelerate those are very very important complimentary aspects I think to an

Indian and Japan collaboration and make no mistake AI is a leaprogging technology. There was a leaprog I think slide before but like it's a solution that isn't just okay we're going to go

to the next step. It's a solution that says okay you know let's bring this country or this company to the forefront of whatever industry it happens to be impacting in terms of startups like us.

So we are a construction technology startup. So one you know we can no longer just focus on hiring the best talent. Once upon a time startups they pay lots and lots of money lots and lots

of stock options to get the best developers. AI is starting to eliminate that. And so what is the new role of startups? For us we see it as a connectivity role. So startups we have a

unique ability to be very very agile. So we have connections to international standards organizations. We have connections to enterprise. We have connections to startups being in you

know very very niche domain areas. So connecting that domain knowledge international organizations, enterprises, governments and being that connecting layer and being able to move

and mobilize very very agiley is where the value for I think startups is going to be and I think that's where we are going to continue to focus. Yeah. Thank you.

THANK YOU. First of all, uh thank you very much Meti for having me on this panel. Uh it is uh my fellow panelists have already covered what are the complimentary skills or capabilities

India and Japan have. So I'm not going to broach that subject but I'm trying to uh you know sort of put together my thoughts on what are the challenges that Japan has right I have having spent

about six seven years working with customers in Japan. Uh the challenges are very unique. Uh and I think India also have very very similar challenges. Uh so uh one of it

is uh when we talk about AI and success of building large language models and also small language models, you need to have good quality data sets. If you look at Japan and one of the big

challenges Japanese have today is number one aging population and the aging population means that a lot of knowledge is resident in people mind and not in data sets. So the first

challenge that we either as an Indian company or a Japanese company need to solve is how do I gather all of this information and knowledge that is resident and what brought Japan to its

forefront in manufacturing and monukery into real data sets and that is going to be a big challenging task for Japan and we are already seeing engagements of this kind when we work with customers

where they're looking to codify and extract this knowledge that is available with subject matter experts in into what we call as knowledge graph. Once we have that in my opinion that is a very

significant sovereign asset for Japan and this is a single biggest differentiator that can bring value not only to Japan to partners like India. What does India

have? India obviously has talent and we have abundance of talent. Second, India has built its own AI ecosystem. It's trained data sets. If you look at ADAR, if you

look at our uh national infrastructure on payments, I think we have a lot of data sets on which we can train our models. Sovereign AI probably take two more

minutes. Sovereign AI is not about saying that I'm going to work outside of the ecosystem of AI. I'm going to work outside of the hyperscalers like Microsoft or Google or Amazon. But it's

about creating something very unique for your own countries to solve your own problems. As Nvidia CEO put it, sovereign AI is more a security asset as opposed to trying to gain independence.

So obviously when it comes to sovereign AI you need to look at problems that are very specific to your country and look to partner with complimentary skill sets of countries that can provide what you

don't have so that you have an ecosystem that you have built to solve mutual problems. Two more points. Number one, Fujitsu along with Nvidia is investing significantly to create the next

generation compute. India is looking for computing capability that is sovereign on which they can process their data data sets. India has serv which is basically uh you

know a group of large language models identified with within various languages that potentially Japan can exploit. So every aspect of this partnership I look at

apart from leveraging India's talent there is so much that India and Japan can do together with regards to harnessing the knowledge of Japan harnessing the

discipline of Japan and harnessing the track record of their success and trust that they've built world over to the knowledge and wisdom and the youthfulness of India to the best of

both worlds. Thank you very much. &gt;&gt; Hello. Uh my name is Shingo from High Razo Corporation Limited. Uh firstly, thank you very much for uh giving me this opportunity to uh participate in

this event and uh panel discussions. Uh let me quickly you know introduce um about my organization. Uh we H Highreso is a Japanese GPU cloud provider. Uh we have our own data centers in Japan and

we are providing our GPU cloud services uh to our customers in Japan and actually uh we have been serving [snorts] our services in Japan only so far but we are currently in the first

step to start you know expanding our business in overseas especially in India. So firstly I'd like to touch to the point about the strength of AI development in Japan and India. um most

of the part uh other panelists already touched but uh for the Japan strengths I feel like the high uh reliability of the data this is one of the you know strength of Japan's AI development so

like the data well organized and also having you know um uh a lot of you know uh data uh storage and and high qualities let by manufacturing and also healthcare uh sectors. So you know um

those are the strengths of the Japanese uh um datas. On the other hand for India side I think uh the speed and also the scale this is definitely the strength of the uh development in India for sure. Uh

even talking with the um uh customers in India uh they are really you know keen to uh invest for their technologies. I think Japanese companies a bit more conservative on that point for sure. So

I really feel like such kind of dynamic scalability from Indian companies and like mix mixing up these two kind of different directional strength. Uh I believe that uh there's going to be a

good great synergy to you know work on together and touching about the um sovereign AI uh this is uh some point from uh Japanese GPU cloud provider. So definitely you know the AI demand is

growing in the country in India. uh we are keen to you know support such kind of AI demands but at the moment like we only have data centers in Japan so there's a a lot of barriers we can you

know support on that point um so hopefully you know we can have some kind of framework we can work together as a friendly nation between Japan and India and definitely you know we are also

looking into you know uh develop our you know data center facilities in Japan uh we are looking for um uh partner uh to have you know data centers here And hopefully you know we

can also got get some you know support from each you know um side of government for sure and not only the um how to say AI development in India I'm talking about the serving AI so I I'm feeling

that the there's a lot of you know unique AI platforms developed in this country in India and those could be you know transferred to Japan as well. So as a Japanese you know um GPU cloud service

provider uh we would love to you know find you know very unique platforms in India bring it all together in in Japan you and you know that could be you know one of the part of collaboration between

India and Japan for you know developing the like the sovereign AIS thank you &gt;&gt; my fellow panelists have covered a lot so I'll not repeat uh I'll keep it super brief. Uh I think we we already touch

upon some fantastic points, right? So India and Japan both are in an increasing polarized world seen as more neutral and middle countries. So there's a lot to collaborate on. There's a lot

of positivity that this collaboration brings. Uh there are also complimentary strengths. Uh as my panelist, fellow panelist pointed out, look, India's age today is on average is uh 28 years which

is one of the youngest population in the world. and working age population and more and more you know working age population will come into the workforce. So Japan

on the contrary would need talent uh insertion right. So clearly an area where India can and Japan can work on and there are programs in place which both countries have put together.

There is of course a tech technology innovation and you know IP advantage which Japan has enjoyed uh specifically around physical AI right like the physical sector manufacturing factories

um auto sectors Japan has quite excelled in in the past we have already seen some recent collaborations around Japanese companies setting up shop in India uh semiconductor companies you know

collaborating u and e ECMS the electronics manufacturing you know we we're working together as mighty and matey to bring technology into India. I believe you know in the new AI world

there's an even greater opportunity to do collaboration to build fidgetital AI what we call digital AI the how you deploy factory AIE factory automation of the future a lot of the manufacturing

data that Japan sits on and with the talent that India has you know working together on something like this with the new investments being done out of India it's it's something that we both

countries can actually work together a lot on um there are of course very positive relations that the countries are joining. We believe you know even on the skilling side there are

a lot of programs being developed by both countries lot of exchange is possible. So very excited about the two countries uh what the two countries can bring together.

&gt;&gt; Thank you very much for your insightful input. I really appreciate it and we confirm that uh we are natural part we are inheritantly work together we distinct to work together for soi. So as

a moderator uh I really want to facilitate a very engaged discussion between panelist uh but uh we have 30 minutes only. Okay I was advised to go straight to the Q&amp;A session. Okay, over

to &gt;&gt; um uh sorry uh thank you my dear panelists um for the lively discussion. Uh now I'd like to open the floor for the question from the audience. Uh so if

you uh have uh so if anyone has a question based on their discussion uh please leave your hand and so uh the secret will go on. &gt;&gt; Okay.

And so when you um dear audience when you ask your question please start from your name and so where you belong and so so the question was to whom. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Uh thank you wonderful panel discussion.

My name is Aziz. I'm from Kyus Republic. It's also talent pool country and we work with Japan also and we uh copy this outsourcing model from India and thank you so much. It is amazing. Just one

more comment about Hindu language. We is we have a strong uh AI community engineers and we create AI words for every language kind it is free of of charge open source in haggy face kind

also hind Hindu included also uh you can use it and Japanese free of charge and we promoted this global initiative among uh you know 7,000 languages we have on the planet and uh you know big tech

doesn't care about small languages We solve on Kir's language problem and we just kind of as you mentioned about Hindu it has great opportunities here uh 1.5 billion and we want to uh do

something for India. Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; Namaste. My name is Nidaj. I'm from Bangalore. Um so a little bit on me. I was working as a machine learning architect till September 2025 and now

transforming into the education sector. So this question is for Miti and Mighty both. I'm sorry I do not know your names. So I cannot say that for whom it is the qu the question is in particular.

So we &gt;&gt; Hamurasan &gt;&gt; Hamurasan. Okay. Hamunas Hamura &gt;&gt; Hamurasan. So we are trying to bring closer

industry and academia where we are uh taking the projects from the startups uh curate in cohorts and take it to the students so that they can build uh hands on learning basically in the AI domain.

uh and uh during this uh project developments we are looking so students need lot of compute also uh to execute their experiments and uh we need mentors also from the

industry where the their companies allows them to work as a mentor outside the their industry the respective industry also. So uh this question is like what kind of possibilities

I can or the organizations on such a small level can explore on these platforms for this kind of project based learning in AI. [clears throat]

&gt;&gt; Okay. Um thank you for that question. Actually I'm not the hanamas but from thei I'd like to answer um the question. Uh uh as you mentioned uh I really understand the Japan and India uh have a

strong uh partnership and relationship uh on the viewpoint of the AI and so actually uh as this event will be also the one opportunity uh to get to know um the world Japan the situation and also

the India situation. Um so also uh actually the last October uh we also have the online the matching event between the Japan and India hosted by the government and I really understand

um the importance of um the relationship not only the business to business but also the academia you mentioned um to tell the truth um the medi are also uh basically following um the industry so

we don't have um the direct connection um to the academia side is true but at the same time um in the viewpoint of um development of AI, it is also important to engage um the like the academia uh

things too as you mentioned. Um so I'm so sorry to say that um I I have a correct and uh complete idea at how this things going on but yeah I'm sure uh we would like to um try to pursue uh and

discuss uh what is the possibility uh of um the cooperation between the Japan and India not only the business to business but also the business to academia or academia to academia. Thank you. Should

I maybe uh ma'am I can answer your question. So uh simple answer is you can go to India mission. I think Abishek is there from India mission. One of the seven pillars of India mission is also

supporting the education and scaling in AI and uh besides uh creating regulations around that they are also funding for that. You must have heard uh uh prime minister and the minister of IT

speaking about creating more than 500 labs across the country in various schools and colleges and uh industry because in the last two years uh compute deployment the GPUs deployment in India

has taken a very large scale. I myself is a very large compute provider in India. We are giving it to India mission for most of the models which are being created in India. They are getting

trained uh on our clusters here. One of the products which people like us have created is targeted specifically for schools and colleges where we are creating the compute workstation GPU

workstation in the cloud itself which you can just access using a plain internet connection. So students wherever they are sitting across the country in a remote area for sure they

have a laptop for sure they have a mobile connection a broadband connection a 5G connection or a broadband connection using that they can directly log into the backend GPU based

workstation start doing their work whether it's a Jupyter notebook or a VS code notebook or whatever environment they are comfortable with this is something which comes at a very very

usage based model very low cost model so that it does not you know hurt the pockets also and uh beside India mission Again as industry stakeholders we are also providing lots of credits. I myself

have created lots of center of excellence in some schools and colleges. We are uh one is that you can access this compute remotely. Second is we are coming to your colleges creating center

of excellence putting some of the compute workstations there taking classes of students and guiding them on their projects as well. So these models are available uh in India right now. If

you contact India emission I'm sure they can guide you to the right places. THANK YOU. &gt;&gt; OKAY, THANK YOU. SO, TIME LIMITED. SO, THE NEXT QUESTION will be the final.

Sorry for that. &gt;&gt; Um, thank you gentlemen for your very very kind words. I spent 18 months in Sasuka. Um, so I sort of sense,

&gt;&gt; yes, I sort of sensed the the difference between Indian work culture and Japanese work culture. Um the challenge to send Indian workers to Japan is very very specific. The even after seven years of

being inside Japan, there's still a delta. My question is on the other side, isn't it easier for your companies to do larger acquisitions, especially in the data center space and especially in

where you have small language models and make those quote unquote Japan and India? um and not do this peace meal but do it on a large scale much much larger scale hundreds of billions of dollars.

[cough] &gt;&gt; So I can maybe quickly comment on that. So I think we are seeing that. So more and more you see the Japanese companies especially enterprise level companies

within Japan realize that okay you know the innovation in Japan alone is not as strong as the innovation connected with other countries. I think for a long time Japan was very very closed. It was

always Japanese quality is the best. Everything about Japan is the best. But as we see, you know, the societal issues that we have in Japan and the the scale issues that we have in Japan and the

technical issues that we have in Japan, it's become much much clearer in all domains, construction especially, right? That yes, we have a lot of good and important knowledge, but in order to

scale that globally and in order to continue growing, we now have to look outside of Japan. And so you see major enterprise companies, you know, in my industry everywhere, right? We have the

top five general contractor companies in Japan. You know, the the mega super general contractor companies acquiring companies all over the place. Whether that be in India, whether that be in

places like Singapore, you see all of the construction consultancies expanding their operations overseas and developing up, you know, similar to Fujitsu like research centers and innovation centers

outside of Japan as well. So, I think that is a movement that we are seeing. I think that, you know, ultimately it becomes a two-way flow. And so we do need to import talent. We do need to

make sure that Japan itself is shored up, but on an innovation scale, that connection continues to grow globally. And I think you'll see it continue to keep scaling into billions of dollars of

investment. Yeah. Okay. Um, okay. Uh, I think the you strike a very uh important point. So I think the for Japanese Yeah, that is very important point to uh look at the

you know our challenges. So I think that in Japan the uh labor force that we are decreasing the labor force. So uh we need a more uh talent from India to sustain our industry. So of course the

robotics can help us but I think the real you human interface still needed. So yeah I think that in that sense uh like I said uh yeah we can work together. So I I think this is not

straight question but uh I think the yes you pointed at a very important point. Thank you very much. &gt;&gt; But I just have a comment. &gt;&gt; See um

I mean I represent this side of the equation. I've spent about seven six seven years in Japan. There is still a very significant gap between how we see ourselves and how

Japan sees India. in terms of policy, in terms of risk, in terms of uh uh you know uh lot of other factors which are very cultural in nature. Okay. In the seven

years postco due to significant challenges in supply chain they are significantly improved their you know sort of investment strategies with India

as a focus. So if you look at uh the two very successful Japanese companies in India, of course, Suzuki stands out. The second one is Dyken.

Okay, manufacture for the world with India as a base. These were the two standout companies. But you don't see too many other companies come in, right? It's not that they don't have problems.

The fact of the matter is culturally I might be politically incorrect to make the statement here. Uh they are very comfortable working with Southeast Asian countries.

Okay. So we need to really look at how can we make India a great destination for their investment not just as a market for also scaling up our manufacturing capability. Vietnam,

Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia are markets where Japanese companies outside of the west have significant exposure to. So that is the primary destination and

those were colonies of Japan prior to World War II. Therefore, there is a lot of cultural integration between these two markets. So there is a little bit of history. So

we need to unwind that. I think our governments have done a fantastic job. When prime minister visited uh Japan in August 2025 when they signed the next version of India Japan uh journey. There

are lot of commitments made on both sides. Commitments alone do not help. I think commitments need to be followed by investment. Very recently I'm seeing a

lot of banks investing. You would have also heard SMBC's invested in a bank in India. Mizo has also acquired a bank in India and that is just the starting point. Once you get the banking

ecosystem starting to invest in another country then you will find capital flow. So I am very very hopeful the next 5 years is possibly going to be the best time for India Japan relationship given

the struggles that Japan is having with the other Southeast Asian partners. So keep this in mind there is a history associated with it and we need to work to unwind some of the things that have

happened in the past and that's possibly why there is still reluctance. &gt;&gt; Um thank you very much. Um time five. Uh now we have le already exceed end of the session. Um thanks once again uh to the

dear panelists and the audience. Uh actually so we have the small gift uh for the panelists. Dear panelists could you stand up and thank you so much for your kind

cooperation and please give them a round of applause. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Now we would like to close um the event. Thank you so much for the participation.

And so lastly uh the company that participated uh the panelists from Japan today are also exhibiting the Japan pavilion at whole 14. A total seven

company including those will not present today or showcase their uh work. So please feel free to visit if you are interested. This conclude the event and you may

exist at the convenience. Once again, thank you very much for your participation today. &gt;&gt; I really enjoyed what you said.
