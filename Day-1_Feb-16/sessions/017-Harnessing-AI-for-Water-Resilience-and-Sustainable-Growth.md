## 📝 Transcript

environment and face. And it's my pleasure now to introduce one of our speakers, Miss Shui Capill, who's sat here in the middle. So Shi heads the security and mutual dependence desk at

the center where she examines both traditional and non-traditional security concerns through a security and interdependence lens. At the ICFS, she also leads India's water security

project. The first part of the water security project will be launched in Mar end of March. So yeah, stay tuned and keep in touch. And with a background in national

security and global affairs, Shi brings on an interdiciplinary approach to addressing India's water crisis. She has experience across tanks, public and private sectors. So that's enough about

background and over to you. &gt;&gt; Well, thank you Celia for the kind introduction. Uh just a slight change in the format. I'm the chair today and I've got two speakers here. Um good morning

and welcome everyone to today's session. It's my pleasure to open this fireside chat on one of the most urgent and consequential topics of our time. The role of AI in harnessing sorry

harnessing the role of AI to water resilence and sustainable growth. I want to start with introducing our esteemed speakers. Please join me in welcoming our first speaker, David Wood. Dr. David

Wood is a fellow at the center. He co-founded Symbian in 1998, which pioneered the smartphone industry. He has since exited and now spends his time writing and speaking on all things

technology, specially focusing on long-term trends of AI, technology, and regulation. In 2009, he was included in T3's list of 100 more

people in technology. David Our second speaker is Sujit Na. Sujit is the co-founder of network for humanity and co-creator of Becken, a decentralized protocol powering

peer-to-peer agent native digital economies. He led the global digital energy grid vision with international energy agency advancing an interoperable digital backbone for clean flexible

power systems. His work spans key digital public infrastructure pillars co-conceptualizing OMDC enabling networks like Namayatri and the Kenya one network. He has also

contributed to Aadhaar's dduplication infrastructure and pioneered the national common mobility card. He's also co-architect of the unified Bhat e charge initiative and a special invite

to the forum of regulators for a unified AIdriven energy economy. Welcome Sjit. Now let me quickly explain the format for today's session. We'll have opening remarks from both our

speakers 5 minutes each which will be followed by a moderated conversation where we'll engage and you know explore some themes in the topic. We'll then move on to audience Q&amp;A which will be 15

minutes and then we'll have the closing remarks from both our speakers and the conclusion. And with that I want to start with the framing of the conversation. Why are we

here today? Why are we even talking about this? Now water is no longer an environmental or developmental concern. Not just an environmental and developmental concern. It is a

structural determinant of global stability. What we are witnessing around the world is too much water in some areas, too little in others and increasingly water that is too polluted

to be consumed. Now when water system destabilize the ripple effects extend beyond borders. Water is deeply connected to trade, migration, climate systems and economic

growth and over 700 million people are projected to be displaced because of water scarcity by 2030 according to UNICEF. So what we're facing is not a

localized scarcity issue. It is a global risk multiplier. Now why is India important in all of this? India is home to 1.4 billion people. So nearly one sixth of humanity.

It is one of the fastest growing major economies and poised to become the third largest in the next two and a half to three years. So it its trajectory matters globally. Why? Because India is

deeply embedded in global supply chains, food and agricultural markets, pharmaceutical and manufacturing networks, technology and digital innovation ecosystems and regional

geopolitical dynamics. Now if India thrives sustainably, it contributes to global economic prosperity. In short, India is too big and too

significant for the world to not understand. And water security is central to this equation. And this is precisely why the international center for sustainability

has undertook a comprehensive water security research focused on India. There are two parts of this research. The first part addresses the water security status of India which is a

diagnostic report. The second part of the report focuses on solutions and recommendations. It outlines not only what is happening what is happening in the country now but

what could go wrong if if there is delay in actions. Now in on the back of this research a n a question really emerged um what are the tools there to really strengthen

water residence in the country and this brings us to artificial intelligence in this context can the water sector become a key beneficiary of India's AI mission and if so how do we

strategically harness that potential and with that framing I would now like to invite our speakers for their opening reflections David would you like to go first you've got five

Thank you. Uh, let's have my slides back up on the screen, please. So, I'm a futurist, though I must say it's never been harder to predict the future.

As a futurist, we want to point out that the near future might be very different from how we are naively expecting it. There are likely to be many changes coming soon. And if we get it right, we

can move away from the image on the left side here where we've been intelligent but not wise and where we are stressing nature in terrible ways. But if we get it right, we have a very much more

sustainable future ahead. Sustainability in the environment and sustainability in human flourishing. But as I said, if we try and anticipate even one week ahead, it's uncertain nowadays. There are

changes in politics, in geopolitics and especially in technology which catch us out the whole time. But despite this uncertainty, I want to say there are some important trends. So

I want to shed some more light on this picture and point out some trends which I believe will hold true in the next few years regardless of anything else happening. Trend number one is for AI we

have not seen anything yet compared to what is ahead. AI capability is continually improving and I know it's quite popular these days to say AI has hit a wall and won't progress any

further and that and it's been overhyped. Well, I disagree fundamentally and later if you like I could talk to you individually. I see there's at least 12 reasons to expect AI

to be very significantly more capable in a few years than it is today. What this means, it's also going to be used more widely in more areas of our lives. More applications we will have AI present

either sometimes as a welcome advisor, sometimes as an unwelcome uh spy. But AI is not just going to be changing our lives. AI is going to be changing technology and this is where it really

gets interesting for water and sustainable growth. AI is going to provide the intelligence so there can be big leaps forward in various uh fields such as nanotech, the study and

understanding and creation of new materials and new integrated matter. the study of biotech and the study of cognotech which is how can our minds improve and all three of these areas

have had slow progress recently but they're poised to move faster and I anticipate many Nobel prizes recently of course there was a Nobel Prize for AI helping solve a longstanding

biotechnological problem with protein folding that is just the beginning as a result AI does have huge potential for change. And I'm saying this so we don't get misled just by what AI can do today.

Our plans must be adaptable and agile enough to cope with new AI capabilities coming sooner than most people expect. But it's not just potential for new materials and new interactions. It's

also potential for many things going wrong. Sadly, we can be misled by AI. We can be confused by AI. we can be manipulated by AI. Which leads me to my final trend which is one thing's going

to be even more important in the near future. Wise human judgment and we haven't been very wise sadly in the last few years. We have been misled far too often. So that is now possible. So then

how does this apply in the field of AI? And very briefly, I'm going to talk about seven ways that AI could boost water resilience. And I'll say in advance that the seventh is in my view

the most impactful and most dramatic. First, it can be used for improving the cleaning and filtering of waste water with new chemicals, with new materials, with new sensors.

Secondly, it can improve the desalination plants. Desalination is an expensive energy exp energy intensive operation but there are prospects for doing this uh better with the help of

AI. Third AI can detect and monitor using multiple sources of information where underground water reserves are. It can combine information from GPS satellites from local gravity variations

and multiple other senses. Fourth, and this is huge, there is the potential for AI to give much better advice on how to irrigate. There's so much water that's used in irrigation,

which sadly is often wasted, is unnecessary, and the potential savings here are enormous to know when does soil actually need more water, when will the water have the best effect. Fifth,

there's improvements to smart urban grids to detect much more quickly where there are leaks and how the leaks can be fixed and to adjust the pricing dynamically. And six, this is more

speculative. There's the possibility for taking water out of the atmosphere by so-called atmospheric water harvesting. But I've left I think the most important to last. Item number seven is that AI

will be giving us inspired strategic advice. In the future, if you want to find out how AI can how AI can improve water, the best thing to do is not to hire an expensive human consultant, the

best thing to do will be to talk to AI itself because it will be aware of all the publications. It will be aware of all the ideas and it will frequently put the information together better than

ever before. So that is seven reasons I think why AI stands to significantly improve water resilience in India and indeed elsewhere. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you David. Um

thank you David. I think you've painted a very optimistic picture and we will come to that in our moderator discussion. Um Sujit over to you. Please share your opening reflections.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. Hi can you guys hear me? Hello. Yeah much better. Thank you. Um, no, a fascinating presentation from David. So, I think it'll be safe for me to stay in

I'm I'm less of a futurist and probably more of a journalist when it comes to talking about water. Um, so I'm more of a I see myself as a digital plumber. Probably a good metaphor to have for

today's topic. Uh, building infrastructure uh with no sense of what the solutions can be built on top of it. And that's probably uh a sentiment that I carry as a way of thinking. Um, and

I'd like to, you know, uh, recall what David started with saying, future is getting increasingly harder to predict. And I think one of the biggest principles of the DPI infrastructure

thinking is to build for optionality. And then you can only build for optionality when when you stop thinking about uh I mean abdicating the sense of

assurance that you can curate solutions to allowing for ecosystem to let solutions emerge especially for complex problems like water uh they're deeply deeply convoluted of course Dominic it's

been political uh you said it's got to be a risk multiplier so I completely see that potential and it's so and it cuts across multiple aspects of how we live as a society as a humanity as a country,

as a state. So I think in matters like these uh one of the things we try to do is to how do you make something available as an infrastructure that allows for context specific solutions to

emerge unbeknownst to us today and that's that's one of the principles in which uh dist infrastructure thinking or the DPI thinking that then I've had the good fortune of being part of in the

last 15 years. Now if I were to bring that perspective into the conversation today particularly about AI and water probably I'll split that two and add my perspectives before I bring them

together. Uh firstly on the AI side I agree I agree with you that it's fascinating progress in the capability we are seeing the all the the beta tests and the capabilities that are happening.

I I have no doubt in my mind that we're going to see increasingly phenomenal capability on the learning uh and and the reasoning capabilities of of the machines. But it also today at at

least for the moment right now you know and I'm sure something that will be discussed in the AI somewhere through through the week is that we're currently dealing with at least on the AI side a

good fair amount of supply side hysteria and a little bit of the demand side gains yet to be seen especially for crucial sensitive matters like sustainability water and other critical

needs of the society and and that hysteria in a way it's good because it's really creating technologies is constantly brewing. Um it's almost like I take this analogy of we're building a

better sun every day just that we we as humanity are failing falling behind in making utilization of that sun better like so I think there is a raging improvement in that on the supply side

but I think demand side has to catch up and one of the reasons why demand side uh is is kind of falling behind and quite quite naturally so we'll see that for a few more years is one a way of

harnessing that diffusing their supply side capabilities is into the uh demand side. I think the diffusion is one of the biggest problems. We don't we probably don't know. We're still sort of

uh dealing with how to make that happen. But more importantly, the supply side hysteria is also elevating the demand side risks because it's one thing to say that my model can do everything just

give me all the data and but it's for the consumer the supply the demand side consumers of AI who's bearing all the risks. So and the risk is not effectively priced and therefore it's

creating whole lot of uncertainty. So AI is adding to the uncertaintity uh in over on top of the uncertainty we have with the problem itself. So that's one perspective I want to bring in. Um the

other perspective is that AI literally feeds on data. I mean it's it's it's a it's a it feeds on data. And one of the other risk we are seeing with adoption is the real poverty of data and its

availability especially for critical sectors. It's not that there's no data, just that they're so islanded, they're so kind of fragmented with no verifiability, no trust, no structure

that gives you a sense of reducing the cost of bringing that data into play for AI. And I think that's one of the things that I see as one of the biggest challenges we need to address. And some

of the work we are doing with Beckin um we recently launched a paper called the decentralized data marketplaces is to reduce that cost of discoverability trust verifiability of any data set um

and and making that data available while retaining the autonomy and agency of that local community of the data holder as a country as a society as an individual to make sure it's available

for for AI to harness and give back some of the things that they're looking for from the AI using that data. So it's a very important perspective to think about and that perspective becomes

doubly important when you talk about water assets and water ecosystems. Um I think there are multiple sort of AI waves that you will see in this area. Uh and David alluded to the point that AI

is revolutionizing technology. So the sciences and technologies I won't be surprised if there are more Nobel prizes coming from these AI schools in some sense but it is revolutionizing the

sciences and the technologies in specific areas. Um but what I the the the area that I focus about a lot more is how does it diffuse at a population scale because this is a crisis that has

to be met at scale. You know one of the things that we learned with India's digital public infrastructure initiative whether it's Aadhaar or UPI I'm sure all living in India know how how much UPI

today is a population scale habit and not a technology anymore uh it comes from this thinking that you fundamentally have to start thinking about not scaling what works

&gt;&gt; but about thinking about what works at scale and I think the complexity with water is probably is the point where we need to elevate ourselves to think about what works at scale and that is where

digital infrastructure thinking not a digital solution thinking but a digital infrastructure thinking as a way to build an open playground for numerous solutions and I take this example of

internet there's nothing in the design of internet that would tell you that after 50 years there will be a charge or an Amazon after 30 years the fact that it allows emergence happen you know

relentlessly I think we need to think about that sort of way to solve for optionality and that's very very important and therefore unlocking data and

reducing the barriers around data reducing the cost of trust and verifiability and discoverability of that and that let AI diffuse faster cheaper better into the hands of

decision makers planners individuals uh is something that will be very crucial I'll take two specific analogies before uh I handle the floor to I think one of the examples we're doing in uh with

energy transition so shifting from water into energy transition is to give that agency to solve back to the people. So the India energy stack that's currently underway in India with Ministry of

Power, one of the things we are trying to do is to make the energy consumers like all of us get your own data back in verifiable credentials. All of you must be using your QR codes today and you use

your COVID passes and some of you use DJatra think you have that data in your wallet for energy. If you have your energy consumption data, your energy connection data available and it's in

your control with with all the kind of privacy knobs taken care of. But if you had that, would it make it a bit more responsible for you? And it allows the ecosystem to also innovate with that.

Today the amount of data that gets stuck in institutional organizations whether it's a local urban water distribution board or or the big departments of the government or private sector for that

matter I think getting the data out putting in the hands of people is very very important think about UPI it was a very messy affair for any Indian in India to do payments you know we were

doing about 170 million transactions a month for a country as big as us 8 years ago uh that's probably the size of what Portugal would do but from there we went to 21 billion ion dollar 20 billion

transactions a month just because we allowed people to find a way to engage with payment transactions and do it. So there so that's one that's one example of how we can think about a DPI machine

readable tamperproof verifiable privacy secure way of sharing data back to the people and are giving them the agency to participate in community private governmental

interventions and making them an active participant in the problem. I think that's one the other the second part is definitely about uh resource adequacy resource efficiencies I mean I've been

given to understand that what are resources &gt;&gt; yeah so the last point I think the the whole point about utilization underserved underutilized resources I

think today with technologies like AI and aspects like tokenization you can bring some of these water assets back into play and make them attract faster cheaper better investments by creating

an open rails to make that So these are some of the ways in which we could think about bringing AI into play for problem complexity of water. Back to you. Thank you.

&gt;&gt; So thank you SJ. Um we will now move on to our moderator discussion where we explore both the themes you know discussed by you and David. Um but I want to really start with discussing the

whole system with you. Um and starting off with you know the elephant in the room which is the water footprint of AI. Again we have all sorts of contradictory data on that right you know and it's

very difficult to say what is the true data on it right um and so we know that the world wants you know AI and soon AGI which is artificial general intelligence which is again very very u you know

water intensive energy intensive so what does that mean for countries like India and you know rest of Africa and Asia which are actually water stressed and how should these countries navigate it

um And the questions are open to both of you. So who would like to go first? &gt;&gt; Well, I I would say that actually it is quite clear what the water usage of AI is. There are people who have looked at

this very carefully and it's quite different from what is in the press often in a pretty [clears throat] hysterical way. The very best source for this is name is Andy Masley. I'll spell

that for you. A N D Y. Andy Masley. M A S L E Y and he has lots of information to say. One of his articles is called the AI water issue is fake. Fake means that people have actually exaggerated

things knowing that they were exaggerating it and it has misled so many people sadly. It has made people much more angry than is needed they need to be about the way that AI is using

water. AI is using water of course but uh most of it is uh recirculated. So when an AI data center needs cooling the water doesn't just get used once and thrown away. It goes round and round and

round again. So and it is much smaller than is used in many other industries. So there's a famous case in a county in America where the press said, "Oh my goodness, the data center is using so

much water, it's outrageous." Now, in fact, the golf courses were using 30 times as much water. And should we therefore say that people should stop playing golf and if you look at the tax

contribution of these two industries in that local area, the AI industry was making many more tax contributions. I'm not saying there's no issues. There are some issues especially more in India

than in America because there are of course areas in India where there are great extremes of scarcity. So we should look at them but there are good uh bits of information that the water use is not

the key determinant. We could talk later about the energy usage that's more serious. These things do burn up a lot of energy and that is a challenge. But I think the water story has been blown up

out of all proportion by quite irresponsible journalists who are catering for clicks and also by some writers who are ideologically committed to saying hey these big tech companies

are evil. These big tech companies are not perfect. They do lots of bad things in my view but the use of water is not in the evil category at all. It's quite manageable. Just one final point on

this. Many other things use water. So if you have a 400page book, of course that uses water to create it. How many GPT prompts could you use with the same amount of water? You can actually have

more than 1 million GPT prompts for the amount of water that is used to create a single 400page book. So shall we say for the sake of water shortages, we'll stop creating books? Uh shall we stop all the

other things we do with water? No. So we need to be realistic here and there are good sources. &gt;&gt; Thank you David. U any reflections on

that? &gt;&gt; I think there's nothing much to add but thanks for putting that in perspective David. I think I would rather go from sinning to virtue signaling for the

expense that if there are big investments that are happening in AI anyway as well use that to bring that investments into public water infrastructure because they need supply

of water. So maybe we should probably use the put them the responsibility of moving a piece of that a small portion of that into bringing water treatment plants reusable water treatment plants

which end up benefiting the city and the region as much as it benefits them because of course they need high quality water which means that the secondary and tertiary quality of water is there for

the rest of the the society to use. So I would probably you spin this question and saying how can that ad contribute to better usage of water society because of the investments happening in AI. That's

one way and kind of create them a situation of how they'll be able to trace and prove the responsibility side of making that water available for the rest of society through any side of

water take credits and things like that. So I probably use that as the problem of abundance of AI and AI data centers as a way to solve the problem of the rest of society as a benefit benefit extraction

more than sending them to one side and of course comparing them with Gulf or the other areas of water consumption. But yeah, that's about it. &gt;&gt; Okay. Um so just building on what David

said right um suppose we get the plumbing of AI right then what are the policy implications that the government needs to think about to really harness AI for water residents

&gt;&gt; AI for water I think for me fundamentally um if there is a way for regulators to bring in some sort of a public private policy envelope uh for for every every dollar of

investment you're making in AI Does it create a half a dollar uh of of investments in the public water infrastructure as a good way of how you can allow them the space, the land and

and and the energy supply that they need and also the water supply as a way to drive that into investments. I spoke about that. So that's one probably a policy intervention. The other policy

intervention is to sort of allow for a lot more of of reporting of usage of water and and use use a way to uh sort of bring their water water assets digitized and made available and sort of

use some of those uh as a way of bringing the other water assets in the space. So I think there's a way of bringing that of digitization digital infrastructure based usage and of course

thinking of about creating shared water treatment plant infrastructures and and allocating at the time of less use especially I mean I know understand that AI is intensive loads uh but given that

there can be some variable load most of that water can be used for serving other purposes in the city so it's more about co-development and co-investment sort of a thesis what I would encourage the

policy think about at the moment yeah &gt;&gt; I I definitely agree with you know disclosure and transparency when it comes to the uh water footprint and I agree with David that it is blown you

know beyond proportion but there's also a significant need to you know have some kind of transparency around that because what's happening is the only way to stop having data centers coming in highly

water stretched region is to firstly know um you know what is the cost of the water that's been required there um and any thoughts on uh that from David around policy implications or the what

the government needs to really think about when it comes Well, I think that the ordinary citizen can play a role here, too. We citizens are sometimes guilty for just

prioritizing convenience and short-term economic boosts. Whereas I think it would be much better for the whole water supply if there's much more focus on can we really

trust people and if there are suppliers who are found out to be misleading in their data not reporting things accurately. I would like to see a ground swell public reaction against them. Not

that hey this is acute this is uh attractive this is low price there should be much more focus on let's have a reliable information and this will put more pressure on these companies more

generally why don't we have enough data and suja was earlier talking about we've had a poverty of data in this one problem is that people did collect data nobody could do much with it was just a

huge morass well now AI has an amazing ability to process data and make sense out of And so this is the time to put more sensors in place. Uh especially sensors can be quite low cost in many

places detecting water pressure, detecting the composition of the water and it can detect earlier when there's something wrong with the filters. For example, the filters that are used to

clean water, when do they need to be replaced? And uh if there is enough sensors there, we can end up with just in time replacement of water filters rather than them getting too old.

they're not doing a good job or unnecessarily changing them ahead of schedule. So with more data uh with AI that's interpreting that data, there's a possibility for a very positive feedback

cycle provided there is a priority on the data being reliable and trustworthy rather than being massaged and manipulated for PR purposes. So the pop the the the normal citizen should be

campaigning for let's have some honesty in data please. Let's have the businesses that we can rely on rather than just the ones who offer us some trinkets or similar.

&gt;&gt; Thank you David. I think that's a very very valid point and very important as well. Um we will now open the floor for audience Q&amp;A. Please raise your hands if you have

questions. um introduce yourself and your organization and keep your questions brief. Thank you. &gt;&gt; In the front please. &gt;&gt; My name is Da Sitharam. I advise

companies on technology strategy and innovation. Uh so one thing that I want to ask you is um you know like the there are the secondary uses of water you know water used for energy generation water

significant amount of water is used in semiconductor manufacturing. So usually what happens is the u the people who are at the lower uh end of the economic spectrum get impacted a lot

more. You know there is a water shortage. So like one story I heard is the people in Fiji are not getting the fresh water because of the Fiji water bottle you know that gets exported to

Europe right so how do we make sure all this AI development and technology can be equitable that again we don't you know create more wealth for very small percentage of people and but the all the

other significant population percentage of the population suffer from this development and Water is a very very basic resource. You know, it's not like something else. Actually,

&gt;&gt; this is a very important question. With AI, we have the possibility for the biggest inequality of all time. Sadly, AI has the ability to do so much. The successful companies with AI stand to be

the wealthiest, the most powerful in the history in the last many decades, maybe going back further. And so we have to be aware of this is a possible downside of AI. In the

beginning I said there are many opportunities. One of the biggest risks is that indeed it will lead to inequalities. And again we need uh popular action against this and it's not

something that you or I as an individual can do. It's something we we can do together. Now on the question of which kind of water is used for all these different things. It turns out that

there's different qualities of water. There's drinkable water and non-drinkable water. And for energy generation, you can get by with a lot less lower quality of water. So

sometimes this is misled as well. It's part of the explanation. People say, "Oh, look, uh, data centers, they use so much water because there's cooling, but also the energy generation that goes

behind it to create the energy that the data center uses." Well, in that latter case, that can use lower quality water. And so, first of all, there must be citizens

pressure and there must of course be politicians that listen to that and respect it and who tax the successful companies, frankly. But also, there must be an understanding of the different

qualities of water. But no, I think you're right. There are risks here and we have to pay attention. And if we are careless, we will end up in a future that was nothing like as good as we'd

hoped it would be. Thank you very um do we have any other questions? Yes, please. &gt;&gt; Hello David and all the panelists. This is Samat. I'm the innovation ambassador

with the government of India and the spokesperson of NCAP. So my uh question is uh how AI can benefit the climate vulnerable communities basically the indigenous communities who are currently

suffering from the digital divide because from the part where I come from uh like a lot of communities are facing water scarcity and other climate vulnerabilities and the issues are

somewhere also risen by the industrial uh interventions and the minings into that area but that particular communities the indigenous communities are already facing the catastrophe of

digital divide. So how AI can help them build their own climate and water resilience. Thanks. &gt;&gt; Do you want to &gt;&gt; so one of the keep one of the things

that we keep talking about um you know most often we forgive this part that I think the one of the biggest expectations from AI is how do we raise the ground and not raise the ceiling for

everybody society where it is rather than waiting for another 500 million people to get convers with AI. So I think one this is a human AI interaction definitely I mean that's an area human

technology interaction is an area where significantly we need to work hard for example today uh in a few days time I think you'll see a farmer doing an energy trade in India uh not because

it's easy to do energy trading think about it we don't even want to test the meter if it goes wrong but imagine a farmer actually selling energy to somebody a tailoring lady in Delhi from

Mir if that's happening it's because we AI is actually making the complex complexity of that interaction with any formal systems interactions whether it's bureaucratic, industrial, uh simplified.

So it kind of eases the way in which people cannot go. So I think AI divide doesn't compound uh AI digital divide doesn't compound AI divide. I think it works the other way. So I think we

should use AI to solve for that. Having said that, I think for business community especially dealing with problems uh it's one of those things we we need to find a way to create an

infrastructure that allows for contextual solutions to emerge. Uh the way we solve for water and other problems are very very different from where we are solving for industrial

reuse of water and that for you know remote uh indigenous communities requirements of water. So this is exactly what I was trying to say we need to build very specific contextual

solutions and for that what could be those infrastructure building blocks that can be made available for somebody in that area to think about solutions along with the government or social

entrepreneurs or anybody who's enthusiast starting to work with it. I think that part requires firstly unlocking the whole data side of it. I think there is a critical data unlocking

part of the building block that I think if somewhere we can figure that out and if there's a natural incentive for that to happen more often maybe there are solutions at least that's one one of the

other mistake but I'm sure they would have &gt;&gt; yeah so India's problem with water isn't one of absolute scarcity there is a lot of water especially during the monsoon

ones the problem instead is that that leaks it's misallocated there's so much water that is wasted in agriculture and it's hard for me to say that because I'm not a farmer although my grandparents

were farmers but uh the case is that people are following time or traditions of watering during the certain calendar months of the year and that's not always appropriate so if they can be more

sensitive there are huge amounts of water savings there it's also huge amounts of water lost in leaks uh where I come from in the UK it's a it's a national disgrace the water companies

aren't doing enough to address the leaks but I'm I'm told it's the same here in India and if the AI can be used to detect the leaks that can avoid fixing climate change issues I I think the role

of AI there is going to be to accelerate better solar energy and better wind and wave energy and make it cheaper so that everybody is happy to convert to clean energy as opposed to the dirty energy.

just preaching at people which we did for decades and saying thou shalt not use dirty energy didn't work because the dirty energy was often a lot cheaper than the clean energy but thankfully due

to technological progress the clean energy has now in many cases got a lot cheaper and there are many wonderful jobs in the green economy AI can accelerate that and make these things

even work better and that's probably how we can make a bigger dent on the elephant in the room which is the acceler accelerating climate change. &gt;&gt; Thank you, David. Do we have any other

questions? We still have 5 minutes. &gt;&gt; Talking about water usage being a disgrace. You know, I come from a city where I just heard that the non-revenue water is as 30 34%. And I still look at

why my bills so cost me and I'm paying tons of money to get safe drinking water in my place. And I think I'm probably a part of the the top 2% of the of the city that that that kind of has easy

access to water. But it's it's it's an important point and I think this part about observability of water use and utilization is such a critical aspect and if AI can solve for that I think

that's a huge leg up in in addressing the other problems I can't we can't you know emphasize that enough it's a it's one of the number one things whether it's industrial urban and others I think

&gt;&gt; having observability of water so critical and solving for leaks becomes a very important one too and it's it's a low hanging fruit that we can always go at

Thank you. So what we have seen in the human history is if one group of people get a very powerful technology right uh they kind of dominate and you know take the

resources of all the other communities like what happened in the European colonization you know sorry to bring up an unpleasant aspect of the history but they were able to do the industrial

revolution and you know what the risk happened to Africa and Asia. So how do we uh guarantee that the same thing because this the same kind of asymmetry the people who can use the AI who have

access to um you know AI and AGI in fact couple of people from Google quit saying that the AGI is already available within within Google and I don't know how true it is or whatever but my my question

remains right I mean you can't say that a colonization did not happen and there were very bad consequences Right. So, uh how do we ensure that the same thing is not going to be repeated with such a

very powerful technology? Uh you know that can fundamentally alter the human history. &gt;&gt; Sometimes of course technologies start off and only used by the rich and

powerful and then later get spread more widely. That was very much my experience in the smartphone industry. When I started with smartphones in the late 1990s, there were a very small number of

people who used them and they were really expensive and now they've become so all all over the place. So that is the desirable trend that the benefits of AI will come to everybody. But you're

entirely right. There's nothing predetermined about it and there's plenty of bad examples as well. And the solution isn't always economics because it's often better for these large

companies to keep their inequalities in place. The solution has to be politics and politics has sometimes worked at least on the national level. So in the Americans in the late 1800s and early

1900s they broke up the large uh uh trusts they broke up the various large corporations trust busting. This is the Sherman Act. Teddy Roosevelt and others did it and they stopped the individual

large companies having too much power. And that doesn't apply to the case that you mentioned, which was individual countries throwing their weight around in very destructive and very regrettable

ways. Which is why we're going to need not just better politics, but dare I say it, better geopolitics. And the role that India can have on the international stage, I think, is really incredible

because India straddles the worlds of having a lot of underdeveloped but having a lot of marvelous development too. So I think India needs to speak up on the world stage as it is doing as it

is doing by hosting this amazing event in fact and emphasizing you know it is a very sad future if we end up with this inequality. It's actually worse for the oligarchs too because although the

oligarchs may be wealthy they have to live in a state of perpetual security. It will be better for everybody if we really can share this around but it's not going to happen by default. It's

going to need politics and geopolitics to make it happen. Um it's one of the things and just to add to what David said I think it's one thing to think about AGI and the range

of abundant intelligence and the other thing about the usability of it I think usability is very contextual right I think uh there will be enough us use cases where I think they can attract and

attract a lot more capital and attention and that's going to crowd out capital for the rest of the use cases that's a big risk but it also doesn't mean that that's the only way uh you can think

about find adapting AI. So this is a point that I earlier mentioned that it's it's it's up to the country not of course politics political you know alignments are important but also think

of a way of how do you make this diffusion happen in a way that is non-exclusive and non violence creating open rates it's fundamentally important and I think it's fair to say that India

has built infrastructure where nobody has a kill switch I mean think about nobody has a kill switch on any of this infrastructure so I mean if one of the big UPI apps goes down it doesn't mean

that the UK is not I mean there other apps that you can use with so we've been building open rails so this whole technolal approach of building that sovereign sort of a sense of autonomy

and control around how we bring this technology into the society is an important way of thinking and that's that's one of the approaches in which we can probably make sure more equitable

distribution of the value of AI and more contextual applications of it I mean it's very important consideration I'm sure some of that will be discussed during the sum

&gt;&gt; well thank you both for sharing your insights. I'm sure you've given enough food for thought to the audience. Um, now moving on to the closing reflections. Um, the prime minister of

India will be here. What message do you want to give him and the business leaders, the political parties when it comes to AI and water and you both have three minutes each?

&gt;&gt; You want to go first? &gt;&gt; Message for the political leaders, Indian prime minister. Well, I will say what I said at the beginning. AI is going to provide many new opportunities

that are even more than today. You make sure you have people studying them, but studying them with their eyes really paying attention not to be misled by all the hype. There is a heck of a lot of

hype that is misleading. But that doesn't mean to say the whole subject is wrong. In fact, the subject has enormous possibilities. So, you need to understand it. You need to understand

also that as well as bringing incredible opportunities, there are huge risks. The energy risk is one. There are people who could use the AI to do all kinds of bad things. Not just bad from a a business

point of view, that business that ignores the environment or ignores externalities. People could use the same technology differently. I've been talking about using the technology to

make things cleaner. Somebody could use a into that technology to make the water more polluted than before. Why would somebody do that? Well, most of us wouldn't, but there are a few people

sadly who are like that. So that's what AI could do if there are no guardrails on it. So my message for the Indian prime minister is you better be sure there are appropriate guard rails on

this. We have the guardrails. It's an incredible future. The other thing I would say is that you've got to design for agility here. This already said in the beginning by SE this is When change

is happening, people have got to become comfortable with being uncomfortable. They've got to design for change. You got to expect the unexpected. And that requires emotional resilience rather

than just water resilience. It requires drawing on a depth of values and culture which the Indian nation has historically been very good at. So it shouldn't lose that ability to cope with disruption. It

should keep that underlying emotional resilience and unless you can do this, you will not get the full benefits of this technology. &gt;&gt; Thank you, David. I hope the business

leaders and politicians are listening. That was a very sound advice. Sujit, &gt;&gt; I'll probably keep it under a minute, but you know, you know, building on what David just said, if if this is an

opportunity to say this to the prime minister, one, I think water resilience is a complex problem. It is therefore okay to not have all the answers. &gt;&gt; Okay.

&gt;&gt; Uh number one. Number two, um I think um and and because it's so uncertain in its evolution, u I would say that it is it is also t unfair for only government to think of this as a problem to solve. I

think there should be a way to distribute this solving to the larger population citizens whether it's activism or by participation in a formal way. How do you distribute that

solvability to to industry, citizens, society is an important way to think about it. And one way of doing that is to set up open rails with safeguards and allow for innovation to happen at scale.

And to make that innovation happen and to get the value of AI, you got to bring you got to solve for the data silos. And the way you solve for data silos is to make people bring their you give it back

to the people the data and the other this and make it more transparent, more verifiable, more trustable. Once you have that possible, I think you're reducing the cost of innovation that can

happen on top of it and innovation not just by a few but by many across civil society, government and markets and that's one of the ways in which you want to set the playground and not look at

you know solving the problem by yourself. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Um and now just moving to the key takeaways from this session. Um there are so many important points but I

think one one point that has resonated with both speakers is strengthening of the data architecture that is important for harnessing AI for water resilience. So that's number one. Uh I think another

one is you know seeing water sector as a beneficiary of of a you know AI and you know maybe soon AGI um and also related to that is having the right kind of policies so stringent policies around

disclosure of water footprint um because without that effective planning is impossible and then obviously building the future ready infrastructure for it that's where Sujit's expertise comes in

um and also repositioning blue infrastructure is foundational you know so investors should treat this infrastructure as a core economic asset. As we said, this is something which

drives global stability and done right, you know, we have we I think both the speakers have painted a very optimistic and practical picture. So done right, AI won't strain our water

system, it will strengthen it and I think India has a unique opportunity to show the world how it can be done right. And with that uh we will conclude today's session. Thank you everyone for

joining us today. Thank you to our speakers. Um, thank you the audience. [applause] We we will have our QR codes displayed on the screen.
