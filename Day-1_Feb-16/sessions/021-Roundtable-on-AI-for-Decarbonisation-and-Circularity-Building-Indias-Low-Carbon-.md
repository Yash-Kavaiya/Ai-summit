## 📝 Transcript

part when it comes to uh a circular economy. So, so uh uh AI has a very important role and now I come to the solution adaptability which was the original uh question to uh us. So uh

fortunately uh in our uh organization AI is helping us a lot. So one is uh in every city we have bins. So we have uh AI models which product predicts level of those bins. Based on the fill

level we send vehicles to empty those bins and uh it save saves not only fuel but it also save the incidents where we have uh places which becomes instead of bin is

pile. Uh that is number one. Number two, uh uh we have uh we have a mechanism uh uh during collection uh we send notifications to our citizens. So uh before collecting their waste they get a

notification or a jingle so rather on their mobile phone and they can keep their waste outside. So they don't uh uh uh so so so in that case they are always informed. So they know when their

vehicle is about to come they how they can uh send their uh waste into the uh into the vehicles and uh if I talk about adaptability so uh now 36 municipal corporations are using our solution and

citizens are using our solution. So this is about us. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much Abhishek. Um Rohan I'm going to bounce that from what we heard uh from Vant and Abhishek. I think as

startups they have a perspective to how they could serve the space uh with that innovation but from your position as part of digital enterprise for Maruti you would see a number of such

innovations that you are attempting to work with attempting to embed within your own operations attempt to possibly take to market jointly two thoughts that I want to ask from you

as you've seen these innovations where have you seen opportunities where they didn't exist for Mari Suzuki or your own perspective until yesterday almost like saying I couldn't have done

this without an AI enabled perspective until yesterday or here is how I could do this and this is a faster better cheaper more effective way of that effort to decarbonization or that effort

to a greener supply chain or greener manufacturing that we aspire Thanks Keshan. This mic is working. Thanks. So I represent an organization called as Marauti Suzuki India Limited.

We make cars traffic jam. So pleasure to be here. I'm not sure whether all of you are aware that we also engage with startups. Of course,

other than making cars, we have multiple startup programs through which we collaborate with startups right from seed stage to even pre series A series startups and one of the uh one of our

very strong partners is NSRL which Van is heading and we are very proud to partner with them. So what we have seen over the years is uh technology has no boundaries uh and technology has no

owners. uh as as a legacy player in the in the Indian uh market for the last 40 42 years we cannot u claim ownership of every new technology which is going to hit the road tomorrow. So challengers

which are the startups are actually making a lot of uh lot of not only noise but also coming out with some novel concepts which are compelling large OEMs like Maruti Suzuki to adopt and change

very fast. That is one of the primary reasons that Maruti said okay let us collaborate with startups. The question which you ask uh are there any gaps which startups are able to fulfill which

Maruti could not do it on their own? Like if you were to ask me about AI when we started this program in 2019 we hardly had any data science engineers in Maruti. We did not have any AI engineers

in Maruti. Handful of them or not even more than five six. Did we have any one who understood quantum computing? Answer is no. We heard about the concept but no use cases to uh test that technology.

Even a technology like AR and VR. I mean Facebook changed its name to meta. But before that we didn't have people to experiment with that kind of technology. So one of the

quick wins for us was to collaborate with startups because they were bringing in the fresh perspective, fresh energy and not only challenging the uh uh dominant players in the market but also

at the same time I I believe they were looking for support from large corporates as well because to validate what they have built in their own labs and we saw the bright talent in India

from the premier institutes like IIT they were not taking corporate jobs they wanted start something. So that became like a natural collaboration and natural partnership for us uh to collaborate

with startups and the use cases which we could not run inhouse became much better to run with startups and uh we only do paid pilots. We used to run great pilots with these startups and what we found

was not only uh we were successful in uh testing those technologies but the costs at which we were able to scale them were like onetenth and at times 120th of the price which large tech firms would

charge us. So that's the kind of economics and mathematics which enabled us to pursue this startup engagement for the last six years now and uh so far 6,000 plus startups we have screened 200

uh engagements are going on 32 startups have now become our tier one partners business I think almost more than 200 cr plus given to these 32 companies in the last six six uh years so that's the kind

of gap uh which they are able to fulfill and this partnership. Thank you Rohan. Um Shakam u Rohan S's perspective is the role of startups and

how young innovation young maybe by age but young more by tenure in adapt adoption within a large corporate enterprise or or an environment ecosystem has or is driving a particular

perspective change. you would have seen it probably from a different perspective which is uh in my mind I'm thinking the role of EPR the role of ESG practices uh and policy and how they have enabled

change change or driven decarbonization initiatives or circularity initiatives not just within as a company but also from a larger global perspective you're a large global organization with offices

presence across tens of countries you also engage in enabling your clients and partners to adopt and transform faster. What has been the role of this kind of a policy intervention? Where has it

created boundaries? And I'm going to ask this nicely. Where has this created a headache? Where has this accelerated a change you would have wanted to see until yesterday?

&gt;&gt; Thank you so much. And I'm glad you qualified that we are not young. We are 80year-old company with a huge and a wonderful legacy which we very proud of. So thanks for that.

you know as as vibro as all of you would know 66% of our ownership is actually uh for uh you know just devoted [clears throat] to philanthropic initiative and even if I don't talk

about uh found I mean CSR but even under the philanthropic initiative I think focuses on u you know sustainability whether it is with livelihoods whether it is

through education whether it's healthare and I think that is the foundational principle that guides our business uh overall and um you know while you spoke about u you know clients and that's a

wonderful thing that you said because as organizations uh like ours we believe that unless you know decarbonization sustainability is u you know deeply integrated with your business strategy I

think it will always remain in the benefit and therefore it is as much a responsibility of the organization you know take up thought leadership as much maybe you know as a policy uh

initiatives of the government. um to respond to your specific questions on policy initiatives you know um it it is a great beginning you know when you have a policy uh that is framed

by a country which kind of outlines the vision which outlines uh some targets I think it's a wonderful beginning because that uh gives every organization to kind of build on it you know it becomes it

becomes a reason and a justification for organizations start thinking about it and set programs. But I think all of us agree that decarbonization is extremely contextual,

is sector dependent and horribly complex and therefore you know uh for any policy perspective it has to be multistakeholder uh but also sectoral guidelines right um

you know from my experience and this is not necessarily uh related to u you know policies for decarbonization or reducing carbon footprint. But you know anything that succeeds is typically on

collaboration. Um and it has to be a fine balance between you know incentives and puritive measures and uh celebrating successes sharing uh you know best practices making it available for

everybody I think becomes extremely extremely critical whether it's the government who does it or uh whether you know as organizations we take that ownership right. U now um when it comes

to customers and as we work with our global customers, I think um what what defines our engagement with them is a is you know understanding or mapping that you know force is of influence in this

uh decarbonization cycle. You know policy is one of them but that's not all. Uh you know uh beyond policy there are change levers. levers such as you know access to alternative fuels uh

access to renewable energy which really become important because you know when you get down to operations or operational decarbonization some of these things become critical if you

don't have access to them then you know what what are your change but even beyond that of course then there are the enablers and that's where a lot of the technology comes in uh including AI uh

when we look at tech enablers you know uh we are in AI summit So um needless to say AI um when we talk about AI we also know that AI is as good as it's data and therefore I think data becomes

fundamental and critical for any AI to succeed right and uh you know in this segment it's not really general purpose AI but like I had mentioned it's sectoral it's contextual so there's a

lot of work that that that maybe you know will will continue to be done here uh specifically focused in in this area. But you know having said that it is it is also let us not undermine u

technology innovation, process innovation and engineering innovation. I think that is critical. You need alternate materials, you need process innovation, you need you need solutions

to store carbon in case you can't decarbonize completely. Let's recognize that you know it is a long long journey right and I think it's a collection of all these that will actually culminate

into you know real operational decarbonization and finally you know you know going back the whole circular to the success of a policy &gt;&gt; there are a couple things you mentioned

which are uh which I took furious notes on uh which are I'd like to say provocative and one of them you said We need to look at incentives and we need to look at punitive measures. Um,

what do you have in mind? &gt;&gt; Well, I I was hoping you wouldn't really pick on that one, but but you know, I think I think it's already there if you look at it. There are standards.

&gt;&gt; I'll paraphrase myself, right? Very often when through our open innovation when we look at engaging with corporates to help them in their uh decarbonization journey there is an implicit expectation

that the cost in some form needs to be bound by I want to say a broader society in the sense the positive externality of decarbonization within a corporate initiative belongs to a larger community

and therefore either the costs or the technology adoption or the margin offsets in some form have to be swallowed from outside of a P&amp;L. Um I don't know there is an argument to

be made that there is justification for positive externality being being funded or resourced from an outsider. There is also an argument to be made that this is intrinsic to the product or service

being created which means the cost of carbon is intrinsic to the pen I'm using. I will pause. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, um let me let me uh kind of uh

respond it maybe in a circular manner and forgive me for that but I think that perspective is important. You know when you actually measure uh you know the impact of your operations. I think you

really need to expand your time and your boundaries horizon. Not just time horizon but also enterprise horizon. You know you We talked about the cost of this uh you know the part cost of this

uh this particular device that we are using but you know when you look at the whole value chain of it it extends so much beyond a single organization it extends so much also beyond you know

that instant of time that it's um that it's that as organization and as society we have to find a way to kind of you know measure it and set realistic I I think you know for any success the

realistic target is extremely extremely critical. Um I spoke about business I spoke about tech innovation. I think one point that I missed is about business innovation. I think uh you know just our

approach to uh measuring success of an enterprise um would be very important because you know if I am plowing back my profits for this which does not necessarily have an immediate return I'm

going to suffer as a business. So I think there is therefore you know that I might be punished by the markets. So therefore what do I do and that's where the externalities of you know uh support

incentives or or you know Whatever it is and and let me tell you that I would be fooling everybody if I say that I might have an answer. I don't. I only am thinking like all of us

are and wondering you know what the future holds for that makes sense. Um Sapna ma'am I'm going to bounce off from what ma'am told us. U she started off by also saying the

role of philanthropy in in creating the kind of change we want to see. U and from your perspective also as part of a very large global company very

passionate about the space of decarbonization um what's been your experience in CSR or philanthropic capital as in my mind I'm

imagining this as seed capital as sort of the early risk capital to creating an innovation that might scale it has in I imagine it has a plowback benefit just the nature of your own business ch you

must have had experience with this you must have grappled with this &gt;&gt; thank you so I think for those who don't know the company in the room I just quickly like to introduce the company

as is a French multinational that builds trains so some of the problems that Rohan's cars create we help sorry Rohan you gave me an opening into that so you can't blame me we build metro systems I

hope most of actually used and avoided the traffic outside by using the Delhi Metro which is an astorm built train. We're also very proud to say that most of the trains and the metro systems in

the country have something that comes from us. Now I think sustainability as a concept is core to the company because the product itself is sustainable right I think if you look at all transport

modes whether that's air road by is the most sustainable in terms of its emissions profile right that think adoption and the usage of rail even in welldeveloped countries and continents

like Europe that have a very very welldeveloped rail infrastructure continues to remain very very low we need to massively kind of advocate for that shift

to actually reduce emissions I think that coming back to Ganesha's original question now there are a few things that as a company we trying to do you know number one driven itself is sustainable.

We're trying to see how we can make it more sustainable, right? So, a number of things that have already spoken about in terms of the kind of materials we use, the kind of alternate fuels that are

used in the first company that actually has a hydrogen train and operation in Germany, you know, like all of those practices and I'm sure we'll speak more on that I

think through the panel. The company is kind of doing R&amp;D and all of that to see how it can improve its sustainability profile. Now that said, I think the problems are humongous and we would like

to focus on what we believe we are the best at which is rail technology, right? Everything else that kind of accelerates and improves outcomes and I think AI as a technology I think is helping us do

exactly that. It's helping us improve outcomes and that's what we need to demonstrate to our customers to be able to actually use AI at scale across rail and that's somewhere where startups come

up similar to what Rohan said you know we have a program running with NSRC as well to see how startups that are currently working because I think what I've seen specifically in the mobility

ecosystem actually is that most of the startups today are actually innovating especially when it comes to innovating for decarbonization or for circularity. They're usually doing that keeping EVs

in mind in mind. You know, we're not really innovating at scale for rail. And I guess where our interventions go to is that a lot of the innovations that are

actually being thought of for rail could very easily be applied to mass transit, right? Including the materials, the kind of chairs that we build, the handles that we use, the plastic end of life

recycling. We use a lot of components in our you know how those components are built. So yes, we are looking at working to your point Ganesh, we are looking at

working with the startup ecosystem to see how we can bring in some of these ancillary technologies and actually improve outcomes and demonstrate outcomes faster to our customers.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. Um I'm going to come back on a couple things you said there. couldn't just spin it till I get a thought from Tibjet sir because of a few things that we just

spoke about. Um, one of the things that worries me is um this is a conversation on AI and and and how AI can help in decarbonization. Um,

increasingly it is one of the largest consumers of energy. Uh and somewhere in my mind that seems like a very peculiar uh unless you say I'm going to use fire to fight fire, it sounds like a very

peculiar uh circular logic to say I'm going to generate energy to fight uh to reduce energy and carbonization and energy is the largest producer of greenhouse gases. uh and then followed

by mass transportation, transportation in general and then probably agriculture, urbanization in maybe in that order. How should we imagine this as as each of

us think about economic progress and each about each of us think about economic progress in a manner that we are decarbonizing or have a more a circularitydriven

approach to I want to say our livelihoods. It might sound very sort of metaphysical. Um how should we think about this? And that cuts across am I a startup am I a corporate uh

am I a consumer a citizen how should we be thinking about this thanks thanks Ganesh um wonderful question the one word that uh while coming to this place I was looking at the in the streets the

government has put up boards all inclusive so what we have to think about the premise with which AI should be promoted in the context of India should all

inclusive number one. Number two, whether it is the Maruti or the storm or for that matter we pro computers or anything needs energy. So we have to see how do we decarbonize the energy and

whether AI can help us in decarbonizing the energy. Now AI is definitely needed for growth and to run the AI you need large amount of energy. Just to give a perspective to it, uh the data says that

by 2030 globally 1700 billion units of electricity would be required and to put that into perspective 1700 billion units of energy is consumed currently in India. So the total amount of

electricity that is getting consumed in India annually will be the requirement for AI only for AI running the AI models in 2030 globally. For India we need about 30 gawatt of

energy by 2030 just for running AI based data centers. How much is 30 gawatt? Roughly around 45 gawatt is the total hydropower capacity in India. 50 gawatt is the wind power capacity in India. So

you can say that 2/3 of the total hydro power capacity will be required just to run the AI models just I'm just trying to say that the the amount of energy that it is going to

consume. Now having said that uh let's turn to how AI can help in reducing that energy consumption and how it can help us in decarbonization our electricity grid. Now we are gradually moving

forward towards a more renewable grid. Uh we all know solar and wind are intermittent. So it's a variable renewable energy that is uh that will be needed.

A human way of computation cannot help in in understanding the variability and to know what is going to happen after say two hours or three hours or whatever

after one day. Now there are AI models now which can predict the u the solar radiation whether it is going to decrease or increase or whatever the wind speed whether it is going to

increase or decrease in the next uh say after 2 hours or 3 hours or maybe 24 hours later all these things have to be done by AI unless we have AI we cannot just predict all those models. So the

prediction have to done using AI models. Now that is on the supply side. On the demand side, AI can help us in better demand management. You have large hospitals,

large institutes, large offices. Uh the AI can actually understand what depending on the weather pattern whether all the assist should remain on or we can switch off few. So it can predict

all these things instead of manually doing all those things or through automat or through automation postevent doing those things. It can do it in advance help

reduce demand side management in in demand side management reducing the energy consumption also. So both on the supply side and on the demand side it can do wonderful work.

Now that's the one part of the story. Now the first part of the story that I started that it needs huge energy consumption to do all these things. You use a chat GPT prompt uh it consumes

huge amount of energy. You might think that okay In 5 seconds I'm getting my answer. But the amount of energy that is consuming to give you that answer is humongous.

Now how do you decarbonize the infrastructure that we are going to create for the EI? And that's the critical question for a country like India because debates are going on

whether we have if AI consumes so much of energy and if our manufacturing also needs a lot of energy because we are only 20% of our energy is electricity and if we have to increase that to 40%

that's the government target then we need a huge amount of electricity and if we divert that to EI then what will happen to our manufacturing that's that's a big debate that is going on and

we have to find an answer as a think tank as a person representing a think tank who have been working in the think tank sector for the last many many years. My job is to see that how do we

find those answers and and reach out to the government. So I would end with saying that AI can do wonderful things. It can it can it can make our life easier. It can make things much better

because it can but at the same time we have to see that how we do we make infrastructure that is required for AI processes decarbonized. uh just giving you an example for

example if you are to select a site say a data center site for an AI should I have the site in Bangalore or Mumbai or Delhi or some place where it is already a hot climate the I will produce

lot of heat now if you produce lot of heat the local environment the temperature will be will be more than the ambient the average temperature you need more AC and that becomes a via

cycle I can't allow a visious cycle to be created out of an AI. I have to create a virtuous cycle. So my site location, location choice of site, government need

to regulate that. Government might give incentives, tax incentives. Lot of these AI companies will come but there are lot of other things that the government has to do to see that AI is not creating

a problem instead of sol solving the problem. So that's what I say all inclusive models where you have to take care of not just the the AI models but also of everything around your

environment. Sir, I'm going to stick with you. I mean just as a corollery what one one reason why uh there is some effort in trying to see if we can put data centers in space

is because it reduces the power and cooling requirement right power from solar and cooling because it's above the ozone layer and so on. We'll see if that happens. Our challenge

to what you said maybe sir is u we are a coal country. 70% of energy still comes from coal. In fact the prediction is our coal requirements for energy will peak in 2035 which is we are still

accelerating and increasing our consumption of coal for the energy requirements that we currently have. And that requirement is going to go up over the next 10 years before it maybe peaks

and and plateaus down. If we have to shrink that or migrate that adoption curve out, you spoke about the supply side and demand side. We are attempting the supply side which is renewable

energy circularity that ma'am is talking about and so on. What can we do to to get inspired by what Vishaka ma'am said? What are the incentives and if I may punitive measures for demand side? How

can we encourage the largest consumers of energy which is energy infrastructure themselves technology now mass transportation urbanization to flip the grid?

Is there way to in my mind is there way to create larger supply side whether it is variable or static by influencing the demand side. &gt;&gt; Well yes definitely. So uh just to

correct you the government report says that 2030 in 2045 or beyond that poll will peak. So uh it's not 2035 for the simple reason that uh I that we are as I said we are using 1700 billion units of

electricity. Now our consumption will increase to about 4,000 billion units. out of that in percentage terms it will reduce the coal will reduce but in absolute terms steel will be consuming

roughly around 1 billion tons of uh coal for production of for &gt;&gt; and just to cor we we I'm not saying it negative we need that energy for the pace at which the economy is growing and

mechanizing so it is almost a mandatory requirement for our economic growth &gt;&gt; absolutely so for us electricity demand is important uh for a country like India energy security energy demand meeting

the energy demand aspiration and load these are important matters than environmental sustainability I'm being from the environment I'm saying that uh so we cannot set our context uh like the

western countries we have to set our own context now coming back uh to your question yes absolutely I think large consumers can flip to renewable energy large consumer nuclear bill has just

been passed I'm sure that uh some of the large corporates uh with private sector now being allowed to enter the nuclear sector some of big corporates uh will start investing uh small modular

reactors uh which there are only two operational reactors across the world but India has is has started redesigning its safe reactors the pressurized heavy water reactor to make it small modular

reactor and I think once that is done 5 megawatt reactor or 50 megawatt reactor can and if of course policies have to be designed on onuh the land requirement, the water requirement and other things

for these nuclear projects. I'm sure that some of the big corporates, steel industry, cement industry, data center, hydrogen plants, all these things can shift to nuclear which is a decarbonized

well. Of course, it has its own risk but uh in India we have not uh we had a very safe nuclear journey till now. So I'm sure that that will uh work. Uh renewable energy, variable renewable

energy or pump storage, hydro or hydro power. These are things which uh as a democracy we have to take care of many things. So sometimes they are slow in implementation. I think the government

is doing some work on that has already started uh decreas I reducing the time that is required for hydropower projects. Earlier it used to take four years to prepare a DPR. Now it takes two

years. So wherever possible time is being reduced so that we have such type of projects uh quickly set up in the country. The transmission is a big problem in the in the in in the country

to uh evacuate the power from solar and wind. Once that problem is resolved, many of the corporates can shift through open access the policy allows that uh to renewable energy. In fact uh I would say

I think uh probably Google is setting up a data center in India. I may be wrong. Yeah. Yeah. And they have entered into an agreement if I know correctly with NTPC to supply 2 gawatt of renewable

power. So if big companies start directly buying power from these renewable energy companies, the discom will also be saved in the sense that the companies will also be saved that they

will get get the money in time. So I think it's a win-win for all. It's just about some of the policies needs to be streamlined and things can happen. &gt;&gt; Thank you. I think that's that's a

powerful thought. I'm going to come back to you Sapna ma'am Rohan. Um on the conversation on circularity and based on what we spoke, one of the things that bothers me is the ability to adopt

circularity practices at scale, which is how can I produce, refuse, recycle at scale, especially in an industrial environment at in a consumer

environment, we try what we try. But the big impact comes when you're able to create circularity in a larger industrial environment look at alternative materials and so on. Um what

have been your experience maybe sapna with you uh what has been your experience in a corporate like yourself thinking about circularity embedded within product design or service

delivery design? &gt;&gt; Thank you Ganesh Gish. from two sides. Right? Now, you know, when you design a rail system, it's actually a system that you use over

30 to 40 years. So, really are the best circularity advantages at only designing for like end of life or is it actually making your daily operations more intelligent? Right? So I think our

experience has been that if you can embed circularity more at an operational level I think scaling that is potentially going to be quicker right now I'm

talking things like and let's come back I think to the subject at hand you know AI right like for an industrial company like ours you know where we are deploying it massively is actually at an

operational in terms of bringing advantages to customers, right? Whether that's predictive maintenance, you know, replacing components rather than at

fixed schedules and all of that, but if AI models actually throw up replacements quickly, you're actually reducing material consumption, right? Because you can maybe repair it quicker if you have

a model that throws up a problem rather than, you know, replacing it completely at a certain interval. So, material consumption reduces emissions reduce right and that

you know like those daily advantages actually compound massively when your asset life is about 30 to 40 years right so all of the things in terms of m you know material traceability yes they will

improve supply chains but it's going to take time for an industry like ours likewise I think you know Vishaka spoke about data I think we are massively trying to get hold of

data and for us you know once we hand over the asset to the operator a lot of the data needs to come to us you know from the operator of the system right we just build the system the operational

data has the key that actually will kind of influence massive decisions on reuse on recyclability and end of life really so you know from our perspective

Ganesh if we can just make everyday operations intelligent I That's where your massive circular gains can come in on long asset life.

&gt;&gt; Yeah. And that's why I think as a company that's why we are trying to massively focus on not to say the others aren't important. They are &gt;&gt; got one son.

&gt;&gt; Yeah. So let me let me try to answer it. Uh because it's an AI conference. the how we responsibly use AI and of course cut out use cases where we can have circularity and what ma'am just spoke

about. So in our in our organization we've kind of uh our AI governance is based on three core principles. uh I don't know I hope I pronounce it correct correctly it's so shina so it's

an abbreviation from u sanjzen which means dignity shinry means trust and cha means harmony so all the AI models platforms products bots whatever in house are based on

these three core principles of dignity trust and harmony When I say dignity, we don't want to build any platform which manipulates human behavior. We want to use AI as a tool which creatively helps

our own employees or customers and all the stakeholders. When I talk about trust, I should be able to trust the model which I'm using in terms of transparency, dependability

and explainability. So whatever output is coming out of the models or the platform which I'm using should be customer and when I say harmony it should be aligned with the business

goals of the organization. It should not be that I'm doing something else and my company's goals are very different. Secondly it should be aligned with the goals of the society as well. So that is

why harmony is very important. Just to give you an example, we deal with a lot of customer information because a lot of customers interact with us and then we have also built AI models to predict

which customer is the hot customer, which customer will be is is more probable to buy my car. So if customer has queried for airbags, I have to provide the correct information. If he's

asking for two airbags or six, if the car has six, I have to say six. If I'm giving incorrect information about the airbags, train incorrect information whe the car is available in diesel or

petrol. Customer is trusting the model. Customer is not even aware who is interacting with the with the customer. The accuracy of data when I said dignity, trust and harmony all combined

actually helps us accelerate the path to innovation and what we are trying to achieve together to have a sustainable environment where not only uh uh we sell more cars but in a sustainable way. We

produce in a more sustainable way and we take care of our employees in a more sustainable way to have greener better future. Fascinating. Thank you. We're close to

top of the hour. Um I'm going to throw it to our two founders. Um based on this conversation, based on your own experience, u I have two questions for for two of you and maybe

starting with you Vinnie. One is in your journey as an innovator fighting in the I use the word fighting nicely uh in the decarbonization circularity spaces. You spoke a little bit about how AI has

helped you uh in in an ideal world. What would you like to see? What would you like to see in your journey? What would you like to see in the form of any form of adaptation, mitigation, migration in

the environment you work with, which could be your customers, your partners, the interoperability you might aspire to? What would you want to see? &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. So

coming back to AI, a lot all of my peers have spoken a lot about AI. We we a company we're just starting off and for for as far as I understand in the industrial operations AI could

not possibly is not possibly helping us a lot right now. But using some tracking mechanism other than the RFID chips which is RFID tags which could be a little more smoother for us. we could

actually have operations which can be streamlined and smoothened for us to actually uh deliver to our customers also because we are a B2B organization and trust is something that is required

by most of the customers that we deal with. Um some some sort of uh tracking solution using an AI tool could could help us a lot. Uh apart from that predictive AI in terms of creating

hotspots as to where uh the end of life solar could we have a predict in the first leg of the process recycling process of it. How AI could

also help us because For my industry specifically, we deal with a lot of metals. So how the price metals and trends of the metals are actually shaping

in or going to we recently saw with silver going up and down weeks. what is the best time to sell these metals out and

to get the best optim. Um apart from that something that mentioned as well that you also need to

what our company has been doing apart from this. So I mean that is something that could could Thanks so much.

Uh yeah, I'm in the industry for last years and uh I've seen uh like uh he has already mentioned about RFID tax. So uh we initially use

RFID cards installing it at every household to track whether we are able to or not and every RFID identity and so it help us in identify

each and every picked up or not and later actually play those RFID cards with tried and uh uh it was successful. So, so the way technology and AI come

the models which we are able to uh very uh so what I see difference I think uh very soon we'll start optimiz

uh though but think consumption is the same time is going to or I believe there is going to

number two specifically uh one of us be it a manufacturer be it a consumer, be it a recycler with the help of AI we can uh send you know stage

whatever in our hand uh and uh so for example if I'm a consumer uh with and what would be the right way uh I can

I can recycle I should send it what what kind of effort I should uh make so that uh I I I become a uh responsible citizen uh uh got uh let's suppose today we haveated 10

plastic and same time we are a 10 tons of plastic at the end we are able to not only but with the economy also so for all Everybody

uh helping everybody in right things uh creating things uh moving things toward the uh with the help of AI able to and one

and yeah yes yes I'll just quickly wrap up so so if reliance on virgin material will significantly reduce and this is not uh

this is not uh only which you know something which we can afford the very soon there is there is we we are not going to we we we are not in a position to afford it it is not going to be an

option. We had to uh we had to do it. So hopefully uh AI is going to help us uh in that way. &gt;&gt; Perfect. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. And we have a huge round of

applause for our panelists. So on that note, we have the nodal officers from the India AI mission who are here to facilitate the speakers. Uh so one by one, we can go first with Abhishek. Uh

Richa, please. Uh can we have a huge round of applause guys? Thank you so much. Vishaka ma'am as well ma'am. Thank you. Thank you so much
