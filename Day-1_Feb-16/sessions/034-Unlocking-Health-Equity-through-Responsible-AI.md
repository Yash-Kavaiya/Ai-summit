## 📝 Transcript

very very different as you said it's very different world you apply general to specialized the second one is and that's actually very interesting challenge can we

explain how the solution actually works do we actually able to to say how for example answer talk about it later it's very very import

cases to ensure that these are trusted solutions. So traceability for example of the evidence is very very important. How can we explain how the answer comes about and especially health

professionals who make always make the decisions they need to be able to trust that answer that comes about need to understand where it's from. And I was very excited to hear for example that

from a um medical education perspective in India um that um now training AI trainings are mandatory which is I think an incredible step forward. Good. solution very very important. Then we

talked about bias how we can help to prevent bias and bias starts actually at the very first step when a clinician asks the question to the AI tool in the way of how they ask the question. So

what you what you include in the question that you ask and what you exclude in the question you ask can make a huge difference. I think you all experience it when you use your AI tool

when you prompt. Um it makes a huge difference how you prompt, how you ask the question. And then last but not least, it's about respect and privacy. It's about especially in healthare again

the data that you share with the tool should really be um yeah it should while there can be utility of having that data help to improve the products we need to ensure that privacy is respected um that

the data is not shared broadly not shared for different purposes. It always needs to be along the intended use of of of the solution. And what we have worked on are these these five principles when

we design our our offerings. And these are the kind of things that I think are very important and are also very similar to when you think about um the principles I think that are laid out

also by the AI conference overall are very very important very very good links here. That's all for myself. &gt;&gt; Thank you Dr. I think you spoke about accountability and ownership human and

the very important element for this philosophy and in fact there are nine which have been globally accepted providing equity uh and and care in a manner which

doesn't harm the patients as well. I mean the technology can go both ways. It's a double sword. It's um uh and I think that's where the the use of responsibility technical aspect is quite

critical. Dr. Bishas I would like to come to you and I would like to sort of hear from you. So addressing equity I think in healthcare requires medical education. That's a key component to

ensure that we have regular access of doctors and health professionals in India. A lot of them are now getting upskilled when it comes to the use of AI.

would like to understand for you sir how what is the role of responsible AI and where is the government looking at responsing the understanding of using AI

responsibly when it comes to primary health centers or even at hospitals and other patient care units to ensure that you know we maximize the use of the technology without harming patient

good morning all of you uh thank you for inviting me here so the biggest You can see when we entered the uh entry of this uh uh the conference room itself we had a lot of people there and in

medical education as you all know when we when the students give the neat exam uh we have approximately 25 lakh students giving the neat exam across the country and we have only one lakh seats

but uh recently uh when we were in the NMC and the ministry is really committed to increasing the number of seats. One thing that comes to the challenge is even if you increase the number of seats

and also the number of medical colleges if you look at the number of medical colleges when we were studying MBBS uh they were around only 30,000 uh sorry uh seats were 30,000 now it's increased to

1 lakh 18,000 MBBS seats MBBS seats and medical colleges were around only 100 200 now we have reached to almost 800 so but the biggest challenge right here is that uh even though we have increased

the number of medical colleges the opportunity for the students especially from the rural areas they are having a a big challenge uh in you know getting good access to the ebooks and the

textbooks as well as to the good technical material including this EI material. So the government is uh thinking of using the leverage of AI uh to uh to reach out to these uh students

especially in the aspirational medical colleges which are lying in the districts the rural areas and uh in the national medical library uh we have started the process of uh procuring the

ebooks and the digital clinical material and we are giving to right now around 57 medical colleges across the country [laughter] only to the government. No right now only 57 57 but we're planning

to uh you know scale it up slowly and slowly and all you know all of you know that there is an OS which was recently started one nation one subscription where the government has taken up the

stand that they're now going to give access to all the government medical college across the country uh many all the journals free of charge. We are in the pipeline to also include the private

medical college later on. But since right now the budget is coming from the government uh budget, we are only right now concentrating on the government institutions as of now. But hopefully

when we increase this uh scope of digital content to across the country, uh we need of course responsible AI there because the knowledge if it is not well regulated are regulated in the

right way, it may also have unintended consequences. So we have to ensure that and I think uh we have to also see to it that whatever clinical or whatever knowledge we are giving out to our

students they are uh in the right knowledge that is being given and uh of course uh we would like to also increase in the recently in the national medical commission we plan to have uh teley

medicine also uh starting there because many of the medical colleges they don't have uh this uh access to good uh faculty building the campuses is very easy. Building up the you know the

infrastructure is very easy but building the you know the knowledge material that takes time and for that we would like that good uh doctors or good faculty from across the world and also from

mains they should be able to you know give lectures to our and that will be transmitted to all the medical colleges so that with technology we can as far as possible

the learning process in the future. The government is in the right way and I think the right path for that but this is the process that we have started and hopefully we

[clears throat] do that much better in the years &gt;&gt; 5,000 kbps. &gt;&gt; Thank you Mr. Shinas. I really like the point you mentioned about 57 government

colleges who are already working to sort of instill digital education and you know teaching teaching the doctors and professional uh healthare is one space which I feel

uh I would like to go to Dr. K. uh so I would love to understand from you and sort of for you my focus is on affordability. Um even at my context I sort of spoke about the fact that you

know affordability lies at the heart of India's healthcare challenges right and that's something which the government is increasingly working to bridge industry is playing a critical role in terms of

making healthare more affordable manharat's team is one such initiative by the prime minister of India but there are other initiatives as well would love to understand from you how responsible

AI or AI in general can help health care more affordable and when I say healthcare affordability it's a very broad term right it could mean basic uh diagnosis it could mean having access to

a doctor it could mean having access to a training physician for something as simple as cold and puff or it could also mean you know purposes or any other sort of kind of

diagnosis which you have to do. So good. Conclusion to the strategic decision. causal framework. We have been working with predictiveness. We now need to move

to the cause. I mean just to follow because I think and then I'll go to Dr. the causality from it from because the tools right now I mean of course they're great but

they're nothing but predictive softwares and patent retention tools at the end of the day and we are not there yet in terms of AGI which I think you know Samman will be here you guys can hear

him and other big folks sund will be here too because &gt;&gt; they are saying that still five to seven years away in terms of artificial general intelligence yeah maybe few here

and uh so speak about because a lot of these causality uh parameters which you're speaking about how accurate will they be

for a doctor to assess and say okay I don't have five options I have only two options at least make it more narrow for me to make a decision this is a favorite question of mine

you always talk about AI high in terms of accuracy. But look at medicine. Medicine is a probabilistic science, right? Medicine is all the papers in here, science director and all that are

all talking about sensitivity and specificity. They're not bothered too much about in in terms of accuracy. But when it comes to AI, we want the accuracy. But your AI

is as good as what the data that you feed whether the data comes from your unstructured medical records or structured you know uh medical literature in all way you will

have to understand how contextual they are and how accurate they are. So to do an accuracy perspective in a probabilistic science is slightly difficult and that's why we

really require a bit of reasoning that's why we require causal frameworks where we are saying from a probabilistic practice that this patient if I give this drug or combination of this

treatment six weeks or six months is where we are. &gt;&gt; This is great. Thank you Dr. K and uh Dr. Chi you know we sum up and would love to hear your thoughts in terms of

the gender divide and how do you see the role of responsibility in the next five years to push that healthare access. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Sure. Thank you so much.

&gt;&gt; I think I want us to I want all of us to come back to the larger mission that the country has set which is about happiness for all as well while we talk about AI. Now I'm going to use a personal story

here. While I was growing up as a student I I come from Karnal a small town in Hana about kilometers from here and I have these fond memories of really going to a nearby small family clinic

husband and wife who would probably be like my uncle and auntie same age as my parents and I think it was a seamless experience to really go to them whenever needed as per the

requirement however as I was pushed out of Karn to bigger cities for bigger opportunities for higher education for ever finding a private clinic nearby is not a seamless experience anymore. I do

understand that the goal for the healthare system is to really deliver at scale at quality. But I think what I really still miss from this whole healthare continuum of care is

compassion. I really would like to have some more compassion, some more empathy embedded into our healthare ecosystem. In fact, the World Health Organization also just last year came out with a

report saying that on compassionate healthcare saying that compassion is the only transformative tool that can really take us towards better healthare. So in my mind I think this is the

We can take a head and heart approach. We are able decision making, the technical analytical decision making alongside empathy and compassion to be able to

provide good quality care because healthcare is every huge opportunity for us to see that how we can leverage AI as a tool. to really enable and empower healthare workers at

all levels, frontline workers, clinicians and nurses to really deliver care with more compassion and more empathy. So I think that to me would we would be looking forward to see how this

can also come up in the next few years for sure. Thank you. &gt;&gt; And I think for compassion and AI responsible use is a must right. So uh while we all believe in you know uh

moving fast and breaking things in the tech space that's the that's the usual uh moto I think when it comes to the use of AI we should try to move fast but cautiously in terms of you know building

in safety procedures and nothing like building those nine principles of responsible I but thanks a lot uh to our panelist I think we have a minute can we take a question or two from the audience

am I allowed
