## 📝 Transcript

You need to go. Good morning ladies and gentlemen. We'll start the session now. May I request you if possible to close the door behind.

Okay, good morning everyone. Sovereign AI for national security. What a relevant topic in today's time. keeping the geopolitical situations in mind and I welcome you all including our eminent

panelists for this interesting and very very relevant session in today's times. Yeah. So question in front of us is that why we are discussing sovereign AI. One reason of course is the geopolitical

situation but another very important reason is the capability which AI is developing. Uh in fact uh actually in the very recent times if you see There is one development which shook the

entire world was the latest release of two models which demonstrated that how AI is actually increasing its capability by leaps and bounds. It's not only growing linearly is going exponentially

and in those times it's very important for us to now discuss what does sovereignty in AI space means to us. Now we also know that when it comes to AI capabilities a very handful of companies

across the world are working on it and um but coming back to the capabilities now if you see what the uh model 5.3 codex from Chad GBT and 4.6 six have really demonstrated is something very

remarkable in terms of capabilities but what is more remarkable is the ability of AI today to write itself and uh when I showed this piece of news to my collegegoing kid he actually opened a

technical document of 5.3 and showed it to me and I quote GPT 5.3 codex is our first model that was instrumental in creating itself so that's the kind of capability we are talking about and with

this context ladies and gentlemen it's very important for us to understand what is sovereignity and AI ecosystem means to us and how do we take it forward so with help of today's eminent panelists

let's go ahead and delve into this topic a little deeper now to start with I would like to bring in Pier Stfano uh Pier first of all welcome to the India AI impact summit

thanks for traveling all the way from Frankfurt to attend and be with us. Uh Pier in your global role as as the government business leader for EMA region which essentially means Europe,

Middle East, India and Africa and also being the digital sovereignty lead for KPMG globally. Uh it'll be great to hear your thoughts what other nations today are thinking in terms of sovereignty in

AI space. what do they think sovereignty actually is and what kind of regulatory reforms other initiatives they are planning. So over to you be thank you thank you very much Abishek

and thanks for having me. Well when we talk about sovereign AI I think from my experience uh we see a lot of emotions in the discussions. Uh that is I think my first observation.

So I'm uh I'm based in Germany and uh I see the the the discussions going on to be as I said extremely emotional um and especially having become even more emotional since um Trump 2.0

Um that's and if you think about and we started was one and a I think one and a half years ago within KPMG globally to start what we say a bridge campaign which is something yeah a product a

service offering around um sovereign digital sovereignity and one and a half years ago this was perceived at least only to be a topic let's say in continental Europe

um one and a half years later um when I travel around it's a topic everywhere except for the US and China so it's everywhere in the world I speak to my Canadian colleagues they want to talk

about sovereign uh digital sovereignity if you are in the Middle East if you are in India in Australia in Europe in Africa it's a topic everywhere so that's my first observation and I

think it's good that we talk about it second obser observation is um I said it's very emotional so we need to bring in facts and figures what does sovereign so sovereignity digital sovereignity AI

sovereignity cloud sovereignity really mean and I think we need to be also kind of educational when it comes to that because many

decision decision takers so people that are importance in Governments and public sector often are not techies. So it is something very fuzzy when it's about

sovereignity. What that does it really mean? Is it about the infrastructure? Is it the applications? Is it the AI model? Um what is it really? Is it the chips? Does it need to

be on national soil? So are we talking about data centers? It all gets mixed up in a way. And I think we need to go layer by layer and then think about what's really important and what is not.

Coming to your question um so where where should it be really sovereign I think also here when we let's talk about the data level also here we need to segregate it's not

everything that a government does and all the data that a government has needs to be super confidential and classified because there are many many datas that are datas like every corporation has

those so why not put them on public cloud and why I'm always mixing up cloud and AI is of course you know no AI with with the cloud so that always goes together and then there may be and

this is what we are talking about today then there may be areas like defense national security healthcare taxation

and maybe a few others that are extremely sensitive data and we're really the we should be thinking about um how this can be sovereign and I think we come to that discussion now in the

progress of the panel. &gt;&gt; Thanks P. I think some uh great insights there and the word I take away is emotional. Yeah, definitely that's that's the talk of the town. Uh but

you're right, you know, we have to see layer by layer what exactly is ready for uh you know for us to think that we can make it sovereign. It's like we discussed you can't switch off this tap

and switch on the other tap. It's not going to happen that way. Yeah. Okay. Thanks. So I next move to Left General H Shiba AVSM VSSM Director General Information Systems of the Indian Army.

Yeah. So sir first of all thanks a lot for being with us sparing your valuable time. Yeah. Uh in your role uh so you look after the entire information system and telecommunication systems of the

Indian army network data centers enterprise applications. But what's also very important that you are at the forefront of all AI and ML initiatives in the army. So so my question to you is

that if you can share some thoughts around what it means for national security when it comes to sovereignty in AI space because you are at the very end uh you know or I may say the other side

of the table when you have to evaluate that what is important for you at this stage. What initiatives should the forces take to ensure that uh data integrity is there, data is trusted,

whatever AI is working on top of it is trusted and safe. So over to you sir. &gt;&gt; Yeah, thank you Abishek. Uh so first of all it's uh indeed a pleasure to be here uh first day first show and uh to see a

very large crowd uh which shows the you know relevance of the event for each and every one of us. Now to um address your question about the imperatives or what is uh relevant to defense forces as far

as sovereignity is concerned. uh I what I will try to do is I will try to conceptualize it into the domains in which probably AI applications in defense will are being rolled out and

will eventually uh get implemented and then try to uh connect it with why sovereignity uh is becoming more important to us uh at this stage. Uh to start my uh you know argument I would

say u what has artificial intelligence done? I think it has expanded the cognitive domain or cognitive limits of uh humans beyond the bounded rationality which was uh relevant before this advent

of technology. And how they have done it is AI has the capacity to uh you know synthesize a very large volume of data and bring out certain insights which then a human can in a time bound manner

you know use to arrive at certain decisions. On the flip side the current AI remains an inductive logic right. it does not have that abductive rationality of a human being and that is of prime

concern when when a military decision- making is involved uh because military decisions are very costly and they are costly primarily because of the human cost. So what I'm going to do is I will

try to talk about only four domain if today if you want to ask uh please list a domain in which AI will not be relevant I think it it is an impossible answer. So I will select only four

domains which are which are prominent for defense applications and try to address why this u what are the imperatives there to start with first domain in which AI will become very uh

significant is the persistent surveillance uh today we have multi-ensor multi- data uh multi-source uh fusion which uh is uh the only way to analyze it to reach a decision is to

have an AI interface in between. So in this uh kind of uh you know persistent surveillance what is the sovereignity concern? I think if we uh have to trust a system in uh such a scenario what it

will be you know prone to would be an automation bias and when I say automation bias I say that there's a tendency of a human mind to go into a uh you know in a mode where you try to

trust more and more an automated output than your instinct. So that automation bias may become very critical or very uh I would say threatening in case we you know uh are not sure of the system which

we are implementing here. To give you an example 26th September 1983 world would have seen a nuclear war starting. But for one duty officer Petro who went against the protocols and he

did not initiate the launch button for nuclear missiles. All his sensors were shouting to launch a nuclear attack because USA has launched five nuclear missiles towards Russia and the time

period that window was only 20 minutes. Only one abductive decision he arrived at is that if such an attack has to take place, why only five missiles? His system was showing that five missiles

has been launched and he went against the protocol and he disobeyed the launch option and later on and he he he predicted it to be a false alarm and it was proved to be a false alarm that

satellite based sensors were detecting reflected sun rays of the cloud as a electronic signature of a nuclear missile launch. So we will require many more provs in the system when we have a

persistent surveillance being guided by artificial intelligence. My next point where AI will get predominant is cognitive warfare. A AI can build narratives very efficiently at a very

fast lightning speed and in a narrative warfare where you know cognition will play a very important role. We require a superior algorithm. So our sovereignity, our capability to produce a superior

algorithm which is not only a defensive against an enemy cognitive offensive but also can create a narrative which sustains which we can uh support for our other actions in the military

application of power. So in this uh superior algorithm creation I think we we have an edge and I'm sure that uh military application will have many sovereign solutions to

deal with it. The third area u which I want to talk about is autonomous systems and this is a cause of great worry all across people are talking about how much of autonomy should be given to military

application more so because lethality is part of such uh systems. As far as autonomy is concerned, in my perception, every military system becomes autonomous at certain stage. A

formation when an operational uh you know task is given, a unit when an objective is given, a soldier when he crosses a certain line, they become autonomous. missile once it has been

launched smart munitions in today's day the problem where we are now getting into is that it is not only now platform autonomy like a missile but it is also possible to have mission autonomy where

a group of machines can be given a mission to achieve and thereafter they are in an autonomous mode in such application of uh you know AI the threat is from adversarial attacks and

therefore sovereignity becomes very important in such algorithms. If there is a say poisoned data, if there is an evation embedded into a system, if there is an extraction kind of an algorithm

which opens a back door into a system, can we rely on such mission autonomy mode for artificial intelligence application and therefore if we have to decide a defense application, a

sovereign algorithm becomes very important. My last point of AI application is about decision support. So military decision if I can broadly divide them. One is deterministic.

Deterministic means when information is available and the output can be calculated. In such deterministic solutions AI can be trusted. It will be optimization solutions, supply chain

management solutions, ERP analytics such I think a high degree of trust can be placed uh in AI. The second kind of decisions which we take is stoastic wherein not only the factors are known

there are certain factors which which have probability of occurrence and if they occur there are certain uh impacts or effects which can be quantified in such scenarios

AI can again assist in a great way. AI can create simulations, simulation based analysis. For example, say mobilization has to take place once u uh you know emergency has been declared or it is

eminent. In such cases apart from various pre-calculated factors uh factors like weather factors like uh civil unrest factors like enemy action various you know landslides road

disruptions which have some probability of occurrence and if they happen there is a quantified effect in such cases again AI can help you in simulating and arriving at a very you know rational

decision and we couldn't have a fair degree of trust in AI. The third and the most critical decision making in military is decision under uncertaintity under fog of war. And once

such decisions have to be taken, sovereignity becomes of prime concerns. In such situations, not only all the factors are not known, their impact cannot be quantified. There are

management tools to deal with uncertaintity but theories like game theory also fail because here rationality of the players cannot be guaranteed. Here the moves are not

sequential. All players can move simultaneously. In such situations, AI can be a tool which can assist but AI cannot be trusted to take decisions. So in this fourth domain I think u uh we

need to train we need to formulate policy our strategy formulations our techniques and procedures have to align to use it as a tool and not as a uh you know trustworthy uh co-pilot overall in

all these four domains and to conclude my response uh one thing which is must and one thing which we must have as a sovereign uh capability with is a platform where we can test them a

benchmarking suit where we can test AI application and grade them whether it is fit for military application or not. Thank you Abhishek. &gt;&gt; Yeah thank you so much sir very very

valuable insights and as we evaluate what layer to you bring sovereignty on I think what stood out from your inputs is superior algorithms is something which we really focus upon in terms of

national security. Uh so I move on now next to Shri AJ Singal IPS director general of police head of police force Hana and for international audience is a large state neighboring uh our national

capital region. Um sir as the head of police force I was going through your uh previous speeches what stood out to me that you talked about policing evolving in five stages. First you said is the

traditional times then the advent of mobile phone and at every stage you you articulated how criminals were using technology and how police was trying to catch up. The third stage you mentioned

was era of internet. Fourth one you talked about smartphone and apps but the last and uh you and you laid great emphasis on that was the age of AI that how criminals are using it uh for cyber

crime narotics even digital arrest type of crimes and how you emphasize that police needs to catch up there. So my question to you sir in terms of uh uh national security policing what

priorities do you think are you know important for us when we will evaluate sovereignty in the AI ecosystem? Over to you sir. &gt;&gt; Thank you Mr.

&gt;&gt; We are the nont techchnical people which Mr. Pier was talking about. We are technologically illiterate and we follow the criminals. &gt;&gt; Yeah.

So we we follow criminals. Criminals are a bit a step ahead of us always and then we train ourselves then we we catch them. So

the question that how this AI is going to impact the national security and how we are going to tackle it. So I don't think we are in that

position to tell you technologically but on the basis of our experience and the AI discussion going on around the world I have prepared a small talk in simple

words you might be aware maybe you might be aware of certain contents of it so here is it we all agree that nobody can stop an idea whose time has

Secondly, the world has become a global village and thirdly which I add there they will not be going back on AI technology. It is there is a fact

of the day and we have to accept it. Read somewhere history's most transformative innovations didn't automate. They unlocked possibilities like electricity enabled mass

production. Internet created digital economy. The printing press democratized the knowledge. Each expanded what humans could achieve rather than simply doing the existing

task faster. In contrast to the efficiency trap, leading organization are deploying AI as a potent force multiplier fundamentally reimagining workflows to expand

capabilities and unlock new market. And on the other hand, I read the views of Nandan Kenny CEO Infosys mentioning hype and technology which has always gone together. Earlier cloud had come so

they said it's the greatest thing since the sliced bread and crypto came they said it will solve the world peer with crypto and now no one talks about smart cities

any longer and now a AI is changing everybody this hype maybe whether it has the unprecedented level this is the one way of looking at the things

dynamics of AI is simple as as we understand because it is uh suggested that by 20130 10 trillion of the world economy will be governed by AI technologies. So whether

it's a bubba or hype only time will tell. However, with every technological advancement, it brings a new challenge because we are the scavengers of the

society. We have to clean the trash or mess created by tech to provide safe and secure environment to police and society. And however it is again it's hardening

to know that this time police views are taken have been issued otherwise earlier the police were never asserted in the planning or conceptual state thereafter responsibility of cleaning used to be

thirst upon us. So thanks for this platform for raising the issues and clinging our concerns. We really thank &gt;&gt; thank you so much sir. Thank you so much for your valuable inputs.

Sorry. Do I move on or you? Sorry. Please. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Please go ahead. Please go ahead. Yes sir. Please go ahead. &gt;&gt; So we we have to learn from history.

1995 Google provided accessibility to info, transparency, equality, but created what? New problems? Fake info, trust issues, planted info, manipulation of human behavior, propaganda, etc. In

2008, someone known as Satoshi Nakamoto introduced blockchain and Bitcoin and some brilliant engineer created dark web to unite the world. But in fact, he united the underworld.

So police somehow was able to tackle the problems as the changes were vast and slow paced which emerged due to internet and mobile tech. But AI is a disruptive tech. is much

much different a much stronger much permanent damaging potential and at a much faster speed. Now after bringing the dark side of AI I proposed my understanding strategic

shift required for national term security for that we have to understand a five layered enigma recently one godfather of AI Jensen wag has beautifully explained

the five layered cake called akimma model we all know about it so it is energy chips infrastructure models and applications

So all these five layers cake matters and affect directly to the police in one way or another. For law enforcement, sovereignity at the top layer that is application we use is insufficient.

If hostile actors can disrupt power to political data centers, our AI enabled emergency responses goes down. If chief supply is controlled externally, our access to crime analytics can be

throttled. If infrastructure resides on foreign clouds, sensitive data becomes vulnerable to external jurisdiction and surveillance and there is a downside of AI as well which is consumption of huge

energy, water and carbon emissions. So fundamental principle the sovereignity must extend through the entire stack or vulnerabilities at lower levels

compromise security at every level above. So in my humble opinion and the limited knowledge as I foresee these are the strategic shifts needed for long-term

national security in India so a road map. Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much sir. Thank you so much. So so couple of very important points came out

from your side especially around the threat AI possesses in various areas related to national security. Now one important question which also you know comes out in front of us is that whether

we tackle each and every layer we go for a big change in terms of sovereignty or we go for incremental changes. So for this I I would like to bring Mr. Bij Singh as the next speaker from our side

and uh while Martin I'm very keen to bring the industry in now but I can't help it because he's in the room and he brings that unique profile of a senior officer bureaucrat who has dabbled in

the world of AI from day one. He's not just written and spoken about a he's a practitioner himself. So I've known him for a number of years and I just read a very relevant article from him which

came in Sunday guardian I think two days back sir. So u sir we uh first of all I would uh you have expressed very uh you know important views significant views about the data and its bias. So while we

say you know we we can make AI sovereign across layers but if the data is throwing a bias isn't that very important aspect of sovereignty. So I would like to bring your thoughts there

sir then probably later in the session I would also like you to express your views about the change which we are saying across or it should be incremental. So over to you sir

&gt;&gt; so uh setting the context right on sovereignty pair said that it's emotional. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I say it's not emotional, it's visceral, it's existential, right?

&gt;&gt; And uh what is sovereignty? Anything that you cannot develop, deploy, govern, audit, secure and license on your own terms is not sovereign. Right? Each of these terms is very important.

Now look at the case of Naira energies. Somebody possessing a kill switch on an infrastructure can shut off you know your access to any technology. So imagine this now for all the benign

technology which is being given to us uh this again is coming to pre-colonial days where you know you had spices minerals cotton tea which was manufactured here taken by train lines

to Manchester and you got nice finished products. Now every transaction that you do, every health record that you upload, every question that you ask and feed to the models will be sold to you back as

an API and you'll be charged for that. Right? This is not sovereignty. So I think government should be be defense, be it government, be it private sector, we should not go for any of these AI

rappers. We should go for this anything that it may be 50% correct. It may be 80% correct. But imagine this that you cannot give the brain of your sovereignty at some place which doesn't

understand you. Right? Now look at something very simple. Uh large language models were developed on you know next token prediction based on something called common crawl and common

crawl was basically Reddit Wikipedia. And what Wikipedia is, you know, I I've written a large article on how Wikipedia is biased. And I've proven it, how Wikipedia is biased and that it has a

very limited set of editors who decide, you know, what the world thinks. And it is, you know, the ideal of some woke ideal of some tech elite. Now the the irony is that this will become the voice

of everybody. the amount of cultural erasure which is going to take place because a model doesn't understand you because it doesn't understand your local context because it doesn't understand

high context low resource uh you know things which are let's say in bjpuri or malaram in tammed in marati let's say there's a local variety of fish it may be known by different names but the GPD

doesn't know it so it starts to flatten it it starts to give you something else it look at also principles of alignment right governance Now

governance in China is different. The Chinese society principles are different and what we call as dharmic principles. We we look at society first, right? We help each other. This is not developed

in the model. It talks about individuality. It talks about certain western ideals which may not be suitable to us. Now what has happened is that being a force multiplier, this has

become the cognitive infrastructure of the world. Now there's a biblical story about the tower of babel and you may refer to it and how it collapsed because it you know wanted to create one

language one world and that is dear friends the attempt which is happening with you know uh something which has been created from a very limited set of uh data which has been created by white

people. Now uh policing uses a lot of technology not just generative AI generative AI I think enterprise use cases are yet to come. There's hardly 10% adoption in enterprise except for

coding. Policing uses a lot of technology. Look at uh you know uh kumba where we start using fluid dynamics to predict uh you know crowd flows or let's say number

plate recognition or facial recognition. But if you start using any western model of facial recognition the error rate is as high as 40%. Because it has never been trained on brown faces. Right?

Similarly any model which does not have contextual relevance now when you will start implying you know using it for law enforcement where you are taking life and death decisions this is going to be

very difficult it's a black box there is no explanability there is no transparency how do I put this automated bureaucracy which is going to take such critical decisions without understanding

what it is and that too when it is you know uh subject to US laws so my taxation data somebody gives me a nice you know sovereign AI solution uh which is sold by big four right and

they they they market it to me nicely in suits and we accept it that okay it's a sovereign AI it's not it's not does it you know pass the test of you know design deploy audit governance no

because somewhere sitting somewhere somebody would be able to uh pull a kill switch and uh you know stop all access &gt;&gt; you see in in the Sri Lanka crisis the world could stop their payment systems

right when you saw Russia Ukraine war was going on swift was stopped for Russia so you will have to with the way we own digital public infrastructure in India we'll have to create a cognitive

public infrastructure how soever difficult it is and that's why pair it's visceral it's existential and we will have to do it and probably it's time that we should do it I yesterday wrote

an article in uh the Sunday gajin where where I called it the the architecture of independence right it is the architecture of independence there's no der of you know experts in India there's

no der of talent in India there's no d of only thing is compute which I think geopolitically we should solve that again is sovereignty right because people are using GPUs to control

geopolitics and that is why we will have to be sovereign at all you know all the layers of the cake &gt;&gt; right

&gt;&gt; and I believe that when you apply these systems to uh policing, you will have to go for trust and transparency. Uh and it has created problems. On the other side, it's become

a force multiplier. It has hugely enabled criminal ecosystem. We have polymorphic malware. You have, you know, there was uh a company called Arup. I think it's a advertisement company or

something where the CEO came on a live zoom call and they lost uh $30 million. Right? This is the state at which AI is evolving. Do we have real-time policing? Sir, you know, explained that policing

is not so real time. So you'll have to increase both capability and capacity and this needs a serious thought right now. So pair we need sovereign AI. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you sir. And again as

expected very very relevant points. So that reminds me of of interview by Jensen Huang a few years back. He said I met your prime minister all before this AI hype uh when it's about in very

initial stages and he said your prime minister told me that I don't want to export data to import intelligence. He said that was really remarkable for a world leader to think in those times. So

I think very relevant points you also echoed but good that s you brought compute in in picture because compute is something where we really have to make pro in fact the rest of the world and

then I would love to bring pier maybe at later stage. So uh with this then I would like to move to Martin. Martin thanks a lot uh first of all traveling all the way to India to attend the AI

summit and being with us. M in your role as uh in terata as a leader in in in data analytics big data implementation uh you have been quoted twice in data IQ's 100 most influential people in

datadriven business and what's remarkable I was looking at your website where you are now saying that uh stop managing data activate intelligence so and I also read your article about the

large scale compute requirement which is going to come for example you give a healthcare example where every patient will be followed by an agent and he'll be firing like thousands hundreds and

thousands of queries to make sure that you have that hypers uh personalization experience. So with that kind of compute requirement Martin do you think that u we are ready for so sovereignity from

day one or is going or as everybody said you have to tackle it layer wise so what do you think especially when you come to the layer of data you know how the data structures uh a country like India can

make sure that they are sovereign in those aspects yeah so over to you &gt;&gt; thank
