## 📝 Transcript

Nothing. Last one. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; No, that's a natural stupidity.

I'm moving this one as well. and I'll see you in the corner. It's a G meeting room number. That's right. of course.

Yeah. So this is problem. Good afternoon. What do you mean? Shall we start? Good afternoon everyone. It is an honor

to welcome you to this distinguished session of the AI impact summit 2026. My name is Sugjata Gupta, Secretary General of Digital News Publisher Association. DNP proudly represents the digital

divisions of India's most respected news publishing institutions committed to fostering credible journalism, advancing responsible digital transformation and constructively engaging in policy and

technological discourse within the industry. At the outset, I wish to extend sincere congratulations to the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology

for organizing this eminent summit. The AI impact Summit 2026 stands as a testament to India's resolve to not only participate but to lead in the global conversation surrounding artificial

intelligence. We are grateful for the privilege to contribute our perspective of media industry to this significant national and international dialogue. The theme for today's session, AI and

media, opportunities, responsible pathways, and the road ahead, is not just timely, but also fundamental to the future of public discourse. Artificial intelligence is profoundly reshaping the

way information is now gathered, curated, disseminated, and trusted. It is our privilege to be joined by distinguished leaders who represent scale, credibility, regional strength

and global perspective. Miss Khalipuri, vice chairperson and executive editor and chief India today group leading one of the most influential multimedia news organization across print, television

and digital. Mr. Pawan Kumar, deputy managing director, Dhani Bhaskar group representing one of the country's largest and most expansive news network with deep reach across Bharat. Mr. Tanme

Maheshwari managing director Am Amar Rujala Group one of India's most trusted Hindi news institutions with strong roots across North India Mr. Mohit Jen chief operating officer and executive

director Bennett Coleman Group one of the India's most diversified and impactful media enterprise Mr. Navnit Elvi chief executive officer the Hindu bringing strong regional depth and

editorial ravitas to this conversation Mr. Robert Whitehead, digital platform initiative lead, international news media association, working closely with publishers across the globe and offering

valuable international perspective on AI partnerships and policy evolution. And moderating this important discussion, Mr. Ashish Fervani, partner media and entertainment from ENY who brings

strategic insights at the intersection of media, economics and technology. With that I invite Ashish to take this discussion forward with our distinguished guest. Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Thanks Sugjata. Um I think what you're seeing on stage if you just add up the numbers of the reach out here that you're seeing is probably the largest gathering of audiences on earth. All

right. It is literally that big. [applause] Okay. Because if you add up all this no we are like India plus China plus I don't know what else. It's that big. So, so I'm going to start with the

largest digital platform in the world. Any guesses who's the largest digital platform in the world? Anybody? &gt;&gt; Times of India. Bang on. So, Mohit. Moit from Times of India. I've known him like

I don't know 15 20 years now. Um, and Moit I have to say AI is impacting media and entertainment across across the board, right? It is it's impacting how it's created, how it's disseminated, how

it's marketed, how it's monetized, everything. And there are various types of content, right? You have news journalistic content which has a very high degree of truth or at least it

should have a very high degree of truth. You have documentaries which are based in fact. You have entertainment which is some complete fiction, some of it like say the movie on article 370 based on

recent history as well. What kind of impact do you sitting where you are at the cusp on this digital massive bareoth of a platform seeing what AI is making on content and how should AI be treated

given its massive impact across all these genres? &gt;&gt; Uh thank you Ashish. Uh I'm quite happy to start because this is a cricket season and probably I'm the

opening batsman over here or I don't know whether I'm the only one who's wearing a tie on this on the [laughter] on the dis right but thank you uh see we uh all understand that uh India is a

very vibrant uh country diverse and complex and uh in such an environment the editorial discretion verification and institutional memory is not optional. It is foundational

and uh press is not just something which you know produces information. It curates trust. It provides context and it accepts the moral and the legal responsibility for what it publishes.

And that layer of accountability is the differentiator. And when AI begins to commoditize information, the trust will become scarce and that scarcity will create value. So Mohit sorry to

interrupt but can AI add accountability or can AI reduce accountability or both? I would say that uh it depends that how we are anchoring the AI models in trust

and responsibility. If you're able to do that certainly it can do that but I would say in that at the current environment the human mode which is there I would say that is not just a

legacy advantage. It is something which is today a structure of necessity to sustain uh a public discourse like just as if you see in the in the FDI foreign direct investment there is a cap on news

because news carries influence it has an ability to impact national security elections social stability and market economics and that's the reason that why journalism is called the fourth pillar

of democracy. There are different forms of content but they do not impact the society in the same way just like a film or a documentary or uh maybe uh a story &gt;&gt; but journalism is something else. So you

have to take a lot of care. So Khali 20 years as editor of TV today &gt;&gt; 20 years is a long time to have content go through you and I I don't know how you editors sleep at night because what

if it's wrong right that's a big worry that you have people react all over the country how are you using AI to manage all this &gt;&gt; so look at uh first of all I disagree

with this one comment I'm sorry uh about uh FDI by being stopped for news. I mean, okay, it's stopped for for print, but online there's no stoppage, right? You're getting a news from everywhere.

So, I think that's a little bit of an artificial sort of barrier which has been created because online and social media, you get news from around the world. Um, and I agree with him that it

depends on how we use AI to create accountability. Right now, AI is not creating accountable information. In fact, what you're creating is AI slop which we have seen. Um, and that can

create an illusion of trust and that's problematic because news and verified media brands such as the Times of India, India Today group shape opinion and in a country like ours where literacy rate is

not that high, you want verified um outlets having that power to shape public opinion. So I think that's a problem. Uh in our side on the India today group we

love technology. We always jump in head first. We've been working on AI for about two and a half years. Any of you who engage with the India today group would know we have AI anchors. We have

AI clones of our most popular anchors. Uh we voice clone. We make movies on AI. We do all kind of things. But I think the one guiding principle for AI as far as the India today group goes is that in

India today group the accountability for AI has a name. So what we do is something called the AI sandwich where human intent starts the AI exercise. You have AI in between to help you with

something and then you have the final decision which is again a human being. So I think that that's really important. Um and it's very important to do that to have that human imprint because you do

not want to become one biscuit in this AI cookie cutter way, right? And flatten everything because we are a country which is very diverse and you want to have that diversity. We want to be able

to tell our stories, not AI stories, right? &gt;&gt; Thank you. You certainly don't want to become a biscuit. Uh but interesting how you guys have used AI and I've seen your

AI anchor at work and she's pretty hot. Okay. So uh I I I just want to t you know from a Hindi heartland solid product um how are you guys investing in AI? What are you seeing as a big use

cases? And Navit I'd like you to add on to that after this. &gt;&gt; Uh thanks a lot you know for that uh query. uh thanks to all of you you know inside

the room you know who took out time and you know came here see for us AI is just another technology and like any other you know technology there's going to be an upside and a

downside the classic case you know is the nuclear technology right it can be the most devastating bomb in the world and that's the cleanest source of power all of us can get same as with AI so

it's about how you use it. Khali has you know rightly said that you have to have a human layer attached to it at our organization which is looking at masses. We're looking at tier 2 tier

three audiences. We're looking at news from tier 2 tier three towns. use of AI is to complement the human work and how to go deeper into an article, how to basically enhance the

content value. So we don't see AI as a replacement of anything. We see AI as a tool to improve the quality of the news. And see at the end of it all, our goal is just to create better content for our

users. And we never think that AI is going to replace anything. Content layer is the most important layer in this entire AI engine. So there

is data layer, processing layer, application layer, power energy layer. But the content layer is the only variable layer and as a responsible organization we feel that we have to use

this layer to enhance our content production type. So typical use cases you know to answer your question would be to enhance the depth of content would be to automate the monotonous task and

to you know use that time to do a better you know research based things superb uh so there's a lot you can do on both the quality of content that I'm hearing from you Tanme and also on the cost

efficiencies putting you straight into the fire navit how to use AI to increase revenues To begin with, you asked a question about sleeping well at night. At the

Hindu group, the CEO sleeps well because the editors don't give you reason to stay awake. I mean, we do use AI for much of what uh Tanma mentioned and Khali mentioned. But

I think the big differentiator is when it comes to media, trust is not generated by technology. It's produced by institutions. And that's where you draw the line.

uh there are multiple ways of using AI to increase revenue. One is pure engagement goes up on your digital platform. Stickiness goes up, retention goes up. So we are 147 year old

institution and one of the biggest use cases I think there is and what we use it effectively for is if you're making sense of what's happening today using the context of

yesterday and paint a picture of the implications of the choices we make as a society and the world we'll be to the next generation that's extraordinarily power powerful journalist usea

journalism use case. uh so we we have built a model uh that doesn't hallucinate because that model's resources are our own archival material as you're writing a story it generates

content from the past offers context relevance and a journalist can choose to take that summarize that and add context so that increases stickiness uh in terms of subscription revenues we are able to

use uh AI to build propensity models to increase our retentionship retention and so on &gt;&gt; that's fascinating So I think summarizing what I'm hearing

there are lots of use cases of AI and it's hitting the world and in the media industry in every possible manner. I'm moving to the next part and Pawan G I'd like you to start on this one. Uh

you guys create thousands and thousands of articles and hours of content every day as a country. If I keep UGC aside, in 2025, India created two lakh hours of video content just video content two

lakh hours which is the largest in the world as of today. All right. AI played as of now a pretty small role in that not a very big role but recently about two three months back there was a survey

which was done when 90% of the respondents could not identify whether content was man-made or AI created which has its own set of challenges in a country as

diverse as ours in a country where the education levels vary significantly affluence levels vary language vary significantly Panj do we have a responsibility

as media owners to our consumer and what needs to be done in the world of AI and after you I'd like Robert you to chip in with some of the international examples around this as well and then I'd like

even all the others to talk because a very important topic &gt;&gt; you know so I think we've seen uh two big technological changes one uh is uh somebody named this to me which is all

you can eat data packages. India saw this you know in uh 2015s when you know all the companies came in to say that you know I'll charge you 200 bucks 300 bucks a month and you can use

as much internet as you can uh that transformed the consumption uh on on phones uh you know and now with the with the advent of AI so what is happening is in a country to 140 cr people uh our

population uh the technology is making uh empowering every single person uh with content uh with free data with a lot of information. It's a great like like TM said you know it's a it's a

nuclear p it's like a nuclear power you know how how do you use this so we can't stop this from coming we have to embrace it the question is you know just like water the you can drink uh water to

quench your thirst right it can be full of bacteria it can be absolutely clean now your your core purpose will be done with whatever you're consuming as a country right now but the question is

for generations to come uh and that's where the responsibility of both policy makers and of media owners and AI companies and platforms come into play where we have to collectively ensure

that as a country we are not fed anything wrong because whatever we feed wrong because uh content and news we are not we are news uh we are not entertainment we are not music we are

not movies you can watch a fiction on a movie and you know you won't carry anything wrong with you but when you consume anything wrong uh anything incorrect it will cause a generation

generational damage and that's where I think uh the role of media owners policy makers governments platforms will play a big big role and I think that's that's what I think the whole world is

grappling with and uh but India is different India we have a lot of people who u have a phone who can read a newspaper but they can't process they can't really process what is right what

is wrong many of us when we receive content on our phones we simply forward it without processing it because we don't literally don't have that capability

&gt;&gt; one thing that needs to be done &gt;&gt; treating India differently by the policy makers by the government and and of course by us you know that we are different we are not a we this country

is not made up of a tier one towns it's made up of tier one tier 2 tier three tier four tier five towns and it cannot and all those people cannot be uh can we cannot assume that Everybody is

the same. Everybody has different education levels, different understanding and it has to have a special treatment. &gt;&gt; Rob

with the greatest respect and I come from the world's second best cricket nation. I just wanted to put that out [laughter] there. [applause and cheering]

India is no different. You are already drinking AI water full of bacteria. [laughter] And people in this room and around the globe don't know the difference between

what's making them sick and what's not. Because unlike a medical condition, misinformation, disinformation, or just wrong information accidentally trained in a model can spread around the world 3

million times before your reporters get out of bed in the morning. We have a problem, Houston. AI is already trained on all the biggest English language models on incorrect information. Now,

laws will change. Anyone in this room that publishes material that is accessed for even one nancond in Europe from the 2nd of August this year will need to label that image that video as AI

generated and many other countries are following that that AI act requirement. It's already law but it takes effect. We need to do so much more than that to ensure that the information that is

being ingested particularly in countries that are not well represented at the moment in the AI models such as India is the right information from professional reliable sources. They are my colleagues

here on the panel. &gt;&gt; Fantastic. Rob Mohit, I was just coming to you. &gt;&gt; Oh, did I anticipate that? &gt;&gt; And then I'll ask you the question.

&gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; No, no, thank you Ash. I just want &gt;&gt; always anticipates the fall. Yes. So, thank you. Thank you, Khali. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You

&gt;&gt; say first best cricket country. Is that what you're going to say? [laughter] &gt;&gt; I mean I mean we we are in a advertising model. So, we'll discuss that later &gt;&gt; for the audience. Rob comes from

Australia. So, yeah, we tend to beat them quite often. Uh so, [laughter] &gt;&gt; no. Then this panel is going in a different direction. Ash have took the mic back to rob them.

Please carry on. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Now Ashish, just a quick add-on thought to that. Uh and when you say that the press is often called as the fourth

pillar of democracy, there is a reason to that and because not just it informs the citizens, it scrutinizes power and uh uh it creates the journalistic standards. But tomorrow if uh AI you

know starts to blend and uh and summarize and distribute uh journalism then that means that they are not just handling content they are participating in public discourse

and anything that becomes to that that begins to participate in a democratic process then it deserves a different standard of care. &gt;&gt; What needs to be done? Now I would say

that uh there is a combination of what we said earlier that presently a human mode is something which is essential to do the governance part of that like you know so I mean there have been different

kind of revolutions as we know Ashish the the agricultural revolution which taught us how to cultivate crops and build stable settlements the industrial revolution they mechanized manufacturing

and molded modern life and the internet revolution that connected continents and uh democratized data and disrupted economies. But AI revolution is a mother of all of these revolutions. It will

actually define the coexistence of man and machine. But how that relationship is going to look like will depend on our intelligence. How we want to shape it. &gt;&gt; Super.

&gt;&gt; So I have a nine-point charter. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; No, I'm giving the nine points and then I won't speak at all. Okay. So uh my nine-point charter for what we can do to

make sure that AI is benign right first of all fair value for journalistic content used in AI systems we need transparency on how you are digesting metabolizing news in AI. Number two

attribution and traceability as a democratic principle not as a commercial favor that the big giants are doing to us. &gt;&gt; Okay putting these labels on all your 18

or 19 top channels. Yes, I think that why are the tech companies not making it as part of the code that you cannot use the AI without it labeling it automatically? Why are you giving this

uh as something of discretion to the user who's doing it? Because bad actors are never going to say it's AI. Why would bad actors do that? You're just putting more responsibility on the good

actors and not controlling the bad actors. Don't interrupt my charter. Number three, recognize journalism as a public good. Number four, reward stories that deliver social impact. Right now,

the algorithms do not have any signals from social impact. They only have signals from virality. Right. Number five, put a real value to verified content provided by proper institutions.

Number six, penalize AI hallucination severely, not treated as something, oh, that's cute. AI has just made a little mistake. Number seven, end the asymmetry of reward and punishment between legacy

media and social media. Legacy media has to follow certain guidelines. We see those same guidelines flouted on social media on an everyday basis and we tolerate that. Number eight, treat our

population's attention as the rarest mineral we have. Point number nine, insist on the reciproc reciprocity of Magnificent Seven, the tech companies for giving them access to that rare

mineral. What are they giving us back? That's it. &gt;&gt; Fantastic. Wasn't 0.9 the same as.1? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Remuneration. [laughter]

&gt;&gt; But fair value is different to what you give them in access. that isn't just media, right? &gt;&gt; Fair point. Okay, I want to take one of your points and Nav, I'd like you to

specifically answer this uh because you're like the guy closest to the equator out here. So, most balance. Um, who's responsible for wrong content? I'm saying wrong content. I'm not saying AI

content. Is it the creator of the content? Is it the guy who posts it or distributes it on any media channel or is it the platform who carries it? &gt;&gt; That's a tough question and also

philosophical. Right now one could even ask is the person who consumes that wrong content and believe it to be true where does the fault lie? So while

while easy is it easier to tough to find fault it's easier to have mechanisms in place to fix responsibility. Platform should be responsible. Now if legacy media is responsible for the content we

put out editor is held to very high standards. Platform should be held to the same high standards. One of the things we as an industry can do well. Little segue here and I I completely u

am on board with Kali's nine-point agenda. Uh I think as an industry we have done an extremely poor job of communicating this to audiences. See regulators should believe in this

agenda. We we as an industry should believe in this agenda. Government and policy makers should believe in the agenda. But unless consumers believe in this agenda and say this is good for me

and there's bottoms up pressure there should be pressure from bottoms up. uh and while we do well with ourselves and with regulation to an extent, we could do a better job in

setting this agenda for consumers and I think her nine-point agenda is a brilliant starting point. &gt;&gt; So like we had the ISI mark and the FDA certifications. You're saying consumers

should demand labeling, should demand attribution, should demand accuracy levels and things of that nature. Uh sorry Mo, you want to say something? No, &gt;&gt; I just just a quick one line on that

only Ashi. See when you say that who takes the responsibility is it the content creator or the platform. So I would just say that responsibility in that case has to be centered at all

stages. See if you do not ingest a credible highquality original content then what Kali also talked about the hallucinations. It is bound to happen and that is where we are saying that the

journalistic content is not like a free floating content of the internet. It is something which is intellectual property. It gets created with investment, with infrastructure, with

talent and and I would just like to say that data has to be contracted. It cannot be surrendered. That's a very important point. Again, point one.9 data can't be contracted.

I'm getting a flavor of the session here very clearly. Uh um Pawanji, moving on to you. Um you know, you you provide content for the heartland of this country, right? lots and lots of very

wealthy states where you're present in um and and you you have worked in states where governments swing in and out and you know the GDP and per capita incomes vary significantly.

Um a lot of the public opinion in your states is currently being driven by AI tools that are built on foreign models, foreign LLMs. Is there really according to you a need

for a sovereign stack that India should invest in because you're working in so many different languages and and Mohit you too you're working across so many different languages you guys as well

right what's the need for an India sovereign AI stack you know as I as I said uh the beginning [clears throat] that India has to

treated differently. The tier 2, tier three, tier four, tier five towns, uh they are very different from you know what you and I understand sitting in in a Delhi. You know the understanding of a

guy sitting in DSA or a or a barme or a saga or a Morana is very different. Uh and and &gt;&gt; I have not been to any of those places. &gt;&gt; Exactly. and and interestingly uh you

know bulk of our population is in those tier 2, tier three and tier four towns and uh they are the ones actually who are getting affected the most uh with all the models which are trained on uh

foreign languages or or in English let's say or foreign models uh so there is a big need uh to look at uh this country very differently and not just look at it as a as a divide between

a language of English versus uh regional probably multiple models because uh the the needs are very different and those needs cannot be understood by sitting uh somewhere out of out of this country.

&gt;&gt; Who's going to invest to build all these models? It's very very very expensive. &gt;&gt; It is expensive. But uh as a country we build infrastructure, right? We build hospitals as a country. We build

institutions for education. You know this is this is another step for next few generations to come. And if you don't build it right now, our generations, the next few generations

are going to blame us that uh you know that these people only thought of reaping the benefits now uh and seeing the next 2 to 3 years and not seeing the next 20 to 30 to 40 years. And if we

don't work on those models right now uh what will happen is uh you know what uh what we feed them uh is is not uh is not anything material. You can't touch it, right? It's being consumed. It changes

your perception. It changes the way you see the world. It changes the way you act, you behave in your societies. So it's a big societal change actually. And if it's not done in time, as I said, you

know, it's going to cause a very very long permanent damage &gt;&gt; that I completely buy. And Tme, I want to come back to you on this uh quickly. And when you use models in Indic

languages, uh does context work? &gt;&gt; No. it. So I would say you know accuracy is less than 50 55%.

In the language models and see there's a very famous quote you know by you know the famous Sam Alman and you know he said that AI will lead to the end of the world but

till then we'll make some great companies. Now you know it can be a dark humor you know for all of us but whenever you know we built we built for tomorrow day after

tomorrow for our you know children right we are just patrons right we have been you know giving this world and we have to you know hand over the world in a very nice manner so Khal's 9point agenda

is great and I thought that how can we actually get it done right you know how do we you know execute So I have a fivepoint execution plan you know to top it up.

&gt;&gt; Super [laughter] white already. &gt;&gt; So number one point is that can the government and big tech label the source of original verified

content and create a signature around it. It's very easily you know done. You can you know have a you know blockchain technology to do it. Simple to do thing. What it will actually lead to is the

second point of a point that is a traceability. So once you know that from where this thing has come you can actually get back to that person which you know reduces

the risk of people trying to manipulate minds because then they know that they can be caught. The third point which I had noted just give me a second sorry

is data access to emerging Indian models. See the problem and you know which you know Robert also said that most of the western models don't even access to proper Indian data. We don't

have healthcare data in India. We don't have public transportation data in India. We don't have regulatory data in India. We don't have criminal record data in India. None of it is actually

digitized. So if we don't have the data, how can it even get trained on? And government must open these models for us for all the Indian groomed organizations to basically build on it and train on

it. My last point is on the infrastructure and maybe I'm asking for too much but infrastructure has to be built by the government. Who is building the roads? Who is

building the dams? Who is building highways? Who is building the airports initially? Not now. It is always the government who would begin building the infrastructure.

Public would use it and then you'll have private players coming in and doing that. China is a classic use case, right? Government has invested hugely. And I think so this very AI

you know entourage today over here you know you had cues of you know people you know to get in shows the you know interest of this country and the you know commitment of the you

know government and I really hope that this very baby you know move you know will lead to a much much bigger leap but without Indian infrastructure without government giving enough chips,

enough data. I don't think so. Even talking about an Indian model is a logical thing to do because there's a you know saying you know in Hindi you know which I'll

use right now. You need to have milk to have cream over it. You cannot have cream over water. Well said. Well said Rob. You work with media companies across the globe. Are

these five human beings asking for too much? &gt;&gt; Well, we've just had deflation from nine points to five points. Let me give you two [laughter]

and they support all of them. There's got to be recognition for the IP that is created by professional creators. I'm a big fan of individual. I'm a big fan of the creator economy,

but the creator economy is not going to give the accuracy that these big models need. And the material needs to be paid for. Point one, AI is already destroying the value of the companies here on the

stage. AI summaries in search have led to as many as 60% of searches no longer going to websites. How the heck are we funding journalism,

advertising, cover prices, and to a very small extent here, subscriptions? If the search engines are not referring traffic, if the social networks are no longer referring traffic, there have

been huge falls in the past 12 months. that is already depriving revenue from the businesses that are funding the accuracy of the data that is needed for a sovereign model or any other large

language model. So these people are already being challenged by AI. A government action that's very specific is my second point. Help fund the AI training on professional journalism.

Sometimes that can just be pass a law that's happened in many countries now requiring the big tech companies and the largest foundational models to pay for the data they are training on. There are

billions of dollars being paid for professional content but not to media companies companies in San Francisco that are buying on the black market. That money

needs to flow through to the media companies creating that content and that will only happen when there's a law that requires the tech platforms to participate in a fair digital

marketplace. &gt;&gt; Is that happening anywhere? &gt;&gt; Yes, there's a couple of different ways of doing it. Norway pays for the media IP to be trained on.

Norway is a very rich country. South Africa is just about to pass a law that requires the platforms to negotiate commercial deals for the access to this very valuable information. From one

extreme to the other, there are many examples in the middle. &gt;&gt; Khali, do you see this happening? &gt;&gt; No, I don't see this happening. Uh that's why I think we definitely need a

sovereign India stack because we do need leverage. In fact, I would be very happy if like Pavan said they would not treat India uniquely and the magnificent seven the big tech companies treated

India the same way as they treat media brands in America. I feel that uh amongst us like you said we have some of the largest audiences. Times of India is the largest news website in English.

Achuck is the largest news channel on YouTube but we don't get the same exceptions from the tech companies like American media brands and I see that as digital imperialism right and uh I feel

that the government does need to step in with either regulation or other ways to leverage so that they can um get the same rights for Indian media companies that maybe foreign media companies are

getting because the cost of decolonizing later is going to be really expensive. &gt;&gt; That's a pretty big statement. Colonization. Um,

honestly, wearing your hat, Khali, your practical editor's hat, you'd love what you said. You'd love to be paid more for your content. And on the other hand, there's a bunch of

other people in a country of 1.4 4 billion who are creating content and they also want to be re you know monetize it. They want to get famous with it. They want to

build audiences, drive communities, build public opinion. Don't you think that these measures could help some of the big guys but could really not be helping any of the upstarts, the small

influencers if I may say the small stringers, the content creators out there. Do you think these do do you see a a set of measures that would be beneficial for both the large news

brands and the individual creators? &gt;&gt; I think that uh having a common set of rules that applies towards uh truth and what is credible and what is verified between creators and news organizations

have to be slightly different. Right? because creators are creating uh content which can be fantastical and they should do it. Why not? And they are making money from it. I don't have a problem

with that. I don't have a problem with influencers having an opinion. But I do have a problem with uh influencers um parasiting on original content made by the legacy brands. In the end, we are

the guys who are funding the reporters to go out and break the original story on the basis of which maybe an influencer will take a point of view. might may use our footage, may turn it

around the way they want and which is fine too but then we are not getting um credited for it. We are not getting any any payment for it and over a period of time how will we sustain those reporters

and if we don't have original stories AI will eat AI it'll keep making stories but it'll keep making stories from synthetic content. It won't be our stories. It won't be original stories.

won't be things on the ground cuz in the end the reporters are the guys who go and get you original stories from the ground from all those places that power named that you have not been to.

&gt;&gt; Super. Um what you wanted to add to this? &gt;&gt; No I I was just saying uh Ashish that uh you know one is the the the content creators versus the publishers and then

the big tech. I think all of these people they have to come together because the fundamental part of innovation and commerce is that anybody who creates value must be able to

capture value and that is something which is very important over here and uh as part the you know the big tech and the publishers also I would just say that uh see conversation creates value

and confrontation creates invoices invoices of lawyers and some consultants Thank you very much &gt;&gt; is here. So I I I genuinely believe that with the big tech people we have to sit

down and talk and and understand the inter interdependence with each other and I'm sure they do also like you know but I think somewhere we need an eliminate environment or a framework to

actually facilitate that further and say that there is a me there is going to be coexistence of technology and content together and if you're able to do that then I think it is up to the

determination of a fair negotiated value that how we can take this for forward because these free markets are not just the ideological ical abstractions because they have a they're the

mechanisms to discover value and uh allocation of capital and sustained quality standards. &gt;&gt; So we unfortunately don't have anyone from big tech to give their point of

view but I think Rob you had something you wanted to add. &gt;&gt; So arguably the best large language model in the world at the moment is anthropics Claude. Can anyone in the

room No question. Yeah. Claude, absolutely. Can anyone in the room tell me how many AI IP deals they have done with media companies to create anthropics cla

they have no interest in meeting anyone including our great friends at the times of India. And if they won't meet the times of India, what help for the rest of the world

creating journalism? Ouch. Okay. Um I think we're down to the last bit. Uh to wrap up, we're in Feb of 2026. uh would like each of you to tell me briefly one wish list item that you have

uh for the buildup and roll out of responsible and really cool AI in India. Starting with you Panji, &gt;&gt; there's a lot of AI noise in the room. Can we keep the doors closed?

&gt;&gt; So I have uh I have two ask. Okay. &gt;&gt; Ashish, one ask is from this audience uh from all of you. Uh please the way you consume where way you eat good food, good quality food, you drink

good uh quality of water. Please build a habit of consuming good quality news. Uh news is fundamental, you know, to to your growth. News is fundamental to, you know, what you will pass on to the next

generations. And uh you know and and we always say in in our industry you know we are the last few men standing uh men and women standing you know we uh news uh if not protected now uh you know will

die in the next decade you know you will only see news generated from user users and there will be no newsrooms there will be nobody taking accountability. So hence whatever you heard from all of us

on the panel about uh our deals about ask from government is not to basically uh run a profitable company is to run a to continue to deliver the responsibilities that we are all here

for. Uh so that's that's that's my ask basically. Superme. &gt;&gt; So I would just like to you know build upon you know whatever Panji just said that

protecting the tomorrow is my ask. See in this entire game okay we have to see that who is the loser and who is the winner you know on Thank you. So you know on the one side

you have the big tech who is definitely you know you know winner okay US economy has 26% contribution to the world's GDP but they have 65% contribution to the world index of the

stock market. So this is the valuation of those companies okay who are feeding on our consumers. I feel that yes you know if it is not done

media companies will be at a loss but the biggest loss will be to the consumer because just like we have a right to good air good water good food good education we have a right to write and

correct information and information of our choice you can't force me to believe that elephant has five legs you can't put me into an information

bubble all the time. So my only ask is that that we have to treat consumer as the ultimate king and he is the ultimate king and build our entire organization policy framework regulatory

framework partnership with the big tech to solve for the consumer because see I know that all of you know a lot of us you know in this room belong to the media industry

and it's not just like any other you know place to work you know it's not like a you know a hotel or you factory. We are super responsible people and we have a responsibility towards a better

tomorrow for our country and for that to happen it is a pre requisite that people must have a choice choice to consume whatever they want not a choice wherein they are you know manipulated and you

know maneuvered as per the global agendas. &gt;&gt; Thanks DM. Yeah, I have two two two small lines. One is more of our wish and the second

is more my wish. &gt;&gt; Our wish is to find the right revenue models and fair share revenue agreements to ensure journalism as a force for the greater good which is something we have

always done and which is something we'll always do. And my wish as somebody who's involved in this business of news and has the privilege of working for an

extraordinary respected organization is to ensure that I'm always in a position to prioritize long-term trust over short-term efficiency and productivity.

&gt;&gt; Well said. Uh [clears throat] I would say Ashish that uh my wish is that the media will always remain trustled. When everything uh can be generated and almost

everything can be made to look real, then attribution will matter and uh the sources of truth will matter and uh the readers will remember that who stood for the truth when it mattered the most and

uh in such cases if AI can help in deepen that trust, bring back the readers to the habit of thoughtful reading and amplify credible voices, then technology will strengthen

journalism and not weaken it. &gt;&gt; And on a personal level and on a personal level if I say that I see something very profoundly human in the AI promise that perhaps it can take away

loneliness. It can uh provide comfort and uh companionship if it was really anchored with trust and responsibility to provide connection and comfort to millions.

&gt;&gt; Brilliant Mo. I love that twist. Rob, I've only got nine points. [laughter] One of the themes of this summit is harnessing AI's power to be able to

improve society. There are so many ways to do that. This summit is barely going to touch them all. And everyone on this stage is part of that upside. But it can't happen at the same time as

something else so valuable in society is destroyed. Destroyed through negligence. Governments, regulators, politicians do have a role to bring the tech platforms

to negotiation so that the funding models for our journalism can be preserved, expanded, and society thrives. &gt;&gt; Okay. It wasn't mine.

So my wish is that um India wins the cricket best team [laughter] and that my ninepoint charter with Tanme's five points of execution come into play. Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Super. I think we've had a great panel. I'm just summarizing what I'm taking away. Firstly, we owe it to consumers to do it do right by them. And that means labeling, building regional LLMs,

accreditation of sources, accreditation of AI tools, all of that. We owe it to the consumers of media content. Secondly, we need to build LLMs for the future. Otherwise our subsequent

generations will have someone to point and blame back blame us for the lack of what we should have done in building that infra for them and third we need an sovereign AI stack at some level uh and

it needs to have customer at the core it needs to have the consumer at the core otherwise it's not going to serve the purposes of a democracy like India I had a wonderful time moderating an

absolutely brilliant panel people Please put your hands together for them. I think they did a wonderful thought. Lot of very brutal statements made. Thank you very much. Have a great day. Have a

great session. J. &gt;&gt; Thank you.
