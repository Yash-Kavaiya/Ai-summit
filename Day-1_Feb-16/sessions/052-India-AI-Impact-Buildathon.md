&gt;&gt; A huge round of applause for our valued guest. Thank you for sparing your valuable time with our AI builders. Now we officially kick off. Let's look at the agenda for the day.

&gt;&gt; So we have broken down today into four power pack stages. Enhance, evaluate, pitch, and celebrate winners. Stage one is enhance. You will have a 30inut sprint to fine-tune your solutions

against specific test cases. Stage two is evaluate where the scoreboard will do the talking based on live performances. Top six teams will be selected to move forward. Stage three is pitch where top

six teams will present the solution on this national stage and the and answer the jury's tough questions. Remember this is the most exciting and most impactful stage where ideas are tested

for clarity, confidence and real world impact. And finally we'll jump to stage four that is celebrate. We will crown our champions and celebrate them on this national stage with our esteemed jury.

&gt;&gt; It is going to be fast and it is going to be intense. But first to set the context on why we are here and the vision behind this buildathon, please welcome Mr. SP Balaman co-founder Gurui

on the stage. Good afternoon everyone. It gives me an immense pleasure to welcome you all for the India AI impact buildathon grand finale at this

prestigious Barat Mandabam. This prestigious Barat Madam has witnessed lot of transformative moments of our nation and today I'm sure what it is going to witness again is one of the

nation's historic moment that will kindle the a spirit of the youth. Having said that any venue is enriched by the people in it. Okay. So today we have our nation's policy builders, our

technologist, industry experts and the youth who is aspirational to create the to create the a revolution for our country. So it's a great pleasure for me to in invite you all to be part of this

mission of our nation and my heartfelt gratitude to each and every one of you for being here. Having said this, I'll just do a quick recap of what has gone in the last four

months of efforts to make this day happen. Okay. So when this hackathon was rolled out across the country to invite people to come part and join this AI revolution,

more than 40,000 plus people registered for it with a common goal of how they can come along and solve the problem of our nation. Okay. From this 40,000 40,000 people when we see the

demographic of the register registration it is across the places of our country more than 600 plus cities were covered by the registered participants and if you look at the diversification of the

people who registered to solve this problem. There were students there were graduates and they were working professionals which showed how much people are willing to come and be part

of this revolution. But interesting part is there were people from non- tech background as well who joined this movement and wanted to give their contribution

be an inclusive platform. How could we exclude them? So we've opened up our learning contents for people to start learning AI from the basics even if they don't have AI knowledge right from the

basics and [clears throat] how they can build a solutions which can actually create an impact. Okay. So that is how these 40,000 people are enriched to learn and then build and then compete in

this contest. So there's no one is left behind. Okay. Then once you educate them and once you empower them with the skills right that's when the real challenge comes how

to pick the top performers from them. Okay. Imagine 40,000 people are competing against a challenge. That's when Guey's tech platform came into the picture. Okay. So, which is

actually the backbone of Guey powered by technologies help us to shortlist the top winner or top 200 teams from this 47 part 42,000 participants. Imagine how how humongous the task is, right? But

the platform made it in such a way that executed their code base against the test cases and then filtered the top 200 teams which comprises of 850 people from this 40,000

and these 850 850 people are just sitting behind all guys. You are among the top two percentage of the finest AI builders of this country. Imagine this. Wow.

Right. So once you have all this you have made this all I spoke about is what we have done but why this builder matters right? We are here for a common cause of solving a problem of a nation

together with AI out the tools. But imagine today we are living in a world where every nation is trying to compete and lead the AI race. Every day lot of LLMs are getting introduced. You are int

every common man is introduced to lot of AI tools. Okay. But imagine whoever conquers this AI race will lead the global economy and we have the top leaders or top

forerunners of our country who are shaping this a revolution along with us who is running this mission for India. But this responsibility just doesn't lie with them. It's on the shoulders of each

and every one of us over here right as a as a Indian citizen. Every one of us are empowered to be part of this revolution and to step forward with our efforts to see how our country can move forward and

that is the one and only intention or outcome expected of this buildathon, right? To lead this world with our skills economy, right? Because if you if you make sure that the skills are

enriching the people of our country then it will have a direct implication on the jobs on the solutions on the products and make our country the global leader in the upcoming world. Right? So that is

the one and only target of this and we want to have you all as the AI builders and not just the consumers. Okay, that is a statement by us like Indians, we wanted to be the AI builders

and not just the consumers, right? When we wanted to build that kind of aspirational thing for our country, the first thing to do is democratize the learning. How could we do that? That is

when this India AI impact presummit happened, right? We joined hands with the India team of the mighty and then went on ground to the places where even there is a which are far to reach to

make sure everyone gets that opportunity. Okay. The team traveled from Punjab to Tamil Nadu from Gujarat to Tripura to make sure everyone gets a fair opportunity to skill themselves and

be part of this movement. More than More than 10,000 students are directly given a hands-on workshop on the field by industry partners like HCL Techch. Imagine industry coming together with us

and then going into the academia institutions and enriching our future generation. What else the best can have? And this happened in around 48 venues over the past four months. Okay, we are

saying how much effort it takes for doing it in one venue, right? This has been done in 48 venues over the last four months to make this happen. Okay, and this hands-on workshop made sure

that people learned the technology in their native language and then practiced in the platform and got things done. Okay. Next is we have made them skilled but what is the outcome? Give them real

world problem. Let them go and solve it. That's when the final transformation of this India AI buildathon has been brought into picture along with India AI team and HCL. So what's happening now is

today as we speak right we are creating the or we are nurturing the founders and the builders for the AI movement. What we are going to do today as you finish this event right we are just sowed the

seeds of everyone taking forward their own step to make sure how they can contribute to the AI revolution of India and we will see that in the going forward season. Okay. So having said

this I would like to take an opportunity to say when Google has taken this on shoulders there are two things that we need to bet on. One is the government of India. Who else can support us other

than them? That is when the India AI team and the major team came into us came along with us who said go and make this happen we are there to support you and from the industry side we had the

HCL tech who said we'll be there to provide the resources and infrastructure to make this happen. That's how the GUI made this transition of doing this and we are all seeing the outcome here. So

with this moment once I take back many people would have known heard about what GUI is or heard about the name GUI for the first time right to just give a background it's a a tech skill online

skilling platform where you can learn technology skills in your native language and then practice hands-on so [snorts] we are part of the IIT Met incubation and started by started in

2014 as a YouTube channel now being part of HCL family. Okay. Contributing and proudly supporting 4.5 million learners across the globe by teaching them technology in 20 different languages.

Okay. So founded by tech nodes Arun and Shvi contributing this growth. This proud moment makes us feel that the best is yet to come. Okay. Having said this and uh we also proud recipient of two

Guinness World Records for skiing more number of people in AI. And the proud moment here is the first record called I hold along we hold it along with ACT represented by Bddha GI who are the one

who made this possible as a thank you buddhaj and whatever we are witnessing here is just the beginning we want this moment to create the spark in each and every

one of you by end of this event right that the ask from us don't just stop it this is just the start we will be there to guide you we will be there to support you to make this movement go across the

nation and kindle the spark of how India can lead the a revolution as along with our leaders. Thank you so much &gt;&gt; stage for the next part of the ceremony. &gt;&gt; I would also like to invite Mr. Abinav

gosh, senior vice president strategy at seal group to join him on stage for felicitating our honorable guest Shiaishek Singh G. Ladies and gentlemen, now it is our

privilege to formally welcome our honorable guest Shabishek Singh Gi, [snorts] Additional Secretary, Ministry of Electronics, NIT, CEO, India, Director General, NIC. Shabbishek Singh

GI is presently leading the India AI mission, a flagship initiative aimed at strengthening India's AI ecosystem, promoting responsible AI adoption, and advancing innovation at scale for

national development. We are deeply honored by his presence with us today. Sir, we would be deeply honored to hear your thoughts and guidance for this gathering.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you. and uh the Swiss leaders from Guei and SC and all the jury members and all experts here there and all the young minds who are here who are wanting to take part in the

buildathan trying to build something which is impactful which can create a difference which can impact people at large. So today of course we are at the AI impact summit and just looking at the

kind of participation you we have the whole global leaders the whole media and all is talking about the global leaders who are coming and the researchers who are coming and the political leaders who

are coming but the real power and the real strength of India is in all of you who are here to take part in s such hackathons and and the kind of response we have got like outside as per numbers

that have been told more than 25,000 people are So that shows the interest of India in such such events and such activities. It's not that it's a cold play concert where people are going.

People are going here to create value to show what they can how they can learn about technology. How can they can adopt to technology? How they can build things that can improve lives. How AI can

improve the life of a farmer. How AI can improve health care. How AI can impact education. How we can help people with with disabilities. So there are multiple such possibilities which are there. In

fact, I was just at the expo this morning and uh I could see so many solutions, so many solutions built by not big companies but by young startups who are very 20somes kids who are

building solutions that are making a change and I'm sure many of you who are here who have the ability to do that. If you look at any metric, if you look at like the Corsera was conducting a event

this morning and their head was telling me the maximum number of people who subscribe to the AI courses come from India. So this shows the urge of learning. This shows the urge of

enterprise. This shows the capability that we have in building things which can really change the world. So I congratulate all of you who are taking part in this buildathon. I'm sure a very

interesting pitch session lies ahead and we will be hearing much more about what you want to do what you how you can do and then it will be our responsibility that how do we help you realize your

dreams whether it's through ensuring for startups ensuring funding through VCs and funds whether it's through access to lowc cost compute whether it's access to data sets and more importantly access to

mentoring there's so many experts who have gone done this who have gone through this if If they can mentor young startups, if they mentor young minds, then we can really really create an

impact and the whole world knows what India can do when it comes to technology. Not only the big tech companies who are offering uh IT services to the whole world but even our

whole digital public infrastructure story like how we used technology for transforming governance how do we build the identity platform of Aadhaar how we do did UPIs and UPI incidentally for

this summit we got RBI's approval to allow UPI for the foreign delegates so those of you who have come from outside you can also download the app the check pay app check UPI app and load load your

wallet, the one world wallet with your credit card and then go and scan the QR codes at the various food outlets and other places and experience the magic of what it takes to pay things seamlessly.

So our DPI story has a lesson for us in our AI story. How we can build the common common layers, the common platforms of compute, data sets, foundational models and then allow

innovation at top of it. So that's the value that we are trying to create and I'm sure with the young minds here and with this initiative like buildathan and others we'll be able to really really

move forward. I'll just conclude by making one request one appeal. I don't know how many of you have already taken the AI pledge. Has anyone taken the AI pledge? Yes, a few people have taken. So

what we have since this morning 8:00 we are trying to attempt a Guinness record of maximum number of responsible AI pledges in 24 hours and India will show at the start of the summit what we can

do. So already we have crossed 50,000 plus but I'm sure if by the end of this session all of you will go to aip pledge.india.goav.in and take that brief pledge which will

also add to what we are trying to do and maybe on the 18th we'll get a Guinness record. So look forward to getting your contribution on this and in fact once again congratulate the organizers for

doing this buildathan and with your energy I'm sure the outcomes that will come the solutions that you will identify we'll be able to continue it it should not end at this session today but

we should be able to follow up so that when next time we do a summit or we do a event they are the ones who will be showcasing their solutions to honorable prime minister. So wish you all the best

and look forward to seeing impactful solutions. Thank you. Thank you sir for those inspiring words. I would request you for a minute for the flag off. Now I would request our all dignitaries Mr.

Dashish Mishra, Dr. Buddha, Mr. Sepi, Mr. Nirwalia, Mr. Ankit Kakar and her Gurui leadership team to join Shiaishek Singh G for the official flag of ceremony.

&gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you respected dignitaries for officially launching the grand finale of

India AI impact buildathon. &gt;&gt; Guys, this is your moment. Give it your all guys. This is your moment. Give it your all. I don't expect such low energies

among the AI builders. Right. Okay. Now it's time to jump to into stage one that is enhance. To brief you about how to enhance your solution, we need an AI expert. Please welcome Dr. Amit Janma,

head of data science at GUI for the solution enhancement brief. Hi everyone. Okay, so welcome to the final sprint of So congratulations to all the

participants joining us right now. You are among the top 200 teams selected for the final sprint. So for the past few weeks you have been developing solutions for two problem

statements. You know those two problem statements. The first problem statement in the first problem statement you had to build a system which detects whether a voice is

AI generated or not. For instance, if an AI clone voice is mimicking your relative and asking for money, your system should be able to detect it. Similar way, the motivation behind the

second problem statement is to set a honeypot trap that engages with the scammer and intelligently extracts the information from them such as bank accounts, UPI IDs or email addresses.

This final sprint will decide the fate of your solutions. So let me go through what exactly you have to do in the next 30 minutes. We have added hidden test cases for both

the problems that resembles real world scenarios. Your task is to enhance your current solutions so that it generalizes across all the possible scenarios.

To help you optimize your current solution, we have also added sample test cases that you can download from the hackathon platform. Now, let me quickly go through the

So, I mean it's the same hackathon platform that you have been using. The URL is hackathon.goovi.in in and you can use your credentials that you have been using for the past few

weeks. Once you add your credentials, you can sign in. So in the dashboard, you will see the title card of India AI impact buildathon.

You can click on it again. It's the same UI. At the end, you will see a final stage has been added for you. Now, please read the instructions carefully. I mean take some time and go through all

the instructions. If you see for both the problems we have added the sample test cases. So for example for the first problem which is AI generated void detection. If you

click on it you will see the sample audio files that we have added which generalizes across different scenarios. Same way for the second problem statement we have added the chat history

in JSON format. Now once you have read all the instructions at the end you can submit the solution u one second let me log in again

right so it's will once the buildathon starts you can see this I mean it's the button is frozen but you can see the button once you click on this button you will see three fields the first field is

about the uh uh it's a deployment link. So you have to add your updated deployment link. The second field is the API key. So make sure your API key is working and it has enough credits. So

you have to add your API key in the second field. And we have added a new field as a third field which is the GitHub repository link. So you have to add your GitHub repository link there.

Once you have done that, you can submit your solution. Now you can only submit twice. So people again you can only submit two times. So make sure that you are confident with your solution before

submitting. Okay. Once you submit you will see in a few minutes score will be updated at the top and with a a short remark also. Also we have we have designed a live

leaderboard for you which we'll be showing you. Uh so the leaderboard will look something like this where we'll be continuously showing you the top uh 20

teams from student category as well as the professional working professional category. Now throughout the sprint we'll be helping you. If you have any questions

our team will I our team will be moving around. So all the best and start building. Thank you. So the portal activates as exa at exactly 1 p.m. So it's 12:59. Uh anyways

uh can you switch this? Yes. So now you can see the submit solution is activated. So the buildathon is officially on. You have 30 minutes and

yeah again start building. Thank you guys. Thank you Amit. Now before we move on to the next stage guys, we expect you all to maintain full decorum throughout this

round. Respect the space, respect the time and respect the competition. There it is. The clock is live. 30 minutes on board. The countdown starts now. Our mentors are here to guide you. If you

need clarity, raise your hand. We are here to support your enhancement process. Your time starts now. You need to speak the Wi-Fi. you like to talk

&gt;&gt; just smaller. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, how is your experience of this whole buildaththon journey? &gt;&gt; It is very nice. I'm very excite excited to do uh the hackathon and want to

participate.
