## 📝 Transcript

born and born and raised in a typical middle-ass family background. Lot of emphasis on education and uh had a had a urge to challenge the status quo and today all these people together have

created $450 billion in new wealth by the first generation entrepreneurs. Probably the se seventh largest man-made wealth creation opportunity since industrial revolution in 1750.

uh and you know this is and and you know you can see from this room gathering the topic we'll be covering today it is still the beginning right so it is truly how California stumbled upon a gold in

1850 how how the industrial revolution happened how there was a you know growth of US after world war I world war II rise of Japan after the second world war

and r rise of China in u last 50 years as a global manufacturing hub I think what is happening in India in digital and AI is I would definitely term it as a seventh largest modern

history man-made uh opportunity and I hope each one of you find your way to make a large impact. So with that I just wanted to cover a few things on AI. So first of all let me ask one question.

You know there was a thousands of years back human being invented a perfect round wheel. Anyone knows how much time it took from inventing a perfect round wheel to a

wheel with a spoke? Any guesses? We invented a perfect round wheel and now we are moving towards the next innovation which is a wheel with a

spoke. Any ideas guys how much time it took? It took full 5,500 years to go from a perfect round wheel with a wheel with a spoke. And by the time I started my

speech today and till now I think three 15 year old have done vibe coding and probably launched a startup. Right? This is this is the era we are living in. Right? So I just wanted to

mention I was very fortunate to work with Microsoft very closely with Bill Gates and Steve Balmer. Microsoft used to launch a new version of window every six

years. Then this small company called Google came and there was a lot of pressure that Google said I can launch a new I'm an internet company I can launch a new product in six six months. So

Microsoft had a lot of pressure launching Windows every new refresh version in three years. And trust me I I saw hundreds of people who had invented UB USB port and what

C++ cobalt all those people worked at Microsoft and they all failed miserably. They were not attuned to launching a new product in six months. When Facebook came,

Google came in 1998. Facebook originally became a little bit more recognizable in 2008. They said we can launch a new product in a week, right? And of course, we are now talking

about launching a real a product over a cup of coffee, right? So that is a speed at which we live. Uh so I you know it's a real test. Uh you know through from ice age until today earth has seen 50

million species. We are one of the animal species. We had one thing which was different from others. We had adaptation. We adapted faster than others. But AI

takes the adaptation to a different level. Right? AI takes adaptation to the different level. So that's my first uh first take for you guys that really AI means survival of the fittest. Every

time a technology has come, it has displaced people and it has created new opportunities. People who got displaced if they got retrained and made themselves relevant they did even bigger

and better and some people some people unfortunately fizzled down. Let me give you one quick example. In early 1900 US having lot of rivers was placing a bet on water

transportation. So there was lot of investments with Mississippi Ocean on three side there was lot of water transportation happening. Then Wright brothers invented

plane and uh shipping industry thought they are done. Today people from 200 countries take flight to

fly to Miami and then take a cruise and it's a 110 billion business. With the invention of email, United State Postal Services, which was the largest employer in America until 1900 until 1995,

almost became bankrupt. Today, during Black Friday or Cyber Monday or or or other important days, they ship more products than their entire uh mail handling until 1995.

So, technology always makes things better. You have to find your way and AI is going to do one one of those things. Also wanted to give you a couple of more things. Rock Feller became the first

billionaire in the world in 1916 at the age of 77. This year very likely I hope it is before I complete my speech. Alone Musk may become first trillionaire right

after 110 years right he may become the first first trillionaire and rocky feller's wealth was linked with standard oil and Alon Musk wealth is linked to everything which is

uh data technology AI space right modern transportation so that's that's that's a word we are living in and trust me uh Every one of you in this room has equal opportunity to create a larger than life

impact, social transformation and hopefully generational wealth. And I wish all of you all the best for that. you know uh before boom the largest market cap seen by any

company was Microsoft Exone and briefly General Electric and on an on an average these three companies touched half a half a trillion dollar 500 billion

today if I'm not wrong there are at least nine companies which are a trillion dollar plus right Apple became the first trillion dollar company in human life in 2018. Next four

years I think it was the only one. Today we have nine. Uh so uh u so you know this is a big opportunity uh and I hope uh you take some

inspiration all I wanted to say that technologies have always have always existed. They have always made the life better. There's one thing difference in AI. So far technology used to be tool

for you but AI is a companion and we are entering into the era where the companion could be competing with you. So I hope uh you keep all these things in mind. Cost of doing business has come

down. speed of business has gone up by 100x. Um, and I think no longer AI opportunity is limited to certain institutions or certain people and I hope all of you make a big dent uh from

AI. I think uh I was uh informed by the host that I should conclude that so I'll be still at the panel but lovely speaking with all of you and I'm so happy this is I think this room is

carrying three times more people than it is I think legally allowed and I hope each one of you carry some some some some nuggets and some wisdom. Thank you everyone.

[applause] &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you very much. Sorry. &gt;&gt; So, uh I think we'll use the best of time that we have at our hands and start

the first panel discussion on PPP model advancing AI for good. And to start that I would like to call on stage Miss Manju Dusana, lead philanthropies and CSR at Microsoft India. I would also

like to call on stage Miss Nilashi Shukla, principal clean techch equity investments and head of responsible investments at stride circulus capital. Mr. Rohan Chhatwal from vice president

innovation governance excellence at Marauti Suzuki and Mr. Sep Nelwal CEO Polygon Foundation. So they'll have to now demonstrate the

best use of 20 minutes. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Picture is important. So thank you very much. I think the time is less and time is in essence. So after

uh absolutely eyeopening speech from separal uh I really jump into the panel to sepal and one thing I learned if you want to become a unicorn your name has to be sep

or or maybe a bansel or [laughter] something. Incidentally, I think I don't qualify for both but still with state golden sep you have built one of the finest uh

crypto company in the world and now you are running a foundation to tell us very quickly about what this foundation do and what motivated you from being a founder to a foundation founder.

Yeah. So, &gt;&gt; um I had uh started this uh blockchain for impact uh uh foundation. Actually, that was originally the plan was not to actually create like a long-standing

foundation and everything. The plan was uh this was during the 2021 crypto delta wave and uh I was donating uh money and volunteering with lot of uh you know people to uh kind of provide the relief

in India emergency relief and that is one time because being a you know recognized you know a global founder uh with polygon right so I just actually tweeted that okay like I want to donate

money back into India and This is my address. If anybody wants to donate, donate it. I will make sure that it transparently goes to India. And that uh fund actually spiraled uh into a very

big thing globally and from you know your Brett lees to you know global founders to everybody started donating into it and it ended up becoming uh you know over time like you know almost like

$500 billion million dollars in fund. So uh yeah and since then like you know then we provided a lot of uh emergency relief uh I think we donated initially 7 800 crores to all the you know as large

uh government uh hospitals and everything but once the emergency relief uh finished um then we started you know donating into the more of research like right now we have you know kind of

converted into research and you know like because it's related to you know crypto and all so the media doesn't cover it that much but uh uh when originally the vaccination in India was

starting Indian government had vaccines but they did not have syringes so we uh you know worked with uh work with UNICEF at that time and we arranged uh 116 million syringes which is around uh 11

to 12 cr syringes. So actually in the first wave of vaccination one out of three Indians were vaccinated because of the syringes donated by us. Absolutely. &gt;&gt; If this was not related to that like the

whole media would be celebrating that part. No. &gt;&gt; So imagine that not only building a unicorn but creating a $500 million today in toty 4,500 cr fund which is now

helping in India developing the newest technology and sep is doing some transformative work. We'll just come back to it. Uh coming to Rohan. Rohan is part of the India's biggest and the best

since the beginning. It's called Marauti and Maruti as such a bimoth company has decided to work with startups. What prompted Maruti? Marauti is certainly the best company in the country at terms

of cars. Nobody can think of car without Marauti. What prompted Marauti to come back to startups and create this Maruti Innovation Foundation? &gt;&gt; First of all, thank you Nik Nikil G for

such kind words for Marauti. Yes, we make cars. Sep G in his address talked about speed. He gave an example of Microsoft and Google. So I believe speed is one of the strategic advantages today

you can have like it can be part of your strategy. A legacy organization like Marauti Suzuki 42 years in India with almost close to 50% market share fairly innovative company but we cannot rest on

our laurels. We need to be always ahead of the curve. So in 2019 that's when when we started collaborating with startups collaborating with startups who are into new age technology solutions

because u if we were to hire AI engineers in in our company it would have taken us years so instead of building that capability inhouse we started collaborating with startups

startups solving and cracking use cases in quantum startup cracking use cases in big data startups doing lot of stuff in ARVR and of course new age technologies and in a very short span of time what we

have seen is collaboration with startups has resulted in big value creation for Marauti Suzuki uh numbers I would say in last 5 years we've kind of screened more than 6,000 plus startups 200 plus are

working with us engaged with us and 32 have now become our tier one suppliers like business partners and in last 5 years we've given work more than 200 crores to these 32 companies

So it's not just the money but even startups have also learned a lot by collaborating with a large organization like Maruti Suzuki. It's like a win-win proposition for both the entities.

Innovation at speed and also the kind of agility which startups bring to the table. &gt;&gt; I think it's a great example where the startup always complained that large

organizations don't work with them. Here is an example. The largest organization in automotive in the country is working closely with startup and they are saying and they are accepting that we can learn

from startup. We can learn from qu. We can learn futuristic technology from startup. And uh coming to Mangju, Mangju I think the Microsoft is the first technological startup with in the world

which we can say and and one of the rare companies where now $5 trillion transformative work. It's unthinkable to even think about it that anyone can work without Microsoft. What does and since

you are part of the Microsoft what does uh what's the culture of Microsoft about innovation how Microsoft is supporting innovation what work you are doing uh please tell us a little bit more about

the EI program that we are doing &gt;&gt; um so uh first of all I'm a social impact leader I'm not a technology person so I want to clarify that I want to talk about innovation from a

technology lens and I loved what SEP spoke about he spoke about speed right and speed The concept of speed has changed with AI, right? And I heard my other peers talk about agility. But one

of the things that we at Microsoft talk about and I think it's very dear to me which is why we are partnering with FIT or Nunati AI inclusion and I think if AI will only benefit

people in urban and cities then I think we wouldn't have done the right right thing right and we have to make sure that like the AI summit first I'm incredibly proud today to be here to see

so many people here at this AI summit I don't think six months back we thought this was possible but just imagine Imagine if you had to do this in Darbanga

can we do this and that for me truly will be the power of AI and I think uh the reason we partner with Unati AI Dr. Michael, you know that is because we want these startups uh and right now a

lot of startups are solving for tier 2, tier three for urban areas. But how do we ensure that young girls who are in tier 2, tier three towns, who are in rural areas, they become the next

startups, right? How do we ensure that the next Sundep actually comes from uh maybe the remote part of northeast, right? Let's let's see ho how do we do that, right? And it's I think it's a

request also an urge also. You guys are successful. how can we also partner with you while we do within ATI to make sure that we're really taking that funnel of innovation the funnel of talent more

deeply uh into the rural areas and I think that's the only place one of the things Sandep said about is survival of the fittest and I think we have to def we have to make sure that it doesn't

become survival of the fittest who has access to technology but make sure everybody is on the same line at the same time and which is why so proud proud to partner with you Dr.

&gt;&gt; Thanks a lot. I think what we are doing with Microsoft is we are supporting 10 companies which are building technologies for AI for good. It's called Unati AI AI for development AI

for good. Uh and this is something which I learned from both the Sundep as a uh you know Unicorn founders and also Microsoft or Maroti is that not only large companies are building products

but they are responsible companies. They are responsible people. They're building foundation. the wealth that has been created is not just used for building the new wealth but also going back to

the people and supporting what they actually believe in. So thanks a lot. Uh Nilaki coming to you. You are an investor. So how do you look at how do you select those companies? Do you look

at companies only which are building product or making money or you look at companies which are also responsible and impactdriven. &gt;&gt; Thank you Dr. Nickel. Um so I represent

Stride. We're an asset management company investing in debt as well as equity. One of the most active tech investors in the last few years, supported over 200 startups so far. Um,

so I think it is quite multifaceted when you look at look at a particular company. Of course, commercial scalability is very important uh for any investor to get the money back because

we also have a fiduciary responsibility to our investors. uh but to do that responsibly is something that is not only becoming more important from a compliance perspective but also becoming

more investable uh especially when you look at AI when you look at you know some of the sectors that we also have started investing equity in like circular economy it is very important to

look at it from a very responsible lens uh governance is important not having bias is very important when you're looking at let's say MSME giving credit uh to a lot of companies so it's a

multi-led sort of way thinking how we evaluate risk can be multiffold. It could be policy risk, it could be scalability risk and it could be offtake related risk. So I think that's where

you know partnering with corporates who are able to do pilots with companies that are super early stage and validate that supports investors like us to underwrite better and be able to select

companies that then can become the next unicorns. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you very much. Coming to sep what are the top three priorities

India should have in your opinion when we are building responsible AI AI for God or AM for impact. &gt;&gt; I think like you know after doing all of this like philanthropic work and

engaging with the government and all that. I think that what India needs to you know work on is actually working on the hardcore capitalism like we still come from a socialist background and

then you know all of this like you know trying government trying to do this and then you know large institutions trying to do this like as a startup founder when I look into this and I you know

engage with it I I realize like there's so much of energy drain like I'm just thinking as a startup point of view like for for startups they should not engage in a lot of the you know I would say

government programs like just go the capitalist route like build your product go to the VCs only problem only thing like that I would say that India Indian government should work on actually or

all the government institution is to try to create an environment which brings more and more venture capitalist investors into India rest all Indian startup founders will take care like our

startup founders are absolutely global class only problem is we don't have a right funding environment otherwise like Bangalore or Gura these will become like Silicon Valley uh you know environment.

So for me most of the things that India should work on like how do we create a very high quality capital market economy automatically Indian talent will take care of everything else they don't need

to do anything &gt;&gt; I think it's a great answer but I think this is the example what we are seeing in AI summit today the government has taken the responsibility without any

sponsorship for anyone in in fact there's no logos anywhere you will see and the reason government is doing that bringing everyone in the world here and you can demonstration is that the the

there is no rooms hotel rooms available. There is no space to park also. So the whole word is here. I think we should clap uh for the government of for doing a great job.

Coming to Mangjun then I'll come to Rohan. Uh Mangju just give us one example which you like what you're doing in NIT. Just one example. Uh Unati any one company you want to talk about.

&gt;&gt; Okay. Uh also u while I agree um I mean I think I'm a different voice on this. I think this is more startup investor voice but uh Dr. Nikl also want to say that you know I think we have to go

beyond Gau and Bangalore and and I'm going to make a shameless plug if there are other corporate partners here others who are doing similar work as Microsoft how do we take startups and build that

ecosystem or innovation ecosystem in even outside metros please reach out to me love to partner with you love to bring that bring you all to unata but I think if I have to give one example one

example that's very close to my heart maybe praa uh maybe I can talk about that this is a company that is talking about predictive maintenance, right? Um and it's u and it's already got quite a

bit of funding. They're also a solution they're taking to Germany. But why why do I like it? So I think what inspires us is humanizing AI. How do we humanize AI? And I think what they're able to do

is reduce the risk to the manual work that works do on railways, right? So if you look at predictive maintenance, it still continues to be very very manual. They are prone to high risk like

individual worker works for 19 hours every day. Just imagine and they're taking care and ensuring that there are no accidents on the railway tracks, right? This innovation is actually going

to help them not replace their jobs, right? But actually help them to be able to predict this in a more safer way. So they are not prone to so many risks or so many long hours. So this one is very

close to my heart. They all are. You can't choose between your babies. So we have very less time otherwise this would have been a very fun topic that you know this Bangalore and Gorgawa I'm saying

like you are able to do the work and trickle down trickle it down to the other areas because Microsoft made money from some Gura or you know Bangalore or somewhere now so

&gt;&gt; no no discontent about that but I think uh I'm coming from the inclusion lens as I said I'm a different person so &gt;&gt; same I run like a $200 million fund and I'm also funding But I feel that you

know actually capitalism like this is where like we have instead of distributing free food, free money which we did a lot before building ICOs and all that right now we are focusing on

upstream research like helping startups you go to the I would highly recommend people to go to the BFI stall there also even though it's a philanthropic organization but we have startups

demonstrating their products there because we feel that if we are able to get two startups to become like large startups which create like a indigenous Indian thermometer or some sort of

Indian-made product which can be distributed into the uh into India overall that would be the much bigger impact than us distributing food and you know all those kind of things to

enabling India &gt;&gt; and maybe I think uh please uh just last plug I would say that unati AI just builds on the premise that talent exists everywhere opportunity does not and how

do we take that opportunity to &gt;&gt; talent everywhere opportunity does not and that's something which we have to do uh Rohan very quickly can you Tell us one exciting thing what you have done in

micro uh Maruti Innovation Foundation and what is plugged into Marauti. &gt;&gt; So like I said almost 200 startup companies are working with us and our learning is that startups are not

looking for CPR they're looking for CPCT which is like they need customers they need pilots and they need what he talked about commercial transaction commercial transaction and traction both. So what

we have been able to crack here is give live use cases to startups. Bigger the problem then only we can have bigger the solution. I'll give you a uh digital example. There's a startup called as

privacy and he's also holding a session somewhere here. We deal with a lot of customer data. So are we with the all the GDPR and DBDP act in place are we taking care of the data which rests with

Maruti Suzuki in the right way as per the laws because the minimum penalty is multiple kores. So that kind of a solution a startup is now able to crack it. Even the big tech firms don't have

that x-ray privacy x-ray tools which the startup is able to now crack it with the use of AI. In fact big fors refer to this startup and now co-selling to other companies within uh within India and uh

globally. So we are very very proud that we supported the startup when the valuation was only 10 kores and recently uh he raised around and the valuation is as high as 300 plus kores.

&gt;&gt; Fantastic. just marine intervention the startup from 10 crores to 300 crores the last bit uh will you put your money into any of the startup they are talking about

&gt;&gt; definitely [laughter] &gt;&gt; there you go so thank you everyone I think and thanks to all the panelists it's a rapid fire panel for 20 minutes but we have another great panel coming

in now &gt;&gt; thank you so much &gt;&gt; thank you much so we ended up saving a minute thanks to all the panelist. Uh I would

request the organizers to kindly change the name plates, name tags. I also request to kindly avoid doing networking as of now because all speakers are going to stay around.

Uh change the name text. Deputy Head for Industries and Tech Chambers of Commerce and Industry of France, India to kindly come on stage.

Dr. Zille Anam, Senior Program Manager at UK Research and Innovation, British High Commission. Miss Priya Kapoor, non-executive director, Sona Comstar.

Mr. J Koling director Korea thememes startups agency cosmi so before we start the session I would request for a group photograph of the

panelist. So there's a very uh high benchmark of uh 1 minute saved from the previous panel. Hoping to see how you meet that benchmark. Sir, over to

you. &gt;&gt; Uh good afternoon everyone. Oh &gt;&gt; thanks Anit and at the onset thanks to FITT and the organizers I think Dr. Nikl

has set a very high benchmark with the previous panel. So again and thanks to fellow co-panelists we have a very distinguished uh set of co-panelists here and uh the best part is that as you

can see it's very diverse and complimentary panel on various aspects. It's also a very inclusively represented uh panel. uh we we have large uh geographical diversity and I'll jump

straight into the topic with a couple of thoughts. Uh so the you know the discussion points what we are supposed to brainstorm on is how you know the how India can raise its bar when it comes to

providing global class uh AI solutions or AI AI products in the realm of uh innovation and from my own experience both with startup academia as well as translating R&amp;D uh I I think it's an

inflection point because unlike any other technology AI is is a probabilistic technology it's it's not a deterministic technology [snorts] So uh and also it has the uh benefit of scale

the benefit of scale and pace. So so so lot of uh unique uh you know uh things are needed to translate into products of world class. And the goal here the overarching goal here is to uh take

India in the direction of an AI OEM not an AI services provider but an AI OEM. And with that uh in my opinion I think the two most important aspects here are uh consumption how what are the

mechanisms for consuming a probabilistic technology how you uh do that making sure that regulations also don't strive for innovation uh and if we look at the global perspective we have uh you know

distinguished gates from uh Korea UK uh France and also uh Indian colleagues uh while uh you know consumption or opening markets which is obviously one of the thing for for really global class

products you need to have a handshake in the supply chain early on. So it's it's not just that you are accessing their markets but but you have a closer integration at the initial roots level.

So I'll just uh request uh Mr. Lee who brings a very rich uh Korean perspective. what is his perspective on the you know India Korea AI engagements or how at the early levels of of the

engagement we can jump into uh you know some initiatives from the Korean side on AI and in the Indo Korea AI realm Mr. Uh good afternoon everybody. Uh nice to meet you. Uh I am Jay Gongi, director of

the Cosme. Cosme is a Korean government agency for supporting small and medium enterprise from South Korea to India. We are supporting so many Korean uh theme and startup uh in India. I working uh

from two years ago. Uh so we are inviting Korean delegation uh about uh AI startup. Last year we have started this kind of project to invite Korean AI startup and to make a matching uh event

with the uh Korean uh AI startup and uh Indian AI uh uh expert. So I have been interested in promoting India Korea startup exchange program to enable AI technology transport and make a market

uh and uh market expansion. Uh good uh good even uh good uh good afternoon distinguished guest uh ex uh respected panelist policer and uh enter entrepreneur. It's a great

honor uh to participate in the uh India AI impact summit 2026 and to join this important conversation on how India can build AI solution for the world. uh India uh today stand a powerful in uh

inflection point uh it's a strong digital uh infrastructure spec uh inspectional engineering talent and a vibrant uh startup ecosystem India

has the potential not only to develop the solution for domestic need but to become a global hub for scalable impactdriven artificial intelligence I uh I want I I would like to mention

some uh three point impact point for India and Korea. Uh AI s collaboration. Uh how can India build AI solution for the world? Uh building AI uh building AI for the worldly uh world requires

structured globalization. uh innovation alone is not enough. AI startup must be built with global scalability in mind from the beginning. Uh in Korea we have learned that

successful NS uhme global agent globalization require uh governmentbacked innovation financing technology validation mechanism

uh industry integration platform and structured overseas expansion support. Uh [snorts] at COSME uh our organization, we actively support Korean small and medium enterprise and startup

in their inter uh internal uh internationalization journey uh through policy financing, export supportive program, global accelerator and soft lending uh centers.

uh recognizing India's growing AI ecosystem, Korea has undertaken India focused AI market research initiative to better understand uh sectoral opportunity for Korean theme and

startup. We have also initiated a partnership with the Indian AI institution and organization to facilitate the collaboration. This reflect our brief that India is not

just a market. It's a strategic uh uh innovation partner. Second is industry synergy from AI algorithm to industrial application. The TMA of the this session uh emphasize

the startup industry synergy and I strongly agree that this is the uh key the key to global competition. AI must must be uh expand experimental and into real uh uh industrial

transformation. Korea has focused focused the heavily on smart manufacturing and industry force ecosystem. &gt;&gt; Oh yes.

&gt;&gt; Okay. Thank you uh Mr. Lee for the perspective from the Korean side. Uh I'll now jump straight to the the UK perspective. U Dr. Brazil. Ammon uh if you can highlight very specifically uh

what is the uh UK initiatives the indo uh UK AI specific initiatives you can touch upon very specifically few couple of them maybe. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much firstly for having me

over. Uh firstly let let me just tell you upfront that I am not an AI specialist. I'm an infe in infection biologist by training but now I do help governments invest in research and

innovation and the UK government does this by uh an or through an organization called UK research and innovation and we drive growth improve lives and we do this through monetary and non-monetary

support to the UK startups now within India specifically and in context to a AI we do this by joint R&amp;D funding we last here with Prime Minister Stammer. We've launched the UK India advanced

connectivity and innovation center. That center particularly one of these strands is to focus on AI for telecoms. How do we improve networks through the usage of AI [snorts] and it is about piloting

bringing together UK and Indian startups on how can can they basically work together for joint and global challenges. Another way that we as governments co-invest in startups and in

R&amp;D is through joint funding which we do with through collaborative R&amp;D programs, research and development programs wherein uh the UK and the Indian government come together and they we

invite joint bids basically with Indian and UK startups. The framework for engagement for that is essentially we would fund the UK side and the Indian government department of science and

technology department of biotechnology and department of telecommunications specifically in context to AI would fund the Indian startup or theme. Apart from that as the UK government what I can say

is that our idea is not only to focus on monetary support but also on the non-monetary support and for that we have very very specific programs that also enable uh UK startups to come into

an international markets and really allow them to embed and we have them across TRL MRL levels. So uh we have something called a global business innovation programs wherein we uh bring

in UK startups for exploratory visits. Now these are startups that want to explore and see are they even interested in India as a market. Uh so we would arrange a program a week-long program.

Now another way u if a startup is interested in working with India and they want to establish here we would uh we run a global in incubator program that is a year-long mentorship program

wherein we also ensure that they are mentored they are incubated for example we've done with one with T- hub and we would connect them to Indian startups so essentially that's how we we do at

various levels of TRLs and MRLs &gt;&gt; thank you thank you uh Dr. Anam so I think really makes sense because if you're going for deep tech scaled up startups you need to really engage cross

border at the early stages right from the research stage and not just the product stage I'll now request uh Miss Anna to throw the French perspective we have heard from the the Korean the UK

what's the French perspective uh for the uh you know Indo French AI initiatives or how they can be uh taken further miss Um, hi everyone. Um, so my name is Anna. I'm the deputy head for industries at

Business France. I'll just uh quickly remind what Business France is. It's the trained and investment commission at the French embassy. So I'm based in New Delhi. Some of my team are in Bangalore,

Bombay and Chennai. Um so uh concretely our vision uh on this topic is that France today is an emerging uh global AI powerhouse. It's one of the most dynamic AI ecosystems uh in in the world. We

have more than uh 600 AI umdriven startups including uh 77 um pioneering gen AI uh companies. Also uh France has a strategy called France 2030 for investments in deep tech and we already

have invested close to 2.5 billion um euros into this program and in addition on this one we have many world-class clusters be it in Paris and around uh the country where we connect uh deep

research and uh tech companies. So for on to conclude this first point uh France is naturally a global partner for India's uh AI ambition and at business France we support French companies

coming to India and Indian companies uh going to France. Secondly India and France are natural strategic uh partner. Uh why? Um because in France in terms of infrastructure energy for example we

have decar lowcarbon uh energy and in order to run these uh very large AI models this is a a plus. Uh in addition we have large um data centers and emerging uh capacities and secondly on

this point we there's a huge talent and mobility happening between France and India. So this is attractive in terms of visas for students. But in addition we have we run a program called the French

tech visa and we have welcome to the French tech desk where we support uh Indians coming uh to France at business France. So for Indian innovators, startups uh France is a great gh get

gateway uh to open international markets. And lastly, because time is running on this uh panel, uh in order to build AI solutions for the world, you need trusted partnerships. Um even in

this panel, it's a great example. It's a mix of government, research, uh corporates and you need trusted and uh diverse partnerships in order to scale this largely. And that once more at

business France we support industrial and technological bridges by uh connecting French and Indian cooperates uh together and also personally being half French half Indian I really believe

in this bilateral uh cooperation around innovation and um thank you for this and I'll conclude on the point that president president Emanuel Macron's upcoming visit to India uh during which

AI I cooperation is really highlighted as a strategic partnership between both countries. So there will be a huge momentum between uh both countries. Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Thank you Miss Ha. So now I come back to the domestic lens from the international perspective. Uh last but not the least I'll require I'll request Mrs. Priya Kapoor uh with the strong experience

that she brings from Sona Commar. uh I would want you to specifically focus on you know uh you know AI adoption in global manufacturing and mobility. Maybe if you can share some thoughts on that.

&gt;&gt; Um thank you professor man. Uh very good and important uh point. AI adoption and global manufacturing and mobility value chain is a a core operational enablement today. you know whether it be design

engineering it's manufacturing um supply chain and especially in automotive and mobility ecosystems AI is increasingly critical today it is for like demand predictability manufacturing

forecasting um defect um identifying defects on time realtime supply chain visibility and efficiency energy optimization supply I'm sorry what I meant sustainability

compliance. Um let me share a few examples with what we are doing at Sonar Comstar. So Sona comstar has actively been integrating AI um in our in data analyticals and our u manufacturing

operations for precision manufacturing as well as next generation mobility technology developments in our products. So our journey actually began in 2024 in AI

how we were actively integrating it um in our manufacturing operations and in our product developments with a three-year road map and this three-year road map is called the data science

function and this the primary focus of this three-year road map is purely to how we can embed artificial intelligence AI tools in our complete value chain which is again as I shared earlier

manufacturing operational operations supply chain visibility all those factors and then new product developments um such as our sensor radar technology ADAS then um autonomous

driving robotics and automation in our manufacturing operations which gives precise uh and productivity efficiency supply chain control inventory optimization so all these things is how

how we are implementing AI in our operations in our manufacturing facilities. So for me AI is not just about smarter and faster thinking anymore. For SonaComstar,

AI is about empowering employees and the supply chain seamlessly integrating with AI tools and cuttingedge AI algorithms are embedding embedded in our you know operations and these tools how we can

leverage and benefit from these tools to you know create more optimized predictability and autonomous optimization. &gt;&gt; Thank you. to uh Miss Kapoor. I think

that that really makes sense and it's heartening to see that how AI is being taken to the physical world that is robotics or manufacturing and not just data analysis. I think we are out of

time and uh in order to conclude you if if your startup if your AI is looking towards Korea you know whom to talk to. If they're looking towards UK you know whom to talk to if they're looking

towards France Europe you know whom to talk to. What about India? about India you talked to IIT Delhi and fit &gt;&gt; I'd like to add to that man because Sona coma has actually you know we are very

um working with with a lot of initiatives with startups and Indian startups and fit is one of them um uh Dr. Nikl has been part of that with Sona

Comstar and where you know what we are working with them what I see the Indian startups today have this position of strength and you know why they have this position of strength because they have

this unconventional way of um problem solving and they're cost efficient and um they they are not afraid to experiment they're not afraid to for risking um for failure or risk so that's

the advantage India has today and they have this landscape and excite exciting offers in different sort of um industries such as ours as well manufacturing mobility technology and

that's where they their strength of problem solving unique linear approach of how to um look at solutions and technology so I feel India um Indian startups uh today are at a much higher

advantage and a position of strength &gt;&gt; absolutely and we also have the sona comstar fit program. So you should uh I think either Ankit can elaborate on that or maybe you can go online and in the

interest of time whatever suits. Yeah. &gt;&gt; In fact I would like to thank all our partners uh who have graced this occasion and help in curating this uh particular session with uh both the

panel discussions. So I want to thank Polygon Foundation and blockchain for impact. I want to thank Microsoft CSR team. I would also like to thank uh circulus fund from stride ventures.

Nilashi is here uh Marauti Suzuki. So all these corporates funds work very closely with fit IIT Delhi. Uh Anna has recently gotten in touch with us. Uh we are working out as to how we can

collaborate. We are going to create a UK exchange program for startups wherein startups from UK will be coming to India and exploring the ecosystem here. Whereas few startups from here will be

accessing market in UK. Similar kind of engagement we have with Cosmi wherein we have created a report as to how Korean startups can add to the AI ecosystem of India. uh uh how fit can contribute to

the Korean companies coming to India and how Cosmi can create a platform in Korea to help launch products and tools on AI from uh startups in India. I also want to thank and share my gratitude to uh

Miss Kapoor for the wonderful initiative that Sona comstar has with FIT wherein we provide uh funding support and also incubation support to those ideas which want to contribute to the manufacturing

sector of the country and thank you so much to all the 11 uh speakers uh for this session and the patient audience for listening to us. uh we have taken more time so I think I will now get off

stage and happy networking there are few momentos which I think the team wants to give I would request Dr. Agarwal uh Dr. Nikil Aal to kindly come on stage and felicitate all the speakers.

&gt;&gt; Yeah, I would request previous speakers also to kindly stay around so that we can also felicitate you although some of them have left the room.

I would request uh separal gi to kindly come on stage. Nilashi to also join us on stage. Mr. Rohan Chhatwal if you are here please come on stage. Miss Mju if you are here please come on

stage. Mr. Sep Nalwal if you are here please come on stage. I would request everyone to kindly stay on stage so that we can take a group photograph.

What do you think?
