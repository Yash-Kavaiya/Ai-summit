## 📝 Transcript

Hello responsibly foundation is grounded in the same reality small however they face a disproportionate

barrier to access very very decade we've seen how they show their services have been able to help these farmers

have potential to deliver localized recognition services even more context aware and more scalable than But technology alone is not enough. The

real opportunity that we have is to ensure that the system adoptions that small scale farmers face every day. So what is required for that require not just innovation but also coordination

entire ecosystem. that requires shared infrastructure, shared learnings and shared frameworks that allow the ecosystem to move forward. So my colleagues in the agriculture team

at the GU foundation have been ideating about this concept and how we can support extension and advisory systems. I'm going to quickly go to the site because we don't have a lot of time

but uh along with our collaborators all across the world we found that broad application of generic AI can help improve the tools at multiple layers of the stack

and services to being able to develop all the various components that are needed for different layers of strike components such as agriculture specific

covers and benchmarks on everything as we proceed in the session but also components such as the access layers and policy &gt;&gt; and this led to a comprehensive map of

the various layers that are right for innovation &gt;&gt; at the various level of the brings us today to exist to help ensure that the

development and scaling of the system happens in a coordinated responsible. &gt;&gt; It's a collaborative initiative designed to bring together researchers, implement responders, technologies and

agricultural stakeholders to align on the foundational components needed to scale effective AI. &gt;&gt; Ultimately, AGX or AGX AI is about building the connective tissues across

this ecosystem. It helps ensure that AI capability advances they translate into people. &gt;&gt; It's my pleasure to welcome you.

&gt;&gt; Yeah, we realize that was a lot of content in a very short period of time, but don't worry, we're going to have more time to discuss all these components. Um, as as Howard said, uh,

AX AI is really building a community to think through and implement inclusive use of generative AI and other uh, tools to empower farmers through very targeted and tailored egg advisory services.

&gt;&gt; And we realize the context of that is going to be very different in each country in which these services are being delivered. And so as uh Howard mentioned there's a certain architecture

that we're looking at to help focus on specific topics but also recognizing that these topics are interrelated. &gt;&gt; We can't just talk about data [clears throat] without talking about

benchmarks by which they're so what we have here are eight different pillars around services that leverage that first

data data especially that is contextual We're also talking about data that reflects minor languages which is very important too. When we talk about models, how do we test these models? We

have the frontier models which increasingly have been more effective [laughter] in delivering solutions for minor languages. It's an evolution. But we

also recognize there's a need for local languages to be brought into these models to tailor those services. benchmarking who who who's setting up the rules for testing to make sure that

what is being delivered to farmers is accurate and relevant. So that too is contextually relevant. So these three discussion papers are the first of eight and we are now starting on the next

batch of five discussion papers. Localization getting that context rate so what's delivered uh to a woman farmer and a male farmer is relevant to their specific situation and market

opportunities. talk about farmer data. This is a very sensitive but important topic. You know, how do farmers contribute their data and how do they get benefits from sharing of

their data? This is a a very touchy but very important topic so that we don't betray the trust of farmers as we deliver these services. Six is around delivery. We recognize the private

sector plays a very important role as we look at sustainable solutions and so how do we bring in the private sector to this conversation both large organizations and local organizations

equitable access. I really like it as he walks in here the the topic of inclusion and Howard brought this up too making sure that this process is inclusive especially in in markets that are less

developed as far as a policy infrastructure perspective in Africa &gt;&gt; and then the last uh topic but not the only last topic there's more topics but policy how do we create the enabling

environment for AI response use and we're we're looking at India as really a leader um because of [clears throat] the digital public infrastruure that's been put in place with Adar and other

programs. What can we learn from those experiences both positive and what could be improved upon to be adapted and adopted by other countries. So this is a range of topics not

exhaustive but really the core [clears throat] elements of what it would take to sustainably and equitably deliver AI enabled services and the AI axi is really a global effort bringing

together development partners to deliver on this vision. &gt;&gt; So um with that we have a learning agenda and I think you're going to walk

us through that Michael. So uh Michael Mangov's going to from Athena is going to introduce us to our discussion and we want this really to be participatory. So I encourage you to uh be engaged

and let your own voice be heard. Michael so &gt;&gt; yeah so just to reinforce a couple of things David said I get rolling here. This is going to be

a participatory kind of blog after I introduce this learning agenda and and what we're trying to do with this learning agenda under AAI.

&gt;&gt; Um just by a quick show of hands who here in their work is working at the intersection of kind of utilizing AI in agricultural development. anyone

&gt;&gt; AI and agriculture. Okay. So, some people and then for for who here is this kind of totally new who here is doing work in either AI or A but not necessarily the intersection of

the two. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, everyone has some connectivity to what we're talking about great uh because what we're doing so with this learning agenda I'm actually sorry I'm

really &gt;&gt; okay this is much more comfortable for me. So what we're doing with the axi so far so what we've learned when we're talking

about AI advisory for small scale producers right we know this is not just a model right we have AI models that or we have lots of different models AI specific or not that are developed that

are being utilized as part of &gt;&gt; and that can present limitations or you're talking a much broader our systemic kind of uh contextual reality that we need to work

within and try to try to advance to ultimately benefit meaningfully smallcale producers through the use of AI and agriculture. Trust, safety, and accountability are

extraordinarily important. They're they're cornerstone. Without them, you can't get adoption. you can't get um you can't get meaningful uh scale scaled application use and impact.

David mentioned this equity and access the important importance of of those in kind of determining who is benefiting and making sure that those benefits are derived across different kind of groups,

population, socioeconomic data that tie. uh and then you need kind of effective policy and governance in place to make sure that this system being become sustainable in its deployment and and

kind of operationalization over time. So as we've been rolling out this axi program over the last uh 12 or so months the question becomes how do we effectively learn and coordinate and

improve uh leveraging kind of what other people are doing and do it in a way that's fast enough uh to scale across the ecosystem responsibly and effectively.

&gt;&gt; So what we've started thinking about and this is a version 1.0, right? This is a draft and please get your phones out, scan the QR code. This is going to be part of our exercise. This is going to

be what we're engaging in here. Um, &gt;&gt; so &gt;&gt; what we're trying to do is create a shared learning infrastructure &gt;&gt; that we're all organizing around in our

respective work, whether it's in just AI, whether it's in just agriculture or ultimately at the intersection of the two &gt;&gt; so that we're we're

a shared language for how we're thinking about iterating upon learning from exchanging information in this space. &gt;&gt; So, and it's to help us move from

fragmented pilots to comparable evidence, accelerate learning loops, you know, inform better benchmarking, data standards, definitions, uh, safeguards and and ultimately enhance coordination

across the broader ecosystem whether you're working in uh Nigeria, uh, South India or Nairobi. Right. &gt;&gt; Thank [clears throat] you.

So the structure of this learning agenda is aligned with kind of the eight pillars that David introduced a moment ago. Um but it's focused on crosscutting link linkages. So the how does corpus

inform benchmarking? How does benchmarking uh enable enhanced policy? And in fact we have a session later this afternoon at 1:00 today talking about that

linkage. I think here in the I I'll give you the building the the building and and room info a little later. But &gt;&gt; what we're gonna do is hopefully you've all had a chance to

kind of scan with your QR code. This is the same QR. It's to the learning agenda. It's a working draft. What I'm going to ask is you break up into groups of let's say five to 10. You

don't have to be too precise there with the people around you. We're going to circulate some kind of notes uh note sheets that you can use which we're going to collect later. We're also going

to uh circulate some paper printouts of the learning agenda in case you're having any connectivity issues or it's just hard to read on your phone. Um &gt;&gt; and I want to use the next 15 or 20

minutes for people to really start kind of discussing uh and reflecting just a quick reaction. Right? This is the start of a conversation. This is an introduction to

the learning agenda. There's no expectation anyone's going to have a mastery of this content. &gt;&gt; Um but just start discussing with your with your neighbors, collaborators, and

peers some of these questions. So what's missing? Are there thematic elements? Are there pillars that we need to include beyond the pillars that David introduced earlier

&gt;&gt; within these different buckets when we're talking about data corpus farmer data farmer data and localization are there are there are we asking the right questions or are there

&gt;&gt; elements are reflected in the draft learning agenda right now. Similarly with technical performance and evaluation, benchmarking and models, standards for

comparable &gt;&gt; and and then last kind of the linkages to policy, equitable access delivery like are we focusing on the right questions? Are we are we

&gt;&gt; driving towards the right problems that need to be solved? And also &gt;&gt; what would you add? What experiences do you have that you think are relevant? [clears throat] So, I'm gonna stop

there. &gt;&gt; You have a question? &gt;&gt; I do have a question. Yeah. &gt;&gt; But I'm curious. &gt;&gt; I mean, because I I do think learning a

little bit about what you have uncovered so far before we jump to do a discussion like some insights in terms of what's come out from start. &gt;&gt; Absolutely.

&gt;&gt; Yeah. No, thank you. Uh, so just for a little context on kind of the evolution. So what we've done so far there have been discussion papers that have been developed across uh three topics as

David mentioned data data corpus um uh benchmarking and models without going too into the the depth of all of these just because we're time constrained we certainly learned that

there are opportunities and approaches to to data corpus building and talking about data corpus we're talking about the bodies of data that can feed into and inform and be drawn upon for AI

solution development, deployment, etc. Um, you know, there's opportunities for federated model, federated corpus development. So, a combination of uh different layers of of data that that

can be drawn upon from different places. Some of that's quote unquote more static data uh that could be managed at a federal level or at a state level. some of its more dynamic data that could be

accessed, you know, maybe it's market information, maybe it's weather information and thinking about ways to bring that data together and some key challenges that have emerged is how do

you how do you incentivize and enable data share across different types of actors with different types of incentives. So that that's as one example a key question that's really

emerged in that in that space in the context of benchmarking and this is reflected in the learning agenda. You know there are the number of different questions. There's standardization of

language. There's uh standardization and like terminology. There's questions around different types of benchmarking and evaluation. benchmarking a model or evaluating a model's accuracy and

effectiveness versus uh benchmarking or evaluating the user experience of using an AI tool or solution versus what is the actual impact of deploying a an AI tool or solution itself. Right? So

there's kind of these different layers and then there's different considerations around standardization and definitions and then beyond that there's kind of the policy and

governance dimension. So what does how Can you employ and enable or deploy benchmarking in a way that allows for more effective and meaningful oversight at kind of a system level? Whether

you're talking about a state, you're talking about a national level or or somewhere, you know, maybe a bit more localized or somewhere in between. Um, so those are some some examples. I don't

know if that's given enough depth, uh, but I am cognizant of time. So, and I So, what I am going to ask, we're going to try this. It's not it's a time constrained exercise. So very welcome.

We're going to try to break into these groups. If you have any questions, David, myself, we'll be available. We're happy to go around and answer questions and engage in conversation. But please

just kind of circle up with your neighbors. Start thinking about transition. I mean

it is so up and switch &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; I don't know. You have to check.

local issues really leading to any Add something. Is item

I'm not trying to be not done. I I got I had some question a question that I thought was

&gt;&gt; uh really valuable that I didn't. So like this is well we're talking about learning and I know because I've got some colleagues in here that are like very strong researchers that do longer

term impact evaluations. And we're not necessarily talking about that level of evidence generation though that could be part of it. We're also talking about just like how do [snorts] we what are

the topics? what are the things going on right now in real time that we want to try to shine the spotlights onto right so like as this is a dynamic space the conversations are constantly evolving

and rapidly evolving so like we're trying to collect information on if we wanted a webinar on a certain question or topic just to understand what's happening like what what is material

what so there's different versions of learning and knowledge sharing knowledge exchange that this exercise is meant to uh Watch. Take about seven more minutes.

channel. background. Yes. Southern Street. Yeah, please.

Excuse me. Mr. Can we mix or timer? video operator.

timer. Coordinator. Sure. session itch.

Yeah. Just a couple more minutes and then we're gonna All cake. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.

Any questions? Anyone unsure about this exercise? I like YouTube studio.

My YouTube channel. interface AI powered intelligence to enhance decision making that's ultimately right

whether we're talking RSK officer and we're talking about CS you know different so so what this session is acknowledge that there's all of these different strategies and how do

they how do they kind of talk I got I got a &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, I'm going to ask you all to wrap up in 20 seconds. So, start making

your way back to your seat. We have to return the chairs to the way they were. So, feel free to help us with that process as you get back to where you were sitting.

Thank you. &gt;&gt; All right. I I actually genuinely love seeing how reluctant people are to get back to their seats because that means there's some actual good conversation

happening, which is wonderful. But I am going to ask you &gt;&gt; Deepa uh to get back to &gt;&gt; let's get we're go we're going back to our our seats.

&gt;&gt; Okay. So in a moment we're going to put up a mentor meter and ask people to start filling in some reflections and key takeaways. But before we do that, I'd love just to open it up to the floor

and hear from any anyone from any group maybe one one or two key things that came up for for you that you that you want to kind of flag or that you'd love to bring into kind of the group

conversation. So one key issue that my problem is coming from &gt;&gt; but one of the thing that I was searching

price today will be 100 [clears throat] AI has to has the tools to larger. &gt;&gt; So we are part here like three states together. Input from North India. Onion

from North India will be audio. &gt;&gt; So if you were to frame this for &gt;&gt; Yeah. So if you were to frame this as so one it's how do how do we

&gt;&gt; improve the communication around how to calculate that type get get improved yield estimates on one hand on the additionally there's how do we kind of coordinate and scale that type of

initiative to improve broader based potentially national level planning and coordination &gt;&gt; I mean like today we don't

that's the primary source of data. So when you think about the compass cce or MS which is the minimum right become the only source and they may not necessarily be a good data compass to train AI

problems on because they're not realistic. Um I I three three quick points right one is I think it's really helpful to start with not all data is equal because there are

certain things that has a much bigger impact on the farmer's income and life input like maybe inputs and prices are really right on top so today we have no data cus and I think that's a huge

emphasis when we start thinking about data cus how do you think how do you prioritize what what has a bigger impact on the farmer directly And that's a &gt;&gt; and and how do you create and manage it

right because prices is very can be very hyper &gt;&gt; local exactly how do you how do you build a data cass around that I think is a really big question I think and I

think finding answers to that documenting good practices and how they've mapped it is really important I think the second piece that's coming through is that we keep what I think

there's enough experience in the room to show that general purpose model it's just not doing it right Q&amp;A fairs just aren't delivering the value that farmers need. Uh the local oncologies and I

think there's a lot of focus on I think he put it quite nicely. He said document the undocumented and I think we had an entrepreneur who said really &gt;&gt; how can farmers translate this on the

ground we need more practice as again very generic like ideas u there's another big point that came out was just this so much of the burden of building and growing the data corpus today lies

with the last night village assistant and we have very unrealistic demands with complex political economy incentives on how that data is generated at the last

So we have time for one one more &gt;&gt; anybody that's at a different organization &gt;&gt; I'll be quick so I'm from Microsoft research so there were a couple of

points that you discussed one of which is that um you know I feel like there's already been a lot of pilots on agriculture and AI, right? So, it would be really great to understand um you

know how well they worked in terms of the AI model itself, the system as well as any long-term impacts that we know about for those models. So, for those uh systems so I think that's missing right

now. We have had so many of these pilot deployments and also longerterm deployments but we don't really know at least AI you know model builders or application developers may not know what

went wrong what worked well etc. So I think a study on that would be super useful. The second thing we talked about was very similar to what was just mentioned about data and that is that

you know how can we ensure that we collect data from communities but also don't overburden them with the data collection &gt;&gt; that is such a huge challenge

&gt;&gt; you know try to make it part of their daily lives but also try to collect representative data so I think that is something that we also discussed in this &gt;&gt; okay I'm I'm being uh encouraged to

advance the conversation so we don't &gt;&gt; So that's a great uh tease. So we are we are doing this in Andra Pradesh and we have a session on Wednesday afternoon at 12 12:30. Is that right? Yeah. I think I

think is a three here a three &gt;&gt; 1:30 on Wednesday to so to learn more about some of the stuff we're dealing with on the ground in Andra Pradesh Wednesday at 1:30 I don't have time

right now I apologize but so what we're going to do I'm going to hand it over to my colleague Sophie to introduce we're just going to kick off a mentometer &gt;&gt; okay everyone so there is a new QR code

on the screen for a mentometer survey so if everyone can pull that up on their own devices. We're going to collect some live feedback

&gt;&gt; and we're going to try to wrap a few minutes early because we know there's a plenary session and we want everyone to feel comfortable having time to get over there. So, that's part of why we're kind

of advancing the the cadence here. So please do uh put in your inputs and and kind of reflections and the mentimeter. We really want to capture I mean the insights that were just shared

in these like two seconds were awesome. We want to capture as much of that depth as possible because it's really going to help us think through and advance the conversations of how to meaningfully

learn and and help people operating on the ground. It's not working. &gt;&gt; We're having some issues with the mental All right. &gt;&gt; It's not

&gt;&gt; where it's good. Okay. Ment is working. &gt;&gt; And now it's not showing up. &gt;&gt; Sorry. &gt;&gt; And there it is on the screen. &gt;&gt; All right. We're live. Mention me. There

we go. Okay. &gt;&gt; First question. What key areas would you be interested in contributing to? policy, equitable access and delivery, data corpus, farmer data localization,

benchmarking and models. &gt;&gt; So we we made sure to capture information as you were coming in though I know some people have joined late. I know there was a long line. If you are

interested in participating in ax could my colleagues in the ax team raise your hands. Please, please try to find one of them. If you haven't signed up and you would be interested in in

getting more information about AXAI, &gt;&gt; please find one of one of my colleagues. Uh &gt;&gt; Janelle, Jess, &gt;&gt; we'll also have a QR code.

Yeah, &gt;&gt; 18 of 37 have responded. So, we'll give it another few seconds. I'm sure moves into second place. &gt;&gt; I don't know if they have like mascot

races in the US on baseball games. You have mascot races. It's like who which is going to win? &gt;&gt; Okay, we'll move on to the next

question. Thank you for your responses. &gt;&gt; All right. Within the draft learning edition agenda, what key additions or revisions would you make? So, this is an open-ended

question. Your responses will pop up on the screen, but give more cont. So I mean again as you were going through the learning agenda which again v 1.0 right early draft it's

not in any way meant to be complete or finished at this point. I think some of the things that were raised like like what Deepa mentioned about &gt;&gt; you know how do we do we have good

examples of integrating price data um at at kind of which is hyper localiz and building that into existing data cor corpus or cororora &gt;&gt; um I think details like that there's a

conversation that I had over over there about kind of what do we do when we're getting when we're transitioning to ondevice models and how does that change the conversation? So,

you know, I don't necessarily have an answer to that, right? But, but these are the types of questions that we want to capture. These are the types of information that people are asking

themselves. How can we bring a magnifying glass to that? How how can we create a broader community awareness about these uh questions and create broader conversation or dialogue that

we're all learning this together? Let's spend just one more minute on this question and then we'll move on. Okay, last question for you and this

will be a word cloud so shorter answers are preferred. What other topics would you add to the core taxonomy? So we had those eight pillars. &gt;&gt; What other topics would you add?

&gt;&gt; So if you remember that the eight pillars are data corpus, benchmarking, models, localization, delivery, equal access, uh farmer data. I believe

I believe I said policy &gt;&gt; and policy. Thank you. Uh and we've also had some initial conversations around geospatial and risk either as kind of standalone pillars or or kind of

crosscutting considerations across some of these. Are there any other kind of foundational elements you would add beyond those eight &gt;&gt; plus

outcomes is a good one. education. I like that a lot. &gt;&gt; Farmer well-being. Secondary income. All right. I think I think we're at

we're at official wrap up tonight. What? &gt;&gt; Get on the bed. All right. So, we're going to we're going to wrap up uh here. I want to

quickly just just to reflect again this this axi community of practice. It's meant to foster connectivity and coordination across the ecosystem of actors that are working to advance the

use of AI advisory for small scale producers in agriculture. I want to thank you all for kind of engaging in this somewhat experimental design in the context of this AI summit and and

participate in a participatory session and really engage in the conversation. Thank you to the those who raised their hands. I thought, you know, highlighting kind of these challenges, whether you're

talking about meaningful crop yield estimates that allow improved coordination at at state and national levels. Um when you're talking about how do you integrate

uh tric data which is hyper local as part of a broader federated cor corpus model and and that use that to enable kind of some of these really complex but important localized decisions in a way

that that drives impact like these are the exactly the types of feedback that we're looking for and and information. If you want to join the community, uh you can join the the AXAI mailing list

with this QR code. There are the discussion paper brief little one pages across all eight topics that you can access at the the other QR code. &gt;&gt; Um and with that, I think we're doing a

quick uh something. [laughter] [applause] So with as we do this, we'll we'll be wrapping

up here. I really want to thank everyone for for your participation. We're going to wrap a few minutes early so everyone has time to advance to the the plenary session or the next thing on your

agenda. Could everyone please pass forward your note takingaking sheet uh that that you and if you wrote any notes down, we'd love to we'd love to collect. Thank you.

Thank you everyone. Appreciate it. &gt;&gt; it went. It went
