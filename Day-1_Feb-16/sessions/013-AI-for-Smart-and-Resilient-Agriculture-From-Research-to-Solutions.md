## 📝 Transcript

always a lot of data, That's a AI, simple tools, low energy consumption, jugart as you say in India, accessible to small farms, clear governance, legal and ethical framework

to protect farmers and their data, an open and collaborative ecosystem, public private partnership, training and sharing innovation and collaborative tools I can mention an example so it was

born in the INRA within it's hosted by the ina foundation and it's developing especially in India we we are all together building plantet plantet is and can rec recognize disease the

content is a common is free it's built by citizens contribution prepared by researchers in aronomy and AI to recognize the plants. So that's an example of the kind of things we can do

all together. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Um now give me the floor to the other enrio on this let's say this connection between research and the application on

farm level if you have let's say any broad broader view of this. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Um well I think it's clear that the system uh to feed the world is uh overdue for an upgrade and we are all

here uh because we believe that artificial intelligence and digital agriculture offer a unique window to accelerate transformation but there are some risks associated to that and this

is exactly why at the FAO we launched the digital agriculture and AI innovation uh roadmap uh which is a federated and decentralized framework framework to move ideas from problem

definition to testing, prototyping, deployment and scale. And we don't do that alone. We do that with a set of of of stakeholders uh working together on uh clear missions

and use cases. For example, uh climate smart uh advisory services or early warning systems, market access and food traceability. uh and the methodology that we apply

there is a structured approach to select the high value ones futurep proof initiatives to work very closely with uh different stakeholders from the private sector, government, research institutes

but also farmer organizations and startups. Uh and in this road map we identified four services. The first one is an AI governance assessment framework developed together with the human

technology foundation. Uh the second one is an AI sandbox, a safe space to experiment, validate innovation hypothesis, but also test market fits. And we are bringing them all together

these innovations and use cases in the newly developed science technology and innovation portal uh that has been uh developed in FO and uh working together on innovation hubs. So working with the

innovation ecosystem to actually implement these use cases. And I wanted to mention two good examples that we have been working on together with an an organization which is called digital

green very well known here in India. and we work together with them on a tool which is called farmer chat and it's a chatbot which is using local locally relevant uh information that can be used

by extension services but the first pilot we did was actually in Ethiopia where we worked with uh farmer organizations and also startup ecosystem that can then use this farmer chatbot to

work directly with the farmer organizations and secondly currently we work uh with the farmer field school uh in FAO which is uh active in many countries around

the world uh on the implementation of farmer chat together with the farmer field schools. So to really make sure that these uh these tools uh that the chat bots that are uh developed they can

be uh used by by the farmer organizations themselves. And maybe lastly if I can wrap up is that FAO is very uh proud to be uh one of the biggest contributors in the UN system of

digital public goods. I mean as you all know it's it's open data, open software, open standards and in the next session there will be a lot of discussion also about open standards and open AI models

and we are currently uh contributing 11 digital public goods. Uh Agravok is one of them. You mentioned it already. uh we're very proud that it became sort of the glue uh that is stitching everything

together uh but also we have a geospatial platform and also digital service portfolio which is providing services to smallcale producers. So with the road map we try to bring it all

together uh and work together as an ecosystem to transform agri food systems using AI in an inclusive way. &gt;&gt; Thank you Henry. Uh if I ask more from your experience because time is running

there have been some pressure from the desk say okay thing to conclude but we have 10 minutes remaining would have tools we have research ongoing we have private companies on

disseminating tools I wanted to disseminate it uh the farmers how do they perceive the said the huge variety of tools that that are available and how can be can they be confident in the use

of these tools uh ri was quoting the sitation that we want servants not masters. So what is the vision in the field of people working there or excession services that were mentioned

by enri how they live with this because there's a lot of possibilities so how to choose and how to maintain their own decision what is your vision about this yeah uh we also have firstand experience

of u promoting AI tools in livestock particularly so we have been working through our incubation center one of the very good company called ERIT solutions. So they provide neck collar for the

animals for monitoring health, monitoring the uh heat or detection of the heat of the animal for you know right time incimination

and also the nutrition management. So um the technology this particular technology and uh as you know there are already technologies or the AI tools available for crop management and one of

the very good example is the cooperation between uh agriculture trust Baramati Microsoft Oxford they have come out with a solution which enhances the sugar cane productivity by 25 to 30%. And uh there

are many such uh tools already available and many private companies they also offer several tools. So farmers are ready in India. Farmers are ready to adopt because they want to

have resilience in the whole system. They also want to optimize and maximize the land productivity and the returns from the production. So they need it in India. Now the challenge is

how to reach out to those who actually require and those who are ready and how to make people aware those who are not yet ready and but then they need it. &gt;&gt; So the challenge is number one make them

aware through various tools techniques. Number two, create the channels through government system which already to some extent they have initiated

through private players to reach out and to initially undertake demonstrations and for undertaking demonstrations incentivization to the companies and the organizations who are already taking

these solutions to the needy farmers is most essential. potential. Number two, the safety nets and data protection. Now there is going to be huge amount of data generation like we

are working in animal genomics and the amount of data generated and the value of that data again for giving great benefit to the Indian farmers is huge is immense.

So for everyone whether government system, private system the responsibility lies on the service providers in protecting this data and specially

making the analyzed information available accessible to the farmers. So therefore it is both opportunity and a challenge to provide the services AI services for enhanced productivity and

returns to the farmers as well as ensuring that the information generated is effectively used only for the farmers from where the data comes. So I think uh

that is very very important and with this AI tools I think in India we expect that the agriculture based economy is possibly going to be transformative

and we are targeting maybe whatever level of income we may have at present but at least from 1 acre of land that is biops experience we will be able to provide solutions to have minimum 1

million rupees the annual income to the farmers the small and marginal palmers in India. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Thank you Dr. Barat. Maybe if one of you a few a few words one minute Carl sorry

because the time is running but it's very interesting &gt;&gt; ju just to add um few words about the the need of um of co-design with farmers. Uh it is um very important to

to to to try to do our best to embed their our own experience uh in order to to define the problem and also to to identify the solution. So this is um a very important points and

we are discussing a lot about that with the LAR digit &gt;&gt; Olivia reaction co-design do you co-design your tools with farmers or do you offer them a well packaged tools

with black box &gt;&gt; more than that actually we are &gt;&gt; few words &gt;&gt; yeah [laughter] yeah we are organizing for the third year the AI acon at

salonulture uh we promote the AI not only with tools but also with liter accuracy because we need farmers and food company to understand what AI is capable of because

sometime is farfetched and also data just just one word about we are also exposing under the France Pavon just nearby so if you want to carry on on the conversation please come

&gt;&gt; some advertisement for to visit the French pavian so thank you so I think we are going now to to to conclude this round table 15 minutes is very short time but I try to wrap up some some some

ideas I've got that finally there is a lot of thing happening there uh some tools are already operating was mentioning the plant net tools for example they have been developed at the

beginning for botani purposes to identify which what is the species that I'm finding in when I'm let's say working in the forest and now it's used for by farmers to detect some disease

some pest so a lot of tools are available They may be have been developed in the different field but they may be usable also for agriculture. We did not have time to to expand the

discussion on the let's say downstream of the production. We focused on mostly on the the farms and the the the fields and production but of course AI has also a lot to do with the downstream with all

the value chains done to the citizens the consumers that we all are. So it's not only a matter of production helping products producers with AI but also having the all the food system

let's say powered by AI tools and uh there's also challenge a lot of let's say exciting perspectives but also few warnings it was mentioned by Dr. Barat about the data sovereignty the data for

the from the farmers for the farmers not for let's say generating a high income for outside it's very important to be also inclusive to have everybody on the table or on board depending on the image

you're using but that's the same idea that you should be inclusive not letting any farmer outside of the system but also having in mind that it's sometimes difficult to to change the way you have

been working for decades so we need to have this all this training explaining testing demonstrating in field and it's that was also mentioned and to uh I've borrowed a formula from a website from

enam.ai AI which is an initiative of the Indian Ministry of Education to advance responsible AI research and deployment in agriculture at IIT ROAR and they say that uh coupling

and farming practices offers an opportunity to go from green revolution here in India we know what green revolution means to green intelligence and I think that's that's a nice idea to

to have in mind that it's not only a matter of tools it's a matter of seeing the world in a different Okay, for the general good, for the the common good, for the farmers, for the citizens or all

the the let's say our civilizations s at civilizations that made difference. But for me, it's very important to promote the the idea that it's useful. It's not a threat, but we need to be

careful in deploying such tools and using them for the benefit of all starting by the farmers of course because here we're talking about AI and agriculture. So thanks for the

panelists. I round of applause for them because it was not easy for them and thank you for attending. And of course you can say here to discuss about standards in AI with our colleagues from

EA. &gt;&gt; That's it. Thank you. How many of them? Eight. &gt;&gt; Hello. Hello. Uh thank you India delegation for coming here and

expressing your opinions on behalf of India team. We would like to give you some momentos. from the was too late to listen to what I was saying.

was supposed to. &gt;&gt; So, sorry for the delay, but we made it. So All right. I have one
