## 📝 Summary

AI will create more job opportunities but also make many existing jobs redundant. This will also require skilling and re-skilling of workers across the spectrum. The Panel Discussion will focus on short-term and long-term impact of AI on employment, both at the industry level (e.g., manufacturing, healthcare, automobile) and function level (e.g., HR, sales, supply chain). Moreover, the panel will identify steps to be taken to mitigate the risks by enhancing opportunities.
