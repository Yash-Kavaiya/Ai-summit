## 📝 Transcript

And also we are developing a big large language model which we call agree LLM. So we are we can we can help our farmers when they ask some questions some queries we can help them in a better

way. So the AI agree LM is also we are developing at IIT roert and whatever the solution what we have developed in IIT roert they are make in made in IIT RO including the electronics. It's not like

that we assemble the components. We make all electronics and and we are for example our weather station are installed all over the India right now and our weather station has a accuracy

of 99% given by IMD department in Pune. So we are setting up a weather station in UP, Punjab, Hana, Andra, GNK. So many states. So they can get a accurate weather data. farmers can and they can

also get the soil tested in a better way so they can grow their crops in a different manner or very productive manner. So so this is our aim and we are in talking terms with the FPOS's and

farmers directly actually. So this give us also a a due kind of feedback where we are working directly with the farmers and in Punjab some of the farmers are very progressive so they are adopting

this technology and of course uh we are working with the Andra also and we are working in UP also being a bigger state so we are putting all these weather station at least one in one gram panchay

and the cost is very effectable and it's very scalable we have put the cost almost around 15,000 Indian rupees only so it's very cheap solution for farmers and same thing it can give not only the

weather but it also give the information about your rain radiation wind speed and the soil temperature humidity of your soil in your field. So, so this gives you a multi-dimensional weather station

with very high accuracy and based on this data we can make uh perfect or responsible AI models and in the end the data is a is a what you say data is a oil for today actually our minister was

saying day before yesterday because he was a oil minister petroleum minister he was saying I didn't know that data will also become a petrol oil so so data is the oil and the future and India has a

data so we can make a really a very responsible and a predictable AI uh for our farmers to so they can increase their productivity and also the pest control and the the crop damage all

these can be studied while sitting uh and getting this information in their apps. So this is the way it roer is growing and uh we are very proud of that we got this center and we have a we have

got opportunity to work with the with Israel and uh we are looking forward to work with you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you so much professor huja for setting the right tone for this

session where what is there from our side and we look forward to collaborate with Israel on the same side. So uh we move next to Dr. Gal for his inputs listening to what is coming from an

Indian side from the nodal center of excellence for artificial intelligence in agriculture. How you see the potential opportunities of collaborating with the Indian counterparts for the

joint uh AI impact together. &gt;&gt; All right. uh professor gal I'll request uh as our ambassador has to has some important assignments lined in couple of uh minutes. So before we move to our

fellow panelist I would like in fact we all would like to have the thought pro session and the vision for India and Israel coming together from his excellency from ambassador himself.

Hello everybody. Uh I'm really thrilled to be here at the AI summit and I want to thank the organizers I roar and Maya Sherman from the embassy as well as welcoming my colleagues from Israel.

Thank you for making all the way to come here and speak with us. Um, imagine a day in which every farmer in India, every one of the millions and millions of farmers will be able to have in his

cell phone the entire knowledge that research has gathered in history and make it available for him to implement in Hills plot whether in a sit a situation that

all The weather information, all the knowledge gathered about soil analysis, all the knowledge gathered about the quality of the right seeds to put. All the knowledge guiding

him when to plant, what to plant, when to fertilize, when to irrigate, how much to irrigate. the satellite imagery that would analyze the soil uh the the water in the soil

the humidity of the soil will be available not just for the entire plot for every plant in his plot. Imagine that all that would be available thanks to the huge amount of knowledge has been

gathered and that is accumulated by AI. Well, the news ladies and gentlemen is that this technology is already available and we are going to use the platform

that we have built with the government of India in the last 30 years to make this knowledge available to each and every farmer. We as you know have uh built together with a huge investment

from the Indian government that has spent between three to four million dollars in each one of the 34 centers of excellence that are spread all around India.

um with modern uh irrigation systems, modern nurseries that supply subsidized seedlings to the farmers, seedlings that have the qualities that are required in order to get better crops and to use

less pesticides. This is all working today and we are going to add a layer that we started actually experimenting this year in nine plots in Punjab, Harana and Maharashtra.

And these plots are being uh uh are are being uh basically are demonstrating the technology of an Israeli company called N Drip. You might want to look it up. ndrip.com.

This company has developed a system that actually not only does all of almost all of what I mentioned before, but also does it with a requirement of almost zero energy.

&gt;&gt; And why is that? It's because AndRIP is using a very specific technology in which the irrigation chip doesn't need uh a lot of uh pressure in the water. You can use actually gravity to irrigate

a plot of 150 mters on 150 meters. And this system that costs no more than $2,000 and can be useful for a farmer for several years can gather with sensors the analysis of the ground and

transmit it directly to an AI center that actually helps the farmer and tells him what is the situation of his soil, when to plant, when to harvest, when to fert fertilize.

Guys, everything is available now. Uh, and has already implemented uh, you know, is applied in several fields around the country in private farms. I personally visited one of them uh, about

a month ago in uh, in uh, near Agra in Uttar Pradesh and now we have finished establishing as I said nine demonstration plots in the centers of excellence. We hope that after the

ministry of agriculture analyzes the results of this uh of these plots they will decide to adopt it nation nationwide and once that happens the implications for the average Indian

farmer will be huge. So we are so happy that thanks to the trust that we have built with the Indian government, thanks to the cooperation we have have been having with the uh research agriculture

research institutes such as IIT Roar, we are bringing this uh news to uh the agricultural sector in India to the farmers of India and I know that as much as we have succeeded so far in getting

modern irrigation systems to millions and millions of farmers around the country. We are going to do the same with AI thanks to technologies like endrip and many other technologies that

together we will bring to this country. Thank you very much. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you so much for the vibrant words and the thought that you have shared with us. Of course the

success lies in joint collaboration and together not just starting with the Agra but of course reaching to Punjab with IIT Roper. Thank you. Thank you for your words. Uh now I jump back to professor

Gal for his perspective on how the way forward for India and Israel coming together to take it forward from here. &gt;&gt; Well uh I don't know if you if if you if you

know that in Israel there's a labor shortage right now. So when when there's a labor shortage, what do you do actually is you you have one option is to raise salaries for attract people.

Another way is to bring to find more workers and we're trying to find workers. we can't find workers anywhere but and at the same time there's an an alternatives to uh implement automation

and start working with with new tools and and the genai and the LLA models and all all of the models for fits for for the artificial intelligence right now allows us to make uh this technology

available for everyone. uh for instance the democ if you know the democratization of the technology allows us for each one of us to be a developer in that uh building applications this

this allows us for every everyone during agriculture when you're in field of agriculture in other businesses as well to develop things by by your own to and each one of

us has this potential to become some kind of inventor and this artificial intelligence and that's one thing that we're doing in Israel, I think, is allows us to to work with this uh this

new technology to fits together and to find the best way to co to coordinate allows all of the all of the people to be part of this process and that's something we're trying to do in Israel

and I know you're trying to do that as well in India in India to to make this technology available to for everyone to use it more commonly this is allows us to make this quantum leap in uh working

with being more efficient being more productive and what so there's a lot of things a lot of working with smart agriculture in Israel a lot of practices what to do

with the with the crops and understanding working with data for each one of us it's a this technology has become available so that's something we're I think it's one advantage of

working together doing joint ventures in order to allow more people to be part of this process what we do for instance at the Israeli employment services in Israel is like trying to find to work on

the on both the sides of the aisle working with employers understanding introducing a new technology at at and at the same time introducing also skills for the for the labor market in order

them to to know how to use this technology. Sometimes it's very basic and that's something we're trying to to develop and I think that's a lot of pros in this uh kind of interventions and

there's a lot for us uh to bring and a lot of us a lot of things for us to to understand and to know and I think working together allows us to implement that very efficiently.

&gt;&gt; Yeah. Thank you. Thank you so much professor gal for sharing these thoughts and of course uh collaborating together to understand the pain points from both the sides and how we can jointly work

together for this. Now for a different perspective as we were having a pre-introduction uh chat with uh professor dove so would like to have your thoughts on how the seeding of this

collaboration can take forward in terms of modernizing agriculture. &gt;&gt; Okay, thank you very much. I want to thank uh Maya and the embassy of Israel and I roer um for hosting this. I want

to actually talk about some governance issues that my institute is thinking about about an emerging technology in this space. Um I a lot of people when they talk about AI and biotech talk

about automation, they talk about data, they talk about sensors, they talk about information. I want to talk about a novel area again u where we are thinking about governance in this space and um

really quickly I'm totally switching track so all of life on the planet follows the exact same rules for the most part uh we're all made up of DNA and DNA is comprised of how many letters

anyone know &gt;&gt; four that's right and DNA letters make up words that we call codons those codons translate into amino acids which are the basis for our proteins. Each

codon is three letters long. That means the dictionary of DNA words is any mathematicians here? The dictionary of DNA words is 64 words. That's what we have. 64 words of DNA in the entirety of

life on the planet for the most part with some exceptions. Interestingly enough, what that means is there's only 20 amino acids that we have. We have 64 words for 20 amino acids which means

that we have what we call a degenerate system. We have a lot of redundancy in the system. And what is emerging now is the technology facilitated by AI for [cough and clears throat]

for refactoring the human genome or for refactoring biotechnological crops. What does refactoring mean? That means that we can take a codeodon that is that is redundant and we can add something and

we can change it. We can change it to allow not only optimization facilitated facilitated by artificial intelligence but we can actually introduce novel aspects to proteins. We can introduce

non-organic components to proteins which creates huge opportunities in the area of biotechnology. Thinking about this though, thinking about the governance issues in this

space, there are a lot of really interesting issues that have to be tackled before we can uh promote this sort of technology. For example, you have to think about um patenting, who

owns these emerging technologies, who who [clears throat] facilitates this, who will implement this. We have to think about to some degree whether or not there are concerns with the

development of Frankenstein like crops. Crops that we don't what what we call unknowable unknowables. What will happen down the road when we start changing the fundamental aspects of genomes. We have

to think about whether or not this qualifies as genetically mod modified organisms or not. Unfortunately, we also have to think about the weaponization of this technology. whether or not you can

create mal whether or not malicious actors can create novel sorts of crops that are effectively undetectable because our technologies don't allow for the detection of these sort of novel

refactor genomes. Another concern is that the pace of artificial intelligence in allowing us to refactor these genomes sort of outpaces the governance that we

currently have and thinking about how to implement governance today that will be useful tomorrow when this emerging technology erupts. How do we think about those things as well? Of course, AI

provides low barriers of entry. So whereas in the past you may need a large university laboratory to develop these refactor genomes, nowadays you can have biohackers in their garages developing

these technologies. How do we how do we uh govern this? How do we protect ourselves from malicious actors? How do we protect ourselves from negligent actors in this sort of space? um

thinking about sort of the consolidation of of farming where that we have optimized sort of biotechnological outputs and those optimizations are owned by large corporations. What does

that mean for the millions of farmers here in India and abroad? And of course ultimately who decides whether or not we move on with this? Who decides whether or not we

pass on this technology? How do we decide how to implement these technologies? These are all questions for emerging technologies. My institute is thinking about these are things that

we both in Israel and in India have to think about the implementation of artificial intelligence in the biotechnological sector. A lot of very interesting questions very few good

answers. So thank you very much for the time. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you uh so much for bringing this uh concept of ATGC the four letters that play a very important

role in making up the DNA that makes up the whole biome. Thank you. Thank you for your perspective. Now I'll request u and before that we welcome you professor victor a research scientist from

institute of agriculture and bios system engineering to this particular session and we would love to have your thoughts in terms of how you see AI for agriculture specifically happening in

India and Israel. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much for inviting me and being here. I'm very happy and thank you for all for being here. Um I'm a researcher. I'm a scientist. I'm an

engineer in in the institute of ang engineering and bios systems engineering in Israel working in um um AI in agriculture and I'm I want to bring here a probably completely different aspect

than those that have heard the last u few hours that I've been in this summit. Um we do research in agriculture in order to uh uh solve the problem of uh food security. We need to provide food

to billions of people and this exponentially increases during the last years. And agriculture is the way that we have to feed all these people and um using the

conventional methods of agriculture uh usually they pollute the environment and they are not sustainable. The new technologies that they are now used in agriculture like precision

agriculture and digital agriculture which have been developed from the last years of the previous century 1990 1990s 2000 and so forth. They keep using uh both technological systems in order

to h produce a lot of data, a lot of measurements to understand what is happening and make the agricultural production more efficient. And this has been a struggle of a lot of years of how

to use all this information in order to make agriculture more efficient. The last 10 years AI has come in and uh suddenly all this data that is gathered and measured around the world in

different uh crops in different countries in different climates. They can all be combined together in order to get some knowledge or some incentives that were not so evident before. But are

we there? because we are there probably in some other disciplines. Uh like uh when you ask your uh Chad GPT or Gemini about things uh to have some knowledge and some incentives then they give you

in different in different topics and those are the topics that the AI models have been trained upon. Those topics are usually that all the data is available in digital form and the models can be

trained. But is this the case in agriculture? Probably not. Not yet at least. All this knowledge and all this data exists in agriculture. But we cannot really use it. We cannot make an

agricultural advisor who is a a a robust and generalized advisor all over the world. It's different in India, different in Israel, different in Europe, different in South

America. Now, but we can go and uh try to generalize this and build AI models, LLM models, large language models in order to do that. But AI in agriculture is

also in a much uh more basic uh place. Uh we use uh in well we develop in agriculture uh systems like um detection system for detecting weeds in the field in order to spray just the points where

the weeds are detected. We develop systems that they detect um diseases and pests in a very early stages in order to treat them locally. uh we we develop systems that uh they

can see how the plants are developing. Uh we can uh we develop systems that they link between uh the phenotype how the plants look and the genotype how the genes are. And here I refer to what you

are talking about uh the the genotypes uh AI are today tools that they improve and they enable the genetic selection not

genetic engineering but genetic selection of varieties that are more resilient to the climate change. more resilient to a to heat waves, more resilient to to salts in the soil and so

forth. So AI tools in agriculture come in many different levels from the level of uh being in the field and detecting and doing things to the level of uh having the knowledge and and address the

the whole management the management strategy. uh but uh this is a little bit far from today because the uh data that we have in agriculture uh is not shared as it is

in other disciplines in the world and also it's not in a standard format. Standardization is a very difficult and problem that has to be addressed in agriculture. But the AI they have the

possibility to uh solve these problems and uh get agriculture in a much uh better place. The adoption of AI in agriculture still has other barriers like the legal barrier, the financial

barrier has to be economical. Um and uh these are still challenges to be met. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you so much. And you rightly said that in terms of adoption

there are number of challenges and barriers that together we have to come forward. Uh with this we come to the end of the inaugural panel. I would request professor Rajivja for the final words

from on behalf of our Israel friends and from an Indian representation for his final remarks. So it's already well said actually Radhika and uh we are going to have a very active collaboration and to

work together in a team from Indian side and from Israel side and I'm sure that uh when we will work together and there were lot of other opportunities will come up also and then because he has

said very many diver diverse thing actually so we have to think about that also and which we are not thinking before and it's good to have a people with a different mindset coming and we

are going to work together and I'm sure that uh uh with the support of Israel governments and and with Indian government support and uh we are going to use AI for for the best of our

farmers. So and so we can make farmer most prosperous farmers in this India using AI. So this is our vision and and the farmer should be the main priority here. So thank you.

wonderful panel and the thoughtprovoking inputs that we have received from all the speakers. &gt;&gt; All right. Uh so with this we thank everyone for joining us. We'll move to

the next panel and uh for that I'll in request my colleague Dr. MKkesh to please be on the floor. Thank you Radika for mo moderating this uh panel wonderfully and uh to all these

speakers as well for joining us from Israel as well as from the India. We also really uh thanks to all the audience who were able to come here in the last panel of the day. While we have

another one more largely from the investment community side and when we talk about the agree techch industry it's very important to have the investment side as well and from the

corporate side I would like to request my panelist over here now where we'll be having discussion around bridging nations through the AI and also talking about scaling AI innovation for the

public good. I would like to call first uh panelist or the moderator for this miss Maya a good friend from the Israel embassy side. I also would like to call Miss Nimisa uh on the stage.

Uh to Miss Omi please if she could also join us and uh Mr. Murice a good friend from the Cund side. Siman, can you help them?

&gt;&gt; Uh, Siman will help you to put people name there. &gt;&gt; So, we'll be having a discussion around that. But before uh before this I also wanted to give some insight about IIT

Ruper in terms of the investment and the agric ecosystem that we are building. As of now we host almost 250 plus startups where we have made investment of somewhere around 17 cr plus in the last

two and a half year and very proud to say that this particular portfolio has raised almost 120 cr from the external community side from the VC side and uh we are also very proud to say that when

we look out to the Anam Aad and various ministries like startup India and all these all have been playing out a very powerful role in terms of enabling out the agree ecosystem. I will be handing

over this to Maya from here and uh I hope that we will have a very insightful conversation and the discussion around it. Thank you once again and my over to you.

&gt;&gt; So hello everyone long day but I think a lot of insights and quite exciting milestone for India with the summit and very grateful first of all to have uh representative from our government

presenting a bit about the work uh and generally very grateful for the work with Europa over uh last few months. It's been it's been very intense but I think a lot of very important

milestones. Um I'm also quite excited about the panelists we have today again dear colleagues and friends but I think also bringing fascinating expertise across the ecosystem in India from the

VCC space from the governance space big tech. So we'll be very glad to hear your insight as we go forward. Um as we embark I'll be glad perhaps a quick overview from your side a bit on how

your first of all how are you perceiving this big event and how it's relevant for you um but if you can share a bit on some of the challenges that you're seeing about crossber innovation today

and how do you think we should go forward and if AI is relevant at all in this regard &gt;&gt; is that with you my &gt;&gt; so um I robert team thanks for having me

I'm trying to I think when was the last time I was on a panel where we had as many women as we have in this panel. It's largely all male or a token women. So kudos to you. You could have very

well had a all women panel also but we'll run with what you have. Um I was observing what you have up here. The transcription is at about 85 90%. But the translation is almost 95 100%. So

kudos to what Bashini is doing right and we need more of uh such programs in India. Um let me give you some introduction of what I do. Um um I was the earlier lot that G hired in the

country to do data science all the way back in the early 90s which obviously became machine learning and which is now AI to all of us. Uh um we've been do making investments for almost 15 years.

Um um as a fund almost 8 years we've been deep tech is a focus uh area of focus for us. Uh when we spoke to our investors in 2018 that we want to do

deep tech, we were laughed out of the room and for us deep tech was semiconductor space uh defense uh similar or investors who have a uh an inclination

to invest when we go and say that we want to make areas in these uh investments in these areas they're not blinking. They're still not laughing away uh seeing money but they're they're

not blinking. What is the relevance of this um this event? I think u um on two parts. One um we clearly need this. I think this is the third big uh third or fourth event.

&gt;&gt; First and the biggest. &gt;&gt; Yeah. But fourth, right? There was one in um the UK, France. Correct. Correct. Um I think it is about time that uh an emerging economy like uh India um has to

start playing or having a seat at the table. I'll tell you why. Um I think some data came out a few weeks back u as to what which which countries are how well disposed towards AI the west

there's a whole lot of fear China there's a whole lot of optimism so is the case in the far east I think we are somewhere in the middle um this is a different beast for sure but you can't

be running away from a technology um it it has never worked historically and it won't work this way also so you have to have a positive predisposition and focus on what are the positives that it can

give. uh one small example I don't know how much how many of us had problems getting in but it's criminal in this in this day and age where there is such loss of uh all our times and

productivity right uh there are three things that are important for our economies to grow um there's uh capital there's labor and there's productivity uh till this current burst of

productivity that the US has had um productivity productivity has plateaued uh but if we have aspirations to be uh developed country in the next 25 30 years I AI has to play a crucial role.

what is working is obviously um all these elements and I'll pause there and I'll let the other panelist speak. &gt;&gt; Thank you for having me. Um I'm Umi. I work for a company called Salesforce. Um

so we are majorly into agents and this is something that we've invested in and we're looking at deploying agents for public good and public use cases in healthcare in finance and incredibly

sensitive areas as and when we look at it. So a big part of the responsibility that we have is deploying this responsibly at scale. So innovating but also having the right guard rails so

that this is something that builds trust. And Maya when you asked about some of the biggest challenges that we have when we look at deploying agents or AI is institutional trust is telling

people that can you trust this AI system is your data secure um are they able to use this for longer and I think that's one of the main conversations we have when we think about adoption because for

a company like ours um you know it's great to have a product but you need people to understand the value of it you need people to adopt it and use it make it relevant in their daily lives. So how

can they do that if they don't trust the system? So it's also not just you know educating people about the risks or the benefits or what is it that they can control what AI can do cannot do what

they should be mindful of but also looking at the ecosystem around it that supports um large scale and large scale adoption of technology for a sustained period. So those are some of the things

that we're working on when we're trying to solve for. So not just the technology but the human element of trust. Uh hello hi I'm Nemesisa and it's uh really an honor to be here uh thanks to

IT Roer and the embassy of Israel to um organize this very important discussion. uh you know when we talk about agriculture uh in India half of the population half of the

working population is actually engaged in agriculture and um uh only 1/5if of the GDP is being uh agriculture is only contributing to uh the GDP it's less than 15%.

uh 65% of the farmers have got smartphones and 80% of all fresh water which is used in India is used in agriculture uh while if you think about it at least uh 20% of all agriculture

produce is is damaged. So the case for AI in agriculture is so strong and when we say today we have so many startups doing so many things out of 200,000 startups in India only 1500 to 2,000 are

actually working in agit. So this this discussion is very important. Uh I have been part of this ecosystem uh since I think 2011. I am working for an organization called Hunch Ventures. It's

a family office. uh we have deployed more than hund00 million dollars across sectors, industries within India, outside India. uh one of the last investments uh that we made was in an

agit startup uh which is doing a farm-to-folk model while we are also looking at creating food parks uh across different uh states in India and I'm here today to talk like the work that I

do with the circle which is an organization uh doing crossber startup programs. uh I I sit at the intersection of ecosystems uh helping innovation find market or actually uh supporting them to

face market realities and in AI as much as we are talking today there are a lot of market realities that have to that has to be faced by the startups by those who are creating innovation because if

you think of something like agriculture which is the bread and butter of people uh so many people to get them to use it at scale there are many challenges but u if that happens

then the kind of u um output we will get that would be unprecedented so I think it's a very important discussion and it's great that we are having it today &gt;&gt; wonderful thank you three of you mukesh

I mean such wonderful maybe want to share a bit from your side how do you see the biggest challenges on crossber innovation &gt;&gt; so I I'll take very less time on that we

had wonderful insight from all the members as a opening remark but largely when you talk about the agree and we were having this conversation just before this the biggest challenge is on

the adoption we are talking about a community which works you know as a conventional mechanism and even if there's 1% chance of failure we are talking about going out the entire crop

cycle as a waste over there so it means that whatever technology you are building be it a startup be it a government tech or be it a technocrat that technology has to have you 100%

efficiency and has to be 100% accuracy. The moment you say 1% fails, we are talking about one particular crop cycle. And not only that, there's a very heavy reason that you know government is not

going behind the GM crop because the crop also have a huge impact on the humanity over there and this is where you have to be very precise both in terms of adoption and in terms of

building out that technology which is one of the biggest challenge that we find while working with the agree community there. &gt;&gt; Fantastic. Thank you for this. Um again

so many questions can come out of it but let us start with you I mean with the hunch and and the circle you've invested in so many programs and crossber programs worldwide

what are the next country that you feel will lead crossber innovation in the next decade. Uh sure Maya. Um I think um the the future of AI um is not uh will not happen via some specific countries

but it will be uh through clusters. So uh from where I see there are three kinds of clusters. One is the uh the government governance centers those who are defining the rules uh which includes

the US for uh say uh models compute the kind of um um um investments that are happening over there and the EU from the regulation standpoint while the other cluster could be uh those countries

where the use cases are being defined because of the scalable deployments such as China, India, Brazil and they say that if you know something uh succeeds in India in agriculture, it can succeed

anywhere. And I think the third cluster is the high precision um uh high techch u agriculture um um innovation which is happening uh by u through um [snorts] uh research and um um um technology being

developed in say Israel in um um Netherlands in Australia. So I think these clusters are very important and the future would be uh the corridors such as the India Israel corridor uh the

India Ashan corridor which will prove very very critical uh for defining how things grow and scale. &gt;&gt; Fantastic. I think you know it brings such an interesting input here that

while many countries are trying to to fight against each other and kind of create this AI supremacy in the end we are seeing clusters being formed um across different technology I think

especially AI is a great example for this uh with the pilica Israel and India are part of this but it's true I think that's exactly what's perhaps setting the next decade of future technologies

going forward would it be full multilateralism or perhaps still the arms I think it's still a question but one insights. Um, Mr. Smash, of course, CIFA has been such an early believer in

deep tech. I'll be glad to hear a bit more on your broader vision for uh deep tech investing. How do you see instruments like again research development innovation fund shaping the

next decade of technologies? &gt;&gt; I think um we've come to a very critical point um at least with uh what's happening in India. Um there'll be a fair amount of us uh who've probably

studied in the US have been beneficiaries of programs like DARPA, NSF. Um and for the longest time we were talking with our policy makers. We need to have something similar to that. Um

it's taken a long time coming but u um we finally have a program this we still our GDP is probably $2,000 or there sorry our per capita income is thereabouts. But for a country at our uh

sca scale of development, we have a 12 and a half billion dollar uh program that brings together what DARPA does, what NS NSF does and what uh the Euroar does Europe. Um I think that is going to

be absolutely crucial because all basic research research and elements of transport research it has to be and has been historically governed. um no no investor like us uh forget in investors

even angel investors will not participate where uh the startup is at a lap stage and it can't even move to a product. So that is going to be absolutely crucial. The first and second

order effects of this are there is going to be enormous amount of money is going to be relatively for our size a flood of money in the ecosystem. Now a lot of this like with most government programs

may be wasted but uh we've seen historically that uh there have been uh platforms there have been startups uh that have been built out um the Indian uh digital public goods is a great

example um and there is absolute hope that uh the AI mission the quantum mission uh the DI scheme which we have for semiconductors uh defense that is absolutely going to work out well. What

the government did did smartly was uh a few uh years back they figured out where are the top three four areas where the country has the most forest outflow and shouldn't be a surprise u oil

commodities was the first one the second one was defense the third one was u uh electronic manufacturing and they passed each one of this had schemes for them so for the longest time um investors

wouldn't touch anything that was manufacturing related but things have changed so dramatically like you have the 800 lb gorilla in the VC ecosystem which is Axel talking about uh or

putting out a thesis about smart manufacturers right so uh whoever are the manufacturing or the real world physical intelligence kind of founders I think these are great days it's not

going to change uh dramatically but it's definitely better than not having any money commoditized manufacturing there's nothing there but if you're doing something along these lines there

there's absolutely money coming to agriculture um the problems are well known right I mean small land parcels data uh uh is strewn all across so much so that u uh defense is an area most

investors will not touch but we are looking at a startup where the the sucker we are getting is oh okay it's dual use uh there is assured in uh income from defense and okay there's an

agriculture use case so maybe we can live with that so that's where agriculture falls on the hierarchy of investments the first set of agri startups have been these platforms the

form far uh farm to fork kind of place but going and addressing the problems that a farmer faces throwing uh earth observation throwing satellite imagery throwing data uh and the ability to

serve these products at the minimal price points that we have that is still a problem that is still to has to be corrected in India &gt;&gt; wonderful insight I think that it's true

that in many ways uh you know this kind of hierarchy of investments uh put agriculture aside In many ways I also feel that again this shift into dual use technologies as has enabled in perhaps a

new avenue for agrich startups as a whole. You know even I guess from the Israeli perspective we know we have dozens of center of excellency in the country. They always worked on

agriculture. Now we're trying to shift a bit more into agreech in them. So hopefully this is something we'll be able perhaps to I guess give a different lens or a different avenue for agoot

startups to get the right investments especially as again economy wise it's clearly needed and relevant now a bit to you um again I you have different hats of course the wonderful work in

Salesforce but again also I know the wonderful AI fellowship from Rina where you did such great work around climate AI and I I wanted to hear a bit more from you on how how you see India

positioning itself as a responsible AI leader especially in anguac and public uh goods cases that's a great question um I think India has a few problems that it's identified

very clearly or that it wants to solve for what their priorities are in this space one is scale the other is innovation but inclusive innovation and it's also striking a balance between

regulation and innovation so some of the ways in which India has been doing this is through as we mentioned um creating highquality data sets uh AI kosh is the program I think and what they're trying

to do is create um these data sets which will feed into more precise interventions from AI systems um and will really help solutions especially in critical sectors like healthcare and

agriculture. So and apart from that leveraging DPI uh has also been a priority for India. Um and it's one of those uh and you know it's one of India's best exports to the world uh in

terms of having this public basic infrastructure that others can use and build on and to use that in agriculture to use that in in public health or uh public good cases is one of India's

biggest strengths. Um and we've seen this as becoming very fertile ground for uh companies and private and private sector and governments and and civil society to really come together and

build something together. So it's really providing that foundational architecture or foundational um field for companies and other stakeholders to come and collaborate and to build on these

principles to build on accountability, transparency um and create a solution together. So I think it's it's that field that India is offering that it's it's it wants to be

innovative but it also wants to have those guardrails. It doesn't want to fence itself away from the private sector. And uh we've also been able to develop a pilot for example with the

government of Andhra Pradesh which is looking at regenerative agriculture again because of um the kind of focus that India has that it wants to be collaborative and I think that's

something that the world can really learn from. Fantastic. I think that you know in the end you know seeing the level of government investment and relevance in

this sector it's not it's not something that you're seeing all over the world. I think that India is definitely pioneering this discussion and narrative. So thank you for this. Um

neisa back to you. Um again I think that crossber innovation has become kind of your your your second name in a way but and again there are some upcoming delegations coming in to to Korea and

Taiwan and a lot of very exciting milestones ahead for Hunch Venture. Um I will be glad to hear from you if you know if you were to pitch in a way what do you think makes India as again a

perfect destination for global agree startups today for any other countries again Israel is one but h how would you say that India is currently positioned? Sure. Thank you Maya. I think uh we are

in very exciting times. Uh India can be the perfect test bed for all sorts of AI solutions particularly uh in agriculture and agreech I think uh there is lots of opportunity the kind of data that can be

made available right now it I don't think it is there but it can be made available. the kind of um um uh you know use cases we can have things that you know uh you know so many farmers

multiple kind of crops u climate issues uh inefficient supply chains all sorts of use cases are there so I think that is that is one place where a lot of testing can be done second is I think

Mayuresh already mentioned about uh the digital public infrastructure and I think all the panelists have mentioned uh which India has created and uh the AI innovation is evolving as the

infrastructure is evolving. So I think that's a great place to be because uh you know when both are growing together there is whole opportunity of again testing and coming to real solutions

which can be scaled fast and the final thing it's a very pilot ready market. corporates are interested. The government is ready to provide sandboxes. The startups want to work

within India, outside India, whether it is you know um um Bihar or Uttar Pradesh or Vietnam, Southeast Asia, the the founders are very hungry to go and test and deploy and get new market

opportunities. So I think it's a great time and if uh you know if you look at it um u in an overall ecosystem manner also I think uh India is not just a market to enter right now it's uh it's a

market from where you can build and scale to the world I'm convinced what wonderful words say say and I think that um you know if if you look for a moment at the size of the impact summit and you

know the level of scholars coming from all over the world to India I think it's it shows the level of regor and scale the data ecosystem is bringing today. Um my rash back to you. Um clearly again a

a lot of work and great work done by C fund. You're managing over 250 uh million kores over sectors but I'll be glad to hear a bit more for you. How do you differentiate AI and agree from

other frontier deep technologies especially as you were mentioning the difficulties in investment. So I'd be glad to hear from you how you're perceiving it and what would be the

right way to to reach it from your angle. &gt;&gt; See, we can't play the US game. We just don't have the domestic capital um to throw at problems, right? Um we don't

have the billions of dollars to go out and uh buy compute and do LLMs. Neither can we play the Chinese game where they've finally passed out manufacturing uh with AI. Um we've got to find our own

way. um we have to solve our India specific problems. We are a voice first nation and uh we have many languages. So u anything that is being done by somebody sitting in the US um I don't

think Indian founders should be um even trying to solve it in the same by the same playbook. I'll give you an example. uh the old SAS playbook hitting a 1 million in ARR within 2 3 years was a

monumental achieve a achievement that has gone out of the uh out of the window. You hear crazy stories and these are on the consumer side. Uh startups hitting um $100 million in 6 months. The

best I've seen in India is somebody doing half a million uh RR in 45 days. That doesn't compound to uh even 10 million in 5 years. Um so how do you play that game? Um as a fund we are

betting a lot on uh physical intelligence in the real world. Things will change dramatically here too but not to the extent that we are seeing on the software side of things. There's

still things to be played out in the next 5 to 10 5 to 10 years. And I think agriculture if we solve all the problems that India has um I think that falls in the sweet spot of that. You can't run a

startup having uh Silicon Valley uh uh salary level cost cost levels with Indian paying power. If you can crack that puzzle uh if you can start making products especially on the agra side for

bat as we call it beyond the metro tier one cities I think there's a huge uh and the market is huge uh and you won't find this market anywhere else. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Thank you for this. Um Omi

last question for you. um you know you mentioned the the again the very interesting initiative in part with the government of Andra Pradesh. I'll be glad generally to hear from you how do

you see again big tech companies such as Salesforce enabling this work with governments to be able to move um again AI pilots into national level impacted programs because the question is also

about the scale. That's the million-dollar question that we're all trying to solve for. Um but I think two things that have uh that we're trying to focus on I think other uh companies who

are working with governments at the pilot stage are trying to focus on um is co-creation. So sort of uh from the idea ideational stage itself to deployment involving stakeholders at every step. So

that is for us it could be the government of Andhra Pradesh but it also involves other stakeholders like farmers groups um uh or SGS or NGOs that are working in this space. So if we are able

to conceptualize the idea with all with with as many pitfalls as many difficulties from the inception stage it sort of uh becomes embedded by design in the solution rather than something that

surprises us towards the end. It's easier said than done, but this is the approach that works and um is something that we're striving to achieve. The other is also taking the ecosystem along

with you. So having an ecosystem approach, what I mean by that is um focusing on scaling and capacity building so that people are able to understand the benefits of the

technology that they are going to use and deploy. That is the only way that you see sustained adoption. um that is the only way that you see um an ecosystem growing with you when you're

trying to encourage a solution. So it's sort of taking everyone with you when you're developing and also taking everyone's ideas with you co-creating these are two of the pathways that I

think a lot of us are exploring. &gt;&gt; Fantastic. Thank you. I I I absolutely agree. I mean cocreation is key and I think you know the wonderful work that Tus has done I think definitely is is

making this kind of change I feel in the ecosystem now as we are nearing to an end I'd be glad for 30 seconds for you you know we've had great insights on the ecosystem how VCs are enabling the

ecosystem how we're able to push the government investment VCs in the end farmers are the are the core um how do you see the future and more interestingly how do we make sure that

farmers are not left behind when we're pushing these innovations. But again, crisp 30 secondond interventions. Mesh to this one. I also be glad to hear from &gt;&gt; I think um rightly said by all the

members, we are at an inflection point where we have to talk about farmers. We have to talk about the yield. We have to talk about the you know funds that can be deployed by the government and also

so that the community could grow together for the betterment of the impact and betterment of the society. Um I'll just I'll just say one line. I think uh farmers as as the the the

community is today across the country. They trust they need trust and they need to trust the technology. They need to trust the people who are creating the technology and for that they need two

things. one it is introduced to them by people they already know intermediaries and B they are educated and when they are educated the support is also given to them post once they have got a

solution and they are facing challenges that they don't know how to solve so if those things are done I think uh it will be a great uh boost &gt;&gt; I think we've you know spoken about

co-creation and capacity building but one element that I would introduce is also working on the explanability aspect of the models um so the farmer or whoever the stakeholder is should know

where AI has come into the decision making and where and what is the process that has led to that decision. It is an ongoing endeavor with most companies trying to figure out the mechanisms to

do this but that should always be the endeavor. &gt;&gt; I think I'll echo what your ambassador said. Everybody has the the tech in their pocket. The pipe has been laid.

India has the lowest cost per uh GB in the world. Um it's incumbent on all of us to make sure the intelligence is provided to the farmer at the price point he can afford.

&gt;&gt; Fantastic. Big rounds of applause for our wonderful panelist. Thank you so much. No, it's been a long day. I don't know if you have time for questions. Do we have I think we we don't have. So you

still try to catch us afterwards. Thank you so much for the panelists and I roar again. Wonderful to have been working on it. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you Maya for

wonderfully moderating the session. Uh before we conclude with this session, we have a special gratitude to our speaker and we want to express this with our felicitation from our side. Uh Maya, I

would like you to please step forward for felicitating our chief patron professor Ajiv Vuja for steering the session. Please sir. [laughter]

[applause] Thank you. Now I request professor Rajiv Huja and Maya to we please in front to felicitate professor Gal for wonderful insights from your side.

We can come up. A a special gratitude to Professor Dove. [applause] A huge round of applause. &gt;&gt; [laughter]

&gt;&gt; Now we want to felicitate the wonderful panel. uh Maya yourself has moderated it from technology to investments. So I'll request professor Huja to felicitate Maya for wonderful moderating the

session miss Please, &gt;&gt; Miss Unmi And not the least, man of the panel, Mahir.

&gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; So with this we conclude our panel and I request every one of you to please jump in here for a group photograph. Especially I requesting I roer team and

our friends from Israel to be here so we have a group photograph together. I request our speakers to please take a seat and we stand around them to be fit in one single frame.

I'll request everyone to be please here so we'll fit in in a group photograph. I'll request everyone to be there with us. Okay.

Some of them please. I guess what? We'll take couple of seconds. We have

Professor Victor with us. U So, professor, I'll request you. &gt;&gt; There he is. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you so much. We had photograph
