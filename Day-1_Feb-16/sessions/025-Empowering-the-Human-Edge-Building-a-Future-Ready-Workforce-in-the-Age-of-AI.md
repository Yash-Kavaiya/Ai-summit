## 📝 Transcript

you know, how will they upskill, how will they grow in this in this world? And so, it's really important to put the right upskilling frameworks around them to make sure that they have the right

tooling, the right mentoring around them as they're using these tools in the right way. Um, and and and just in general, right, like I I mentioned this term that AI is infrastructure. It's a

tool that that you mentioned as well. It it is going to be used as a tool in in your daily workflows, right? So when we are interviewing for example we actually see in in some of the interviews how

you're using AI to to do critical thinking right to ups to uplevel your system design to uplevel your critical thinking how do you actually use it to uh to further those skills versus

replace those skills right and what we're also seeing is actually you know the AI is not a skill that's useful on its own the domain skill and AI together is what's really really helpful right so

being being a computer scientist and also learning about AI is useful. Being a a major in finance and learning AI is is useful. So yeah, and then I'll hand it over to Matthew. Yeah,

&gt;&gt; thank you Mustafa and thank you for the question. Um, so these questions uh uh struck me because it really describes very well what is a paradox. paradox of the uh the contemporary society where we

give you something to learn in a certain way but we take that away when you have to implement the result or the solution. So we teach you by using AI but then we assess you without using AI. So we give

you a book but then we take it away when you have to explain what you have started on. We give you a pen but then we ask you to write without a pen. We give you a piece of paper but then we

take it away. So the ethical question behind that is how do you address this paradox by enabling you to use purposely with uh questions behind the tools that we're giving you. So I feel that there

is an opportunity to understand also from the student perspective to what extent AI is helping them to train how they question processes and also how they can use it in an exam for example

but by declaring by stating by judging by assessing how they use it and what they use it for. So I'll give you a very brief uh example, a story. One of my Corsera alumni from October reached out

to me on LinkedIn and said, "Mate, that course was opening my eyes onto what I can do next. This person is is a is a guy that is around 35 years old and he is a six form school teacher in the UK."

And he asked me to have a little call with me. I said, "Fine, send me an email." We an email. We had 15 minutes call. and he asked me, I now understand what I can do, but I don't know what to

do. So, you understand what you can do, but you don't know what to do. Okay, let's have a chat. So, you are a school teacher and you want to bring AI to

school in the UK. What can you do? Well, I would like to do this, this, and that, but we don't have resources. And then I said, what would you how would you feel empowered to do something to change the

way people use AI into your school? And he spent a couple of minutes there and he as answered me with well we can use Google, we can use Microsoft, we can use this and that. I said okay but what is

really that you can change as an agent for change in your school? And then he said to me well we can actually open a panel for discussion around AI at my school among teachers and among kids you

know. Oh cool and what you can do next? Well actually I can be the starter. I can be the the president or you know the person that starts this panel and bring those educators together to talk about

how do we bring AI to kids here and so the answer was actually in his brain already but the moment we started to brainstorm together because he had a chance to follow this course was opening

his eyes say actually you know what I don't need someone else to start that I can start it and he can be the agent of change so Coming back to your question, we are teaching how to use ethically AI

from the foundations, but just to make sure that people can have this philosophy of curiosity and this way of questioning what they do and how they do it by themselves. And if they have a

chat with me, great. But they can have a chat with billions of people around the world that can have the same mindset. &gt;&gt; Okay, we have time for two quick questions. Uh

there's a gentleman at the back over there. very quickly introduce yourself and &gt;&gt; good morning. Thank you very much. My name is AJ. I lead digital health and

data science for an NGO that's working to incorporate AI into how faculty for medical and nursing education actually use it to teach their students. Um but that's where some of the paradoxes arise

for us, right? One of the questions that we got from a teacher that we're we're trying to work with now uh is to say that well the expectation is now for me to do more right you'll you'll make my

life more frantic um more larger in scope uh and I'm not sure I want to go there [snorts] right uh I'm happy teaching my students the way that I'm teaching now while at that point of time

we kind of discounted that question to saying that that is one but we just read a commentary entry by professor Ranganathan at HBR as well which is exactly the same thing as to how AI is

making lives of people more frantic uh and how it's really expanding the scope and dimensions of work that they're doing. I'm an AI evangelist. I want to use AI for almost everything that we do.

Uh but have you noticed some of this in your dealings and how do you really um counter that narrative? &gt;&gt; Sanjay, you talked about AI reducing the workload. I think maybe you should

[laughter] take this one. &gt;&gt; Now I have we heard that before the answer is yes. Um but the context of that is is also unwillingness to change.

Uh we have seen a lot of times people and and this has happened to us. I'm not saying anybody we don't want to learn new things. Change is not something that comes naturally to us as humans. So it

is about because I've been doing something a specific way, I want to continue doing it a specific way. Why should I after years of my knowledge that I have as a professor and why do I

want to change? You you tell a 25 year old kid that he or she would be very un very willing but a 45 50 year old professor maybe a little more close to that change process. So it's

it's actually because of that u I've seen the other way around. I've met a professor at IIT Therupati. They are today using notebook LM to teach kids how to do research

in the first class of research. Right? So that's I think what I would rather want these professors and teachers to start thinking that it would take time away from a lot of mundane things that

you do and give you time back to spend with students. And let's be honest, it's not easy. And that's why people don't like to do the difficult things. So I think it's a combination of willingness

to learn something new and doing the difficult thing, which is spending time answering those difficult questions that kids have. And let's be honest, kids have very difficult questions today. So

yeah, that's that's the way that's what we have heard and been able to manage that discussion. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Okay. Thank you. I think uh I think we we're supposed to clean out uh the room

now. Uh thank you for everybody who showed up on a Monday morning. Thank you for our panelists who came from all over the world uh to share their views here. Uh we all need to do a lot of change

management at our organizations. Uh please enjoy the rest of the summit. Thank you. [applause] &gt;&gt; We will now be handing over momentos to our esteemed speakers.

Yeah, exactly. I have a picture of all of you in this picture. What does it have? &gt;&gt; It has a picture that we took initi.

[laughter] &gt;&gt; Many thanks to the Corsera team for a fantastic session. Ladies and gentlemen, please remain seated for our next session in the same room.

The speaker lounge is at MR13 and you may check the agenda for any other sessions that you might be interested in. You can also use our mobile app to figure out your next port

of call. Thank you so much for joining us. is only sour.

Thank you. Thank you. You are making share me. Thank you madam. And uh thanks for everyone in the audience for being here

u defying all the daily traffic early in the morning. But um to uh set it right at an outside at an outset uh right the bold move that we are making in Telangana is to unify all AI innovation

happening across the state under a unified uh entity called ICOM. So if you look look at what's happening in the world of AI the technology is like a runaway train it's in fact a runaway

train right u for and two it has become a sovereign matter right it's international security matter so in that context uh you cannot have fragmented splintered initiatives happening where

for you to get uh that uh massive momentum and impact that you want to deliver. So in Telangana we have unified all existing AI initiatives and innovation initiatives under a new

autonomous body called ICU that we launched at Dows uh last month and that is going to drive integrated innovation across skilling to startup acceleration to startup financing to co-creation and

co-inovation with industry to uh co- research with leading institutions across the world and the idea is to make Telangana a top 20 AI innovation hub and an open innovation ecosystem in

collaboration with the rest of the world as an investor you deal with startups in India right and you have also worked with how do you see the AI disruption

&gt;&gt; are we are we waiting for what's coming ahead I think we are always ready again. We are never ready because change is constant. So I think it's just about you

know being prepared. But your question uh has two parts to it. One is uh when organizations are at scale uh what do you need to do to be ready and uh when entrepreneurs want to create now what do

they need to do differently right so you know and as a user India is making uh lot of progress and leaps. This is number two in terms of number of users

from uh uh open AI tag GPT and so on so forth. So from AI usability and AI learning uh we are making a lot of progress and that's of course you can put that stat against a population scale

but at least uh awareness is growing but that's different from how do you build AI native organizations which I think is always uh difficult from incumbent transformation.

If I just take anecdotal example uh in a small firm like most venture firms we are early stage venture capital relatively are 20 30 people so fairly small scale organization but what used

to take 10 analysts from research tracking today probably take two analysts and maybe there is a future where it requires no analysts I don't know that but today at least we still

to analysts, right? So the question is from my employability perhaps those analysts and most of the time they are far ahead of somebody like me in leading the organization into what should we be

doing and so on so forth. So that's where the employability and the skills. So the fast changing landscape of tools that are emerging that deliver operational efficiency at organizational

level you know is changing but as an entrepreneur I think there are two things one is can you conceive a uh AI native first of all so can you do solve

whatever problem you're solving faster quicker cheaper uh although if you look for the venture capital that's going in that doesn't feel like that sometimes right because the investments are not

going down the investments are going up into AI uh founders but the second thing is what kind what do founders need to do today differently the tools make it so much easier today

from developing a product so that's not an edge that used to be an edge maybe before but today there are you you could uh do a MVP in a week if you're using uh tools to

take your idea and to create some kind of a viable product. So the viable product is no longer about building feature but the value proposition that has compressed from time is can you show

how you're actually creating cost efficiency or you know where is it that you're doing the organizational transformation right and maybe we'll pause there and we can talk more about

that &gt;&gt; let me ask you one spoke about startups and I needed You're part of data group the biggest conglomerate in India dealing with so

many businesses you have a digital mandate there what is AI you know what is such a large organization you transform what are your what is keeping you off what what challenges do you

foresee the right what said nowhere close to being a small organiz ation but the aspiration is same. We do believe that AI is a

transformative force which is going to be impacting all our businesses and therefore what does it mean in terms of um scaling and rescaling people uh at this scale. Uh the way we are looking at

that is how can we have specialized programs for senior leadership so that you understand the art of possible you know where disruption is going to be coming from. Uh we believe that critical

for our success will be building a carder of mid-level business managers. We call them AI champions. We often use the term reimagination to but we don't really tell people how

to imagine and what does it look like to be reimagining. So for us middle management level of business is critical from a reimagination perspective. The third one is the technical talent. How

can you keep them updated always? And in a large organization where the change is the only constant and I think today for us the biggest challenge is the tech is changing so rapidly. So by the time you

finish one round of skilling with your for the tech has already moved. So how do you always keep ahead and make sure that you're playing the catchup game right? That's the biggest challenge to

With that let me pass it on to you. Now Aana spoke about the challenge that people face. &gt;&gt; Now you are you belong to an organization which is one of the

disruptors here. Uh you also run a lot of scaling initiatives as part of Google. &gt;&gt; How do you work in terms of helping them come off the curve? Because technology

is as good as the organization adopting it and can people actually get these skills. It's it's going to be hard to see. WhatsApp

spoke about how AI adoption in India is going through the roof. I think Google is overflowing. It kind of shows the energy and doctoral that India has for uh the goodness that AI can bring to

India. Uh so at Google we are deeply committed uh to accelerate this space of AI learning and skilling in India. Uh the idea is to leverage this optimism, work with the ecosystem, the partners uh

like people on uh on this panel and beyond uh and really convert this energy, this optimism in a purely AI ready workforce which is not only solving the problems of today but also

planning for future. the some of the learnings that we have had so far. Uh first and foremost, if we want to make a meaningful difference uh for a country of our size, you know, if you want to

make a meaningful difference for a scale and size uh of India, the first and the foremost uh thing for all of us to collectively solve for is to reduce the entry barrier. Because if we are

thinking about solutions for say people in this room, people like us, students in Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai, then we are just uh addressing the tip of the iceberg. It has to talk to students,

entrepreneurs, right? From say Gualia uh to uh you know another end of the country, right? Uh so reducing the entry barrier will be uh the first one that I will talk about. The second thing that

we have learned is that just making learning um about understanding a concept is not good enough. A spoke about the pace and how difficult it is for anybody to or us to uh uh you know

play the catch up game. So just understanding a concept is not good good enough. Uh the learning has to talk to real world solution, real world application. So bridging that gap

becomes extremely important in concept as well as what we are solving. This is something that we have learned from our startup here ecosystem. We have Google startup uh school. Uh Aani and I have

done sessions there. Uh and you know we've learned that uh since inception we have uh there have been more than 30,000 participants. Almost 50% comes from tier three cities. So covering almost 700

cities. And when we talk about our accelerated program which is for say a growth stage uh startup again we have seen these companies uh you know leveraging the technology and the

survival rate is more than 96%. So when these startups survive and thrive using the technology solving for real good problems innovation and employment creation go hand in hand and that's very

critical for a country like us. Uh so again you know the alumini of our accelerators have already created about 20 26,000 jobs in India. So far the third way that we have and many other

organizations in partnership with the ecosystem are addressing is really how do you make it a multiplier uh effect. So when it comes to AI skilling, how are we focusing on the trainer? So there's a

Gemini Academy. I don't know if people in the audience have heard about it. If not, please do uh look at it. Deeply focuses on trainers. We have trained more than a million educators, trainers,

professors who are further going and ensuring a multiplier effect. And then I would say that you know deep partnerships and I have Aperna from Dava sitting next to me. We have partnered in

the past uh on an initiative called internet safi which was about digital education and you know deep partnerships to acquire reach scale is absolutely critical. We also do a lot of work

through uh google.org ORG which is our philanthropic arm uh which is through funding through um uh uh you know technology by providing people and um many many you know education related

initiatives are being uh sponsored and uh you know pushed uh through these uh initiatives. Thank you uh professor let me bring it to you like this was very large

organization hyperscaler view now you are working in many countries in Africa 50% 50 such countries each with different context languages also referred to you know people who

have access in large cities versus people who do not like we are dealing with a different animal in in in Africa and some parts of India and and rest of the global south. So how do you see

scaling initiative being done at scale is the you know the kind of initiative which are we talking about which is very global westled uh or global northled are those enough

what do we need for Africa and India &gt;&gt; thank you very much um before I start let me thank JC for &gt;&gt; and also for inviting me to the panel as well it's glad to be here and uh good to

see the enthusias on AI. Now before I continue, I allow me to ask the public three questions. One is obvious, others may not be obvious on that. I'll continue with my presentation.

Um, if you know Africa, please raise your hand. Okay, everybody. I said that's obvious. Everybody knows where Africa is. Um, do you know if you know East African

community? Raise your hand. So see very few people know this a bit harder question the hardest if you know the inter university council for east

Africa raise your hand okay only one person two people so um I'm the acting executive secretary of Africa our work is based on this African community

african community is a regional economic block our community in East Africa which is basically composed of eight countries. Uh this is Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda,

South Somalia. Their main objective is to integrate is a country political federation. Now in the university council for East Africa is the

institution of East African Community in charge of higher education. It main objective establishment is to use higher education as a platform towards regional integration through harmonizing

education systems that are very diverse among these five states and we do that through policy advocacy, academic mobility, capacity building, convening and networking and through projects and

programs. Our main major strength is convening policy makers and academic leaders as well as students. We are interamental organization. At the same time, we are a member based institution.

All higher education institutions in the East African community are a leading member of South African partner states on all matters related to higher education and we look at the

trend in higher education which at the moment is AI. In June 2023, we held our first annual conference on the theme um the age of higher education. Higher education in the age of AI and data

science. This is June 2022. Remember AI became so prominent by the launch of TPP. When was it? &gt;&gt; November 2022. So just about six, seven months. We boo saying we are probably

the first international region organization to hel to host a conference on AI in high education through that policy makers and university leaders reflected on the impact of high

education or of AI and data science in high education with that we realized uh we have a lot of challenges and I think that mention here one is the skill gap lack of expertise

in teaching but also Alo lack of awareness for teachers of AI at that time students who were really widespread using AI too but teachers were not aware of it didn't know how as well as lack of

infrastructure and so on and so where we are placed uh we came up with a number of interventions into particularly building workforce ready future ready skills on AI with this there's a number

of intervention that we helped and I think we before I continue explaining what we doing all this has been largely due to the partnership with different partners around the world who've been

supporting us to do it. One is we are training teachers on the use of AI in teaching and learning in partnership with UNESCO and we train all our teachers. The idea is to train all our

teachers at the member university to discuss cohort one, cohort two coming with basic phase one conventional skills for teaching and learning but also phase two is a bit more advanced like

developing chatb. Other one is establishing a federated center of excellence on AI particularly building a network of universities. One note for each of these partners there's

a certain community that the network whereby they collaborate cocreating curricula and building research collaborations among themselves as well as yielding to uh innovation ecosystem

through partnering industry and as well as the private sector as well as the public those are just two of the activities there are more but I think you come back

to me I'll explain now these are homegrown initiatives. Some of them I've come up with other activities that we doing where we have the western man initiative they are all useful they both

use but I think the most important thing is to cocreate some of these initiative with the local not only adopting or adapt and this is what we do with our experts

in the radio I'll come back to you on this uh professor right spoke about the local initiatives you know what is localization how are you as Google that

organization which is driving scaling initiatives across the world uh building this local context &gt;&gt; that's a very important question uh right u uh as my fellow fellow panelist

just mentioned that it's been almost 3 years that we have in fact a has been around for longer but I guess generative AI and the acceleration happened in the last thousand days plus three years

and we reached a stage that if we have to solve for India and I've mentioned the scale and the size isolated projects will not help. So for me um or for Google uh as I represent Google uh the

first and the most important thing is aligning to a common vision of the country right so when the government through India AI mission how many of you have heard about India AI mission so

yeah almost everyone right and we are here for the India AI impact summit so it's really coming together of the vision for the country and when the government pays as a catalyst then the

academia the industry can really come together together to bridge the gap. So for me the most important thing is aligning to a common vision which is happening as uh as we speak. Uh I'll

speak about Google initiatives uh like if I I I spoke about Google we work closely with follow the framework that has been shared through the India AI mission and

that's why the impact is much uh larger. we are able to work with people who or partner with uh you know organizations who are thinking alike and we can join hands to solve um AI is is one such

initiative that we you know they really focused on a very simple thing which is about making uh people across uh India get more comfortable in speaking in English. If you think about it, it is an

important aspect of being job ready uh and uh you know it's an important skill uh uh for a market like uh like India right uh so that's one the second thing that I feel is very very important is to

solve in India for India understanding the local context and again here uh I'm inspired by the government's uh mission there there are these coes that have been created center of excellence for

center of excellence we partner closely across uh the center specifically the education one in partnership with IIT Madras what it does is that it gives industry uh opportunity to invest in

local research. So unless and until we have the local context and we have local researchers solving for the local context you cannot solve for a country of our size uh size and scale. So that

becomes extremely important. Then the third thing which I also spoke about scaling and I think works uh across pillars uh pillars of human capital is again bridging the gap between

understanding concepts understanding AI uh um in theory and bridging the gap to really making it uh you know application oriented solving and again industry has a big role to play to bring

up front what are the challenges that need to be solved and then work backwards uh you know um through research through innovation towards it. Um very very important that while we are

innovating in India we are solving for employment in India and everything is going uh hand in hand. So those are some of the things. Yeah. &gt;&gt; J I'll come to you. Uh you have been you

know your initiative largely focusing on the bridging the gap between say research and commercialization right through the innovation hub you run.

Are you seeing enough like how how do you see startups coming off the curve in terms of localizing and uh building for the market as so? Yeah, it's a tough question, but

nevertheless, I'll give you my perspective. Firstly, it's fantastic to see so many people, right? I did not expect the ideas that as it is today. So, hats off

to all of you. That's to do with the stellarness of the audience here. Um, and that's a right. Um if I were to take a view and break it down on in the so-called value chain of skilling v AI I

think three things stand out and this is purely my personal view I'll try to marry it to this program that we run which is called praise in Japan very successful

the first part of the value chain is you know there's a lot of talk about um jobs being displaced if you really double click on that and see you know take a first principles you I don't think There

is any job today that involves one task, right? Every single job that all of us have hopefully has a multitude of tasks. So when jobs get replaced and it will, it's not that your occupation goes away.

It's the tasks that you go away. So for me, the first part of figuring out how you can play ball with AI is to figure out what is the one task that you are good at. I'll give an example. Humans

are exceptionally good at taking decisions at a point of indecisiveness. Leaders, CEOs, entrepreneurs are exceptionally good at taking decisions when there lies a platitude of

indecisiveness in front of them. And number two, they can be held accountable. If hits the roof, &gt;&gt; the lead is accountable. And I think

that's what humans are. So there are components in the value chain where the tasks that humans embrace and do well. You have to now play ball with AI and think of how AI as an in an agentic mode

or a co-pilot mode or through aggressive learning becomes part of your playbook. I think that's part of the answer and that's how I think brain is also evolved. Um the second part of the

valley gym is you know alluded to it. Unfortunately, we live in a world where the arbitrage of labor in capital markets is going down and the value of capital is going

up. Which means that if if you are in a country or an ecosystem with insane amounts of talent, it may not actually matter as much as it did. What matters is capital. Um I think mention I think

what India offers specifically is two beautiful things. One is diversity of data right so if you look at diversity of data and do a mathematician model you get this bell curve where the

area of the bell curve is beautifully spread out I don't think any other country offers that the second part that India offers I think is the fact that we've led the way

um by postulating public goods right that's as a piece of infrastructure I think India can lead the way not with building another Actually, I'd be happy if it does, but

uh I think we're better off building public goods as an infrastructure and I think it's probably a leading candidate for that. And I'll end on a negative note, not that I want it, but uh what

this leads to, right? Scaling and scaling of AI is going to be bit of a uniform world where distribution of wealth is going to be concentrated,

right? It's going to be in the hands of a few tech companies. be in the hands of a few countries. I think that's what you got to watch out for as a populace.

&gt;&gt; You let the scaly death in your left end with and let me go to funny for this like we are dealing with a much large population here. uh you know we've all

spoken about India's demographic advantage and that advantage only works if we can move talent in line with where the technology is headed the gap between halves and have which J was also

referring to it's going to be crucial now you have one large scale initiative in but you're also leading innovation hub how do you connect the dots like how do

we bridge this gap and make sure that whatever we are doing is actually inclusive I think great insights from the rest of my panelists and I've been keenly living

in uh it's uh we talked about how access is important u for a country like India there's also uh the element of richness of the right of the kind of content and training that you want to deliver

there's also an aspect of aligning that with employability or the industry and uh so on so forth but there's one thing uh I think they uh I haven't heard that much is the focus on outcomes. It's very

very very important especially in skilling you begin with the end in mind. Unfortunately today most of the time the end seems to be that certificate that I'm choosing or that diploma that I'm as

opposed to what impact I delivered as a result of this training that I'm going to take. For that to happen in a country like India, you have to take on an ecosystem approach which is bring in the

startups, bring in the investors, bring in the industry, bring in the academia and the research into your skilling programs, into your AI fluency programs. But even more importantly, I want the

audience and all of us to take a step back and uh listen to this. My personal perspective having been in the US for 30 plus years in the valley in the heart of innovation is you need to

institutionalize the mindset. There are three things to it especially in an AI world where the technology is the runaway train. You need to institutionalize the curiosity of the

mind. the critical thinking of the mind and the creativity of the mind. The curiosity brings up what is the right kind of question that I want to ask. Okay. Using AI to generate the right for

example we take the LLM the prompts it's all about prompt engineering we talk about right depending on who is asking what kind of prompts to get the right kind of a response or the uh important

response or the sophistication of the response. The second is being able to define problems or analyze problems. And then the third thing is being able to produce creative solutions. All these

three things doesn't matter how fast technology moves, it cannot replace the human capital. And I think bringing these three which I call the institutionalization of the mindset as

part of the training curriculum first and foremost and making it a foundational pillar for everything that we do again using that ecosystem approach of bringing in all the

different institutions as part and parcel of your uh curriculum as a part and parcel of the skilling and making it like live data sets. [snorts] I we talked about how India has the most

diverse data sets and that's very important for us to recognize as a country to lead the AI race. It's one thing about amassing GPUs, but the twin angels that are going to determine the

dominance in the AI race are who will mobilize talent at a population scale and who will mobilize data sets at a population scale and India on both those fronts has a tremendous advantage and I

think with the kind of initiative that we are trying to do with ITM to bring in the muscle power and to bring in that ecosystem that approach and to bring in that openness to build bridges to the

rest of the ecosystems in the world. We could truly become the global AI innovation capital pretty soon. Just taking that further uh one are you seeing enough innovative solutions

coming out from the India market and and the markets that you see um specifically around scaling like is is this a gap where there's also a lot of potential for startups to come in and play a

larger role. Um the opportunity if we think about the next decade, two decades let alone longer because internet opportunity now is at least uh uh three

decades right and we are still mining that opportunity. So it's important when you have a generational shift in technology which AI is and it's probably I would

categorize it as bigger than a generation shift. This is going to change fundamental order of many things. Maybe how organizations work, maybe how society works, maybe how and what we

value. I know we've been talking about how wealth may get concentrated. But we don't know that for sure because you know history teaches us a lot. Land holding was where wealth was at one

time. maybe oil holding and you know if you look at uh top global companies today they are technology companies which would not have been conceivable a few decades back uh few decades back you

have to own assets to be able to be a wealthy company so you know I think uh there is a equalization over time that happens and that's inevitable that we know from you know history so I think

it's important we don't get too myopic to consider are we seeing enough opportunities? Is there enough innovation going on? Because the one thing that gets asked often is

why didn't India create a deep sea or why didn't we create an open AI and for that we had to have been thinking about that 30 years back and these things are not overnight. So the thing that's most

important is for us to think about you know this is going to be a long innovation race. Maybe in a race there are certain mile posts that you don't win. Maybe the large LLM models maybe we

win we don't. Although there will be another turn in technology again even within that right but it's important to think about how do you win the long race and so for that what are the investments

we make today and that could be a topic by itself and the panel by itself but you know if I could just take one more minute let's think about it that the uh cyber physical systems that we

experience daily in every aspect of our life are all going to be intelligent that is you know the pace may change what comes first what comes next which means that that's a large opportunity

and I heard global south mentioned many times here and what we have an opportunity from accessibility and affordability and one part of that is the digital infrastructure that Jay

talked about and others but it's more than that and that opportunity AI can equalize and empower you know so I am my optimist you couldn't do my job if you're not so I don't look at it as are

there enough innovations I think there are enough ideas enough entrepreneurs there's also a responsibility to uh invest with patients mentor and plays a long game

&gt;&gt; with that let me also get audience questions anyone &gt;&gt; hi everyone I'm Janette As a I'm a research scholar at the new school. Um I have a new nonprofit um K

network which is focused on um promoting inter research using AI for social good. Um but I used to work at UN women for 15 years. And so I'm going to take that hat um temporarily right now and ask you a

question that's related to what you were saying the long um run game um really investing in talent um and investing in women right um it was really nice coming in here this morning because you had a

lady's line and you had a gentleman's line and the ladies line was really really short [laughter] I'm a data scientist by training I can tell you that machine learning um is a

passion of mine 12% of women worldwide are um in machine learning business. Um less than a third of women are in AI, right? Or are AI um um experts. And so I'm really curious how you're thinking

about that in terms of the work that you're doing. How are you empowering women to enter this field not as users but as designers as you know um decision makers as as really people who are um in

the room making the decisions and really um thinking about how we're going to use this um technology to change the world. Thank you &gt;&gt; everyone.

No, great question and you uh uh I'm going to request you and uh other men and women in the room if you're really interested in this topic. We have a panel discussion tomorrow uh which is AI

for her and we will really have conversation with leading women leaders uh from the field of AI where we are going to really drill down on this topic to say what all we need to do uh to be

truly inclusive because you know we've heard about biases that exist right in every shape and form and uh that gets carried forward to NLMs etc. So it's so important to have women in machine

learning, in AI, in leadership positions, in uh uh in making decisions and so on and so forth. Uh but I am going to urge you to attend the session tomorrow. At the same time since you

referred to J and and uh Vani and the optimism that the sharing jets specific to your call uh call out which is a very important one for all of us to focus on that it doesn't stay in the hand of few

which includes you know uh the gender gap as well uh I'm a AI optimist uh like Vani and I wanted to say we sit in India with 900 million plus connected users who have access to internet today large

language models and I'll speak for Chennai because I represent Google is available in nine languages with the road map to cross 22 languages uh in coming years. What does that mean? It

means that a girl sitting in Seliguru say 15 16 years old can ask questions in her local language say Bengali and can have access to anything she wants to know. So uh uh you know understanding

English, typing in English, being in a metro is not a barrier for her to know what she wants to know because access to information and how you use the prom and you know through voice etc is making it

democratic and available to everyone. Uh so that's my short answer but if anyone else wants to weigh in let's take more questions. Right. Okay. Hi, good morning.

How will I real? How will that take LLS? Hello guys, good morning, good afternoon and good evening everyone. Student has a

question. My question is how will Relax. Okay. Open your phone.

Okay. Don't don't be afraid. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I have heard a concept of VJA visual language joint embedding predictive architecture.

It can replace the LLM. So, how it can be? &gt;&gt; Yeah, I can uh maybe take a stab at it.
