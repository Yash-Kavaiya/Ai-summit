## 📝 Transcript

You saw Russia Ukraine war was going on. Swift was stopped for Russia. So you will have to with the way we own digital public infrastructure in India. We'll have to create a cognitive public

infrastructure. How soever difficult it is and that's why pair it's visceral it's existential and we will have to do it and probably it's time that we should do it. I yesterday wrote an article in

uh the Sunday gajin which where where I called it the the architecture of independence right it is the architecture of independence. There's no der of you know experts in India.

There's no der of talent in India. There's no der of only thing is compute which I think geopolitically we should solve. That again is sovereignty right because people are using GPUs to control

geopolitics and that is why we will have to be sovereign at all you know all the layers of the cake &gt;&gt; right

&gt;&gt; and I believe that uh when you apply these systems to policing you will have to go for trust and transparency uh and it has created problems on the other side it's become a force

multiplier it has hugely enabled criminal ecosystem we polymorphic malware. You have, you know, there was a a company called Arup. I think it's a advertisement company or something where

the CEO came on a live zoom call and they lost uh $30 million. Right? This is a state at which AI is evolving. Do we have realtime policing? Sir, you know, explained that policing is not so real

time. So, you will have to increase both capability and capacity and this needs a serious thought right now. So pay we need sovereign AI. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you sir. And again as

expected very very relevant points sir that reminds me of of interview by Jensen Huang a few years back. He said I met your prime minister all before this AI hype uh when it's about in very

initial stages and he said your prime minister told me that I don't want to export data to import intelligence. He said that was really remarkable for a world leader to think in those times. So

I think very relevant points you also echoed but good that sir you brought compute in in picture because compute is something where we really have to make pro in fact the rest of the world and

then I would love to bring pair maybe at later stage. So uh with this then I would like to move to Martin. Martin thanks a lot uh first of all traveling all the way to India to attend the AI

summit and being with us. M in your role as uh in terod data as a leader in in in data analytics big data implementation uh you have been quoted twice in data IQ's 100 most influential people in

datadriven business and what's remarkable I was looking at your website where you are now saying that uh stop managing data activate intelligence so and I also read your article about the

large scale compute requirement which is going to come for example you give a healthcare example where every patient will be followed by an agent and he'll be firing like thousands hundreds and

thousands of queries to make sure that you have that hypers uh personalization experience. So with that kind of compute requirement Martin do you think that uh we are ready for so sovereignity from

day one or is going or as everybody said you have to tackle it layer wise so what do you think especially when you come to the layer of data you know how the data structures uh a country like India can

make sure that they are sovereign in those aspects yeah so over to you &gt;&gt; thank you and uh and good morning everybody lovely to be here um there's a lot to unpack in your question and we

should come back and we should talk about the implications of potentially millions of agents running thousands of queries because I think that is a very important consequence uh of where we're

going that we should think about. But you're absolutely right at Terodata we think that the first and the most fundamental layer is the data layer. There is no good AI without good data.

So it's incredibly important we get that right. And there are some principles that have proven to be more or less timeless. And if I speak about timeless in in terms of it, I'm speaking they've

proven to be good over three or four decades. That's the kind of event horizon, isn't it, for technology. Um, so we need to focus on capturing the most detailed data that we can. We need

to make sure that we are capable of integrating that data so that we can solve complex problems across domains. I guess in in defense, air, space, maritime, land, cyber increasingly that

requires that we can connect the dots. Um and then we need to expose a simplified representation of that data um so that a hard-pressed individual uh operating under pressure uh can make

sense of the data and also so that we can as we increasingly open that data platform to agents so we reduce the risk of hallucination for the agents as well. So those are three principles that I

think have stood the test of time. When we think about a modern data foundation and we tend to use this word data modernization a lot right now in the industry

a a difficult term I think I uh I I would say that uh data modernization can mean whatever the vendor sat across you wants to sell you that day. So we should be careful with the term but I think

there are two things that are really important in in this idea of data modernization. The first is this idea of open table formats and and the the promise of open table formats is that we

can store more data more reliably and crucially more cost-ffectively and cost effective is important. I was speaking to the ministry of defense at one of the smaller European nations last week their

next generation AI data platform that they envisaged to integrate those five domains they think will be a minimum of 2.5 pabytes of data. for a country of the size complexity of India um I think

you can multiply that by at least 10. So being able to store large volumes of of data and to to fuse that data that sensor data cost effectively is very important. But the more important

consequence of open table formats is this idea of interoperability. This idea that we cannot possibly predict sat here in this room today which models and which technologies will

be the most important four or five years from now. And this idea that different technologies, different processing engines have different strengths and weaknesses for different applications.

And so we need to be able to support many of them. And so the idea of having a data foundation that we can bring multiple tools to is incredibly important in that conversation. The

other modernization conversation that's very important is data products, but we probably don't have time for that discussion today. And this now brings us to why are we building this data

foundation? Well, we're building this data foundation so that we can bring AI to that data foundation and increasingly so we can bring agentic AI to that foundation. And I think there are a

couple of things that are important to to think through there. The first is I think we can get very wrapped up around the idea of training models around training the best

model around training our own model. I think that's a little bit of a trap. Honestly, when I look at um the performance of the open- source models, they're generally only six months behind

the proprietary models. So, right now, the open source models are catching up with the proprietary models inside six months. And those open source models, we can inspect the architecture, we can

inspect the weights. So, we can we can be pretty confident in those models. And so, I think we should focus less on training our own models and think more about inference. A good model that I can

score quickly and cost-effectively is better nine times out of 10 than the best model that I can't get out of the lab and into production. So we should we should focus on inference first. We

should also think about the diversity of models. There was a really interesting paper by Nvidia last year called small models of the future of agentic AI and in that paper they pointed out that

smaller models are often cheaper to score faster to score and can be less prone to hallucination when they're focused on a task specific problem. So better, cheaper, faster and more

reliable. That's a pretty good trade, right? So we should think about not having one single model to rule them all. We need to start thinking about the models that are available to us as a box

of tools. And when we have a box of tools, we shouldn't always reach for the hammer just because it's the biggest shiniest tool in the box. And then the last thing that I think is particularly

relevant in a defense and a security context is for I've been in I've been in this industry for a little over 30 years now and mostly we've been concerned with structured data with rows and columns of

numeric data. And the great promise of AI that we're seeing play out already is that we can now apply these models to unstructured data to images to audio to text and we can have multimodal

intelligence and this is incredibly important. So at Terodata for example we've always worked with defense agencies around supply chain optimization to your point around

predictive maintenance. Today in terod data we can support very complex maritime surveillance applications where we take large volumes of detailed data across multiple sensor types a and fuse

that intelligence for maritime surveillance. We can assess camouflage effectiveness. I think you made the point earlier that that highv value assets are increasingly vulnerable to

loitering munitions relatively inexpensive loitering munitions. So we can capture images of camouflaged assets like tanks and assess camouflage effectiveness to protect those assets

and these are applications that would not have been possible even 3 four five years ago. So the the pace of change and innovation is spectacular and exciting. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you Martin. I think

what really stood out to me is that in our quest for sovereignity I think using open source data data model is really important because you get to inspect the ar architecture no matter who's created

it at least that aspect can we bring into soy very early on and also it resonates with general shiba earlier said you know building superior algorithms on top of it yeah great so

now I come come to uh pri saxa pri is a director of global data analytics in concentrics uh recognized as one of the 10 most influential leader awarded as uh one of the women leaders in AI and looks

after the entire genai initiative across the world from concentrics. So pri great to have you here and thanks for coming. So pri uh what we would like your inputs is is on the public and private

collaboration and you have been at the forefront of it. So what do you think are the right models where both the teams can work together with a larger focus on bringing sovereignty across

layers of AI? Over to you. &gt;&gt; Sure. Thank you. Thanks Abishek. Am I audible? Okay. Great. So good good morning everyone. So I would just like to answer it by having very small blocks

to the entire ecosystem of data AI and analytics. So starting from data which is the main thing the bread and butter on which all the layers are added on top of it as as you mentioned rightly

capturing the right data having the right form of governance is absolutely important. I think I think starting from residency the data residency aspect in which India has already initiated the

DPDP act which is very very absolutely relevant and that would be the first foundational layers to it. So once we have ensured that all our healthcare data PI information all the transactions

we are made are residing in our own country that's a foundational layer in terms of residency then we need to have the right layer of governance on top of it and when I say governance like do we

have any biases in the data are we capturing in the right formats right shape so that is absolutely important because data governance is going to be the next key thing for your success for

any program any analytics or AI program that you run across. Now here when we have the data residency solved, governance solved and then on top of it we try to apply any AI models on top of

it and I completely agree to your point which you said like open source are much speedy to market we should leverage that but with all the relevant guard rails. So here I believe public and private

partnership can have a great role like can we have a challenge based programs. Can we have some hackathons in which public sector also and private sector also come across with various prototypes

and those prototypes can later on be put into mass productions but that can be a great collaborative formats and because open source these days are like very very speedy to the market. they are

actually solving the real problems and they are coming up with very innovative concepts that we haven't thought of enough. So here I feel like public private collaboration can really be of

help and there are various uh you can say uh unique models to curl that out be challenge based be hackathons or in any other formats. So once we have the AI layer sorted out and have the relevant

models built then comes the consumption layer. Now as as uh my fellow panelist was saying like there is no industry today right now which is not affected by AI. You you name any industry we have

the analytics use cases. Why? Because we have the right set of techniques especially in defense area any anomaly detection any pattern recognition we can put the right alarms right setups. Okay

this this is something which is going off the track and should highlight we should raise the relevant alerts. So in those mechanisms the user especially in the defense sector is absolutely

important and can be done on real time. Now all of this is en you can say encapsulated with the ecosystem layer and what we call it as like you can call it as an ESG layer because as we are

building the Indian soverent track to build our own AIS we need to be absolutely cognizant of the fact what kind of carbon footprints uh while we are creating our own data centers

building our own clouds what kind of footprints we are having. So somewhere in back of this journey we should be cognizant of this facts as well how ESG can actually have an impact in this

entire ball game. So that's that's all my thoughts abishek. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you so much P. I think uh yeah [applause] my my takeaway from you is that open

source but with guardrails um you know quick to go to market innovative. Yeah and you also talked about the consumption layer but most importantly you came towards the end on

the ESG side of it. I'm very sure we are going to have one more session sometime in future on ESG and we'd love to invite you and express your thoughts because after all data centers wherever we read

US or anywhere local communities are they they are really affected by it. Thank you so much Pri. Okay. So uh towards the end I come to Mandar. Uh last but not the least, Mandar is is the

national security officer of Microsoft India and Asia Pacific and is at the forefront of Microsoft's uh security initiatives including cyber. So Mandard your thoughts about adoption of AI in

general because your platform as we say you know various layers while that layer can be addressed later but what is whatever is built on top of it is is actually what we debated can be you know

the early adopters of sovereign AI so over to you &gt;&gt; right thanks I think interesting and uh I have the advantage of speaking after everybody so so [laughter]

I will uh I'll just take one more minute right I think a lot of speakers before me talked about sovereignity and uh different words used visceral and emotional and all that right I think in

my opinion um sovereignity has been obscured or confused by a lot of interest right and interest from everybody from government from tech companies and um of course uh general

audience right but sovereignty and uh in my role I work with lot of governments including Indian government I have I had privilege of working with some of my uh some of the Indian defense folks as

well. Solverity is fairly simple, right? Essentially, it's four layers. The layer number one is data, right? Data sovereignity. We whole started with data residency. But then given the

geopolitical situation and some of the incidents, we actually now talk about data sovereignty. How is my data protected? Nobody else has access. Nobody else has jurisdictional access to

my data. Right? That's data sovereignty. The second layer is operational sovereignty. uh couple of speakers before me spoke spoke about how can nobody else switch me off right

operational so also is fairly simple so that my business can continue uh I can continue to trust that cloud or AI without somebody else having ability to switch off tech this is where things

become little complicated and interesting right tech soy means I should be able to build on top of that right I'll not get into bit of clos source open source commercial right but

that's where the issue starts happening because tech also means the tech has to be not only in my control but it has to be good right the classic example classic debate that we get again we have

eminent defense folks so I'll refer to that right is India willing to wait 10 years for AMA to come fifth generation fighter or is India willing to buy Rafael to fill that gap right uh

sovereign aircraft maybe we wait 10 years but we have needs today that's where the tech sovereignty becomes a very very interesting But sorry to pitching but just interesting input. The

AMA is coming with 50% indigenization. &gt;&gt; Sure. Sir would agree with me. &gt;&gt; No no absolutely I'm saying AMA drawing a parallel. &gt;&gt; No no I'm saying AMA is great but AMA

will come maybe 10 years. &gt;&gt; Sorry not AMA. Rafal is coming with 50% Indianization. &gt;&gt; Yeah of course of course. Yeah. So uh but the point I'm making is AMA is 10

years away. Would we want or would we want 50% Indianization and use uh Rafal today? Now that's the balance on tech right? If we insist on every layer has to be India then we probably will have

to wait right that's the balance and finally the AI sovereignity right the fourth layer which was not on top of everybody's mind right the three layers have been talked for pretty much for a

long time the data the operation and tech so even in the cloud world but AI already came now AI so is a little bit more complicated than cloud sovereignity or or or any other tech soy right why

because I think speakers before me spoke so I'll not go detail there but AI brings a perspective right that means the data that it is trained on has to have the Indian perspective right it

needs to have all the nuances which in the first three layers were not so much so data solidity is not only whether it is running in India whether it is developed by Indians it's also is it

trained on Indian ethics is it trained on Indian languages and all that so I think AI so is a step beyond that right and because most of the models are uh like black blocks explanative

explanability is a challenge. I think that's where AI already becomes extremely important, right? &gt;&gt; Um and that's where I again agree with what I think Peter you mentioned the

small language models Martin sorry you mentioned small language model purpose-built models are probably making more sense. I think that's the way we think generally of sovereignity right

the question that we need to all look at is solidity is not binary it's not zero or one right as it is typically made out to be it's a spectrum different departments different organizations

different applications need different level of sovereignty somewhere you need to have operations control versus somebody somewhere you will have to end to end the stack like in defense needs

to be developed ourself right uh the final point that I'll make here is see life has come full circle. Uh those who are in IT for maybe 25 odd years we saw mainframe where computing was

centralized to distributed computing where computing was distributed to cloud where again that computing become little centralized. Now we are talking when cloud started 10 15 years back right all

the big techs believed that there are going to be five regions in the world right somewhere in Europe somewhere in Asia somewhere in US and everybody will use cloud from those five regions today

reality is Microsoft has 75 regions right so we moved from five regions literally 10 years back to 75 regions I think it's time to take the next step where we are saying the region is not

only in my control but region is also in customers data center so I think what we will see happening in tech is that the sovereign clouds will become a reality right for example in Microsoft we have

now created something something called a sovereign private cloud which can run in customers own data center under complete customer control disconnected air gap we did not do that maybe two years back

that's the reality right we we talk kept on talking about softwaredefined sovereignty until about a year back &gt;&gt; today we are saying okay we have a full stack sovereign private cloud and I'm

taking Microsoft as an example. Our competition and other companies also have similar. &gt;&gt; No, that's a very valid point. In fact, competitions like SAP already deployed

sovereign cloud and that's the way to go. &gt;&gt; That's sovereign public. What I'm saying is sovereign private which can run in an aircapped environment in defense of

course of course &gt;&gt; and that's a reality because &gt;&gt; last point we will have to take us out of the equation the zero trust model right you don't even need to trust the

company that gives you tech. That's the only way we can build content. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you. Right. Very valid point Mandar and it was important to bring the industry perspective here to

complete the full picture. Uh ladies and gentlemen we have almost run out of time. I would request Pier to give his closing remarks and then we'll uh conclude the session. P what you

&gt;&gt; okay so try to keep it brief. So what we have been discussing here it's we would say it's when we talk about sovereignity and AI it's openness versus security the trade-offs speed of innovation versus

governance global integration versus autonomy public infrastructure versus private innovation. So these are the extremes and um what

what what I wish was would be for India would be if they if you could have something in the middle of these extremes um so the best of let's say the EU and the US EU very much regula

regulatory driven uh regulatory first innovation second etc and the US probably innovation first and then well some control from the permanent um anyway that comes. So if if that would

be something uh for India, I think this is a is a good rate good route to take. You said it uh collaborative models um in uh in to invest in in infrastructure something like um centers of excellence

um where public and private come together to solve the real world problems in architecture in healthcare and all these kind of things. So if that would be a route for India I would be

more than glad and it brings the best the best together from both worlds. Thank you. Thank you Pier. So towards the end of the session I'll request all speakers to please come forward. We are

releasing a background paper and I would request Nachal Mishra and Akilshuta from KPMG to please come up as well. Show it please. Let's

get out of this.
