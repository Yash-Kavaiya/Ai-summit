## 📝 Transcript

a common response to online harm. Um, but that said, anonymity also plays a dual role. While it can enable abuse on platforms, it also allows women, it allows folks who identify as gender

queer, um, you know, gender diverse persons to be able to seek support, to be able to claim spaces online without fear of retaliation. Um this is again something that we studied in some detail

and our recommendation was that perhaps we should look at something that's a little bit more proportionate something that's a little bit more risk based one that focuses on ident through targeted

tools rather than mandating identity disclosure for everybody. I should be able to access the internet um anonymously if that's what I want because that's the point and the promise

of the internet as well to be able to access it as a safe space where my identity is not something that I need to verify um all the time. So the real challenge then therefore is how do you

create a safe space while you're when you know where you don't have to choose between safety and anonymity. How do we design systems that deliver smarter accountability, clearer recourse, and

informed policy grounded in live experience? And with that, I'm very glad that I don't have to answer these questions today. And I'm very very um pleased to call on our panelists. Um may

I start with her excellency the Norwegian ambassador to India may the digital empowerment foundation utra danesh snap and our moderator Rajiv Makni awardwinning uh media personality

tech expert author please I will hand this over to you right So uh let me set context first. Thank you so much everyone for coming in. I know many of you including Soha I've

flown in from various places, various cities, various countries but of course my heart goes out to all of you who traveled from Gulawa and Noa that was that was the tougher journey for sure

right so uh while that was one tough journey we've done we've got a lot more to cover with this panel today uh and while this mic seems to be uh not behaving very well and I could get cut

off but uh at NDTV when I used to be there there used to be a term called you don't have to be shout to be heard and Andrea and so have shown that you don't really need to do that and I don't think

either of the people in the panel will also need to do that. I think the context has been set by Niha. I think Andrea already said everything I wanted to say but I will just set context for

what is important to me as somebody that does take his technology very very seriously and also sees all that has gone wrong with the way technology has gone till now but I also am very

frightened by what is going to be happening very very soon. on the threshold of witnessing what I think is the single largest digital advancement in human history. Now I know with an AI

impact summit you will [clears throat] hear this term in various ways. The words may change, but you'll hear this great founders who are focused on customer needs, local customer needs,

right? And that they may be very different that know how to make talent which might be a combination of AI talent and human talent to create a great company. So I think it's possible.

&gt;&gt; How many people are looking for capital in their AI? Come find me on LinkedIn. &gt;&gt; I'm going to move a very nice background

as I asked him. says he started activate as an organic next step of his life. I think that's and activate is perhaps India's one or

two perhaps the only leading stack which is helping entrepreneurs get resources am I right and if I am you are about three months old as activate

What have you learned in the India mission of being an adviser and now doing activate? What have you seen? &gt;&gt; I think I was just tired of answering

this question where is AI in India. Um and I'm glad you didn't ask that question as the first in this session itself. uh which is uh and more recently the questions have been about how do I

get into bhat mandib but that we will leave for later but &gt;&gt; uh there's no AI that can solve for that unfortunately so um you know I think like uh just like you mentioned I built

this company called haptic and you were part of the same ecosystem for a long time uh we built AI chatbots in 2014 uh so I've been trying to explain to people what a chatbot does you know since then

um and then over the last two or three years um repeatedly this notion that India is behind in AI kept coming up. I think if you have to be honest to ourselves we are probably not leading

today right there is there is things we have to do to uh catch up and accelerate this wave. uh that's the reason why I decided to spend some time with the government on the mission and that's

what led to activate with the core beliefs that the AI of Bharat or Indian AI will be created by deeply technical founders. So um one of the things that we saw

repeatedly over the last 2 years is that traditionally company building um in in everywhere in the world but in India particularly used to happen like this there has there used to be business CEO

founders like us uh who would find a great tech co-founder to pawn into our idea um and then we would start building something working from a problem and a use

the new AI companies that are being built everywhere in the world and I'm starting to see this happen in India and that's our entire thesis are actually being built technology forward where

it's actually two nerds or techies uh who are hacking away uh using the latest you know uh uh cloud bot or gold bald or you know latest cloud release without necessarily knowing which problem they

are going to solve. As they're tinkering and hacking away, they end up building something that is extremely interesting and unique, economically viable, and then they marry it with a particular No.
