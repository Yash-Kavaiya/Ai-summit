## 📝 Transcript

which is not which is a big big big mistake. Uh so that's a sectoral access a skill pathway. If you are elite then you get to see if you are uh not from elite institution then slowly it reaches

to you after few years but the speed is too high. We cannot afford that for AI we need to do something else to keep up. Okay. So now we understand that why we kept a

billion literate people in AI space from the perspective of gas. Let's also look at some uh financial aspect that what does it mean financially? This is a plot created by uh McKenzie

recently. They said um about 15 trillion dollars GDP contribution will be done by uh AI and AIdriven changes in the world. Okay. In in just next five years, okay,

India's potential is $1 trillion. And there's another way to look at it.$1 trillion is 25% of our GDP. So that's a that's a big number and to be very true I I I I I still think this

is a conservative number if we go to uh go through the uh real adoption of AI. Uh nevertheless so that's the economic case of AI and AI literacy at a scale why is needed.

Then we move towards advantages of India and uh because I I perhaps triggered a lot of thinkings that we are uh way behind we need to act and that's true we need to but there are certain things

that that really unequal to any there's no competition in that space for us and that's where we sign and this is the time to capitalize on it uh and and and and those are the points

where we are best position that any other country and let's start with the proven scale which we talked a bit earlier that we we we we have scaled certain things in in a way in a number

that nobody else had done. So we know that game how to make grassroot label scaling dem demographics that's a very very very important point see people up to the age

of 18 if they say some see something in the world they think this is life this is how world age the people who see anything in the age of 18 to 35 it's a general understanding I do not

have scientific backing for it. Uh those they see something 18 to 35 they think that this is innovation. This is new innovation that has come up. The people that are in 35 to 45 50 they they they

are the kind of people who are somewhere in between. They think that oh these changes they don't make things very nicer. The people above 55 and it's very generalistic. That's just uh just to

give a sense of uh how people perceive new innovations. The people above 55 generally think that this is an a thing. This is going to make things much difficult. It will not help care.

We are a economy where our people are below 35. It's a huge huge huge benefit. If you put a new skill there, they are more likely to learn it quickly. They

have more power to learn newer things. So that's the huge advantage we have. Necessitydriven uh innovation. That's the frugal innovation that is in our DNA. We live with limitations. We have

seen that at our home. We see everywhere. So and that's where we sign. Uh so that's uh that's uh that's a great thing while world is uh being struggling with um huge data center need huge

electricity need because there's interest to have really uh bigger models but the beauty lies when we are able to do automations in everyday life and they don't require bigger models they don't

require those bigger data centers and who is champion in doing this that's where we we come we can really build those edge solutions.

Diversity advantage if you want to build a solution in AI basically it's a predictor it requires the more you sow it the more smarter it becomes who has more to show we have more to show we

have more people from any we have more sample we have more Hindu sample we have more uh all kind of sample right we have more people sample so so so we can provide that scale that diversity

university that can really help us huge gap. So the bottom line is we should not compete on building AI models. We shall lead creating the world's most AI

literate society and the world's most applied AI space. So I will conclude on this slide and then I will hand it over to one of my

colleague. Uh but what are the implications if we don't do okay and it it builds on the previous story uh mostly that unequal productivity claim gains. So those people who use uh uh I'm

sure some of you would be using AI you would realize they can do a lot of stuff uh already uh uh that they were not able to do last year. Yeah. So uh that's there we will

not be able to equalize on productivity gains. AI divide we saw the digital divide is already there and it's a huge factor in India that gets uh uh multiplied many fold uh and in fact

there's a there's a good story there to to give a touch uh that I started this initiative AI for all global with this very problem I come from Bihar and my ambition was that someday somehow can it

be possible that MIT grade of education can be available two people in Bihar and with the help of AI with the help of uh u uh various possibilities uh in interest of time I'll not go there u

that is possible we can do that misinformation and harmful use that's a big one uh so this uh uh this this is a this is a unseen but a very dangerous topic which can lead any society to

chaos which can which can take down any government and there are examples but this is not a political uh session so I will not go there uh misdevelopment opportunities of course India fails to

harness the AI's full potential if it did not go there so the bottom line is it's not about losing job learning AI It's really that we will miss opportunity.

This is once in a lifetime opportunity where uh where intelligence that was available to elite is available to everyone and we have the opportunity to change

the status quo. we have the opportunity to take a position uh of Vix Bharat. With that I will hand it over to my colleague Lakshmi Mishra. She will

explain uh what AI literacy actually is and what AI literacy do we need uh now that we know that we do need. Okay. Thank you. Okay. Hi everyone and I know this is

being uh broadcasted as well. So uh hi to all our online audience as well. Uh I'm Lakshmishra and uh we have a good context. We know why we need AI literacy and uh I'm just going to take you

through a very interesting thing. I'm an engineer so I love architectures. So let's see uh how can we achieve AI literacy at the scale at which we are for India right so let's first

understand the definition of AI literacy so it is a technical knowledge durable skill and future ready attitudes right AI first mindset and not be scared like we don't have to be scared we have to

take an AI first mindset and I think with that AI literacy is required for everybody in the society not just for the top people or who are building the AI but for the commoners if everybody is

a user at the end of the day if you assume as a user or consumer of AI you need that kind of understanding and imagine going to the top of the pyramid which are the buildings so we need every

level AI literacy so it enables learners to engage manage design and of course create okay I'll go deeper and in the interest of time I'm speeding up because Um we have a lot to cover still and we

are just on the top of the iceberg. So universal AI literacy framework uh this one we have derived AI for all global has derived this uh based on research and uh the grounding is on OECD

and European commission research. So it takes a lot from there but we have tried to expand this to do uh AI literacy for all. How do we achieve that? And I would say that many of you are probably coming

from different backgrounds. So this framework is very simple. You can think if you're an educator, you can apply this when you're thinking about building your course or curriculum for your

target audience. If you're yourself uh somebody who is keen or who are who is now AI enthusiast, it's very popular word. So you want to upskill yourself. I think this framework allows you to do

that as well. Right? So it is persona driven uh and it allows you a lot of flexibility. So it's a common knowledge. It is foundation for anybody who is thinking thinking about AI literacy.

Okay. So let's uh dive deeper. U I think there's one slide why we need a framework and not a course. Many of us I mean at least 20 years back right it was like do one course and you are all

good, right? But I think with AI we believe it is not true. We don't need a course. We are talking about a fundamental shift here, right? And for that to happen, um, imagine how our

earlier systems used to work, right? They were very tool centric. They were mostly delivered for tech professionals and delivered in English. We don't need that anymore. We don't

need a course. We don't need one-time certifications. That won't help us. It is continuous learning. I think we have been hearing this word continuous learning. That is good. At least I I

believe India is is a great knowledge center, right? So we believe in continuous learning and that is the same mindset which this framework also emphasizes. So it talks about

capability. Okay, it is continuous process. It is role based and it is for everyone. Does it make sense? Right? So we have to focus on how to judge as a commoner. How

to judge when AI is in front of you, how to use it and people who are into policy making they have to understand how to govern AI, how to build those guardrails when they're building it, right? And why

does this matter? So let's talk about a real gap to understand uh this better. So India ranks number you know one when it comes to geni courses on Corsera for example this data is from Corsera number

one but when it came to the skills proficiency we stand at 89th rank out of 109 countries right so there's a huge difference in attending the courses

versus having the skills to literally go and use it in your daily life with that let's understand the framework There are four interconnected dimensions that we see here and it is built on

domains, competencies and personas. Very very simple words, right? You can just remember these four words. So domains, competencies, personas and proficiency. So let's dive deeper into

all of these together. These four dimensions actually let us keep a universal standard while adapting learning for different people and different roles depending upon from

where they're coming from. Uh I'm going to deep dive into domains and connect this domains. Four pillars are there to all the three other uh dimensions that you see.

Let's go forward. I think this this is a very simple architecture four pillars and as you can see the way they are uh structured they're going higher in order but they

all are critical you can't skip one over other engage is fundamental it is about how does AI affect me okay uh coming to create it is about application using it in or adapting it in your uh daily

workflows uh third is about manage so this is very particular I think it's more about uh people who are in the role of managing who are deciding the goals who are adopting like digital adoption

who are making decisions for the company or for country for example. So for them it is definitely an important pillar. Designing is for people who are on the top of the hierarchy they are technical

people they are innovating they are the one who are developing. So how do you build AI right? So four distinct capabilities areas that progress from foundational awareness to technical

leadership if you see here. So these four domains help us move beyond the tool training to actual readiness. So let's go deeper like I said we'll go deeper to understand what does engage

mean uh all all these pillars. So when we are talking about engage with AI right it is about four competencies first are you understanding that how AI systems are appearing in your daily life

that is AI awareness. Are you able to assess the reliability of the things that you're seeing? Right? How do you trust? What is what are the biases that are coming into play? Third

is about understanding the privacy aspect of it. You know, we we share a lot of data. We share a lot of things. So, are we aware as a end user when we are engaging with these AI systems that

privacy, security and lot of misinformation is with AI? I I would say I mean there is darker side also. So if you think about that there's a lot of misinformation possible what is the

societal impact are we understanding that aspect so policy equity implications right the digital divide that what about the AI division that is going to be coming up very soon right so

let's talk about the demonetization example right I mean when UPI or remember demonetization in 2015 I think we all moved so quickly towards the digital adoption or dig and PI I mean

it's a great example of how digital adoption scaled in India and we believe that AI literacy can too if we treat it like a foundation UPI is like I think everywhere right so the

similar approach if we can think build towards AI that is how it will become a universal foundation let's understand uh how it behaves when we go to create with AI I think this is where I think

was focusing Right? I mean create with AI is very important pillar for us to be able to scale uh on the AI leadership. So create is about AI using AI effectively in our everyday affairs. So

think about from engineering everybody uses it. It is a simple plain English. The better you are in writing those the better results you get back from the AI systems. So how do you use this

effectively? Second is apply AI tools for domain task based on your domain. If you are a healthare worker, do you understand that how will I use this for my use you know use cases or scenarios.

So if you understand that I think you are in the create. So that's where it falls. Uh are you able to verify refine and validate the outputs that you get from uh your when you have created with

AI right? Uh fourth and very important how do you embed I think AI is going to disrupt our traditional workflows it's it is already you know the way I mean when uh Google came I think Google map

very simple example how many of us now remember the pathway to go back home or I mean any places right anything you just put on the Google and use so are we it is going to inter literally disrupt

our uh workflows so do we understand that so this keeps the focus focus on practical capabilities and that is where I think we have huge potential not just knowing the tool but using it well

checking on the outcomes and embedding it back into your workflows. So let's understand the third which is manage because that is essential we are giving a powerful tool in hand of everyone how

do you govern and manage I think India is still working on a AI policy for India don't have yet influenc how How to manage it? So manage is the is for governance and strategy that what

organizations and leaders must do to adopt AI responsibility. Core competencies to align it with your organization goals. Establish policies and standards and accountability right

you just can't give it away. How do you make sure that you have put guardrails and uh terms and conditions so that you you you have things in place. Change is not going to be easy.

It it's going to disrupt things. It will make you uncomfortable. Change is always uncomfortable, right? So people will uh resist. So how do you address the resistance and also make the AI adoption

easier for people? So how do we reduce that friction? Lastly, very important um is AI related risk which are important. So, so it's important role by the manage pillar to put all these things in place.

Now, the last I think is very important which is design people we want more and more innovation in that space. I think this pillar is very interesting which is um based on design with AI. So the key

competencies here if you are designing a curriculum for somebody who is at the top of the stack which is the technical leadership they are they should be very clear on the a IML concepts which are

going understanding the architecture, data management, how are we collecting the data, right? I mean, we talked about samples. Yes, India has a lot of samples but I have been talking to somebody in

healthcare like data is there but it is all still not digitized right so how do you adopt them into your a IML models right very difficult pre-processing making sure that the quality is good

right there's no biases training them testing them and then optimizing them because we don't want to use a model of higher g for a low lower order work right so you have because it is all

related to your money your costing your energy dissipation and whatnot So how do you or you know select your model deployment and monitoring is most important evaluating your for example

agents you are building agents are we able to evaluate them there then production systems how do you bring into the production and then performance practice continuously all these agents

with the reinforcement learning we know that they are evolving they're getting better at understanding when you engage with any AI system you you would have noticed that the more you engage the

more it understands you there's one I think very viral thing like Chat GP you ask chat GP based on your persona and it gives your understanding it creates your image what it understands because of

your interaction with right so all these things are becoming and changing very fast the models are evolving very fast the role of design AI with AI is very important these are the people on the

top of your pyramid so let's understand how can we you know personalize this learning using this framework I talked about the four pillars which is engage create um manage and um build or right

or design. So how the framework personalizes these four pillars we just touched upon. To personalize this you have to understand that there are different

personas which is different personalities different learner archetypes and then what are their domains so that the pathway the learning pathway should be role relevant. You

don't want to teach somebody uh end to end everything based on my requirement based on my role. Give me the knowledge. That is how we have to package it right for healthare workers for imagine for K2

school what should be the curriculum. So based on that the same framework can be personalized for different personas. So step one is identify your learner. Step two determine their primary

domains. Step three would be each domain requires four competencies to develop. What are those? Based on domain, you need to be able to break it down. And then the fourth and final is progress

through the proficient skill. It will not happen in the first stage. It will go level by level. Uh so here are some examples like citizen and end users. What are we like engaged? We are at the

engage pillar, right? I think nobody can skip that pillar. Engage is for everyone even for builders. They have to first understand the uh use cases and then only they can build right. So engage is

for everyone. For business leaders it is manage and create. They are deciding the organization goals and they they are somebody who has to take lot of decision. They need to bring those AI

into the daily workflows or AI first mindset. So that they are the people who whose curriculum should be basically manage and create. Think about policy makers of course manage and engage. They

should be understanding these AI tools. If you you can't be managing something you don't even understand. So engage is fundamental. Technical professionals I think engage I have not you you don't

see here but I think they are also end users. So they fall into the first bucket as well. So design and create because these are people developers, data scientists, art, AI engineers. So

when we apply proficiency level which is aware which is kind of engaged then you're building the capabilities and then you are achieving fluency which is the

fluent okay so same competencies but you go in different depth depending upon for which persona you are creating the content. So the different programs has to be created based on all these

parameters or four dimensions in mind. uh with that I would like to close that we the core idea here you can your takeaway is the universal AI literacy framework is universal in nature it's a

foundation it is tailored by persona and captured by proficiency which will enable AI literacy to scale to billion 1 billion that we are thinking about and I think if we do we are able to do

populationwide AI literacy It's a great example that we create for the whole world. Many countries need this and I think they they look up to India and I think that's why AI India comes. Right.

So with that I will pass it on to my colleague uh Sor who has more things to say. So uh how to scale to a billion people that's what uh most of the things are

already covered so it may look or it may sound that we are being repetitive uh and this is something on which we have already delivered we have shown things right to the world which nobody

was able to do and because they didn't have that uh scope as well. Nobody has 1 billion population right except uh one country. So that is our advantage and with advantage we also have lot of

responsibilities because we don't want to scale uh just for the sake of right checking check boxes. We don't want to do that. We want to have a quality because the

most important thing which comes with AI is not just the speed. It eliminates mediocre outcomes. What we see today or uh in the beginning stages of AI, we make fun of AI giving

us mediocre uh outputs, right? But eventually it is getting trained, right? Gradually it is getting trained and with time it is improving. We can see that improvement and that is the challenge it

is giving us whether we'll be able to improvise ourself improve ourself at the same speed at which AI is doing right the problem here is the mindset. So who will or what will differentiate

uh good output of AI from a bad output? Anyone can do it. But who is willing to take action? Once you see there is a bad output coming but you have a deadline within 5

minutes you have to submit. If you are if you are in a mindset of uh right just manage deadlines don't worry about the quality you will automate 100% of your work to AI

right and that's what we see so mindset is important not just the scale and for that scale if you want to do that scaling we don't have to blindly right blindly give AI courses to everyone we

have to go this way where we Okay, first identify the force multipliers who can do it. Now AI is a tool or AI tools are there. It's you can you can take it as a tool as your helping hand. But without

domain expertise, you won't be able to utilize it completely. If you want to utilize it completely, if you want to utilize it efficiently, if you want to utilize it and if you want to scale with

good quality, you will have to have those people who are their own domain experts. Ask them to be your brand ambassadors, to be your uh torchbearers, right, for this drive which is uh AI

literacy. So what we see is we have around 10 million teachers in India. So if we target them first not target them all because we know what quality we have right. So identify the quality. Quality

should involve the mindset people who not only know their domain but they are passionate about that domain who want to adopt AI and let people use AI. Right? So identify those teachers and all and

then their students or their mentees they can actually go and multiply this. So that is the main thing and apart from uh teachers uh it has to come from all the d all

directions for example government officials. So already government is pushing right uh it should be it should be pushed as well as it should be adopted by the officials. Then we have

uh at workforce I know many companies they are they are actually uh making it compulsory for the people to use AI mention that we have used AI so that they are aware of what

result we are getting and how it is working. It doesn't it it doesn't uh it's not like they don't know AI and they are trying to literate them but to know about AI and how it is going to

impact them in future is something which is an essential part of AI literacy. So that is also important and again uh CSRs uh non-governing nonprofit organizations they are also very very important.

Another important aspect here is that these things should be done in local languages. So people who are doing it in local language they'll reach. Yeah.

Okay. So uh we have around five principles on which we want to scale. Uh most of them are already uh mentioned. If you want to scale, make these uh courses or whatever we are providing,

right? This should be very very short. Okay? Very short. It should not be a one semester course. We are not looking for that. People are very busy. We know how

we have come here, right? We have it's it's a working week. So, people are very busy. Uh it should be role based. Role based means already uh described. If I am an uh IT engineer,

don't teach me how to use AI in growing mangoes. It doesn't work for me. I will not have time to do that. Next is uh again mentioned earlier local languages. AI should be used to train AI or to

train people about AI. you use AI because whatever we have asked for right those things are very very easily doable by AI right and another important thing is judgment you should put more stress

on judgment than uh learning how to use tools this is something which we have discussed earlier as well mindset that should be our outcome we have to decide what is good what is bad what is correct

what is wrong. So that judgment is the main thing which we have to teach not the tools. Uh this is a small road map. It's seven years you can achieve in three years if

you are dedicated you can achieve in 10 years if you are not uh foundation where we train the trainers. Then acceleration in just uh right you make 15 times the target and then we have uh saturation

but saturation doesn't mean that we are done with AI literacy. It is a continuous process. You have to evolve yourself. AI is also evolving that. That's what from where that's from where

we started, right? Uh our competition is not what AI can do. Our competition is how fast AI can improve itself. That is the main uh competition. So government, government sector, educators, workforce,

CSR and foundation, they all are all the they are all the important uh stakeholders in this. Uh there are multiple uh pitfalls. We should be aware of that. I'll try to touch only the

second one. I think most of these are already covered. Second one is about wait for perfect curriculum. You should not we have suffered a lot due to that, right? because the perfect AI itself is

not perfect. And to say that we'll build something perfect uh curriculum for an imperfect tool, it doesn't make any sense. You have to be fast. You have to be uh open

for feedback and then learn again. That's how AI does. We want to beat AI. We want to uh use AI. Be it AI, whatever is your goal, you have to learn the way AI learns,

right? I think most of the topics are already covered. Uh old metrics and new new star. Old metrics is uh certification we are no more interested in that certification is good. But uh

I'll have a very good uh evaluator made out of AI itself, right? which can check whether you are good or not. I don't need your certificates now. Okay. So that is very important thing. So

these matrices are no more uh important. Quality quality and quality that's what we want and it's an it's a very good opportunity for us to deliver quality to convert our mediocre uh don't take it

wrong but majority of our workforce is mediocre. So to convert that to a quality workforce, this is a golden opportunity for us and AI literacy will be able to do that and if we plan it

properly, if we implement it properly and honestly, we will make it. It's not difficult. It's our opportunity. That's all. &gt;&gt; Okay. Can I have uh just one or two

slides to complete uh as call to action. Okay. Uh we'll make it very quick. U no okay. Okay. Perfect. Then uh that's &gt;&gt; yeah

what I want to understand how can that happen because

That's what I said. India not everywhere else
