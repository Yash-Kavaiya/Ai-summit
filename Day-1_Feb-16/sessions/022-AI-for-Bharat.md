## 📝 Transcript

believes that the AI of Bharat or Indian AI will be created by deeply technical founders. So um one of the things that we saw repeatedly over the last two years is that traditionally company

building um in in everywhere in the world but in India particularly used to happen like this. There has there used to be business CEO founders like us uh who would find a great tech co-founder

to pawn into our idea um and then we would start building something to working backward from a problem and a use case. the new AI companies that are being

built everywhere in the world and I'm starting to see this happen in India and that's our entire thesis are actually being built technology forward where it's actually two nerds or techies uh

who are hacking away uh using the latest you know uh claude bot or gold bald or you know latest cloud release without necessarily knowing which problem they are going to solve. As they are

tinkering and hacking away, they end up building something that is extremely interesting and unique, economically viable and then they marry it with a particular a lot of optimism and there's

going to be a lot of optimism in the head to come. I'm going to do a 30 secondond of reality check if you let me &gt;&gt; of course uh because everybody's building AI agents I saw everybody's uh

hands go up. I think the reality and as much as I agree with about technical founders and I think everybody's becoming technical now I have CAS in my company who are saying that

you think of yourself as a research I think they're all kind of gravitating in that zone but uh this country this country is of excess whether it be of excess to be on the stage whether it

be excess to be in this room whether it be excess to be in this &gt;&gt; access I thought access. So while I think great products will be

built, while I think lot of technical capabilities, I think we should not dish down the fact that go to market or how will you reach your customers? I think that will always be very very important.

Just a small example from our journey. We tried to build a lot of AI for the last 12 months. Nothing nothing sir nothing sir you get about 10,000 smallmemes across Africa South Asia

Middle East and these SMMES then essentially go and do like education consulting credit housing all of those things that you're talking about and they do it via us

and nothing stuck but the moment we essentially integrated it on top of WhatsApp things started to fly off very very quickly so I think yes we we want to be a sovereign AI nation I agree with

everybody's sentiment and the room people are building their own AI but I think it will not hurt us If we we borrow what is already out there. If we work with these large corporations,

borrow what is already out there. We work with these large corporations.
