## 📝 Transcript

on the stage, but we encourage you to keep your thoughts together, your observations and comments. We're hoping to make sure that last 10 minutes we open the floor up for these

conversations as well. &gt;&gt; Okay. Um can can we request all our panelists to please stand up for a second for a group picture and then we'll get into the conversation.

Thank you. Thank you so much. Um, am I audible at the back? Thank you. Okay. Um, can I request Mr. Arvind Kumar the director general of software technology

parks of India to please share with us his opening comments. The context that we set here is the government's largest incubator seed funer. They're the ones who are taking innovation to tier 2 tier

three cities. U the way we're going to do this is all the panelists and all the speakers on the dash will make twominut opening statements and then we'll pose very specific questions for them. Over

to you sir. Uh good morning. So those who are not familiar with STPI just 2 minutes. Uh so software technology powers of India is a autonomous body of ministry of electronics information

technology and we support uh more than 1,800 startups tech startups in the country and the best part is these all startups are from tier 2 and tier three cities.

We have 70 center across the country. Out of 70 centers, 62 centers are in tier 2, tier three cities. Apart from these centers, we have 24 center of entrepreneurship across the country and

all centers are domain specific like one maybe could be health tech, another could be for blockchain, AI. So we have such 24 centers and in 24 centers we provide all type of the support 360 60

60 two startups from their uh preidation stage two prototype to market access this is a whole journey we take we have multiple schemes of funding nurturing incubating global reach and number of

conferences where we our startup used to go. So this is what the STPI is in in terms of startup. We have multiple other works also but this is in terms of startups.

Um so now the here topic is responsible and ethical AI. Out of 1800 startup there was only initially there was only two centers dedicated to AI. Now in 3 years all center basically converted

into the AI. So you can't think any technology solution without AI. So it is our responsibility aspi to ensure that whatever solution is being developed, whatever they are doing in their uh

companies, it should be responsible, ethical, trusted and safe. there are generally u because there are uh five six panelists so I won't take much time but in a sort generally people

are confused with responsible and ethical these two are different term though interconnected uh when we say responsible and ethical

we used to call there are five terms we used to call this fast P so which is um one is fairness and then uh uh S for security, T for transparency, uh P for privacy and A for

accountability. So fairness, accountability, security, transparency and finally privacy. So these are the five terms. But when I say ethical AI, ethical AI is generally little larger

term. It is umbrella term. It is a more u generic term where CEO has the responsibility to look on the bigger things which means whether your this solution is going to envir affect

environment negatively whether this solution will uh have some disruption in the jobs. These are the bigger things which any co has to see. When it comes to ethical ci

when it comes to responsible, responsible means when you are making any solution, it should be fair. It should have fairness. Which means it should not be biased towards any cast,

religion, gender. When we say accountability, we must fix the accountability. Suppose tomorrow there is a um driverless car and something happens mis happens on the road then

who's responsible whether the algorithm who has been develop scientist who has developed the algorithm whether the company who has developed that car whether the person who has purchased

that car who's responsible so I think this accountability has to be fixed these are the few terms I will take questions I think is already in hurry please continue thank you

&gt;&gt; thank you so much Arvin Gj I don't think we could have had a better uh yes, please give him a round of applause. We couldn't have asked for a better context setting. This is also the person you go

to when you have a brilliant startup idea, when you're looking for space, when you're looking for a home for your idea. I'm so glad that we could have him and it's a privilege having you with us

on the panel and it's a beautiful segue for me to come to Mr. Ravi Aurora. Ravi Aurora is the global lead for all multilateral conversations. He leads global public policy and government

affairs for Mastercard and we're so delighted that he decided to come all the way back from Spain where he was on a flight. Ravi, I request you to make your opening statement in two minutes

and also set the context why finance and what Mastercard is really doing. Please over to you. &gt;&gt; Well uh thank you very much Suie and a real pleasure to be here with such a

very distinguished panel here. So thank you for having me. I think you certainly are a very uh trailblazer uh you know and uh it's wonderful uh to uh really be on this very topical uh you know and on

day one of uh AI summit impact summit on responsible AI for Bharat. So as Mastercard you know we are uh we've been in uh India for over 42 years now uh and part of the digital transformation

agenda of the country and uh I think that as a committed partner in that digital transformation we really it's really exciting to be here I think today in Delhi in India as part of the world's

most influential AI gathering. Now you know when we talk about artificial intelligence it has really crossed a structural threshold because it's no longer a frontier technology in pilots

and you know things of that you know it is part of critical infrastructure right and then as AI systems are shaping you know whether it is credit access welfare delivery healthcare triage language

translation payments public services the question then becomes is whether AI is governable at scale right so and when it is when you talk about scale it's only possible if there is underlying an

underpinning of trust because trust is what determines adoption and adoption is what determines impact right so in that context the AI for Bharat vision I think really represents something very

distinctive because India is positioning artificial intelligence emphasizing population scale deployment socioeconomic relevance and system level resilience right because a lot of it is

about resilience that we're going to be talking about so I think that that impact first orientation what we are seeing in India uh you know is really uh this um is is very impact you know is is

uh uh it's part of everyday life that we are using uh artificial intelligence so when we talk about success and responsible AI in Bharat it is not defined by absence of risk but by the

presence of resilience and accountability and transparency right so and I think we have a lot of livedin experiences here in India which uh drives scale diversity inclusion and it

positions bhat not only as an adopter of global norms but as a co-author of the next chapter of global AI governance so we look forward to the discussion ahead thank you

&gt;&gt; thank you Ravi u what a beautiful thought I want to bring in Mr. Ankush Saburval who's the founder and CEO of corover.ai and Bharat GPT. A huge round of applause for Ankush

and he's actually the co-author of India's dreams for giving us our own sovereign AI. Over to you Ankush please. &gt;&gt; So so so great to hear from Arvin and Ravi. So when I was 20s I used to think

the young people are very smart and why the all the leaders are old age people and now I'm 43 and I think even 20 years old people are smarter and of course 50 plus years guys are smarter and I'm the

dumbest so but I think good thing about me is I keep learning and that's why uh we are able to uh deliver something really great. I could I would have never imagined we would produce something

where a billion plus users would use because I never uh probably gave so much importance to my dreams and my visions. I was I was thinking you know let's let's see where we can help society and

but but I was smart enough to know if I help society society the society would help us build it. So I think yeah so uh the previous session was very interesting to become you know AI users

to AI creator. I urge everyone who is here I think you can hear all of these uh my gan or whatever on YouTube since you are here uh today I met just outside the hall founder of automation anywhere

mah shukla I met him earlier I follow him so all the great minds are here right just get inspired to be the creator it's very easy now to become the creator I always sees see AI users are

three kind of users one is the end users you use YouTube, you use YouTube, by the way, is the best AI app. I was just telling the previous session, right? You don't know you're using AI, but it's an

AI. It tells you what you need. You YouTube knows better than you. You yourself you know about yourself, right? So, so, so one is we become the user. We don't have to think it'll come to you

through us. Knowingly, unknowingly, you'll use it. The second is building the AI platform. So, few techies and PhDs would build it. If you are in that field, you do it. But it's very very

lowhanging and easy to create AI applications. Whatever field you are in uh just understand your domain well. So forget about the noise for more chaos. Go go go understand your domain first

and then see go very deep. See where are the gaps where are the opportunities. Now see where you fit your AI in to achieve your purpose. Not some India AI's purpose or not the um you have to

prove India is the best. We would be best. We are the best in many aspects or let's not get into that race. you see how you can be better in your own field and we have all the tools, all the

resources to uh make you make us win. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you so much Ankush. Very inspiring and such an important takeaway. Um let's

go to the field. Let's get inspired. This is not just India's AI impact summit. We're talking about bringing the world. We're looking at global frameworks. Let's get down and get our

hands dirty and look at putting where our putting our money where our mouth is. Look at some very important questions on energy security, food security. I want to bring in one of the

youngest and brightest voices in the room, Mr. Vive Raj. Uh he's the chairman and CEO of Panama Corporation. He has over 42,000 hectares under cultivation. He has about six global patents and he's

making sure that uh the next generation is fed on clean food and he's working for all uh people progress and planet. Vive over to you two minutes and then uh we will come to our right. Yes.

&gt;&gt; Hi, good morning. Uh uh good morning everyone. &gt;&gt; Could you hold the mic a little closer? &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Hi. Hi. Good morning everyone and thanks

for making me a part of this estim panel on AI global summit. I am chairman and CEO of Panama Corporation. Uh I'm a farmer and I love farming. Today I want to talk about agriculture. Uh the

agriculture is a sector which has been ignored uh by all the world leaders. They make beautiful policies but nothing comes in uh in in in real sense into the uh actual when it comes to actual

farming. uh you need food every four to five hours in a day and it is such a important uh uh sector but still it gets less than 5% of the uh AI investments globally.

So I started this farming company in the year 2016. Uh we have been doing research in AI agriculture since 2016 and filed various patents written international journals and have been

running successful pilot projects. We are at a turning point in agriculture. For the for the last decade, vertical farming has focused primarily on optimizing photosynthesis, maximizing

plant growth through red and blue LED lighting, controlling nutrients and climate precision. This was allowed us to grow leafy greens efficiently. But we are honest that was only the first

chapter. The next chapter is far more complex. As we h as we move forward value fruing crops like berries, medicine plants, saffron and specialty produce, we encounter a deeper

biological challenge. Pollination. Pollination is not simply a natural process. It is an economic bottleneck. Without efficient pollination, yield

consistency drops, fruit quality declines and commercial scalability becomes limited. This is what Panama Cop under it subsidiary Panama Idaho X has done successful pilot projects and filed

patents. Recent innovations such as control airflow based pollination systems being developed in advanced research environments demonstrate that we must move forward much beyond

traditional thinking. Instead of importing bees or deploying robotics alone, we must engineer ecosystems. Artificial intelligence now allows us to model microclimates, simulate

environmental cues, regulate air flow patterns, and measure plant response in real time. AI is no longer just optimizing growth. It is beginning to replicate biological systems inside

controlled environments. At Panama Hydrox, we believe the future of indooring is not about growing plants. It is about designing intelligent ecosystems where light spectrum

engineering airflow precision sensor networks and airdriven climate control work together to enable natural biological functional indoor farming. This is evolution of agriculture from

control environment farming to controlled ecosystem engineering. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you so much Vic. What an amazing journey. We're really hoping for great things to come and of course

it matters because we need it every four hours. Thank you for sharing. Uh with that I come to Professor Nitin Sakena. He's the head of the Vadwani school of AI and intelligence systems at IIT Kpur.

I come from Uttar Pradesh. I was born in Lucknau. If we were a country, we'd be the fifth largest country in the world. We understand the value of opportunity of bridging conversations between

academia and industry. Take it away Nathan. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Hello. Thank you for this uh opportunity to be here and I thank all the audience who are sitting and

especially the ones who are standing here. Um so many good points have been made. I'll just be quick about uh the points which are still missing. So since I come from academia and I now I'm the

dean of a new school in ITK. So uh one confusion that policy makers usually have is uh that we want that India should be doing research in AI more and more um and through research good things

will happen. Uh that is not quite true in this in this new world uh in this new area of AI because so traditional research is not enough. So what actually uh is needed is slightly

different and uh others have basically said that uh the mindset which is required is the mindset of a startup. So it's not that you hire more professors and you hire more PhD students and you

form a group that will do research but what is actually needed is each professor's lab should be should have the mentality of of a startup. So which means many things which means that uh it

should be a dynamic group. It should look at the utility of the research. It should look at uh a profit model. So whatever is happening, whatever is being created, there should be a client for it

and there should be a agency, government agency or a client uh who is willing to pay for it. So so that mentality is actually very different from what uh Indian universities currently have or

traditionally what they have had. Uh so we have been moving in that direction. We have been making some changes in ITK and we have been trying to bring this startup spirit in AI research because

without that uh whatever promises are being made they cannot be fulfilled. Uh so AI research is not really fundamental research. It's something more to do with as was also pointed out in other uh

panel comments that u uh it is to do with uh identifying problems in your core area and see whether AI can be used to uh get more insight. And while you do it, you have to be aware that the

intelligence of AI is inherently jagged, which means that it'll make mistakes and it will not have guarantees. So this is not a guaranteed tech. It's a tech which is uh statistical.

So sometimes it fails, many times it works, but when it fails, you actually don't know why it fails. And when it works, it works because you are being lucky. So it has that jagged uh behavior

which is why you cannot use it to actually run uh autonomously cars and especially planes or do medical treatment. So there has to be somebody who is an expert and who takes

responsibility for this. So this is very important and in the in the setting of India u another thing which is important is that it has to be frugal so that people can actually use it. It it should

be utilitarian. it should be frugal and uh yeah so uh so with the startup mentality in universities what we are moving towards I think is uh like PhDs and MTech thesis they should be now

awarded based on products so instead of just publications and research it should more be at least there should be an option of awarding them based on products

&gt;&gt; thank you &gt;&gt; so I think my time is up thank you &gt;&gt; uh no I I think you've left so much for us to think about and opened up uh new frameworks. Please give him a round of

applause and um I want to come with that conversation to in taking this from India to Bharat. I want to give you Miss Tripat Takur who's been not just a DGP

DG of NTPI she's the first woman vice chancellor of UTU a university in Uttakand I've just come from her amazing campus she's a formidable woman leader who's putting the conversation between

upskilling between preparing India's future um she's investing a lot in growing technical frameworks and making sure that AI reaches the unreached and the most underserved communities. Uh

very very rich background. Over to you ma'am for your opening comments. &gt;&gt; Thank you Shubi and thanks for the opportunity. Thanks to all the people who are standing and uh this shows that

how important is the AI summit. Only thing which I want to say in this as a opening remark uh I worked with uh as a director general national power training institute which is the AEX body for

training and capacity building. So when I started that journey I was also the first women DG in NPTI also in the uh 60 years of beginning of NPTI. So when we were moving in the power sector still we

know that we are number third in the world as far as uh generation capacity is concerned but in 78 years we achieve this 500 gawatt and we want to double this capacity within 20 years. So uh

this is possible only with the help of technology and we were trying to uh put digitalization in every aspect of the value chain of the power sector but we also know that we have to make our

system cyber resilient. It's a critical infrastructure needs lot of cyber resilience as well. So we started lot of training program and when I joined as a UTU my responsibility is more than

double because we need to prepare manpower who will work with the industry very closely and I have worked uh and I have realized that there is a huge gap between still between academia and

industry. So how to uh fill this gap how to produce the manpower which are suitable especially in this era where everything is changing with the impact of AI. So there is a need to make AI

compulsory courses rather than elective courses. So I'm very sure AICT will take initiative very soon like they have made environmental as a core subject in every engineering discipline. They will make

AI and especially when uh this session is very important. Thanks Shubi for designing this because this is the time when we need to speak about ethics and this ethics responsibility shall begin

with the students who have enter into engineering field. So a lot of challenges and I'm very sure that with the this kind of environment where we are in Bharat is not taking technology

which is 20 years old. it is working, developing, training, reskilling at the right time when everyone is participating in this. Thank you. Looking forward.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you so much ma'am. And I'm so delighted that we have leaders like you who will take this conversation from India to Bhat. I'm very very hopeful that when policy, academia,

government um it's intent, it is action which is working in cohesion to make sure magic happens and that's what we're solving towards which brings us to a very very important stakeholder. Um Dr.

Arvin Kumar, India needs not just AI models but AI ecosystems. you know with your experience as the director general of STPI software technology parks of India you've also been on the other side

of the table as a regulator with TRI which is the telecom authority of India and telecom's journey in India has been incredible how do you see this ecosystem how what is it that you're doing at STPI

what is it that you see happening in the corridors of power how is it that India solving for things differently over to you Please. &gt;&gt; Um thank you Sui. Uh so

uh if you see the whole u maybe last 500 years there are three big revolution. First revolution came in the form of electricity u is the life.

Second came in the form of internet information symmetry access will inclusive growth and third this revolution is in terms of AI. Uh the difference is here now uh government is

all with you. I mean first time otherwise generally you leave any new technology uh to the companies let them work private companies private company's job at IIT's job it is this job but now

first time government is with all innovators the we have created the AI mission which is supporting all pillars of the AI whether it is you need u compute you need some support for

developing application you need support for uh LLMs you need support for foundation model you need support for creating rappers. Every support is being provided by the uh government. In fact,

government this model of uh democratizing compute facility is a unique to India and many country wants to um copy it. But they want how how you are able to do it. We are providing more

than 38,000 GPU for the innovators for uh at very very subsidized rate to uh our country. I mean this one big thing which we are going to do. uh similarly we are uh providing full support to LLM

models like Bharat GPT is one of them and then foundation model we are supporting. So government is always with innovators providing all types of the support all layers are being uh

supported in this uh and then a lot of uh uh startup is also working. In fact AI is not something which is new. Uh I did my engineering uh 30 years back at that time there was a paper on AI. In

fact uh if I remember when I appeared in the engineering services the question was short comment on AI but so but what is new now is um uh is that now we have lot of data at that time we were just

talking about the AI neural network this network that are theory we were not able to understand because we can't feel it now we can feel it because we have lot of data and the biggest advantage of

India is that we have 1.4 billion so this data of 1.4 4 billion now this opportune time to capitalize it. So you need three things for AI. One is compute facility. Another is data and third is

algorithms which is your logical thinking. I think we always been good in logical thinking. When this Y2K problem came we have developed such a big IT IT industry. Today we have more than 200

billion US dollar export from ITI it services. So we always we are not uh like western world where you create a model 3 years you take to create a model then you solve it. We directly solve it.

This kind of the cap capability we have. So this is the right time this is the right time for India to um uh to lead the world from the front when it comes to AI.

&gt;&gt; Thank you so much Arvin. We are so happy that we're in very very safe hands and we've got the full might of the government backing our dreams and aspirations. With that I come to you

Ravi. Ravi you have a global charter. You look at different geographies. You look at how things are happening across the world. Uh trust in AI isn't just a policy goal. It's a technical and

operational requirement for global networks to function. It is also stability in policy that ensures that we get investments in a country. For a platform like Mastercard which operates

at the intersection of billions of transactions. How do you practically embed responsible AI into your core at Mastercard and products as well as processes and what's the message for

people building in India? &gt;&gt; Great. Well, thank you very thank you very much Fubby. You know, so as you mentioned Mastercard, we are a you know payments technology company right now.

Uh we are operating in over 210 countries, territories. We process over 180 billion transactions every year, right? And in 150 different currencies uh around the world every day, every

single minute, you know, transactions are taking place, right? Why are and and for all of that to happen the underlying imperative is trust because you have to trust uh you know the mechanism of

payments. Today digital has transformed our country here in India also tremendously and taken a big leap forward. Right? So the underpinning is trust and then I think like for us I

think you know AI when I look at it is not some is something I think for the over the you know before it became really a very very big buzz um for us it has been foundational probably over the

last two to three decades in day in and day out from fraud fraud solutions technology that we embed you know dayto-day right because at the end of the day how do we leverage and harness

uh you know these models uh in order for betterment of society, right? How do I get how do we get uh small leaseold farmers better access uh to um products and solutions and services, better data,

right? And better pricing for their product. How do I unlock for women entrepreneurs, how do we make sure that it is not we are talking not only about inclusion or financial inclusion, we are

talking about financial health because financial health is what is important. Inclusion means you get somebody into the fold. Health is only comes when there is resilience and longer term

sustainability and and there is a repeat factor involved. So that and we wantmemes to be healthy. We wantmemes to be able to plug into global supply chains you know from every part of the

the the country. All of that requires you know um us when we talk when when we embed AI it is you know not aspirational it is very operational in day-to-day what we do and it's responsible AI. So

and and we are governed by a very uh you know very stringent set of uh governance and tech principle. you know, as I was driving in this morning and looking at all of the uh you know, big u uh posters

with prime honorable prime minister's messages around AI and this summit you know everything that I think we take as foundational in terms of uh our principles resonated with me right you

know because we talk what is responsible what is needed as we build products and solutions and services is we need to be there needs to be security and privacy Right. Best-in-class security, trust and

transparency. How do we collect your data? How do we share data? We firmly believe at Mastercard that you own your data. You are responsible for how you uh you have the right to say how it should

be used. Our job is to protect it, right? And you know there needs to be accountability when we are talking about AI. There needs to be a robust governance program with proper controls.

Uh we have to minimize bias. There needs to be fairness. It needs to be a human- centric design. These are core principles that at Mastercard, you know, when we talk about inclusivity by

design, a human and there needs to be social impact because how do we take data and technology to make a positive impact to communities. So that is really what we are focused on at Mastercard and

how in every product service solution that our teams are working on. Uh we make sure that it is all responsible and ethical AI because and I think what we need see as the big opportunity going

forward is this intersection about you know between public and private right that dialogue and harmonization is needed in terms of standard regulatory harmonization. So where inclusion and

innovation kind of reinforce each other rather than competing with each other. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you so much Ravi. And I'm so glad that the financial architecture is absolutely safe. He's

also given you core principles when you decide to build your business. I'm so glad that Ravi is joined by his team. They have four more sessions. They have a very active AI garage and we are so

happy that they partner with InMobi. They partner with us at Tata Suns and they've created a free for for all use kit which is an MSME toolkit that's talking about how do you make sure your

businesses are safe they are looking at practicing responsible AI I'm so glad that we could have him join us with that I come thank you thank you so much Ravi with that I come to Ankush and Ankush as

we discussed is building both a core AI he's also the co-founder of bar GPT Ankush Korova has built conversations traditional AI systems they are used at scale in India. What are the biggest

real world risks that you you've encountered in deploying AI for citizens at scale? &gt;&gt; I don't think I have encountered any risk and we have any risk. uh it's just

about uh I think okay I think I think the the current risk is um not being defocused not having FOMO not being uh you know uh get diluted uh from our

vision from so much um chaos around the world right I um agree I kind of based on uh the farmer here. Uh good to see this attire you know farmer and cavier. So we have some kind of stereotyping

which is wrong. See I think if you see I think agriculture is one of the oldest um field sector I'm not sure that that called as industry or not it is one of the oldest sector isn't it from mankind

maybe hunting and all that that never became the sector but agriculture was one of the uh early revolutions I would say right so now if you think did we solve all the problem of agriculture did

we solve because that is core right these Many things are secondary. Travel, entertainment, maybe education also, maybe healthcare also if you believe in God,

right? So I think food, food is important, right? And we have not solved all the problem of food. See, still someone has to saw the seed, nurture it, harvest it, transport it, cut it, clean

it, cook it, eat also. Right? and and I don't understand u why uh people right so the serial entrepreneur staff and jumping from one to another and one

company or many companies you see they have launched some product a month ago and now they're launching another product after one month they launch another product why did so whatever you

launched 3 months ago so has has that been scaled has then been perfected has that created an impact I I think it's all the risk which I perceive so far. I'm not so much diluted but I think that

is the risk I think. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much Ankush for drawing our focus on things that truly matter. And Vive u of course whenever you go to a room you uh surprise the room you also

inspire the room you operate at the intersection of AI climate resilience and food systems. What where is it that you're seeing the next movement for Panama Corporation? What does

responsible AI actually look like and how do you see using AI in pharma and farming? How are things changing for you? What is the message that you want this room to go away with?

&gt;&gt; Yeah. I want to uh tell uh &gt;&gt; Vive could you hold the mic a little close? Thank you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Regarding farming, if you talk about being responsible AI, uh let me

take you inside one of our control environmental farms at 5:30 in the morning. There is no sunrise inside, no soil, no changing weather, just rows of vertical crops growing under calibrated

light. In that silent space, thousands of decisions, thousands of decisions are being made every second. Humidity ades slightly. Nutrient composition changes every second because the plant has

entered a new growth stage. Irrigation pauses because the roots have absorbed enough oxygen. All of this is guided by AI. Now here is the reality. If the AI makes a wrong

decision, we do not lose a spreadsheet. We lose an entire crop cycle. We lose farmer income. We disrupt supply chains. We affect food on someone's table. In agriculture, responsible AI is not

philosoph. We cannot afford block blackbox systems. Every recommendation must be explainable to the farm operator. Every sensor must be calibrated and verified.

Every model must be tested across multiple crop cycles. We validate outcomes continuously. AI supports human judgment. It does not replace it. For us, responsible AI begins with clean

data, reliable hardware, transparent lo logic, and constant monitoring. It means building systems that are predictable, resilient, and sustainable. When a farmer who once depend entirely on

uncertain monsoons can grow 365 days a year with minimal crop loss, that is responsible AI in action. It is not about compliance alone. It is about food security, climate resilience and

economic stability on our farms. Responsibility means ensuring that on any given day families on families can depend on safe and consistent food. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you so much Vive. Um it

firmly puts a spotlight on what are the issues at stake, where the risks are and what is it that we're really solving for. A very deeply humbling moment. With that I come to you Tripa G. As someone

who's worked deeply in power systems and smart grids, how do you see AI changing critical infrastructure? What does responsible deployment mean in such a high-risisk sector and how do you see

that translating into education and learning training too? &gt;&gt; Thank you. Very apt question. We all know that how critical infrastructure especially power is very important. But

we have seen that with this technology AI penetration our grid is changing. It is becoming smart and uh instead of becoming deterministic it is predictive. So this is very important for us because

we all know that world is facing two major challenges. One is energy security. The second one is environmental concern and both the challenges have one solution that is

more and more renewable energy. So we are going we are again number third in the world as far as installed capacity of renewable capacity is concerned. We have met our target very early. So with

this renewable which is unpredictable in nature, we really need to integrate in the grid and for that purpose the AI is going to help us a lot for making our grid very very efficient and we can

incorporate the system integration issues which can arise because of the renewable energy penetration into the grid. Also this AI is going to help us for not waiting for the fall to occur

but before the fall we could predict the fault and remove the fault and so our grid in future will become self-healing grid. So this AI uh but again as we are going for smart meter everywhere in

distribution sector which is the weakest link in the value chain but we are in uh improving our distribution sector and we have a smart meter everywhere. So we are giving the tool to the every consumer.

So it's very important that we have to have very responsible consumer. We have to have cyber resilient team which is working there uh and we need to have experts who can solve anything comes

across as mentioned uh by professor from IIT Kpur that we need to prepare that if model fails what happens. So like in financial sector we cannot say that we are going to use in electricity sector

black box. We need to understand what is happening. Our need engineers need to understand what is happening for load management because electricity sector is all about matching demand and supply. So

our engineer need to understand how we are going to uh design the flexibility into the system. How we are going to design the demand response load forecasting. So our engineers are not

going to replace by AI but certainly an engineer which does not understand AI are going to replace by others. So we this AI is not going to improve our efficiency but it is going to help as a

very important sati in the entire value chain of electricity sector. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you so much Tupta G. Um it's very important to note that India

is one of the third largest attack nations when it comes to critical infrastructure. Every single day we lose value, we lose uh critical functionalities and there are frameworks

that are being worked upon and which is why I want to bring in uh one of the foremost scientists, researchers, academicians who's also a philosopher in his own right to do the closing comments

on the panel. Um, Nitan, which parts of the AI stack, data standards, benchmark models are most critical to standardize for reusability while preserving local context and we've also been solving for

the global south. You have various initiatives that you pioneer and champion. U please do share your views. &gt;&gt; Yeah, thank you. Um so the most important aspect that uh Indian agencies

I mean since we work on so many products for them we build products for them uh what in my experience the most important parameter or the thing to change is the data standard. So data since not all the

uh state governments, local bodies even central government ministries and departments since uh they are not completely digitized most of the time what we see is uh uh since the

digitization is not complete or it's not very advanced just shifting directly to AI tools is not easy. Uh it may it is actually impossible. It doesn't give any further

efficiency. Uh so data standard is very important. Uh if a department or if your organization wants to use AI um the only way I mean first of all it is not clear whether AI will help you. So you have to

first understand whether it is going to improve your profit margins your cash flow. So so because the measure of your uh of the the basically whether AI will help you has to be decided in a

utilitarian way. It is not for uh it is not it should not be a status symbol that you are using AI uh but it should be on actual grounds. So for that data standard is very important. Um and the

other thing is that for the AI algorithm itself or AI tools itself they get better only when there is enough data. So it is not just that you want to use it but it's also that AI want to AI is

very data hungry. Uh so for example chat sheet uh magic. So when the model is trained that magic starts happening only when the when it has seen around 100 billion to 1 trillion words. So at 1

billion 10 billion 100 billion magic is not there. The magic only happens when it goes beyond 100 billion words of training. So something happens there. The architecture is very big. It has one

trillion parameters and those parameters actually at that point they learn enough so that they can surprise you. So you can ask you can give any prompt and it gives you answers which are surprisingly

uh intelligent. So that magic can be achieved only when the data is enough and there is a standard and uh when the training is enough and then you have to validate it. Uh do I have more time or

&gt;&gt; that's it. I think that does it. &gt;&gt; Okay. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Yes Ravi. Sure. Sure. I think you know you mentioned about global south and uh you know I think one of the things that

comes to my mind is that uh you know uh the whole India's AI for Bharat vision it is uh you know kind of reframing responsible AI away from abstract principles to a very infrastructure-led

deployment right and I think that that positions India to lead by demonstration &gt;&gt; rather than regulation export you know And I think what India is showing that instead of prescribing rules up front,

India is showing how trust, safety, accountability can be embedded into real world systems which are handling billions of transactions. Right? So many global south countries are facing very

similar constraints because they're large population, limited regulatory capacity, linguistic diversity, right? And this approach is more replicable the what is happening in India than an EU

style you know kind of regulatory density or US style marketled governance. So I think in multilateral forums what we are seeing is that the India model is increasingly bridging

this gap between the global north and the uh you know developing country realities and I think that I think it is offering a very pragmatic way forward in terms of governance and I think

obviously uh you know all of these principles that we talked about in you know uh that all the panelists have touched on um are are very foundational to how um We'll continue to grow in

scale. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you so much Ravi for making my job easier. I want to thank this room first. I know a lot of you stood up and that on a Monday morning

tells you why this is such a pressing issue. Why you showed up? I really want to thank all my panelists for enriching this conversation and when before you leave what is really at stake it's

trust. If we do not trust if we do not build trust. So while there are many many countries that have solved for trust in manufacturing they've created green channel corridors. What is India

building which is so special I'm not so worried about our products at scale when 1.4 billion people decide to build something there is nobody in the world that can stop us. What we are solving

for is this conversation should not be concentrated in metros in urban cities and therefore this is so important that you have such a diverse set of stakeholders in this room present. You

have voices from academia. You have voices from someone who works with the World Bank has trained young women is creating a double ahead program. You have a farmer who surprised all of you

by telling you that the modern fields do not look like what they used to. Their silent rooms and any little bit of tinkering is not just going to impact spreadsheets. It's going to impact real

food on the table. You have somebody who's been at the foremost of regulation policy unlocks. As a policy professional, it is my dream to have someone who's like Arvin Gi. You know

why that matters? You want someone with an open door. You have someone with whom you can brainstorm things. You want someone who can build capacity for you. And you want someone who puts public

interest, public consultation at the heart of public policy which is what is happening today at Matei at the India mission. I don't think any of us would have been together in this room without

Shri Abishek Singh, without our formidable prime minister who loves technology, who understands technology like nobody's business and our secretary Shri Krishnan who's unlocking an entire

ecosystem in manufacturing in India. You've got someone like Ravi who makes policy um uh feel like music. He makes it smooth. He makes it so so engaging that he's building a next generation of

policy professionals. You've got a brilliant startup and ecosystem founder in Ankush who's made sure that our aspirations are not limited to India. As a young 20-year-old, I'm not sure what

was going on, but you managed to unlock talent. You managed to not give up. And I say this in uh particular reference because being an entrepreneur is a very lonely journey. You've got two of them

from very different sectors who are telling you what's possible in India and I'm so glad that we've got someone like Professor Nitin Sakena on the panel. Uh some of my most inspiring moments

insights have come from brilliant teachers and in India that's why I want to bring this conversation to a close towards a responsible AI framework. Knowledge has always been dialogic. You

would ask a question and your teachers would give you answers which is what is happening at IIT Kpur, which is happening at his school, which is what is happening in the projects that India

is inspiring. Um, in our world, we like to say sunlight is the best form of disinfectant. When we ask for transparency and accountability, we not do not ask for black boxes. We ask for

explainable standards in AI when we are looking for responsible AI which is what this panel decided to bring for you today. Uh we have time for one question. Um yes the gentleman in the front

quickly identify yourself. Ask a very short question please sir. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah you can you can take this. You &gt;&gt; please identify yourself and tell us who

you would like to. &gt;&gt; So I am Dr. Jane from DR. work in rocket sciences. So my question is to professor Nathan Sakan. In fact I appreciate his viewpoint that the academics should go

to the products &gt;&gt; we request the people at the back to &gt;&gt; my question is that you said there is a one% of uncertaintity when AI is giving answer. So when it comes to the medical

diagnostics or engineering simulation how do you take it's a confidence where we need 100%. So what is &gt;&gt; thank you thank you sir thank you for your question and thank you for all the

exceptional work at the professor saxa. Yeah. So the the solution for that is simple. Ultimately the reports have to be signed by a doctor who is a who is a human being and who is a professional

experienced professional. Uh it cannot be unsigned report. So whatever happens in the background is just more uh data faster analysis but then ultimately the responsibility lies with an experienced

professional. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you so much. I want the room to please bigger give a huge round of applause to all our panelists and to yourselves for being so patient and for

such an engaging audience. Yes, can I please ask you to do the honors? Um and may I request all our planners to please step forward for a group picture. Thank you.
