## 📝 Transcript

S on. hard. Okay. Time start. Is this your man?

We love you. I don't need everybody. Yes. Yes,

we got to I would again like to request all the invitees and attendees who were attending the prior session to kindly vacate the room. We do not have space

for our invitees. table. Table Don't Ladies and gentlemen, can I have your attention? The next session will start

in 5 minutes. Whoever who all have not registered for the session can join the respective sessions. Thank you. Everybody, I'll again request those who

had been attending the prior session to kindly vacate. We do not have space for our invitees to sit. We request cooperation from all of you. We are about to begin our next session.

Our panelists are already here. I would request those who had been attending the prior session to kindly please vacate for our invitees and guests. Don't worry.

All the panelists of this session are kindly requested to come for the photo session. Be careful guys. Leave it here. Nice.

I don't know. Good morning ladies and gentlemen. A very warm welcome to this session at the India AI impact summit 2026. One of the most significant gatherings

advancing the AI agenda across the global south. Rail Corporation of India Limited, a nervy PSU under the Ministry of Railways is privileged to organize today's panel discussions. As a national

digital infrastructure provider, Rail plays a pivotal role in enabling secure, scalable and inclusive digital connectivity across India. Through these sessions, Real Tech is proud to

contribute to the national and global dialogue on harnessing artificial intelligence for public good, particularly in the domain of healthcare. To formally commence the

proceedings, it is my honor to invite the chairman and managing director of rail corporation of India Limited, Shri Sanjay Kumar, a 1992 batch IRSC officer with over three decades of experience in

signaling and telecom. associated with rail since 2002. He has been central to its growth, strengthening initiatives such as the national knowledge network and leading the expansion of nationwide

fiber data center and ICT services. May I request you sir to kindly deliver the inaugural address. Please welcome him with a big round of applause.

Good morning everyone present here respected Shri Akma general manager Northern railway I'm privileged to host you sir here today morning I'm also privileged to have uh Dr.

Bernoval uh as a panelist. So welcome him as well. All distinguished delegates, panelists and participants.

I extend my sincere thanks to the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology and India AI mission for entrusting rail with the responsibility of curating these two important panel

discussions at the AI summit 2026. The central message of this summit is both simple and powerful. AI must create real and measurable public impact.

Innovation alone is not enough. Artificial intelligence must strengthen institutions, improve service delivery and enhance everyday lives of citizens. Healthcare represents one of the most

important meaningful area where this impact can be realized. AI has the potential to improve disease surveillance, support early diagnosis, enhance clinical

decision making, optimize hostile operations, and enable populations size health planning. However, technology by itself does not guarantee transformation.

It must rest on secure digital infrastructure, responsible data governance, interoperability of across systems and above all public trust. Our first panel

will focus on how collaboration can strengthen public health systems. AI become impactful when various responsible agents work together in a coordinated framework. Public health

challenges require collective solutions. The second panel will address an equally important dimension that is of inclusion. AI solutions must work across urban and

rural geographies across primary health centers and tertiary hospitals and across all socioeconomic segments. The technology must bridge health care

gaps, not widen them. Affordability, accessibility, and ethical safeguards must remain central to deployment. Together, these discussions aim to translate the summit's theme into

practical pathways aligning policy, infrastructure, and innovation to deliver scalable and inclusive healthcare outcomes. Before I hand you off to the esteemed

panels, let me set the context with Rail's vision and perspective. Rail has evolved from a connectivity and data center service provider into a

comprehensive solutions organization. Health has been one of our key focus areas where we have successfully executed few marquee projects such as hospital management information system

implementation on 700 plus railway hospitals and one similar project we have done for Brhan Mumbai Corporation hospitals network. At the same time, we recognize the remarkable contributions

of our Indian business associates that those are developing world-class healthcare solutions and addressing niche yet highly impactful challenges. Rail's strategy is to collaborate with

these make in India technologies offering integrated solutions that strengthen public health in India and extend to emerging economies. With that I declare the floor open to our esteemed

panelists to take this important conversation forward. Thank you Jahind. Thank you sir for those inspiring words. Ladies and gentlemen, we now move to panel discussion session one. This

discussion brings together imminent leaders from public health, digital innovation and policy. And it is my privilege to introduce our distinguished panel. As I announce their names, may I

respectfully invite each of our esteemed panelists to kindly come forward and take their seat on the das. Because of some emergency, Sri Prashant warrior could not come today. In his

place, we have with us Shri Ankit Modi, founding member and chief product officer Cure.ai. May I request you sir to kindly come forward and take your seat on the dice.

Shri Sunil Kumar Banwal CEO National Health Authority. He leads the implementation of Aayosh Man Bharat and India's National Digital Health Infrastructure. I request you sir to

kindly come forward and take your seat. Dr. Anuba Gupta, Professor Triple Delhi. Her work focuses on machine learning applications in healthcare technologies. Ma'am, please come up on the stage.

Vijuija Navaluri, co-founder and chief customer officer, Supervitti AI, a global voice in enterprise AI transformation and population scale impact.

Dr. Yan Filbert and Seni Mana, Chief Digital Advisor, Africa CDC. He leads continental initiatives on digital health systems and data governance across Africa.

A truly outstanding lineup of experts shaping the future of AI in healthcare. Please join me in welcoming our esteemed panel with a warm round of applause. Ladies and gentlemen, guiding this

distinguished panel is our moderator for the session. May I now invite principal executive director rail southern region Shri K Manohhar Raja to kindly come forward and take his seat on the DS. He

is one of the founding members of rail and a pioneer of digital innovation whose landmark initiatives include railwire broadband and station Wi-Fi with Google that has transformed

connectivity and value creation across Indian railways. We now move into the panel panelist discussion. I request each panelist to kindly confine their remarks to five to

six minutes. With that, I now hand over the proceedings to our moderator Sri K Manuhar Raja who will guide us through the session. Over to you sir. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Hello and good morning

everyone. &gt;&gt; Thank you. The buzz and energy in this room is palpable. I'm sure something great will come out of this. I we are very privileged to have Dr. Bernwal the

CEO of NHA amidst us. We have Jean Filbert Sangimana the chief adviser uh the chief digital adviser of Africa's uh CDC. We we have the poster child of uh make India for the world cure AI here

with Ankit Modi. We have Vijay Nogluri from Superviti who has the largest AI workforce in the world. So we have an and to represent the media we have the uh the academia sorry we have Dr. Anubag

Gupta who's has significant contributions in this area and she will balance the different perspectives. So before we dive into the proceedings, I would like to take a few minutes to

set the context and I also would like that uh we have short answers and have multiple rounds of question and answer so we can feed off each other. So I think that will bring out the best in

the panel. So public public health is always been about seeing patterns early. Who is at risk? Where are we failing? How how do we take the next action

before the crisis hits? AI can sharpen that vision. We have seen through various deployments and uh uh and PC's that AI has solved problems, can predict uh disease outages

can can do surveillance at scale, optimize resources effectively and shape public health decisions. Even from economic perspective, we have seen that if if you focus or move to an

area a paradigm of early detection and risk mitigation, we tend to have save significantly in the long-term systemic costs in our country where we have a

significant doctor patient deficit ratio ratio deficit. AI can be that force multiplier which which can enable our existing workforce to handle a large and diverse populations

with higher precision and clinical effectiveness. India has has shown what digital public infrastructure can create. UPI just did not change or modernize

payments. UPI showed the world a global reference model with ABDM and and UHI we are building the foundations for something even more transformative.

I believe that AI could be but if you compared to finance the H health is much more complex. In finance you have structured data standardized transactions and with a few parameters.

Health is probably is moving to more unstructured data probabilistic complex with hundreds of variables and highstake decisions. AI could be that layer which can build and

create capacity for high explanability, very strong governance and and the and the ability to build in very high very low risk tolerance. In fact, AI can be that layer which can

upify UHI and considering the spirit of the summit we we can get a little more a bit more ambitious and I'll leave you with this last thought for the panelists. For

decades, health innovation systems have always flowed from the west to low and middle inome countries. With with DPI that that equation has

changed. What if instead of relying on proprietary and extra extratory platforms, we are able to create a public digital infrastructure using the

best of talent and the vast data resources within our countries and create a UHI uh a UHI powered by AI with with uh intelligence

ethic with ethics. sovereign capability, population scale, health system built for and in the global south. Thank you. So I I I will leave you with this. I'll I'll start with you uh Ankit.

You know, for for a health startup in in this area, you have had an incredible journey uh establishing yourself in more than 100 countries.

What has been your journey like? What has been your learning? And how do you think that learning will help with public health? &gt;&gt; Sure. Thanks. Thanks, Mano. Uh you

touched upon a very good point uh with respect to UPI. Uh before our country could get debit and credit cards to every nuke and corner of the country, we directly hopped on to UPI which is

contactless payment that the world is still catching up to. uh similar example 20 years ago was uh before we could take landline phones to every village of the country we directly hopped onto mobile

phones. So India has a tendency of uh jumping hops when it comes to technology and uh I firmly believe that we are ready for the same hop in healthcare where AI and digitalization are going to

go hand in hand and India is going to lead the AI revolution in terms of its implementation in public health systems. Now when you look at something that is very new and uh very uh cutting edge

what we have seen is that take iPhone for examples right uh when the iPhones came for the first time they are usually limited to the uh upperence of society and then trickles down to like sort of

say upper middle class then middle class and probably never reaches the most uh neediest part of the population. With AI we are seeing the exact opposite. uh we are working with governments across the

world and even in India where we are seeing the latest cutting edge technology deployed in public health systems and directly benefiting the most needy part of the population and that

has been uh tremendous tremendous to see on the journey like when we started out in 2016 uh it was a very simple idea that if Facebook can detect images from normal photos can we build similar AI

algorithms to detect diseases from medical photos right which is where we started out on X-rays and CT scans and uh fortunately we became the first ever AI company in

the world to get published in the Lancet which is the uh most pu uh most reputed medical journal and because of that we gained a lot of trust a lot of evidence came out around that and eventually in

2021 uh who cleared us uh to be used in reading chest X-rays for tuberculosis even without a human being in the loop and we went to countries like Malawi or Timur Lee where there is zero or just

one radiologist for the entire country right we have multiple X-ray machines uh taking X-rays but just nobody to read them uh and that is where AI created its greatest impact uh screening for

tuberculosis then we expanded it towards screening for lung cancer and that also became a huge value ad we just uh completed a pilot statewide pilot with the Goa government where this AI was

deployed across the board, screened more than 200,000 people which is basically 5% of uh Goa's population and was able to detect cancers much much earlier and not only detect it also proved that the

diagnosis time was reduced by 50%. In some of these diseases 50% is life-saving. We see stories of patients every week, every month uh where an early detected cancer basically means

that the person gets to live for 10 more years, 12 more years. Also reducing the cost on the health systems because we are talking about public health systems. A cancer detected in stage one compared

to stage three or four means that the burden of treatment on the health system is much lesser. A TB detected two years earlier means that it has not spread to friends and family. uh and this there

are less patients to take care of 2 years down the line. So all of these things come together to create a great value ad uh and we have been able to like sort of deliver this not just with

AI but going beyond AI like I mean you can sit and build an algorithm but what it takes is really working with these hospital systems, public health systems and making sure they are being used

right at the edge of these uh systems to create real impact to save actual lives. Till date we have touched around four crore lives all over the world and we are on course to touching 100 crore

lives by 2030 and we are adding more products more AI capabilities towards that vision. Uh but it has been an immense uh immensely satisfying journey creating something uh out of India and

taking it across the world uh for everyone to benefit. Thank you. Thank you Ankit. Wonderful. I'll come back to you for the follow-up question later. But uh now to Dr.

Banwal. Sir, over the last 5 years, India has built one of the largest digital health public infrastructures in the world. While the infra story is phenomenal, the outcome validation story

is emerging. How do we plan to leverage AI for governance and outcomes? &gt;&gt; Yeah, thank you. Uh I think many of you may be knowing National Health Authority was created to implement world's largest

government funded health assurance program which is called Aishman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Janaroki when it was launched in 2018 it did not just implement the scheme it also

created a huge IT infrastructure for transacting all the details related to treatment of the patient including the claim settlements by the hospitals and all and that is how we have more

than 100 million patient treatment records available though not fully structured but it is there and I believe there are more and more tools coming which will actually structure this data

for usage for training of the models and also for uh doing all kinds of research including you know disease prevalence uh surveillance and this will give a lot of idea about

uh you know future course of action which AI proposes to and that is how this is one of the biggest strength India has where you have the data of more than 100 million patient and this

is not just data of one geography it whole of country completely diverse data because from every part of the country people are being treated and it truly represents

India because the beneficiary which who are covered under the schemes are bottom 40% of the country's population. So this is one big advantage we have. But more than that what was started in

2021 was very interesting uh for the country. country launched this uh man bharat digital mission and this digital mission was with a objective to create the digital public infrastructure for

the healthcare and the aim was to have a national digital health ecosystem because if we know the health sector and everyone of us interact with the health system as of

now it is highly fragmented healthcare Here you go to one hospital, you get the treatment, you have the record generated, it remains there, you carry the you know copy of the reports and you

preserve it till the time next time you have to go to another hospital. You carry that same document. So it many times doctors will like it may not may not use it. And then similarly over a

period of time you might have visited several hospitals, severalarmacies, several laboratories and might have got huge number of reports. But what did you do with that report? Could you anyway

use that report for any kind of protection for your own health? Could any be any research be done that what kind of people are getting what kind of disease in which area? which age group

has got prevalence of which kind of disease. Do we have any uh analysis done of that? I think it was very difficult because the data created was in such a form that

it did not empower the patient to to hold the whole longitudinal history of his own health. So this was first time uh being addressed through the iceman digital

mission and the whole objective is to connect these health systems. So if we keep patient in the center and the any record health record which gets generated belongs to the patient we'll

start seeing that systems must talk to each other and patient should be in the command of the record with whose consent the records can be shared. This is what the digital mission does. We have

created three registries which is you know registry of patient in the form of Abha ID. Many of you may be having today we have around 86 cr citizens having Aha ID is man Bharat health account ID. This

is the identity through which the records can travel from one system to another system keeping everything in the hand of the patient. Second registry is the registry of health facilities. So we

have hospitals, we havearmacies, we have laboratories, they don't talk to each other. So unless we have the verifiable identity of each of the facility by which they can be uniquely identified,

we will not be able to talk to each other and that is why the second registry is extremely important and that was created. As of now we have around 4.5 lakhs facilities on this registry.

Similarly, third registry which was much more important was to have a health professional registry. Health professional registry included all the doctors, nurses, paramedics, lab

technicians, allied health care professionals so that they can be uniquely verified and given identity. With these three registry what is happening is now the sharing of record

exchange of uh information is much more possible. Now with a unique identification of the patient with a unique identification of the facility and the uh professional you can actually

use it to share the record as per your wish. And now what this exchange does is it doesn't store any of the data. Data still remains with the hospital. Only thing is it it is now created electronic

health record and data is linked with the patient ID which he can see on his personal health record applications and so he gets empowered and then the exchange only has the address. It

doesn't have any storage. So it has the address it knows where the data is. So in future if we really want to develop a model and test the model you actually use the address and ask the data with

his consent actually you can leverage the health record being created across the country. So this is extremely important and this public uh digital public infrastructure probably there are

very few countries in the world which has created such infrastructure. The challenge of course lies on adoption. Many more facilities everyone has to come on the system. Patient has to

become empowered enough that they can demand their digital records. And somehow this is taking time and we need to actually collaborate to ensure that more and more records get created

electronically. They get linked to Abha ID and the patient can hold it in his mobile. So this is one. Similarly, it also opens up the possibility of having unified health interface. It was talked

that the how UPI was uh created. You see the NPCI was creating the backbone. Nobody knew that uh you know few years down the line it will become such a powerful tool in the uh you know poorest

of the people in uh living in the remotest part of the country. But it happened. Nobody had thought that point of time. But it had the digital public infrastructure in place which could

leverage this. And this is what ABDM will leverage someday when we have all the uh health facilities connected. People will have access to all the facilities using his Abha ID. Every

facility would like to be on the platform to get the visibility. Every professional would like to have the visibility to see uh have the visibility through the identity. And now tomorrow

if a patient let's say in Delhi needs a eskine specialist he doesn't have to call his relative or his friend to find out who is the best eskina specialist. He or she has to just go on the

platform. every facility will be visible and then can he or she choose nearby with available slots for the you know appointment etc and it can be leveraged for blood bank for ambulance services

and many more and I think the kind of uh you know uh uh infrastructure we have created what we need is more and more application to run on it and with AI I we are seeing huge value that if we

really use this infrastructure actually we can leverage AI to scale very fast and this uh I think uh we have started doing it on the one hand we have 100 more than 100 million data on which lot

of applications can run. We have already been using it for fraud detection and to the extent of almost 630 cr we could save in last 1 and a half years only by application of AIM ML tools to detect

anomalies against the historical data which we had. So this is the potential uh which exist in the healthcare. I'm very happy to see the kind of response uh you know the people uh present here

showing lot of interest in health care and it was said rightly in the finance sector or in agriculture uh you know application of a AI improves efficiency in a big way but the risks

are you may lose some money you may lose some crops but in healthcare uh you know it improves efficiency capacity of the professional signals. It also improves the clinical efficiency by using

technology but at the same time sensitivity is much higher. It relates to the life of the people. It has the privacy of the highest order. So with these concerns I think uh you know

responsible deployment of AI for using uh you know uh and using health data to deliver more is something uh uh uh you know opportunity as well as a challenge that how as a uh you know government or

the national health authority we will be using responsibly and allowing the AI tools to be deployed for public health delivery. One of the big thing which is happening and probably tomorrow we will

be launching it is to also develop a open benchmarking platform for health AI. We know in case of health people come with lot of AI solutions and actually they say it it has very high

efficacy but how do you know that unless it is tested against the real data set of our country and maybe even within the country the kind of uh diversity we have on different data sets. So this is where

we have developed this benchmarking platform with the help of IIT KPUR and there every AI solutions can be tested against the diverse data set sets which have not been seen by the sol uh models

before and therefore you can actually benchmark where these solutions lie. So before it is deployed at population scale, it is benchmarked and that will be the uh responsible way of actually

deploying uh AI solutions. It will build the trust. It will improve the confidence of people on using AI. else we know many times AI solutions trained on a foreign data not specific to our

context might be a misleading solutions too and therefore we are taking a big step by which we can responsibly deploy AI in healthcare and this is a challenge which we will be able to meet using our

digital health infrastructure we &gt;&gt; very very comprehensive answer thank you very Dr. Anua, while AI can do all these amazing things, it can also amplify

biases and widen inequities. So, is AI going to be the next great equalizer or is it going to be the force multiplier widening existing gaps? &gt;&gt; So, thank you so much and uh I'm really

very happy to listen to Sunil G because he touched on many points that I really wanted to emphasize in this. So first of all to be honest I wouldn't say that AI is responsible or creates inequity. What

I would say is there is an existing inequity which AI would actually potentially scale to a very large extent and how and where. So let's understand. So what do we want from healthcare

solutions? We want health care solutions which are deployable anywhere in any part of the country at any clinic or at any hospital irrespective of where it has been

developed. Now he touched on uh solutions which are built on foreign data are they really employable or deployable in our context. So we have seen that the the disease is really

specific to the biological diversity that we have in the population. So the the genomic landscape that we have, the mutational landscape that we have, they're really different for different

uh populations. The exposure to environment risk, the exposure to microbiome, they really make a difference in how uh the drug would actually respond to a particular

disease. So that really makes a difference. So that is why we say that ethnicity really matters. So do we have those sorts of curated data sets in the public domain where people are able to

build solutions. So when we come to that we really find that India is a country which is huge. We have such a diverse data set that we can collect. We are a populous country. We have variety of

like uh if if we just talk about diversity in language, eating, terrains, we have so much of diversity. So we are in a way mini word but when we talk about our data we find that the data is

unstructured fragmented not coll co coll co coll co coll co coll co coll co coll co coll co coll co coll co collated not curated not properly actually connected with each other within a hospital or

within even a small clinic one department will not be connected to another. So the entire data is scattered and we are not able to utilize. Government is funding so many projects

uh even to academia as well as hospitals and we do collaborative projects but we do find that the data are collected but they are not collated and deposited which is where the government is now

headed that we should be doing. So there is a data heterogeneity that data is not structured is not accessible. How would you build solutions which are India specific or which are specific which are

which can actually take care of this ethnicity and diversity into picture. Then the models are developed. The models are developed. They are also like one hospital would be de collecting data

at a different protocol. Another would be collecting at different protocol. So I would say for example if I just talk about MRI the research is going on since I I would say decades. But when it comes

to whether a solution developed at one place is it really deployable anywhere you will start saying no the data is collected at different dimensions. So maybe one person is collecting at 1 mm

slice thickness another is collecting at 5 mm slice thickness. So the protocols are not same machines are different. So one is collecting on seams one is collecting on 1.5 Tesla another is

collecting on three tesla machine. So your SNR is different. So many varieties and so many variabilities are there. Then India is not a rich country at least we are really progressing fast.

But when it comes to deployability of the solution in our rural areas can we really deploy those MRI scanners in PHC's then that means that we need to come up with the solutions that are also

deployable. They are low cost. They are deployable. They take care of those. So we really need to make our AI. I &gt;&gt; I think inequity is a very wide subject. So many parameters in which you play. So

we'll come back to you. Thank you for uh for this eliminating response. U Phil, I'll I'll go with you next. As the head of Africa CDC, you are an important voice for the global south. Our

countries face similar constraints, limited resources, workforce shortages, fragmented systems, etc. Do you think an AI powered public health can help you leaprog from the conventional trajectory

to the healthcare you desire? &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. Thank you. Um it's always a pleasure coming back to India and I'd like to thank uh the organizers Rail and Cure AI for uh allowing me to

participate. Um I would say that for the global south AI is not a luxury. It is a necessity.

We face big constraints. All our speakers have talked about uh fast growing population. Africa and India are talking about 1.5 billion people and increasing. We have

constraints in terms of financial resources. We have constraints in terms of human resources. And for us, AI is the opportunity not just to keep catching up to the rest of

the world, but to leaprog and potentially lead in this space. But for us to get there, there are three important things that I summarize in three eyes that we must be very uh bold

and deliberate about. Number one is infrastructure. And I'm talking here about the public digital infrastructure. This is a domain where India has shown

global leadership. Without a public digital infrastructure, we can continue to see the very beautiful pilots that are sprouting everywhere but that are not able to

scale at national level to solve problems at large scale. So previously we used to look for solutions coming from north or west coming south but this is changing. There

is this conference and the fact that we are having this conversation show that uh cooperation to solve the infrastructure that we need in the next century for health can be a south house

uh solution and collaboration. Number two is intelligence. Intelligence meaning that the one nurse that we have who serves many communities having their

intelligence in their hands can really do things that only doctors could do. So we can create a multiplier effect on on the real on the on the on the few uh resources that we have.

It is intelligence that is able to understand the local context and local languages but also the intelligence at national level to allow uh government

institutions, national public health institute, ministries of health to make informed uh decisions and optimize resource allocation.

And third eye is impact. This is what this whole summit is all about. impacting people's lives, reducing maternal mortality, reducing the time it takes to detect uh outbreaks and to

respond smartly to outbreak to deploy resources for response in a more coordinated way. So if we can partner on developing those three eyes, I think we not only catch up but we frog

and lead. And that's a call to action I'd like to put all of you. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Very illuminating Vijay. Over to you. Actually,

while a lot of AI is used for insights, I think you have a very different approach to it. You're focusing on outcomes and and that that is the holy grail of everything. So, can you tell us

how you're going going about it? &gt;&gt; Absolutely. I mean I think CMD said in the inauguration speech he spoke about outcomes right technology is there but outcomes where are they first of all

pleasure to be here um India won the match yesterday so all of us are feeling good if there were an upset but um you know our colleagues um you know my my friend

Ankit also mentioned India comes late like to quote superstar Rajni Khan we come late but we come latest right so we do things in in a different way. Um at Supervit, uh our mission was to make AI

a force multiplier for humanity, right? That's why we started the company. We do a lot of work on enterprise and governments. But when it comes to health care, like you mentioned, we think

really different. We should not need more hospitals. We should not have more doctors or medical professionals. We should have lesser patients, right? Um if we can make lesser patients, the

infrastructure can scale. So the energy and the entire if one single thing AI and all the thousand things it can do for humanity is about improving health right if you look at the impact um it

can do automate jobs a lot of us are scared about AI coming for our jobs and many things but AI is a force multiplier when it comes to things like health right we don't have enough resources we

don't have enough of anything when it comes to managing healthcare so can we move away from thinking healthcare to wellness care and like you mentioned AI can orchestrate those outcomes right um

a lot of us are you know many of us must have gone through the experience of that bad report that we get in the family that midnight hospitalization you know all of us are scared about these things

you know can AI really change it from moving from sick care to wellness care can it make the biggest impact the agentic AI it can it orchestrate the pe the the providers which are the

hospitals, the payers which are the insurance companies and the pharmas which are the you know the the medical medicine companies and most importantly the fourth one we are talking about Dr.

Sun mentioned I'm so proud to hear what India is talking about digital public infrastructure in healthcare and the kind of energy and passion that they are bringing to the to the table here that

the fourth P is going to be public infrastructure. It has to play a role if you can bring these four ecosystems together and agentic AI is the invisible orchestrator orchestrating outcomes

between the patient keeping patient in the center right that's how we see you know agentic AI and AI can really change from being um you know sick care to preventive agentic prevention as this

holy grail of healthcare &gt;&gt; oh really brother fresh air really if we can stop feeling people falling ill that's the best kind of healthare &gt;&gt; we don't need more hospitals we need

less patients right that's how we all have to start thinking and we should have um if you just can add one point there we should have like we all have civil scores for financials maybe I'll

request here um to Dr. Sunil that if we can also come with you know personal health score for every one of us. So where we can really measure where we are and have a personal AI coach which for

every Indian citizen right to and and globally eventually to drive the outcomes from the score from where we are to continuously improving the health outcomes right so these are the things I

think we should be really looking at how uh private ecosystem like us we can contribute open-source health AI command centers we can pro you know agentic AI technology and you know the DPI can

actually look at the governance of the data governance of how AI can be you know utilized across the ecosystem. So we'd love to look at some of the big ideas and socialize with them as we go

along. &gt;&gt; Thank you. We'll have another quick round. Let's let's keep our answers short and sharp. Uh Ankit I'll come back to you. You know I want to understand

now we're talking about u the health startup industry today. They have two paths. they they can take this long path of building their own models like how we all did for machine vision and or you

can work around use cases of frontier models. What are the choices? What should we do? What is in the interest of DPI? &gt;&gt; Great question uh Manov gi see for us uh

it's never about uh starting from the technology and uh then finding out the right problem statement for it. We have to always start from the problem first. What do we want to solve? Like we want

to save lives in an econom economically viable way, sustainable way. Then is like what kind of solution do we need to build for that and then what are the uh technologies required to build that

solution. So when there was no imaging AI 10 years ago, we built our own imaging AI, trained it for four or five years, core R&amp;D, acted like a core R&amp;D lab and came up with uh our chest X-ray

AI solutions. Uh last year we launched a product called IRA which is uh ambient scribing for primary healthcare centers. There again the sol question was we want to again uh empower digitization in as

fast manner as possible. What is the best pathway to that? maybe open source models fine-tuned on our own data sets. So always start from the problem and like I said cure is a very young startup

uh bustling with energy and that is where a partnership like realel we're running short of time so a short answer please. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. So that is where like a

partnership with realel with like people like Sanjay G and Parag at helm it will really work out uh in the sense that look with their experience and our energy we can create something

meaningful for the country. So in short like just start with the problem first and then figure out the technology needed to solve for that. &gt;&gt; Sir, so Dr. Parnal uh you touched upon

it actually uh when we we spoke about uh DPI. So when DPI everybody agrees it's a way for health to go. It's so it's so important. You can't leave it to any

proprietary systems. But how do we build it in the sense how do we build DPI? And uh how do we after all it's so complex that we need the talent and the energy of the private sector and still it has

to be owned by a public entity. Is there can we have some models around what you're thinking? &gt;&gt; See the manbar digital mission uh the DPI which

has been created is a completely open interoperable federated architecture. Somehow let us be very clear that there is no complexity. Actually it has

been made much simpler and you see today people can say UPI is so simple. &gt;&gt; No it is really simple but of course the backbone has been prepared the you know detail architecture that is what we did

in ABDM. The architecture which has been put in place only requirement today is the hospitals the professionals the patients they need to see the value in it see when we say this every patient

feels they need to have their whole record for last 10 years 20 years 30 years we all need but I don't know people sitting in the hall knows when did uh last time when did they visit the

hospital and what medicine they took for what symptoms they went to the hospitals and what was the treatment provided will they use it next time they visit to the hospital will they be able to explain to

the doctor in a clear terms that what exactly the symptoms were and what medicines they had taken I think many of us will fail &gt;&gt; right

&gt;&gt; now with this architecture in place the challenge lies is the patient need to know the value of it. Hospitals need to know the value that if they create electronic record, it will take care of

not just the efficiency of the hospital will also build the huge digital uh you know uh record repository with the hospital which they can also analyze of course with the consent of the patient

with the anom anonymization etc required and more so if we are part of the same health ecosystem every hospital will benefit. Let us not think in isolation that if a you're

saying sir it is finally boiling down to awareness and incentive &gt;&gt; awareness and incentive we have started a incentive scheme for using more and more facilities to come on the digital

health system. Many of our people are still on a manual prescriptions you know uh examination etc. These all have to transform to electronic system which are integrated with the larger

ABDM architecture. &gt;&gt; Right. Thank you sir. &gt;&gt; This is what will have to happen. &gt;&gt; Thank you sir. Uh Dr. Anab I I'll I'm coming back to you on this because I

think you are addressing a always a different perspective but you were saying that low resource health systems are very important multimodal systems are more important population aware

systems are more important can you briefly touch upon it we have less time so a short answer please &gt;&gt; so I would say as of today the models should be representative of the

population should ingest data from different population should also be built using multimodal data your demographic data, clinical data, lab data, genomics data, imaging data

etc. So that not only we can do early disease diagnostics means not only treat the uh patients who have already advanced in the disease stage but also do early disease diagnos diagnosis. mass

screening should also be possible within the Indian context so that we can early catch on those disorders and I would say the models would be different unless they have seen that diversity they would

not be able to actually do both. &gt;&gt; Thank you Dr. time to squeeze one more question. So I if you don't mind I'll I'll address that question to you doctor. So we we have the head of NHA

here and you are the head of Africa CDC. What kind of south south collaboration do you think will be really impactful? &gt;&gt; Well, I I see him as my twin &gt;&gt; that uh I had not been able to find

before. So, I I hope to have a a bit of a conversation right now because I think the South South collaboration can be in terms of human resources. Um there are so many Africans that come to India for

training. myself I'm I'm an alumni of the SPGN School of Global Business. So, and I was hap I happened to be part of the first cohort of computer science trained um uh graduates in Rwanda and

all our professors came from India at that time. So that south collaboration is happening and just needs to be strengthened. And finally, I learned one thing that when you have a microphone,

you have to sell something. Otherwise, you have lost an opportunity. So, I'd like to sell something here. I'd like to invite you uh to those who are interested in doing business in Africa

and especially in the domain of digital health to join us for the Africa Health Tech Summit. You can type healthsummit.affrica. It's September 30th to October 2nd in

Kegali Randa and this conversation can continue. Thank you. Thank you. I think we are about time. I'm sorry I'm not able to go do some more questions. Thank you. Thank you panelists for the for the

lovely discussion. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you to all our distinguished panelists for the rich and insightful perspectives. We are running short of time so we won't be able to take

questions from the audience. Ladies and gentlemen, as a mark of our appreciation, we will now present momentos to our esteemed panelist and moderator. May I invite director network

planning and marketing rail Sri Yashpal Singh Tomar to kindly do the honors. Yes, please. I just want to say that &gt;&gt; QR and they're handing over the reports

as well. Due to shortage of time, we not releasing it formally. You can give that. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Sir,

sir, please come. Please do. Sir, excuse me. Just one more. Sorry.

Thank you once again to all our distinguished speakers for an enlightening discussion. This concludes panel session one. I request all the still panelists to

kindly step down from the stage so that we may proceed with the next session. Ladies and gentlemen, we have just concluded a very insightful first session where our speakers highlighted

how collaboration, digital infrastructure and AI innovation are transforming public health delivery at scale in India and across global context. Building on those powerful

perspectives, we now turn to the next frontier. &gt;&gt; We request the audience to kindly remain seated as the next session will begin shortly.

All are requested to remain seated. it &gt;&gt; We are going to begin the next session That's it. context. Building on those powerful perspectives,

we now turn to the next frontier. I request everyone to kindly be seated. Panel session two will focus on the theme AI for inclusive, accessible and universal healthcare. This discussion

will explore how technology can translate into equitable access, affordability and better outcomes for every citizen. This session brings together distinguished leaders from

for their remarks. A short buzzer will sound at 5 minutes and a long buzzer at 6 minutes. May we request you to kindly conclude at the final buzzer. It is my privilege to now request Dr. RS Mani to

kindly take over the proceedings. Good afternoon. Uh the sessions are like dil manga more so it never ends. Huh? So I'm going to make it very short and crisp and especially

after Mahashiatri it is better to stand. it'll be difficult for me to sit down and do the otherwise you'll sleep. So let's come back in the previous session we saw that you know how the uh public

health is being AI is impacting the public health. However on the on the joial side someone talked about like civil we must have a health uh I hope it is kept very

confidential and not really given out it will have a huge social impact otherwise. So coming back to this session in this session we'll try to take our uh narrative towards universal

universality and then governance trust and then see how AI if enabled with the DPI that we talked about the digital public infrastructure and the technical framework as well as

the ethical framework as and when it comes out you know he's able to do an early detection and probably help the health care to reach every nook and corner of this

country. Today we are faced with a huge diversity, population diversity which Dr. Ana talked about. We have also seen the financial diversity and access

diversity. So it's extremely important that whatever AI can throw out on this is able to take us to that level so that with minimum cost we are able to deliver healthcare.

So with that what we are aim is today in the in the in the discussion is as everyone no one likes a guardrail. Okay. So even I'm not used to a guardrail. So I've been told to do in a particular way

but I'm going to shift it in a different way. But don't worry I won't eat your lunch time. So we'll close at right time. So what I'm going to do is that I would request uh each one of the

panelists because we have uh very senior panelists who got a huge experience and then entrepreneurs who have created their companies. So it's extremely important to understand how AI in their

area of work and all of them are working on healthcare and also infrastructure. So how is it going to help the public in general? How is it going to make AI inclusive accessible okay and inclusive

accessible and more important universal so let's have a look at each one of the panelists for a few minutes and then probably we'll generate few questions and then end the session accordingly so

with your permission I would like to start with Sika Sab who has been a CIO and uh huge group so obviously he must be having a wonderful experience of AI in his field and let's hear him out on

how AI has enabled Maidanta and what is the future for AI in his company right now. Thank you. Yeah, please you can you can you can sit there because I have to stand. I was not uh sleeping last night.

So you can sit. &gt;&gt; Sure. Uh I think the topic itself says that AI for inclusive and accessible health. Uh we are almost on the 80th year of independence

in freedom fighters including Mahatma Gandhi thought about two important social dimensions. One education and second is health and I think you know folks sitting in this room and even

outside will agree that both of them are in shambles. uh right from the first planning commission we thought we thought that we will have inclusive health commission but no butter on any

side of the bread no political colors I think in 2018 when ABDM was launched first time very clear-cut tech embedded healthcare policy was formulated so the kind of gap which we have in the country

uh be the facilities be the skill beat the tech or beat the insurance penetration. You know we will not never be able to reach that gap and this gap is going to grow exponentially. Only

thing which we can do is that either you have less sick people which one of the earlier panelist said that which is not going to happen very soon. Uh the other is that you bring tech and that's the

only way by which you know healthcare can be scalable, can be accessible and can be affordable. I will give two examples of AI nothing in theory. All of them are in production in Madanta. Uh so

these are not theoretical stuff. So guardrails you know risk all have been taken care. So one example is that we have been running TB free hana for last 11 years.

I think this is the biggest CSR which we do outside uh the tertiary case. Now we run TV free in five other states where we have our hospitals. When we started we used to go we used to take a ban and

you have to understand the meaning of accessibility. Now we are talking of Hiana. We are talking of districts which are like 20 kilometers away from Delhi or 30 km away from Delhi. You know you

are talking of trace everybody understand traceability after co but we were aware of traceability and we were tracking traceability for TB way back in 2014 and 15 because you know someone

rightly said that one TB patient and TB is more infectious than HIV. TB India TB load is 27% of the world population while our own population is roughly 14 15% of the world population. So having

said so now when we started running this program we used to send one radiologist in a van. So roughly in a one single day we have 200 odd subjects who were there for TV

screening. I have been to those vans. Uh and for us timely detection on the same day and very fast is important because these were all jihadi workers. I learned this word called jihadi workers because

they used to say that sir do it fast because for him to find TB in his body that non-latent TB versus dihadi was more important. So one thing which was

happening is that we used to do the picture of the uh scan because radiologists can see limited number and then send it to folks in the guru headquarter and then you know delay

definitely used to happen and lot of times picture was not perfect. So all that story cutting it short uh covid happened and then we were short of radiologist because radiologist also got

involved in doing HRCT. Now everybody remembers what was HRCT during COVID days. So uh we thought that let's have a AI box in the van. Okay, great. But where was the 2G or 3G connectivity on

those remote areas? So definitely AI van was a failure. So second thing which we did is that we brought the AI module back it into the box which is attached to an X-ray modality. So which means in

local AI now how do you improve the machine learning which Dr. Numa spoke about. So we used to bring the van back to Madanta Hospital. We used to upgrade the algorithm each Friday night so that

next Monday morning it is ready to use. Now what we are saying is that in this particular case we were able to detect TB or no TB within 30 seconds of an X-ray coming out

of the modality. So just imagine that which was taking couple of hours where the thihari worker is not around and then you have an x-ray machine giving you an x-ray in a dcom page format and

giving you a possible TV for the subject or not. Definitely this is x-ray is a is a screening test in the case of a TV because it's easy to do but difficult to read because radiologists were not

around. So sputum test and then asha worker took over. But for last 5 and 1/2 years we were doing roughly six vans 4 days a week 200 subjects per day per visit. So multiply it not even one

single x-rays read by radologists. So that's the power and accessibility and affordability of AI in in production at least in midanta. uh this is primary care and I'll talk about one more

example on agentic AI I think I have to tell you two aspect of the stories both of them are personally related to me my mom once I took her to aos to maidanta hospital obviously

everybody knows me so doctors are also aware so one doctor gave one prescription mom rejected it second doctor next day gave almost the same prescription mom was not aware which

prescription is or which doctor is this academic hierarchy? Nothing was known to mom. So next day when we asked why the hell you took you know second when the prescription is the same. She said that

at least doctor was speaking to me. Doctor was looking into my eyes. So this is so patient want doctor to speak. I have another example. My doctor my daughter is a doctor. So she does

practice. So she generally have 30 minutes for a consult. She's outside India. So she said 20 minutes patient are talking nonsense. They don't talk about symptoms. Doctor only kick in the

OPD is to convert the symptoms into a diagnosis. That's the kick. Okay. And now for 20 minutes patient is saying that you know my son came he brought such a beautiful shawl. At 21st minute

doctor is switch off. He doesn't he doesn't comprehend what patient is saying. So there two two different contrast. Doctor wants to cut short, listen to the symptoms, say the

diagnosis and go back. Patient wants doctor to listen. So we came out with agentic with this principle where conversation between doctor and patient is happening in a agentic environment.

Agent is listening each the each of the conversation you come and visit us. It speaks in bhpurya language. It speaks in matri language. That's the because we have hospitals in pata. Okay. And then

each and every prescription is ready structured. There are there are brands, there are generics, there are instructions in the local languages, there are general

advice in the local languages in case the patient is interested in the local language as a prescription. So what I'm saying is that and plus doctor get lot of you know satisfaction because he's

not focusing on type. Most of the senior doctors they use keyboard like this. Okay. So for 20 minutes they are typing the prescription for five minutes they're looking at the patient. So what

we have done is that we have ensured that doctor focus on the conversation on empathy on breaking the ice rather than on the keyboard. So this is one more example and there are multiple you know

by byproducts of this. &gt;&gt; Yes Mr. Rajiv I think you gave a good example of Rajiv's mother having the right which is called a patient autonomy to throw away the

prescription when she doesn't want it. So it may be the same next day but she has a right to throw it away. So now I think we'll go to Dr. Sinat and take his experience on public health and how AI

is impacted. Well, let me start off by saying what was actually advocated as a very important prescription for the health system of the country. If it has to

deliver universal health coverage, we need an efficient, equitable, empathetic and economically viable health system if we have to

deliver universal health coverage. The critical elements of universal health coverage are adequate service coverage to cover all the essential health needs of anybody.

across the entire life course of the individual. The second element is that these services should be delivered with quality but with adequate financial

protection so that they are not either hindered from seeking care or driven to bankruptcy because of the care. Now we know that about 6 to 7% of the Indian population every year this is from the

national sample service are pushed into poverty because of unaffordable healthcare expenditure. We also know that there are several people who do not seek care because

they're worried about the expenditure or because health services are not easily available because of geographical access barriers. This is basically foregone care. Now if you don't estimate foregone

care, you'll get a false understanding of out-of-pocket expenditure. When people are not even spending, then you'll say okay not people are not really having too much of out-of- pocket

expenditure. So to find out how universal health coverage is working also we need to get that. But the critical element is that AI has helped and will help even more in bridging some

of these barriers of access. It'll also bridge barriers of quality. It'll help bring down the costs. Now important element of course is that we do have a serious gap in the

distribution of our health workforce. uh there are states where there are adequate number of doctors per population uh ratio but there are several states in which there are very

few doctors distributed and even in most of the states there's the urban rural mal distribution. So if services are not reaching people to train non-f physician healthcare providers with diagnostic

algorithms and management algorithms on handheld devices point of care diagnostics and enable them to give appropriate care at the point of care or even train people for self-are train

family members for care all this AI can greatly bridge the gaps that are there now and ensure people will get care at home close to home and an affordable manner with appropriate triage for

referral when required. So therefore the overall service coverage component will improve the quality of care will improve with this kind of algorithms being very clearly stated and distributed. the

healthcare providers being treat trained and even the patient or the family being able to check whether they're getting the right treatment or whether they're being advised the right kind of tests or

not. So we are democratizing the health system in the in enabling people to actually participate in their own healthcare in a much better manner and the financial costs also will come down

because people don't have to travel far people don't have to take unnecessary tests and treatments. So all the objectives of universal health coverage are going to be definitely satisfied but

there is health beyond health care and which means that we are also looking at prevention promotion at the community and the population level. Again here AI can help tremendously in very many ways

in enhancing public awareness of the conditions through health and nutrition literacy enabling people to undertake a lot of preventive care themselves so that they

don't fall sick because somebody was saying in the previous uh round that you can't prevent people from falling sick. Yes, but you can certainly reduce that risk by enabling people with much better

knowledge. The other element of course is there are disconnects in the health system in terms of referral. Right now we have primary care under the health and wellness centers. So Dishman

Aragamander we have secondary and tertiary care being subsidized or financed by Pran Mantri Janajana. There's virtually no connect between the two and the disconnect between the

primary health care as well as secondary care and tertiary care can easily be bridged by AI in a substantial manner. We have seen how tele medicine has been functioning, teley health services have

been functioning. So we can actually ensure that the expertise of the specialist is available to the primary healthcare center as well. So we can bridge the quality gaps that are there

in our healthcare while ensuring better access ensuring also that the financial barriers are lifted and ultimately all the objectives of universal health coverage can be much better served.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. Now I request Rama to you know give a little bit on the infrastructure as well as what uh he has got in plans for AI. AI actually AI is

intelligence part of it and finance is incentive part of it. Unless you incentivize the entire system, universal access is not possible.

I mean AI is actually re revolutionizing entire uh healthcare scenario wherein if you look at this uh primary care if you are going to push more and the burden on the tertiary

care will come down the preventive part of it what Dr. Dr. Sika has also spoken about the tuberculosis and also many such kind of examples like uh diabetic retinopathy

or maybe I mean sepsis I mean there are many cases use cases wherein the sepsis was detected and uh peranom 2000 deaths were come down to 500 in in a particular hospital. So that kind of preventive

thing will reduce the load on the tertiary and secondary health care systems and that will enhance the affordability for the general patients and public. So that is one area actually

this AI is going to play a major role and uh as far as the other aspects I mean I'm from finance that's why I'll try to look at it from the finance angle also wherein the benefits should be

available to all the players in the entire ecosystem from that perspective uh earlier we have been listening to NH director where he was mentioning mentioning about the fraud detection

part of And AI is a tool where fraud detections can happen and then public spending where 3 point around 3% of GDP is being spent on public fund I mean uh

healthcare and uh there may be lot of leakages these leakages can be plugged and coming to other point uh as far as the uh risks part of it is normally technology means we go by technology

solution utionism thinking that technology is all pervasive and technology will be the right it will give the right prescription but many a times may not be because it is involving

data and the data what we are gathering might be having so much of biases I mean this is one area where inter international discussion also is happening the data on which the entire

systems are getting trained and uh the data intake may be biased from various perspectives, sometimes maybe on racial perspectives, sometimes on geographical perspectives and most of the data might

be western data on which we might be training also. So this kind of uh systems which got trained on these kind of uh I should not use the word lopsided but not relevant databases the solution

also might be different. So there comes whether the trust factor about the technology what it is giving solution from that perspective and also data being very private and sensitive to

everyone especially the individual health data it is very very sensitive data federation of data is very much important very much important in the sense that uh the data can be trained by

respective hospitals in their local systems and without having any specificities and detailing about the individual data that data can be Julie giving the weights and the activations

then that can be shared across uh on a portal kind of thing. So that kind of systems are very much essential and that also makes this universal healthcare very

much accessible. Unless the data localized data indized data is getting trained properly the solutions also may not be right in the perspective. So that's why the data uh I mean

sensitization is very much important and also I foresee a lot of opportunities in this sector especially tech companies and uh I mean startup companies kind of thing now huge data is getting trained

but that can be containerized that can be quantized and it can be made readily available to the end users and end I mean mobile level and end device level wherein this kind of data trained models

on a low memory based uh systems can work even on low internet. I mean there's no internet available in rural areas. there also they can be useful and that is another area where which can

make this universal access possible because universal access means what to my little understanding I think experts are there here to my little understanding whether primary secondary

or tertiary all the three layers of the health care shall be available to all the citizens and individuals equal footing and that is a very I mean utopian kind of thing but technology is

one which can really make it closer to us and uh obviously various kind of technologies that are coming like multi-ingual chatbots or interaction with the uh patient that can get

recorded and then replayed again that kind of systems which are going to proliferate in shorter period of time and then we can see everyday life I mean uh use using these kind of technologies.

So now finally coming to this part because I'm from finance we need to talk about the risk also there are risk elements what I have already flagged and uh the policy comes into picture there

the government policy which need to be very very uh sensitive towards the uses of this uh artificial intelligence into healthcare because it need to be patient specific because in the entire ecosystem

if entire ecosystem is running on finance and then profitability AITA margins that will obviously uh I mean uh twist the entire thing and it will not be in the favor of the uh general public

and the patients. So that's my point sir. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. So uh so let's hear about Anchel if you can just uh uh talk about a little on uh the technology that

you created and also a little bit more on the language and uh you know as Rama was talking about having the model in the car as well as Raji was talking about it. So what have

you done on that and what are the difficulties that you have faced on this? &gt;&gt; Sure. Um thanks thanks u everyone for giving me this opportunity.

um when I'm surrounded by such esteemed panelists uh I tried very hard to neither talk about policy because I know very little about it. I'm not that well-versed and domain trained as uh

successor there. Um I do not really understand the intricacies of how to run very large P&amp;Ls uh either. U so I thought how can I really contribute meaningfully to this conversation u and

um I think I over period of time I learned a lot more things. So let me just first briefly briefly tell you what hat I'm going to wear today right um and I'm going to wear the hat of someone who

was historically now because in AI world 10 plus years is history u I was an AI researcher I was briefly a professor then I built companies I sold them I spent about 14 years outside of India

and then I met my lovely wife who's a doctor and she said uh hey why don't we go back to India and uh really fix uh uh hopefully uh the whole healthcare ecosystem right and we thought of this

name Percha because doctors percha is very intrinsic to and it's like a very household name to everything that we do um so I'm going to wear today the hat of someone who has largely been trained uh

outside now we do have uh some interesting access to technology right I'll I'll be very honest the access of GPUs and uh HPCs that I had in my university was probably better than what

you'll find in some of the largest companies in India. Um and I uh there was as much learning when I came to India as much as there was unlearning because things that you would take as uh

available to you there are not available here. So I thought I will just give you a uh this this picture of what someone who's trying to really push for AI adoption and empowerment through AI

really faces today right and everything that I'm going to talk about are very much backed in data and we have done so many deployments now that we are very integrated to this largely this India AI

ecosystem not just healthcare either in fact most of these recent product launches and these foundational model conversations that you see when you really uh unlayer them uh twice you'll

find a flavor of pan science innovations somewhere there um so there are see look India has done fantastic work in digital healthcare ecosystem uh like no questions about it um when you really

look at the rails that have been paid they are fantastic I mean we what we have hundreds of millions of u digital health ID cards we are running cres of teleconultations parallelly uh these are

things at population scale These are not even like a cohort or a silo scale. U but there are a couple of very interesting challenges that we are going to all face. The first being we have

also talked about contextualization right. So the AI being trained on Indian data. AI should be trained on Indian data. Uh I will not go right now on the accessibility of the data aspect right.

How much of this already is still pen and paper. But uh when you really think about contextualization so that is my first point. um we faced the problem of contextualization not only from a point

of view of data access but also what um Rouseer said with regards to even the bandwidth access right so when you're really doing deployments in these fringe areas and we did some deployments in

Andhra Pradesh and very remote areas of Telangana these were deployments on mobile medical units which have no access to internet whatsoever now you are resource

constrainted you don't have bandwidth you are internet constrained so everything has to run on premise right or at least on the device and that means you are also going to be constrained by

the kind of AI model you can use all right so while we can talk about the benchmarks that yes AI today has become 98% great in predicting certain things when the rubber meets the road there we

are really talking about 75 and 78 and probably 82 so I think one us as enablers as well as the uh eosystem system that will be empowered. We first have to really keep resetting our

expectations to the nuances and constraints that we'll be operating under right and I think that kind of a realization and resetting around ecological validity is most important

because otherwise what will keep happening we will keep comparing the hype with the realities and that is uh that is not going to be that great. The second part which is u I think some

that's one thing that I see lots of AI companies not doing today is start to build any solution from the edge inwards and what does that mean in healthcare ecosystem I call edge as the point at

which the healthare worker and the patients interaction happens right u so yes you can you can build fantastic policy models you can build u dynamic pricing saying on on insurance you can

build uh maybe great uh tools for uh uh for radiologists but I think that is the second part where we have seen uh lots of failures happening in fact last week we were doing a deployment we doing a a

pilot at one of the large hospitals in Delhi and there were at least 10 conversations happening in the same room so all those YCI models that work really well in an airond conditioned office of

a tertiary care large hospital are going to fail right and fall flat so I think That is another part where you start to see nuances that you have to fix and yes of course by doing some technical work

you can start to really get to a solution that works. In fact that that pilot it seems that it it was going well. So we'll know more in the coming weeks. And the third point and that's

the last point I think that is a mindset shift that we all are going we must must have here. We have to and we have to and I cannot emphasize more. We have to start to measure outcomes and not

pilots. And what does that mean? If you ever come to my office, it's uh I have a quote there. Uh we can only improve what we can measure. And it's absolutely critical that you measure the right

thing. We have to measure I mean in dystopian word yes we have to measure the how many people got longevities and so on. But today we have to stop measuring success by product launches.

We have to stop measuring success by pilots. We have to start measuring success on how many high-risisk pregnancies were detected earlier. How many hypertensive patients adhered to

their medication? How many uh patients history was were properly captured and populated in the EMR systems. Right? I think that is where a lot of issues uh do come across.

Uh the great thing is and that's the optimistic view and that's the last point I'll I'll add. Um I'll most of the things that you today feel are technically difficult right and we are

probably just skipping the conversation because it's technically difficult are all solvable today. In fact, four years ago, I gave a talk at NVIDIA uh around adaptive machine learning and in fact,

PCHA was a use case there uh which was how do you really keep training the model as the doctor is giving feedback and at that time we didn't feel that there will be a need for things like

that but today you can see our hisystopathology system that was working at 60% accuracy today is at 75% accuracy so I think there's a lot of optimism in the in the in the space and I think

there's a lot that can be done uh at the same time the constraints are very real and they have to be looked Thank you Anad. So let's now get on to the topic where uh

uh we will ask uh Mr. Jon on um how do we look at AI when we talk about personalized uh medicine and as well as whatever you are doing right now if you could en enhance more on that. So thank

you for that. &gt;&gt; Yeah thank you for that. Uh good afternoon everyone. So I'll pick off initially where sir left right. So when we talk about AI that is inclusive that

is accessible that is meant for universal healthcare we cannot look at benchmarks in terms of model score in terms of pilots conducted in terms of demos conducted. The benchmark is

systemic impact. Systemic impact in terms of time saved money saved continuity of care especially where healthcare is stretched out thin. I do not come from the perspective of uh

training a foundational model but more from a perspective of creating curating deployment pathways healthcare pathways on the ground and what we have seen is that healthcare becomes non-universal

much before uh due to human reasons much before it becomes non-universal due to technical reasons. uh if I take you through a quick vignette of a a diagnostic come

consultation setup that we have in a small town called Mahoba uh the Jan Swastas Kendra as we call it uh as patients started rolling in we saw a very unique pattern I I'll say unique

because yeah so a very unique pattern in which patients were equating good treatment with something that is fast so by fast what I mean is immediate visible intervention be it strong medications

steroidal medications IV drips anything that will give it give relief faster. Right? On the contrary, if a clinician prescribes a proper treatment plan with multiple follow-ups, something

a gradual medication uh lifestyle changes, it is treated as hoax or perceived as hoax. So, I'm not saying this to uh pass judgment on anyone, but more towards to

bring light to what this births confusion-driven healthcare. confusion is madly expensive lack of uh faster treatments in then uh talk about

you know delays uh so treatment delays I'm sorry treatment delays unnecessary medications lack of adurance this is where universal healthcare breaks not just an access but an understanding so

uh on the uh deployment side what we observed were four you know common breaks in each and every deployment the number one was the meaning gap By meaning gap what I mean is the lack

of healthcare literacy pushes the patient towards understanding or towards chasing relief faster relief. The new norm is something that is immediate. The second one is the interpretation gap.

There's prescriptions available. There's multiple reports available even with my grandmother but you know these these documents did not make any sense to her. A patient would not be able to tell you

what their HB1C reports mean or they would not be able to tell you what the seven why they're on seven different medications in a sing in a single prescription. The third gap that we

observed was variability. Healthcare is not consistent. It varies from doctor to doctor, from clinician to clinician definitely be a lot better in vanta when you compare it to a simple PC, right? Be

it due to the time variation, the time pressure, due to uh uh incentives to the doctors to the habit or due to just simple lack of standardization. This is treated as randomness or perceived as

randomness by the patient. This randomness drives the patient to get to the most the or rather take the pathway that feels most effective instead of taking a path that is correct. And the

fourth one is the navigation gap without understanding what to do next. It drives the patient or rather makes the patient bounce between multiple referrals, multiple medical institutions without

understanding what to do next and ultimate up until you know uh the symptomatic escalation brings them to a tertiary hospital as one of the panelists said in the tertiary hospital

increasing the load of a condition that could have been taken care of at an earlier stage possible. So uh where does the AI come into picture right that is that makes it

genuinely inclusive? Definitely not by making AI or transforming the AI into a doctor itself. Not by making the patient act as a doctor but by making the patient an informed participant in this

entire process. What I mean by informed participant is making the patient a patient that understands what their health means. A patient that understand what their reports mean.

So on the patients end I believe AI can essentially function in two simple yet powerful ways. Number one understanding and number two is navigation. Understanding what your prescription

means, what the particular medicine is, which is a support medicine, which is required, which is symptomatic and which medicines are just simple supplements. Understanding what your reports mean in

plain simple language, what it implies. And finally creating a next step ladder that talks about what to take care of immediately, what is an emergency situation, what can be taken care of by

a simple home remedy and what requires a local clinician intervention. This reduces panic decision-m and unnecessary escalations making inclusivity uh come into its true sense

in terms of lower number of hospital visits, lower expenses, less hassle, less uh harm essentially. &gt;&gt; Yeah, please go ahead. Finish your last. &gt;&gt; Yes, sure. So, uh the uh this only works

with a bounded model, right? By bounded I mean the AI needs to should must not prescribe. The AI must not alter dosage. The AI must be true and uh transparent in terms of communicating uncertaintity.

The AI's role is to explain explain triage and uh escalate. That's it. On the medical practitioner's end, the AI can act to make the consultations more safer and consistent. essentially acting

as another set of eyes in a time constrained environment. It can detect uh flag duplications uh contraindications, dangerous combinations and guide the consultation

towards the medical guidelines. The key ultimately is that the final decision should remain with the clinician. On top of that, in cases of uh a high impact choice like prescribing a steroid,

prescribing some kind of antibiotics, we can the system can act ask for a a separate layer or single line explanation or confirmation from the clinician not as a punishment but more

towards inculcating a learning loop and as well as to uh you know reduce the chances for doctors getting into an autopilot autopilot mode on the system layer where universal healthcare

essentially gets into an operational form. Once we reduce the confusion and increase follow-ups, then we unlock prevention. AI can flag risks only, detect patterns

and prompt interventions, especially in cases of &gt;&gt; So I got a question for you. Okay, now let's just start with a question because uh maybe a question for you. You said

explaining the prescription to the rural. &gt;&gt; So when you talk about a rural mass getting into the PSCs, very soon the doctor will not have time. So are you

contemplating on a system which will generate a video with the same doctor speaking on what he has written on the prescription so that he can carry it on the same language in which uh the guy uh

speaks so that he can refer to that whenever he feels like and take the prescription properly. So, so we're not initially going for a video based thing because uh what we observed in our

deployments is that although after digital India mission the advent of smartphones, advent of internet is there, there is penetration but still a lot of people who will be visiting these

hospitals are not very familiar with it &gt;&gt; distance far. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Okay. So let's come back to one question each. I'll just put the question to

Sikasab. You talked about X-rays and lots of X-rays were taken and I'm not a medical professional but still I just I just thought that today I was just hearing

about you know the funders the retina photographs they also not only talk about retina problems or retina proper retinas but they also sometimes indicate about heart heart issues. So when you

have taken those x-rays and collected so many of them for TB yes or no can those be you know further worked upon uh will that be legally allowed or I don't know I'm not sure but can that be worked upon

to really find out many more things that the people might be developing? &gt;&gt; Sure. So answer is 100% yes because as I said that all guardrails including privacy including ethics committee

approvals are very much in place. I think money we have to understand that uh health care will bring AI in healthcare will bring less problems than the you know problems it is going to

solve. So we have to keep that focus in mind. You know countries struggling with so many problems of the healthcare at the remotest corner and we keep talk talking about problems of AI in the

healthcare. That mindset should shift. We should think about mindset should be not to you know worry about what kind of best algorithm we will

build. I think the mindset should be that how we build confidence in practitioner in using AI for the healthcare. That should be the mindset. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. uh Dr. Shinat uh if

you could uh highlight on some of the difficulties that you faced just one probably the biggest one when you talk about a public healthcare policym or any other accessibility etc.

Let me let me say that scalability is the biggest challenge. Scalability of care across different parts of the country. Even scalability

of some of the treatments that are available partly because we do not have the health workforce which is adequately trained and adequately distributed.

But AI can actually overcome the scalability problem. There's also another element when we are talking about universal health coverage, we are talking about equity. We have to

identify vulnerable groups who require additional attention, additional services, perhaps additional resource There will be equity in a horizontal dimension in which the package of

services is identical for everybody. But there will also be a vertical dimension of equity in which the additional care or additional services or additional resources will have to be provided to

vulnerable sections. Now bringing in the social determinance of health is not that easy unless you bring in AI which actually combines it with the health system indicators and identifies which

are the vulnerable population groups, who are the vulnerable patients who require this kind of attentive care. in addition to what is being part of the general package. So equity gap is

something and scalability gap is something that AI can overcome. All right. So I have got one question last very short answer for Anul. You talked about uh the remote boxes where 70 72%

of accuracy is the one which you can work with and you also talk about zero connectivity as Rama was also talking about. Now when you scale the system into thousands and thousands of them and

uh tomorrow obviously the country will have wonderful connectivity today also we have the cheapest of data rates but then uh maybe very soon within few months if that comes what's the kind of

disruption that you think that uh or would you use it for your own benefit &gt;&gt; just short very short because we are left with hardly any time &gt;&gt; all right sure uh so I think uh this is

uh as much a wild west the whole transformation um uh in India around AI that's happening is as much a wild west as we are seeing with the frontier models in the west. Uh so I think two

things are definitely going to happen. First is uh as much as we are talking about the empowering healthcare workers, we are actually missing out on how it is really going to enable the patient to be

better aware of situations, right? I mean there are going to be patterns emerging on the on the ground that yes there are new new knowledge on the ground that will be spread. I mean most

of the doctors do face this question right and like medical education medical awareness in itself is a big problem. So I think that is going to be definitely impacted. Uh second part as the

connectivity happens we I do envision that we are going to see a very hybrid deployments that will happen &gt;&gt; right so you're going to take care with the hybrid deployment and probably make

sure you take advantage of the connectivity that's going to come. So with that I think uh we don't have any more time so I would like to stop here and thank the panelists for their

wonderful suggestions and uh takeaways on AI and thank you so much &gt;&gt; and thank you for being the wonderful &gt;&gt; I think Dang more I need to speak but I will do that on the other time

Our sincere thanks to all esteemed panelists while for a highly valuable and enriching exchange to recognize the contributions of our distinguished

speakers. We will now present momenttos. May I invite director projects operation and maintenance rail shri man chandan to kindly do the honors. Are they cooking?

Ladies and gentlemen, with this we come to the conclude. inclusion of real session at the India AI impact summit 2026. We extend our sincere gratitude to all our speakers, moderators,

dignitaries and participants for making these discussions meaningful and impactful. On behalf of Realtor Corporation of India Limited, thank you for your presence and partnership. Have

a wonderful day ahead. Thank you. Thank you everyone. The next session will start in another five minutes. Kindly Vik the hall till then. What is she?

Come on. Hello. Fresh from pilot tomb. Crazy.

&gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Hey guys, uh please vacate the room as uh the guests have to come. You too. Mom

Yes. So, should I go ahead and kick us off? &gt;&gt; Cool. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Good afternoon everyone. I'm just happy everybody's sitting at this point and

there's no one in the hall that has to stand. one of the benefits of a 200 member seating facility I guess. So this is fantastic. Thank you all for joining us today. My name is Deepipa Kartiken.

I'm co-founder partner of an organization called Athena and Phonomics. We're an organization that specialize in evaluating artificial intelligence, right? And which is really

what we're here to talk about. Uh I'm I've been instructed that we'll need to do a group pick before we get started. So I'm going to request uh my esteemed panelists for a to just come together

for a group pick and then we'll get started in a minute. Great. I think in one of the I mean I was in a session and I think there was a sentence that really captured the

sentiment that maybe several of you particularly if you're in government are feeling. Do you want to be wasting money to be part of a race that you're not even sure is building or generating

value? And I think that's an important question, right? And it's becomes even more critical when you're spending scarce public financial resources subsidizing

design, innovation, and delivery of artificial intelligence services. There's a value for money question, right? Is there value for money from this investment today? Do we need to

wait? There is a safety question, right? Which has been a really large part of a lot of the discussions that me that's that I've seen since this morning. And there is definitely an inclus an

inclusion question, right? Which is you could say, oh yeah, this is great. There is value for money here, but it may not be inclusive yet, right? And achieving those goals require us to go back and

think about questions of how we collect data, how we build models, how we finance those models, um, and how we actually drive adoption. We have some phenomenal panelists today,

so I want to really, and if time permits, I know 55 minutes is tight, but really allow for some sort of audience interaction and Q&amp;A as well. But I want to kick us off. So we have here with us

Zebas Sadiki and Francis who are both evaluators who are going to come from the perspective of really what is the evidence telling us right so there was a systematic review that was funded by

FCTO that Francis and Zeba were part of leading and delivering at Athena Infinomics and they're going to share Zeba will share the results and then Francis will share how that's shaping

our thinking as we think about AI evaluations. We're really honored to have Dr. Singla join us who's secretary information technology the state of Jammu and Kashmir who's really thinking

about questions of how do you do this at scale and how can we make sure it's inclusive and what do we need to get right in terms of the digital infrastructure on the upstream and

professor Kavia who's joining us from IIT Delhi who's going to touch on this very critical aspect of adoption which will not come without the trust infrastructure at the last mile and the

human interface and what we're learning learning through the work that she's being leading and delivering on with with that I'm going to hand it off to Zeba to talk us through uh yeah what

we're learning from the FCDO um systematic review. &gt;&gt; Uh thanks Deepa. Uh thanks a lot for situating Athena's work in this landscape. Um as she mentioned uh this

was a rapid review that was commissioned to us by the RCC FCDO government of UK University of Birmingham and international initiative for impact evaluation. Uh the idea behind this was

to map what kind of AI solutions or AI enabled interventions are being used for what kind of agricultural problems. Now having said that we were also cognizant of the fact that we not only want to map

it in a very technocentric manner but we also want to understand what are some of the welfare related indicators uh related to agriculture. Um I am drawn towards the point that one of the

panelists in the previous uh health related uh uh discussion they alluded to is that you have to also measure the right kind of outcomes. So in order to do that we embedded rapid review a very

rigorous methodology with more qualitative and nar narrative based methodology in order to call out the more relevant the more uh uh well-informed and well-rounded sort of

details in terms of how does it impact smallh holder farmers um across global south across lower and middle inome countries. Um I'd quickly mention what are some of the key uh uh evidence base

that we found in this study and then I would also discuss a little bit about what are some of the qualitative or narrative based details uh that came or that were generated through this study.

Uh we looked at over 55 journals. We also looked at around 19 to 20 repositories both academic and organizational repositories and we also looked at over 100 gray literature just

to ensure that we're not missing out on anything relevant and the time frame that we included in this study was from 2019 to 2024. Uh we realized that there is a lot of dialogue around

effectiveness of the AI models of the AI interventions. However, where a critical gap lied was the fact that we didn't have much dialogue around what is its impact on poverty reduction uh

livelihood decision-making power and who does the decision-m power rest with. There is also um we did find that uh there is a lot of impetus on using AI models around crop production, pest

detection um precision agriculture models, large language models but they were directed to or the studies or the evidence were essentially directed to understanding how are these effective

how are these solutions addressing or fairing in terms of performing or not performing. Um again there was a lot of in in in previous discussions we see that there is a lot of dialogue around

uh you know not just measuring the pilot but also measuring uh the sustainability of those interventions. This is this is something that we realized when we were doing the rapid review and which was

sort of also came up in uh the case studies and the deep dives is that um the AI models especially in agriculture are much at a very nent stage um at a very pilot stage. we do see surge of a

lot of uh supply side designs where uh uh you know AI uh is sort of being seen in agricultural practices. However, those models do not sustain. Uh I'd briefly like to touch upon why do they

not sustain or what are some of the challenges that we encountered and these are the gaps that we identified during our uh analysis. Firstly, adoption related challenges is essentially driven

by lack of trust. Um the limited amount of trust is because we do see uh uh you know agriculture is essentially a very conventional a very traditional field uh wherein we uh see that you know people

from a certain generation they're not ready to take that financial risk in order to take up a new technology. Uh hence there is lack of adoption and there is also the lack of trust in terms

of you know adapting to something that may or may not lead to u the desired sort of outcome. So uh uh we we also realized that you know behavioral uh changes are very difficult to um

overcome. &gt;&gt; Uh sure. I'm actually not reading through the slides so that's fine. &gt;&gt; You're not using the slides. &gt;&gt; No I mean it's just

&gt;&gt; I I'll just because I have my notes made. So yeah. Uh yeah. So in in one of the case studies that we studied that we that we did in the African context is uh based out of Kenya where we realized

that a lot of cooperatives farmer cooperatives that engage um farmers are also disseminating a lot of information in terms of how to use AI enabled solutions for financial services for

banking services and so on. While this is a good avenue to percolate information to the right kind of audience, what we realize is that these cooperatives also called sakos in the

local context uh did have high amount of male uh membership or male concentration as opposed to women uh who were not traditionally part of these organization. Now that brings us to my

second point is gender disparity or gender inequality. AI that essentially has been sort of brought into any field even in agriculture to uh balance out that inequity uh in a way also sometimes

not always perpetuates these inequalities in the sense that uh when we are trying to model anything in a particular context it also has to be uh cognizant of what kind of context it is

being tested in. It also has to be aware of what are some of the uh cultural gradients that are you know that are prevalent in that particular environment. Uh what we also realize is

that human in the loop design or human validation is something that is a challenge and that is that is not being talked about enough in in in terms of the evidence. uh we do see inclusivity

is uh something that is missing in the evidence base or in the literature and we um uh you know when we talk to stakeholders, we talked to large cohort of people from academics, from donors to

research organizations and uh there is one thing that they definitely uh debated about or they sort of argued about is that human validation or inclusivity in that sense is something

that should be at the very core of the design of any AI solution. uh and u any solution that is being designed for a related uh problem should not just have uh uh technical experts but should also

have people from gender from uh from you know local community or community champions. Uh then we also realized that there is a big capacity building gap in terms of providing that kind of training

to farmers to be able to u not just adapt but also understand these solutions. Digital literacy as we all know is a big challenge and that also hinders the adoption of these AI uh

related solutions. Um at a large scale what we realize is that governance or governance related frameworks AI frameworks exist in a lot of geographies. However, a specific

frameworks are missing from uh the discussion. So this is something this is this is a definite policy takeaway uh that you know of course Francis would talk about it later when he talks about

the horizon mapping uh from this entire project but absence of a related governance or a related policy framework are a definite um uh evidence gap u absence of localized data or using

average assumed data from you know national data sets or uh absence of consent or taking consent from the farmers in terms of how the data is going to be used is also one u sort of

dialogue that is missing from the evidence base. Uh we also realize that um there are financial constraints there are financial sort of functions indicators that are attached to using

any AI enabled solutions in agriculture. While a large scale farmer may use um may function at economies of scale, a small scale farmer may not do so. Which is why there is a definite inertia in

terms of adapting to uh you know these solutions. Uh again uh coming back to the gender point there is um gap in terms of ownership of assets, ownership of land, ownership of smartphones or

even basic uh uh you know uh these kind of paraphernelas where uh women are sometimes at the fringes and not at the very core of these solutions. Uh financial inclusion is also a big

problem when we're talking about enabling financial services through AI interventions. uh because a lot of times women are also left out from the banking sort of uh you know sector or formal

banking um networks. So these are some of the gaps that were uh flagged during our study and I think I would just leave it to the fellow panelist to sort of allude to these points and also talk

about them in details. So yeah that's all from my end. &gt;&gt; Thank you Zeba. I can I a quick question before we go to the next panelist. Is there something that surprised you from

the systematic review? We've we know about the digital literacy stuff. We know about the finance and scale stuff. Is there something that came out of that systematic review that you went whoa I

didn't expect that? &gt;&gt; Uh I wouldn't say surprise. there were a lot of expected sort of evidence that emerged during the study. But something that really does um I' I'd say that you

know a lot of these solutions which should be directed at small holder farmers which form the majority of the group um are not directed towards them are not made for them or even women who

do not own the land however they are sort of forming a majority of the labor who are sort of performing you know the daily labor at these lands. uh why I say this as I mentioned also is that they're

not part of the you know the circle who owns that particular agricultural land and hence they're not part of the solution as well uh which is why they could be at the other end of the

spectrum using these solutions but they're not at the other side wherein you know uh they can contribute to the design side or the you know the supply side or how do you want these models to

look like and all of those things. So this was definitely not surprising I'd say expected but yes this is perplexing in a way that you know you're not really addressing to the very core of the

problem uh uh or you're not addressing to the larger group which are going to be your majority sort of you know the user group. So yeah that is something that

has come in. Um one thing that really surprised me uh in the literature was we we have shortlisted about 450 studies and then included about 51 studies but the number of studies that did not

report even basic uh what type of data they used for uh training those models and what are the ground truthing and uh what are the ethical uh issues that they looked into was really surprising like

uh there's very few studies I've actually kind of like looked into and uh reported that in the final uh like a report. Uh so that kind of really calls for u um um a sectorwide um um like a

checklist or like a reporting standard that everybody should follow. &gt;&gt; I love that. I think so we're hearing at least three things, right? We're sort of firstly we don't know. There isn't a lot

of evidence on impact yet where there is some evidence the impact hasn't lasted or sustained. It's very temporal. It's very projectized. So it's clearly this and this is such a great segue Dr.

singularity, right? Because now as in government when you're starting to think about how do you build systems and how can you approach this in a way where impact is delivered where it matters and

is sustained and that's a question that's true beyond artificial intelligence. I think we can draw draw from literature on public service delivery. We can draw from literature on

good governance and where that's worked. I'd love to hear from you building on your experience on yeah how you're thinking about it in Jammu and Kashmir. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much for having me. Uh I

think this is a very pertinent point to discuss. We do have pilots across the sectors. So do we have in agriculture as well but is issue is institutionalizing those pilots and that's where comes the

biggest challenge. I see it very differently uh from the AI use perspective. There is some sort of FOMO fear of missing out that if you are not doing anything you are missing a huge

thing. For sure we are missing the huge thing but most important is to do what is actually required on the ground which has the adaptability which has the uptake from the local population. For

example, if I talk about Jammu and Kashmir, I've been there for last 14 years working in different capacities uh in the senior administration. uh the farms of saffron farms in Pampur

&gt;&gt; is very different from the apple orchards in Soapor. So it is very different in the rice fields of Jammu. So we have very diverse geographical regions, very diverse uh needs, very

complex behavioral uh issues. So we cannot actually put in just one dimension that look whether this pilot will upskill or not. I remember we were doing when the PMKAN was launched. So we

were interacting I was a district magistrate of Anantanag district in Kashmir. So we were interacting a lot with the farmers small marginal farmers they have their own set of needs own set

of uh requirements. So unless any AI model speaks the language of a farmer that upscalability will always be I'm not saying a technical language per se but how the trust develops.

&gt;&gt; So in government when we talk of scale we talk of trust. So it is a service actually it is not a small pilot you run in one district and suddenly it fades off in one year that will not be

adapted. It will only be upscaled adapted when it is as a service. When farmer needs it, you provide it. So it's a transaction. It is everyday's need. So if they want the weather advisory, so

because the weather the farmer will not wait for the seed sewing. So if he needs the weather advisory right now, very accurate. So he need to get it today. So if I say okay, there is some algorithm

problem. So my model drift is there. So I'll wait for 3 days. So his time is gone. So he'll lose a precious time of seed swinging. So I believe this is the real practical challenge which we see in

AI these days. There are very beautiful pilots around and very with a great intention just that it has more adaptability on the ground. The system is adopting that uh models and we are

upscaling it in the interest of the public. So the last mile is benefited. I love that and I think this is why it's always exciting when government's in the room, right? Like because that

perspective and mindset and is so unique to a public sector leader. What is Jamo doing something about this already? Is are there initiatives? What are some what are what's being done

for instance to address the last mile advisory that without latency that is highly reliable &gt;&gt; that's the most challenging part of it actually so we uh educational

institutions especially higher educational institutions have a bigger role to play we have IIT Jammu uh so we are collaborating from the Jammu and Kashmir government side uh to come up

with a center of excellence again uh the mandate of that COE would be to create use cases which are actually upscalable and replicable and based on the needs of the ground. So we all must be knowing

about the duisan uh that there are a lot of AI solutions, AI platforms where weather advisories and other kind of things are given but to have it more comprehensive without latency or minimum

latency uh and suiting to the geographical needs of Jammu and Kashmir. The farmer in Jammu needs a very different advice than the my farmer or horiculturist or orchardist in Kashmir.

So that variance is huge. So we have to have those models which actually help with that. So our COE would be taking up very few case use cases rather than what actually feels from our side it is it

can be taken. No we are thinking from the maximum problem perspective. So when you have unscheduled rains when you you know uh snow untimely snow and sleet can damage the full apple crop the full

season is gone. So we are trying to work on those use cases and trying to come up most important is the data in my opinion right now. So we are coming up with a good data sets so that we know what is

the trend of last 20 years or 30 years about the weather advisories uh how the forecast has been what my farmer needs in that space. Then we can feed that data to the models in collaboration with

academia uh industry and can come up with a real use cases which are upscalable rather than just pushing very uh less data from small district uh level sample size which we do not want

to do. &gt;&gt; Lovely. So this I think and and I struggle with this right as someone who's operated at the at the intersection of research policy and

practice. We need policies to be designed to be scalable. But the reality is it has to be highly customized and bespoke, right? And

that's a difficult that's a difficult intersection to navigate, right? Because when you're designing a new program or a policy, you're making some assumptions about what impact could look like and

you're operating with certain principles of how you will deliver that. Now, in the absence of feedback loops, right, we're never going to really know if the policy is really working or not. And

that's a really, and you know, this is a book that I love. It's called Seeing Like a State, which kind of talks about why public sector schemes fail, right? And at the heart of it, it's not because

of intent or even complex political economy dynamics. They go on to say it's because we just don't learn. We have no way of learning cost-effectively on what is and isn't working. So that our

policies end up being static documents and systems that are stuck in bureaucratic inertia rather than allowing for dynamic engagement in terms of what is and isn't working. And I

think that professor Cavia probably is an area where I'd love for you to come in because you've been thinking and working on questions of how do you do that in practice? We all know it's

important. We know there are challenges, right? Like none of us in this room will say otherwise. We need feedback loops. But how can we build those systems of feedback loops and dynamic

accountability and policy responsiveness? Uh thank you for having me here and uh the the work done by Ethina itself speaks so much about the need of the

concept itself and then the scalability the data which they have collected much appreciated. So coming to the question I would say that agriculture is agriculture health care and welfare

schemes they are the source of big data in our country and they should be treated like a big data source. They should not be treated like uh a lab scale work. We make policies but then if

you see our trajectory, our trajectory is from pilot to policy. It this is a very wrong way because pilot is a very very controlled experiment. I do experiments in my lab and the same thing

when I take it out in the field I know there is a small field there is a village a a a cohort a specific uh demographic I am addressing to I know the crops and I am handholding that

particular small group so that is a pilot which I want and then pretty much I'm also interested that these are my expected outcomes so everything is kind of framed in a predictable manner

whereas and then we very merily compile those pilots and then go on and make a policy for the population or for the public. Now this is where the disconnect happens because we do not have

multimodal data. Pilot is very very limited to its frame boundaries or to when we can say it has its own um boundaries which is which it has created. Whereas agriculture is

different. Agriculture I'm not touching upon healthcare but it is no different than this. Uh speaking for agricultures exclusively it is a multimodal sector. You just can't look at a picture and say

that all right this is late blight of potato. You need to know which month it is, what variety it is, what is the soil condition, what weather you are growing in, what state it is coming from. But

when we are making develop uh when we are developing the models, we do not have a point where this multimodel data is integrating or collecting. So what miss is the um accountability because

even if you see the advertisement of the chat GPT and all what are they saying? You ask a question and then they respond. But at the back end there is a whole lot of training which goes inside

and if this training is not on Indian system if this training is not hyper localized if this training is not repetitive that means uh feedback models as uh she rightly mentioned if there is

no feedback loop or a constant learning we we do not have uh you know saying it is self-improvising that would be technically little too alarming but yes the system should keep on improvising

ing itself because the continuous data is coming in and where is this data coming in from the multimodel sources where which are at different positions in the country like rice for example uh

pan India we are growing rice pretty much all hybrid rice we are growing so what is the problem in collecting the data from the different states we would try and have our own area this is our

area where we are collecting the rice from and then we have this data 10 times same area being repeated there there is no diversion or there is no um uh there is no extra data which is coming in or

an alternate. It could be a flood bone, it could be a zinc heavy soil, it could be a farm practice which needs to be improvised. Not everything needs a flush of pesticides. But generally um a static

trained model will give you a static trained response and the the worst part is there is no accountability. Wherever we are talking about trust factor, farmer feels all right. Now earlier you

used to come and talk to me. Now you have a device which is coming and talking to me. But what if it goes wrong? Even when farmer is standing in the field with traditional knowledge

with his all uh all seniors and ancestors and very well experienced people still things go wrong and there is nobody to hold accountable to. And then we expect him that this is the

device. It should replace all your wisdom, all the experience and this is the best thing to be. The world is just moving on moon right now with this device. So you just take it and if you

don't take it, he rightly said there is fear of missing out. You are no more the the mainstream person. So there itself we are creating the layers and these layers are kind of filters which are uh

filtering the profit which are filtering the benefits which are creating barriers to accessibility and also to improvisation. a person or the group of people or the villages which are

technically um smart uh accessible having a good bandwidth of internet near to city having good smartphones uh women usually excluded because either they do not have a smartphone or they do not

have the time to do it. So we are kind of narrowing down with the data with the users and also with the area uh from which we are trying to train our problem which we are trying to train our model.

So in a way um I would say all of this again this becomes multimodal itself. If we have to make a policy it should just not be pilot to policy it should be policy at scale. scale data should go

into developing the policy public to policy not pilot to policy where trust is embedded. Um I strongly um speak for embedded AI which is akin to embedded finance. For example, your WhatsApp and

AEL phone, they were not traditional banks, right? But then they allow you to make payments. Google, they allow you to make payments. As simple in your existing smartphone, you have a payment

making agency sitting there. As simple, you don't need uh that you don't need the knowhow of technology. You just need to have a bank which is somehow linked to it and somehow you can make a

payment. That is the user aspect of it. If we are able to make embedded agriculture, embedded AI for agriculture, the farmer should not feel, oh god, one more app, what do I do with

it? It is not helping me anymore. And then gradually there is a trust deficit. So, and then it all feeds into whether we want to acknowledge it or not, it all

feeds into shallow policies. There is no feedback mechanism. There is no impact assessment of these policies. And then there is no um no improvisation or recovery mechanism that okay this didn't

work let us do that. And the last and the most critical thing is if something goes wrong who's to be held accountable because he has everything which can go wrong and then he has nobody who will

compensate or hold his hands for. So highest stakes lies at the last mile. &gt;&gt; I love that. So I sit on the board of a crop insurance company and we've been joking about doesn't maybe it's not

going to be a joke too soon in the future is an insurance product for AI right so what happens who takes the liability of an advisory going wrong and what's being built into the into

advisory agents today right for instance I'll give you an example of a a pest management platform right they don't want to take the responsibility of what pesticide you use so the farmer still

makes the decisions. You simply provide a connecting bridge to, for example, a drone based service or a a mechanized human facilitated service. So, it's still just a matchmaking facility, but

you're not taking responsibility for advisory yet. Uh, I think that's a really powerful point. And I also want to I think you touched on this so elegantly, exclusion by design, not

inclusion by design. You talked about how you know and again I we've talked about this sometimes poverty is a policy status quo. It's not that by design you are perpetuating or maintaining uh a

state of uh exclusion. These are such powerful points. I do want I know Dr. every single I mean I one of the disadvantages of being the only public sector leader on the panel means I don't

know like these are very complicated issues right like as researchers it's easy to sit here and think about it and write about it and I think there's a there is a a role that we play in a way

as mechanisms of evidence and accountability but when you start thinking about practice what does this what do these yeah how what's the thinking in government today

about questions like these. &gt;&gt; I think uh the the most powerful point was accountability. So you cannot let uh let AI to drive your car and when someone you know if that car hits

someone you you someone can just get scot-free. Someone is has to be accountable. That's why in government when the systems are designed especially uh all the pilot projects very carefully

it is seen that whether that has a relevance for the last mile. It may or may not touch but is it is there a relevance for the last mile? Here comes the role of data is very important. So I

personally see we have so many departments which are data rich &gt;&gt; and but unfortunately the data is not granularized in a form and shape where there is interoperability.

So to have that data layers interoperability we need to have more systems of data sharing. In JNK we are attempting to have some data lake concept. Uh data

lake concept is a new concept where every department pull in their data. If you put AI layer over it then there's a uniform reply. So we we have seen a a case study where if we put AI to one

department the response to a same query will be different than if I put AI to other department's data. It's the same query but the response will be different. Why? because the data is in a

different form and shape. So datas are not talking. So we have so much of data. So I think the most important critical right now in our opinion before we put any AI layer for any use case is to have

good data interoperability, good data exchange which data can speak to each other, good form and shape of the data which can be fed to the systems for training our models. So that we all talk

of model drift, we talk of model hallucinations, very common words. But if our data is like that, what model is going to do? They're going to behave like that only.

&gt;&gt; Absolutely. I want to and I know Francis you've been thinking about &gt;&gt; just like to add one point uh sorry for this interjection. There is a if you just ponder upon it there is a little

bit of a stark difference when the models are made for healthare because there the jargon remains with the doctors uh and that is consistent anywhere in the world you would have

typhoid called as typhoid and TB called as TB and cancer called as cancer but when it comes to agriculture the jargon sits with the farmer and that is extremely extremely diverse I mean we

have language we have dialect and then we have household language generational word for a So creating a data lake and interoperability of the data becomes so

crucial and critical in agriculture and this should be addressed first because for the same thing you will have so many different words which are coming. It is just not how you describe your problem.

Somebody would say stomach ache, somebody would say, somebody would say I'm not feeling comfortable and then doctor would understand based on the treatment uh reports. But in agriculture

it doesn't happen this way. So it is very very sensitive like a thin glass we are walking on. So data pipelines should be very well structured pulminating into data lakes and then data talking to each

other may possibly a be a way wherein we are addressing the big data of agriculture including all levels of dialects and even a household language for a word.

&gt;&gt; Amazing. Gosh. Maybe Francis, I'm gonna make your job harder uh then in a way, right? Um if you because as an AI evaluator and as sort of having spent a lot of time

thinking about this and working on this, Francis, you've been trying to come up with almost like a framework to navigate this complexity, right? that ties in the interests and the incentives and the

practical considerations that government lead with, governments lead with, but also what we know is important from a technology governance, regulation standpoint. And finally, an impact

standpoint, right? In terms of what we know and what matters, right? Like while the language might change, we've now worked across different states, the two biggest things every farmer wants is

better prices and affordable inputs, right? In fact, credit is the third like if you could address these two and then then credit in fact dependence on credit goes down. So it at least the needs are

universal at least there's enough convergence on some of the core things that has a huge impact on their quality of life. But Francis how if you were to sort of think about a framework how

would you go about doing it and do you have advice for governments and practitioners and researchers? &gt;&gt; Thanks Deepa. Yeah. Uh both Dr. Singla and also Professor Cavia ended uh their

like part with very uh difficult question like say the accountability question when something goes wrong uh who's accountable who's like responsible and they also like talked about like

there are several challenges that actually kind of leads to like say lack of interoperability of data or lack lack of feedback from the end users all that kind of like leads to this like a

problem. But like put the question different differently. Uh like we have like lots of pilots from that's what we see in the um literature review as well. Uh but then almost like none of them

have actually kind of like moved on to uh like kind of scale to kind of become part of the like a public infrastructure. So what what would we need uh for a pilot to become a a full

scale uh like like project like say um like what type of like evaluation or governance architecture that we need to like put in place uh like so that the that we are kind of like confident of uh

the the final like results. So along with the literature review we also did like series of case studies uh in Africa and also in India. So from those case studies like what we have actually

distilled like three like a buckets of uh like like issues uh that um that we would need for uh ensuring that the the pilots when they move to like like a scale uh we could be uh like relatively

like more confident of the results that like could like come out of that like so the first uh like a pillar is actually the model safety the model verification that pretty much almost like all the um

uh like a model like builders their application like engineers would actually do. They would be like looking at uh uh the consistency of the results that coming out of the model uh the

efficiency like of the model and so on. But um our in in the in the framework that Athena has actually developed uh the question that we actually ask is like beyond like model uh like like

safety u like like we asking like model safety like like for whom like this has been like say uh um the engineers do like a stress testing like for different types of inputs that like professor

Kavia talked about like say the inputs could come from in varied like fashion because of the language actually changes and so on. So the model could be like a tested in the in the lab like testing

but like was this really tested with like a people in the real world like testing. So that's like for the basic like block for model safety um like say a government that is uh expecting um an

AI model to like be scaled or like a donor that's actually aiming to fund this should be asking like a series of like question on the internal validity of the model itself like what data this

is being trained on uh is is that being trained on like localized like a data that's specific to the context again like quoting like professor like u in in AP that's what in Andhra Pradesh like

within a vicinity of like a 20 kilometer we see there is a massive difference in terms of like say the pest incident in like oil palms like because of like a difference in um soil like moisture like

a soil quality like a weather and and so on. So the the model needs to be trained on ultra like microlevel data. Uh so that the kind of like checklist that we should be looking at to begin with. The

second block again um um Dr. Singler talked about it's actually the the trust and usability. Um so we should be actually asking question is the model being tested in the real world with the

people who will be ultimately like using it. Do they really understand the model or the model producing like say it could be like a chatbot and advisory. Does it really produce outputs that are um like

relatable to them? Is it culturally uh contextually like like a relevant like to them? Um and then there is another angle. So um the end user is one group of like stakeholder. Then there is also

the last mile workers who work with the farmers who are another very important stakeholder in this uh human in the loop like whole process. These are the people who could actually like build the trust.

So this like say extension workers like who've been working with the uh farmers there is actually a level of trust that uh they enjoy and now if we like build this models jointly with the the last

mile workers like say your uh like say like the support team or like the like red team as we call in in AI like language that if this team includes the last mile worker themselves and if the

last mile workers own the model and could really interpret the final output that will increase the level of trust uh like for the like a farmers to uh like take the uh like like results and then

these two blocks once we have once we know that the model is safe and the model is like working well in the real world like like a setup and this is also like culturally and contextually like

relevant and it's like and it's also ethically u relevant as well then we should be looking at like what is the ultimate impact these models are creating that's

something that we see there is a massive gap in the literature there's very little that is actually kind of looked into like what's the final impact on the yield or like say on like a farmer

income and so on this one uh like a like a challenge like even in the morning in Athena's like session on like benchmarking we were talking about um the ultimate impact is a distant goal uh

but a is so fast that uh it can actually the version two can come in like say four months in four months very little changes in agriculture yield may not change like soil quality like may not

change but in in in um in impact like what do we then look at like we should be looking at like at least like some of the intermediate uh outcomes like so for example that say incidence of like pest

or like say the the pesticide like a residue those are intermediate like steps but that will be absolutely important for us to reach the ultimate goal so once we know that this

intermediate steps work then we could be like relatively confident of like the the final step like in one of the one of our ongoing work in Andhra Pradesh that's what our idea we actually looking

at the intermediate outcome in in the second phase we'll be looking at so what's the impact of the precision and spraying that we are like promoting on on the productivity and and the like

residue and so on. So just to summarize like all this so the a donor or a government that is actually looking at uh like a funding or like scaling like AI should be looking at like three like

things like say is it really like a safe to like implement that that's there's an internal validity of the model and then is it really working for the people who actually are intended to like use that

and then we should also be like sure of like what's the impact that it's creating. &gt;&gt; Wow thank you so much Francis. So I do think so what to measure I think

consensus on the what to measure in the context of AI is a good question for us to all ask and find a good answer to and align on and say make it so simple at least you're not having to go back and

think about what this means so not everybody has to figure it out in their worlds. I know we have very little time but I'd like to take at least one or two burning questions from the I'm not

taking anything from the Athena team. I'm sorry. Yeah, &gt;&gt; thank you. I'm Dr. Silender. I'm CEO of Agriati. Agriati. We have uh deployed, we have

prepared the model to use the DPI and UFI going to be from government of India and while Doing that I want to just share one uh example Javier mentioned about extension

worker ownership of the model. So that accountability is there, responsibility is there, someone is there there to just see what is the result. What happened? We have a we are NRA and we are taking

care of our native place and for native place native block we have selected and in our native block we have developed this agriati and we have increased four to eight uh time income of the farmers.

&gt;&gt; Oh lovely. four to eight time we are just converting information into income not only just knowledge we have seen the agree stack of government of India it is static we are building we have built up

the dynamic one so that there is a soil master sensor there is a coordinator uh and it is going delivering directly to pesticide to the farmers and that dynam should be there because it is day-to-day

operation market is there market price is What we have faced the problem that the data data at a block level, district level from government of India that

coordinate is not that much uh uh precise drone is going to somewhere else and these things are there and we make sure that we are our model is from bottom to

bottom up. So that we have we have uh uh selected our native place because we have to be accountable for our native place. &gt;&gt; Okay. Firstly, congratulations. I know I

saw another hand go up and I'm okay. I'm going to can we just get a round of comments and questions and I'll come back. &gt;&gt; Uh amazing discussion and uh just to

introduce myself, I'm a general manager and uh CTO of Sardar AI we AI readiness company. We have already trained 10 million people across the globe and we are creating the personalized AI

role-based courses and certification. So one of the point that you have mentioned and I would like to echo on that as well. Uh I feel the the mechanism which is missing is a reward mechanism

in India. You know Indian runs by heart. So you know you if you want to have an ambid AI if you want to have an inclusive administration if you want to have a proper framework I feel that

reward mechanism has to be driven by the government so that &gt;&gt; mean incentive &gt;&gt; exactly ma'am because see uh in India I think it's it's like it's always you

know what's in it for me so you know if we can figure out that route I feel we will get the last mile information from every single farmer whatever you want. The reason everybody's on the WhatsApp I

tell you uh we seeing that uh there is a digital literacy problem. Uh we have done a survey of more than like 10 million people in India. We see everybody out of 10 million people like

98 percentage people are using WhatsApp. So I feel that it's not about the uh the ecosystem, it's about making the reward mechanism much more stronger. But the amazing panel it was and topic was

really touchy. Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. Gosh quite a few hands. I'm going only going to be able to take two more. I know he had his hand up before and then you and I apologize

for that. I'm going to have to &gt;&gt; Yeah, madam. This is Guru Raj Mahajan. I'm the coordinator for smart agriculture and entrepreneurship program in India for Tampere University Finland.

So we have been working with agricultural universities from past 14 years. So as you mentioned we worked on participatory development. So my question to you is you mentioned about

this is the era of embedded AI devices which are happening. For example, one of the Pune based company they are looking for the soil testing as the soil testing cannot take place across the India. So

there are limited labs. My question to you is how can we what is the solution to reach be we reach out to the final last mile farmers ma'am I mean the specifically uh final marginal farmers

ma'am &gt;&gt; I'll come back after that &gt;&gt; one more &gt;&gt; this is the last one &gt;&gt; yeah thank you very much for giving me

this last opportunity to interact with wonderful panel uh yeah absolutely so it's more of a question or I would not like to bias this discussion by giving my introduction immediately but I'll

hold it for some time but I can give you an experience that I have an experience of meeting or managing the inputs from two and a half 25 million farmers or okay now my point is that uh I'm also a

practitioner of AI and from UT Austin so I keep working on the problems I always believe that agree is very complex in India why don't we take lessons 5 years 10 years back which happened in banking

and health sector see what happened was when the AI got introduced banking and health never went for solving everybody's problem on same day. We don't need to boil the ocean. We just

need to pick up two clearcut problems. Maybe state wise, maybe central wise. Like look at banking thousands of problems but they picked up only that how do I manage my fraud system?

They solved that topnotch and then they created an web of solving the other problems. Similarly, healthcare if I go back 10 years or 8 years back when the AI started building up before it coming

to India, it was primarily how do I solve the breast cancer problem nothing else and whole lot of exercise across the US and other part of the world's directly or discreetly were focused only

on collecting the information around the same nothing else no else to be solved and they just nailed it that created a ecosystem the environment the confidence so what I'm trying to say can we portray

that and bring out agriculture issue one or two and focus only on that. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank There's a data quality question how particularly government of India there is an incentive question

right there is a question of and maybe that's what we end with what's that one burning thing we should solve for in agriculture and then there is a question of feedback loop

can we do rapid who can take can I give it yeah maybe the incentive question &gt;&gt; small part &gt;&gt; so I yeah just &gt;&gt; if each of you could and also the

burning question what is that one problem that you think we should come for and we can close. &gt;&gt; I think it was discussed about the health and the finance sector. It is

about creating the DPI digital public infrastructure which is like a pipeline which can be used for any different kind of purposes. So and many use cases can be drawn to it. Where we are heading is

is creating a DPI structure. So which is based on trust and you can use any number of cases over the years. Over to the next speaker. Thank you. Uh quickly I just want to respond to your uh

question. uh when I said uh like making uh the last mile workers part of the design team uh I meant was uh they would be part of the trust building process and feeding into that not making them as

accountable but like this human in the loop would actually having um the last mile worker would really kind of help design uh and also help the workers like wound this and then would be able to

like build the trust of the like farmers and then in one of the ongoing work that we are thinking about like involving Lakmile workers who would also be empowered to override the uh the results

or like the advisory of the uh like AI and they would feed that information back for the next round the model to like a develop. So that's the human in the loop that would want would make uh

the whole process more trustable and accountable. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Um I would uh answer your question about how to embed AI into the systems. So um it is not impossible but it is not

that easy. uh we are doing it in different areas like I said about finance I also said about u like your communication for WhatsApp but agriculture is little diverse and

agriculture is very very personal to the last ground and the um impact is huge not only for the farmer but even for the nation it just it's a cascading effect the crop loss converts into food loss

and then dollar loss so on so forth so um what I can say is right now that In order to make embed AI for agriculture, it should be the layers which need to be strengthened and um it should be a top-

down approach. The problem definition should be bottom up but the framework should be top down wherein the government or the institution the responsible institution like IICAR or

maybe IT Delhi who's working on that. So would just know that in which area what is the problem who are all the stakeholders just connect them make a small nugget of all the information

which is coming up and then create layers empower each and every layer and there could be a feedback loop which is created. So that is the only way we can have backward and forward talking of the

information which is moving and that actually embeds first it will embed in the pipeline and then it will embed on the device. Uh thanks for that discussion and one

last as as Deepa said one final thought before we close. I think inclusivity is definitely one thing that would be a key takeaway for me. Uh as we talked about having a sweet spot between you know

context specific but also you know intersection of policy and practice. Uh I think participatory designs more uh as opposed to handme-down approaches would definitely be a key takeaway here. So

yeah that's it. so much. A huge round of applause for the West. &gt;&gt; Maybe if we met a year from now and did a systematic review again, we'd see very different results. In anticipation of

that, thank you all for being a wonderful audience and for being here with us and hope you enjoy the rest of the conference. Thank you very much. Okay. Uh and do do the audience have to

say for that? Go have lunch. Yeah. Thank you so much. Now we have done the P pilot work. This is like uh before the exam we have

released the question &gt;&gt; just one question. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; This is the PPD. So folks, I'm going to reset it. Thank

you. &gt;&gt; Yeah, please. We I'll reset it now. &gt;&gt; But you you can retain that uh that page. It's it's going to come back again. Now there are five questions for

Please. Um so here is a quiz. Yeah, this is all AI quiz. Uh Sandstorm, Stanley and Boss. Sandstorm, Stanley and Boss, they

participated in some event which eventually led to the creation of an entire industry. By the way, uh, Sandstorm failed the first time.

Stanley aced it the next year and boss PIP to first place the year after, a few years later. What are we talking about? Show of hands. It's it's AI AI question. Sandstorm Stanley and Boss

they participated in an event which eventually led to the creation of an entire industry. H show of hands. Anybody guesses? Guessing is allowed.

&gt;&gt; Sorry. &gt;&gt; Did they succeed? succeeding what they wanted to achieve. &gt;&gt; Huh? In succeeding what they wanted to achieve?

&gt;&gt; No, you you are you asking me a question or telling me something? &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. Yes. It's Yeah. No idea. Any guesses? Guessing is allowed.

&gt;&gt; Artificial music creation. No, but it's some artificial something. &gt;&gt; Can we have the question again? &gt;&gt; Can we have the question? Yes. Stanley, uh, Sandstorm, Stanley and Boss, they

You know, if I give you the next clue, I think you will you will crack it. Huh? So, this event was taking place in the middle of a desert. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. Yes. There you go. What's your

name? &gt;&gt; Anoj. &gt;&gt; Anoj. So, so the this is the DARPA challenge which led to the creation of their autonomous vehicle

and uh Stanley Stantorm and Boss were the names of the autonomous vehicles. So this is 2004, the Mojave Desert uh $1 million grand challenge that DARPA had announced. And uh which were the two

universities that were involved? &gt;&gt; Stanford had to be &gt;&gt; CMU and yeah, we got the other one. Stanford. Yes, that's true. So UHO Whimo has come out

of this. Vimu has come out of this. Uh, are you in the mood for one more question? &gt;&gt; I mean, I really don't care what answer

you give. I'm just kidding. Yeah. Shall we shall we go for another one? Some energy.

&gt;&gt; I hope you've had some lunch. I mean what I can promise is of course the panelists are going to give you nice food for thought that much is there. Okay. So the uh

the diamond age a science fiction novel by the American writer Neil Stephvenson was published in 1995. Okay. Okay, so the diamond age

was published was a science fiction novel by Stephvenson was published in And so the uh the most powerful piece of uh you know something the the the main

character if you will wasn't a spaceship or a weapon but it was a it was a book. The book was called A Young Lady's Illustrated Primer. Yeah. In that book, in that book, the protagonist was a

book. The book was called A Young Ladies Illustrated Primer. And this was a source of inspiration for someone who created an edute company in 2022 23.

What are we talking about here? Who who is this person? And uh you know there's one person here who can't answer this question though except that person others are allowed to

answer. Swati I'm referring to you. You can't answer this question. &gt;&gt; Oh you didn't hear the question. Okay, good.

&gt;&gt; Khan Academy is not the right answer though. &gt;&gt; That's not the answer. Huh? What is the what's the question? The question is Diamond Age was a

science fiction novel whose main character was a book called The Young Lady's Illustrated Primer. Now that book became a source of

inspiration for someone who created an edutech company in 2022. Khan Academy was not in 2022. Huh? But let's just say you're getting warm.

Come on. If you say Khan Academy, what's next? No Kigo. So it's Sal Khan and this was the inspiration for KIGO

for for more more on this. Of course, Swati will be on the panel and she will share some. So folks, how are we doing on time? We are we're getting there.

Yes, Shavita is also here. Fantastic. Okay, we will we will close this off with one final question. H Okay, this is a this is a good one.

uh Arthur Samuel Arthur Samuel was a pioneering American computer scientist uh IBM Stanford University in the uh so in the in the early days of computer programming

uh if for example games yeah games were coded so if if programmers wrote a game uh they would essentially code in a large number of uh if then rules That's how they used to build the games.

But Arthur Samuel did something different. And uh in 1959 he wrote a game to play checkers. And in writing about it, he coined a a

new phrase which has become very popular. Let's just say the understatement. It's become very popular these days. &gt;&gt; Functions.

&gt;&gt; Which one? &gt;&gt; Functions. No. No. It's a very popular you you can't I mean you come to an AI conference and if you you Yesarning

&gt;&gt; machine learning yes that's right so he coined the phrase machine learning but what did he do anybody what did he do so you know where machine learning comes from

so what did what did uh so by the way if you want more such stories the another panelist on you know another another of our panelists Anil Anandas Swami has written many stories is in his book and

you can read his book and so on. So I'm just setting up the uh panelist this way. We're done. Okay. Fantastic. I think we are ready to

Okay. You know I'd love for the speakers to come and be seated on the stage now. uh so Swati, Shaveta, Anil, uh where is Sunil?

&gt;&gt; Oh, on a call. Okay. &gt;&gt; Uh this is for a photo op. I request all of you to be uh on the stage. Come sit. &gt;&gt; No. Can you stand please?

Good to go. Uh ladies and gentlemen, a very warm welcome to you all on behalf of the Vadwani School of Data Science and AI and the Center for Responsible AI at IIT Madras. Uh it's an honor to be

representing IIT Madras at the impact summit 2026. Uh before we begin um I I'd like to give a quick introduction about the center for responsible AI and the work that we do in case uh some of you

might not be aware of what we do. The center for responsible AI at IIT Madras is a multi-disiplinary nonprofit research center positioned in the global majority. We are among the a few global

institutions uh that specializes in both technical and policy research to ensure and enable responsible development and deployment of AI systems. The center aims to pursue research in ethical and

responsible AI and become the standard body in the country to recommend guidelines and policies to make deployable AI models and systems more accountable, explainable and

responsible. Through its work, CI that which is center for responsible AI brings together researchers, policy makers, industry leaders and civil society to build AI systems that are not

only innovative but also trustworthy and aligned with societal needs. Uh today's panel discussion is a reflection of that and it's my pleasure to introduce our moderator Mr. Krishnan Narayan who's the

co-founder and president of Yihasa research and uh dist over to you sir. &gt;&gt; Thank you Shatsson. Uh and of course I'm I'm very delighted that we have a a sort of a an

outstanding panel panel with us today. Um in fact you know I was thinking so so for example Swati Swati is the country director for Khan Academy India. uh she brings the uh the school you know the

the the school perspective in in this conversation today. Uh Shavita Sharma Kukra uh you know is the managing director of uh CSF central square foundation and uh she brings in a a

perspective of taking these solutions to the to the market and uh you know how how that that implementation happens. uh Shini Pathasarati uh he uh is a professor at Ohio State

University and he brings in the the higher education perspective into the uh into the mix. uh Anil Anat Swami is a is a professor of practice at uh at IIT Madras

uh you know he's authored multiple books one of which is uh why machines learn and so he will bring in the the perspective of uh you know the technology behind

uh safe AI and so on and finally we have Sunil Vadwani founder of Vadwani AI uh businessman investor philanthrop philanthropist So he's going to bring in that perspective into this uh uh into

this conversation. Yeah. So so we have a fantastic panel. Uh it is going to be like a thali for you. Yeah. It's nice some five things. Hopefully you know it'll I have requested them to

keep the answers short and sweet. Uh we also have lots of engagement with uh you know with the panel. Yes, about sir is done. Oh, this is the right. So before we get started, I just

wanted to set a context. Now this is a over the last four years uh I this is my perspective of uh on uh safe AI. Yeah. So uh over the last four years I've been researching this this topic called

co-intelligence. We can keep the mobile phones on silent please. So we've been researching co-intelligence along with professor Wenkar Traaswami from the raw school of

business and Karen Jaman Ozan who's a philosopher and we've been looking at we have identified sort of uh six layers of a co-intelligent systems architecture. Yeah. So on the on the left hand side

the first three layers are more infrastructural if you will. So things like data uh you know the the the models what we call as machining cognition uh the

agentic systems yeah they all kind of the infrastructural aspect cover the the first three layers but that alone is not sufficient is what we argue that in co intelligence systems you need to have

the next three layers which are what I call as phenomenological layers. Yeah. So they the the layer four is where the humans and AI interact with one another. Layer five is life

experiences. So in the case of education systems, it has to take into account life experiences of the students, the teachers, the administrators and so on. And finally the sort of the ecosystem

view that what what learns in in one school how can the entire state sort of understand from it and so on. So my my simple statement is when I whenever I think of safety uh I think of safety

across all six layers of this education coin system. Yeah, that's how I'm I'm going to be framing and uh thinking about it as as our panelists uh speak. Uh

okay. So, so I'll first start off with Swati um you know Khan Migo for Kan Migo which is which is now a learning assistant used by by millions of students uh what

does safe by design look like? &gt;&gt; Thank you for that question and thank you so much for having us and what a great group of uh diverse set of perspectives in this panel. So really

excited to have this chat on such an important topic. You know, you're exactly right. Um, Khan Migo is today being used at a very large scale with about 44 lakh or four more

than 4 million uh teachers. Uh, sorry, students and 14 uh lakh students um sorry for no I said that wrong. That's 40 um lakh students and uh 14 lakh teachers across the world that are using

khan migo and out of which two lakh students and two lakh teachers are in India alone. uh so very large scale deployment already and we do believe very strongly that uh any AI tool has to

be very thoughtfully designed with the learner um at the center of it um and responsibly tested to ensure safety security and privacy of the learner and everybody else that's involved in

interacting with the tool uh and KMIGO like you said is built with a lot of those safeguards uh in it uh for example first uh KIGO sits on top of Khan Academy at tech platform platform which

um has worldclass content in it which has been u properly quality checked ratified and aligned to state curriculum uh board. So um it's pulling content from high you know highquality

well-known set of library and not just from anywhere from any unratified unqualified um you know content u source. That's number one. Number two it's also Khan

because the Khan Academy platform does not capture any personally identifiable information about the student. So Khan Migo does not have access to that information either. So that's another

very important safeguard that's built in from the get-go. And third, Khan Migo does have the ability to uh it in fact logs all the interaction that the student has with Kan Migo and uses that

information to identify any potential risk risky situations or potential risky um interactions for the student and unsafe uh potential situations and flags it to the teacher. uh so that's kind of

how the tool has been designed with all of these things in in uh in mind but more importantly I would say we are deploying kanigo today at a large scale in India uh in a teacherdirected manner

&gt;&gt; so it's um it's got human control and supervision that's at the you know at the not just at the center of it but it's leading the deployment of kan migo and um so I think that adds another

layer uh and the moment you bring in some a tool AI tool in an integrated fashion with existing systems and not as a separate thing that's sitting on the side unsupervised uncontrolled then that

jury that's out on um AI being safe or risky I think that starts to um tilt very heavily towards the benefit side of AI. Uh so to me in a nutshell what I'm trying to say is that uh it's not say

you know design for safety is not just about designing the de the the tool the development of the tool but it's in in fact I would argue more about the deployment of the tool and the

implementation um making it human directed making sure that uh it's supervised and controlled by human beings um and um and and we're doing that we we're scaling it in a very very

thoughtful manner step by step uh capturing learnings uh at a small pilot uh level what's working what's not working what makes it safe and then and investing in that capacity development

and only then taking it to scale &gt;&gt; right right no in fact I I have read about the socratic way in which the things are taught to the the students and so on so it's fantastic uh in the

India pilots Swati were there any u safety constraints which were different than than in the in the in the U or were they similar in India? &gt;&gt; Yeah. So I think see students are

similar everywhere in terms of the risks attached to um education learning process. uh we have to be mindful of similar things across the board whether and I'll give you an example in one of

the Latin American countries where Khanigo is being used KIGO was able to identify a particular specific situation which uh where the student was at potential for harm self harm and it it

got identified by Kanigo it got flagged to the teacher and the potentially very harmful situation was avoided so that is a very good example and in which is a developing country as well in India

similar ly we are not having to uh do anything that different from how it's being done in the US. the guardrails work equally well everywhere and they must right just because you're a

developed nation or a developing nation it doesn't matter children need as much safety everywhere that's kind of our philosophy uh and you're right socratic method is used everywhere um which is

why even for B2C where the children are using it on their own and it's not teacher directed how do you ensure safety for those children not just in terms of social emotional wellness and

safety but also learning safety so you're not messing with their minds and making them dumber number. How do you ensure that? And that's where Socratic nature comes in. So it doesn't give you

the answer, it leads you to the answer &gt;&gt; and that's across the board. &gt;&gt; Okay, good. Okay, so now we will we will go to the audience question. Uh I'm going to reset this slide.

Okay, I'm going to request you to now access this. It should have come up on your screen. So what is the biggest safety risk of AI in education right now? There are five choices.

Don't be shy. I encourage you more of you to participate. In fact, we uh you know we we did discuss as a as a panel and we we really want to understand what uh you know what

the audience is thinking here. So the more of you participate that'll be wonderful. So don't shut the uh your this thing just keep it on because the next

question when it comes will automatically get refreshed on your on your phones. Yes. &gt;&gt; I can only select one &gt;&gt; right. Right now I have forced you to

choose one. Your topmost one. &gt;&gt; All of them. All of the above. See, that's why we didn't we didn't choose all of the above or none of the above.

Great. So, uh about 67 70% seem to think student dependency reduced thinking seems to be the the uh the biggest risk right now.

Uh so, Shini, I I come to you next. So you know this can remain here or maybe you'll get tempted to keep filling in the answers. So this is done now we

are just moving forward but this is going to be the next question. Okay let it be there. Okay. So, Shini I I'm I'm I'm coming to you. So, so that we get a you know, Swati gave a school

perspective. We'll get a a higher education perspective from you. So, in higher education sort of AI touches many aspects writing, grading, admission support, research workflows, etc. So,

what does safe AI mean mean to you? &gt;&gt; I think it's a very important I think it's a very important question. Um, I come from Ohio State University where we just announced what I think is

one of the first AI fluency programs, which basically by the time a student graduates from the university, they would have touched AI in some part of their curriculum, regardless of which

part or discipline they come from. So we're talking you know 60,000 students across uh over a 100 disciplines that the university covers and so safety is a

paramount in terms of the implementation safety is a paramount question in this context. Um let me give you a couple of examples where you know where these things sort of provide major challenges.

I mean think about the current role in admissions. How do you admit a student into the program? Um, right now, so students are increasingly using AI to write down their statements of purposes,

their CVs. Professors who write recommendations for them increasingly using LLM technologies. So, it's hard to sort of really understand, you know, what the individual is is doing. On the

other side of the boat, counselors are using AI to filter candidates. Um, and so we are really what we're moving towards and and this scares me no end. What we're moving towards is essentially

using AI to evaluate someone else's use of AI as opposed to the individual. I mean this this is as you can imagine this is a problem. Now, of course, when we talk about in the classroom safe use

of AI, we we absolutely have to embrace it because AI can democratize access and I think that's really important. There's a real win here, but we have to do this with careful guardrails. Now, what does

that mean? As a professor, I used to love open book exams because I didn't want to disadvantage people who did not have the best memorization skills. they could actually understand the concept,

work with things and do that. But now the danger is if I have to set an openbook exam, I have to run these questions through five different frontier models, hope none of them

capture it and only then can I vet it and actually provide it and even then there's no guarantee because what I set you know last semester frontier models are advancing so fast on some of these

things that you know by next semester they would have solved that. So I have to come up with new clues. But okay, that is something I'm willing to do. But the real concern and this is related to

this question. My position on this question is the biggest harm that I worry about with you know introducing too much AI into the classroom. When I was a student, I learned not only from

my teachers, not only from my books, but from peer interactions. Today's peer interactions is ask Claude, ask Geminy. And I'm worried about the cognitive decline and you know the mental health

aspects of that and we've seen this we've had like more than two decades of social media where everybody is on I this Instagram that Facebook whatever okay and so you are seeing and in we are

now at a point where we can measure some of these things and so that is a critical harm you touched on research just one point on research there was a recent paper in nature two days ago I

believe which pointed out that the use of LLM technologies seems to be helping people at least in terms of getting NIH grants. NIH is the National Institutes of Health. Um it's one of the largest

funding bodies in the United States for health related applications. But one of the comments that came out of this which concerned me and it's kind of ironic in a way is that a lot of the ideas that

are coming through are kind of safe bets. they're not the high-risk high reward which you want in research and that's a challenge and a potential harm as well

&gt;&gt; right I mean I I can I can uh I relate to this I conduct a a college level hackathon in India for global learning council uh last year when we did it I was essentially we were all judging uh

various LLM answers so this year we said absolutely no responses in English from the students just give us the model that you built and we'll evaluate you. Yeah. But u

Okay. Now Shini, you you've developed tool for uh for or online fairness auditing of AI systems. Yeah. A war is a tool that you have built. Uh what what what does a war in the context of uh of

an AI system in education? What will it mean? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Again, when you when you think about auditing or evaluating, we're trying to monitor things that are, as I

think uh Shua pointed out, things that are deployed. Okay. And so uh the um the deployment it depends on who you're deploying it to. So for example, I I said, you know, OSU is going through

this AI fluency effort where, you know, you're training the next generation of a medical doctor. You're also training the next generation welding engineer. You're also training the next generation

historian or literature student. When you say auditing, it depends on context. Another point that she made in in the context of Khan Academy. So context matters here. Who you are auditing. And

again the other point and very related to her answer as well is there's a human in the loop the learner the teacher. So there are humans in the loop. So when you audit a system um or when you audit

learning uh outcomes and things like that you are auditing the entire process. It's not just you know the machine learning model that's being used or the AI model that's being used. This

is a hard hard question. Now for some things we have reasonable approaches regulatory approaches or you know part of the fiber of a of a university or a college or an institute you know we have

you know data must be protected okay there must be privacy one must ensure that data is not released through this interaction with an LLM system so we have reasonable definitions on that but

when it and even for fairness as it relates to regul regulatory fairness. But where things become really challenging and amorphous is that safety is you know when you look at something

yeah that's safe that's not safe this is unsafe borderline safe you can when you look at something you can say it but it's very hard to determine these specifications a priority for safety and

that's what makes this problem really challenging so to speak in the education but we're trying to figure it out as I said you know we we announced this this is going into sort of our curriculum Um,

and pretty much every student who graduates by 2030 will have sort of this AI fluency effort as part of their degree at Ohio State. And so we've got to figure this out fast.

&gt;&gt; Yes, you've got to figure it out. Okay, so time for the next uh audience question. Um, you know, if if forced to choose, what should educational institutions

prior prioritize first? So, I'm going to start this I mean the I panelists too can &gt;&gt; Okay. Huh. This seems

sort of balanced or &gt;&gt; you know this is this is the other thing I I use this in in in a class that I teach at IT Madras. I always have hundreds of people who who show this sad

face emoji and then I usually have some friends who take over and and then and then put that 100 100 plus happy face emojis. So okay so I think we are it's sort of

settling in now. Good good good responses. Uh learner learning gains is is exam integrity. &gt;&gt; Sorry,

how are we &gt;&gt; ensuring exam integrity? &gt;&gt; How are we ensuring &gt;&gt; in the poll? &gt;&gt; It's in the poll.

Only one person can uh answer. I mean only one answer per per person. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Huh? Per phone. Per phone. Yes. Of course. If you have many phones, you know, Professor Ravi, he he knows

all the tricks of the the trade here. Okay. But so learning gain seems to be the top most, but student safety and well-being also is like Yeah. So the it seems like a good uh

uh Okay, good. So next we will move to Anil. uh Anil uh you know in why machines learn you sort of explain the math behind the AI systems. So put on the that math math

cap. If a if a school system now claims an AI tutor is safe, uh what evidence would you would you want to see before accepting it before it scales?

&gt;&gt; Oh, um I'm not sure there's a math answer to that. Um I think u for me if I'm thinking about these systems being deployed um in schools uh I would want to see

some evidence of a framework that addresses multiple issues. uh one obviously would be uh whether these systems are fair and unbiased right uh for instance if we are using AI systems

to tailor the educational content that is being delivered to students and um you know maybe these systems are trained on native English speakers and you certainly have especially in the context

of India we have people who might be speaking heavily accented English and somehow these systems uh you know determine that uh someone speaking with an accented uh English is

probably uh less capable uh in terms of their educational qualifications and and ends up being fed material that is probably you know less intense than somebody else who might be speaking

fluent English. So those kinds of lot of issues that need to be worked out as to how content is being delivered and how students are being guided in the trajectories they take uh through their

educational journey. So a framework that you know so in terms of seeing uh in terms of wanting evidence about how this is being deployed some framework that is addressing this u also uh potentially uh

looking for whether uh these systems have uh humans in the loop. I really would like to see teachers having the ability to override uh certain decisions that the eyes might make. M

&gt;&gt; so again you know are these systems in place uh also before going &gt;&gt; but can I can I just push back a little bit on that?

&gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; So one of the arguments for human the loop has been hey there must be a teacher. &gt;&gt; Mhm.

&gt;&gt; But but then there are others who argue look hey my the child wants to understand you know at 10:00 in the night the teacher is not available so you must make this system available to

the to the student on their own. How would you you know the the teacher in the loop is not available now. &gt;&gt; Um fair point and um but I think there there must be some way

for the educational institute uh you know which might be an individual teacher a bunch of teachers doesn't matter some humans who are able to audit the trajectory itself that is being

pursued by a student you know it doesn't have to be at the granularity of looking at it every night but somewhere along the line you need a human in the loop. Sure.

&gt;&gt; Um the other thing before scaling would be that before you deploy it let's say if you taking a Indian state with you know uh tens of thousands of schools instead of doing it across the board

&gt;&gt; actually testing this out in a few local schools somewhere right &gt;&gt; making sure that these things work. So a framework that addresses these issues uh I would like to see those things in

&gt;&gt; Sure. Sure. Okay. So here is the the uh tough question for you. uh if if if an AI tool causes harm in a school, harm in a school as in it could be in the form of uh some misguided uh misguides

learning or or undermines the agency of students and things like that. Uh who should be accountable, held accountable. So um we all had this discussion offline before and uh you know my answer to this

was that I think responsibility in terms of safety of AI systems uh cuts across the board. It begins with people who are curating the data for training AI systems because you know we know well

enough by now that a lot of issues of bias and fairness arise from the quality of data. Then there are you know responsibilities that lie with the algorithms you know the people who are

choosing the algorithm there's algorithmic fairness and bias. So out there too there's responsibility to do with uh the model developers and uh mean again you know when we think of AI

these days most of us just think of LLMs but that's not it. There's a whole bunch of other AI models. you know understanding what are the inherent biases and capabilities of individual

models and being able to uh pinpoint where these problems might be arising from. So there's you know responsibility at that level. The deployers of these uh systems are again you know uh have uh

some onus upon them to make sure that what they're deploying uh uh is safe. Uh end users too. So I really think it cuts across the board and yes the ar you know it's it's a kind of a argument that goes

nowhere when we point fingers at everybody but the other way to think about it is these are such complex systems that we are developing that I think by making sure that everybody

feels the onus of responsibility we at least start from the ground up by building things &gt;&gt; that are fair and responsible &gt;&gt; I mean on a lighter note anil like you

is all of the above guy But it's a but it's a serious point that you say. I I just want each one of the other panelists. Yeah. Just one uh just one word, not a long answer, but what do you

think? What's what's your answer to this? Who should be held accountable? If an AI tool causes harm in a school, who should be held accountable? &gt;&gt; So, I kind of agree with with what Anel

said. It it is a shared responsibility. But I think what you mean is who should be liable? &gt;&gt; Li. Okay. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, accountable I think all

Definitely true. But I I think liability it it it is a function of individual cases. It's not a one-sizefits-all solution. &gt;&gt; It depends. Okay.

&gt;&gt; Great. &gt;&gt; Good point. &gt;&gt; Um so I'll be more direct. I think the system that approves its deployment at scale will have to be held liable and

accountable. Which which is &gt;&gt; I mean typically if you're scaling up &gt;&gt; is that school is that a school or &gt;&gt; uh so typically at least in the government system an individual school

will not make the decision the state will typically make the decision if I am a independent school then the school owner or the leader is making the decision but uh while everyone is

accountable the liability is with the person who approves the deployment at scape that unit. &gt;&gt; Sure. and Swati &gt;&gt; I'll do a plus one to what Shavata just

said. uh because to me uh the accountability yes responsibility is for everybody but the accountability really lies on the ones who are strategizing and designing the deployment and for a

simple reason that and I'm I'm not absolving the ones who are developing the tool completely off it because yes they are they have to exercise the responsibility but we also have to

recognize that you cannot make a 100% safe and accurate um AI tool you just cannot so what you have to do is ensure there are checks and balances is while you're deploying it. So the deployment

person it's the onus is on them to ensure that there are checks and balances um taken into account while designing the deployment process. &gt;&gt; Right? Okay. So audience question

uh would you accept an AI tutor that is 5% wrong? Okay. That is wrong 5% of the time but it helps reach 10 10x more children. So access it's doing great work but it's

5% of the time wrong. Would you accept? &gt;&gt; Yeah. It could it could be could hallucinate. You are absolutely right. you know, when you when you question it, it will it

will give the the exact opposite answer and it'll say, "You're absolutely right." By the way, uh I love this crowd. Netnet, we are positive on the the

positive things here. Thank you. &gt;&gt; No, no, no. I'm saying the &gt;&gt; smiles. Smiles. Smiles. &gt;&gt; See, I am I am looking at the at the real metrics that matter to me.

But only with the teacher. So human in the loop. The human in the loop seems to be the the winning. Yes. Okay. Great. Okay. Fantastic. So now we move to Shaveeta.

&gt;&gt; Um you know what does safe mean for the for the global south for the for the students the teacher systems from the from the low-income communities? What

does it mean? &gt;&gt; No. Um before I answer uh I was introduced as I bring the perspective of the system uh when professor Shini was talking I also bring the perspective of

a parent to two students in high school who understand AI definitely better than the mother does in most cases better than the teachers and the counselors does I'm hoping not better than the

admission officers but uh it's uh it's a lived reality uh and also conscious of saying it in the AI summit But uh to keep things simple, the more

things change, the more they remain the same. And I want to go back to the basic of safety in the global south for AI. And why just global south? I would say also for the global north goes back to

how any education intervention will be considered safe when all design and governance choices do not lose sight of what the pedagogy is, what the curriculum expects to be covered, what

are good instructional practices. So at the center of AI adoption has to be these criteria on human role and judgment, instructional p practices, pedagogy and curriculum. For a student,

it means it has to be age appropriate. It has to be curriculum appropriate, content appropriate. A lot of AI engagement is happening for students without them realizing it. I think it

took us a long while for many of us as adults to realize when we are engaging with AI chat bots versus a live customer service agent. Imagine what it's doing to our children. So it has to be age

appropriate and centered around sound instructional practices. That's what safe looks in for a student perspective. From a teacher perspective, it has to be transparent and assistive. Anytime if we

we dare to imagine a world where AI is being looked as a substitute is where we run into it being unsafe both from a design perspective, governance perspective, uh adoption perspective.

You know to your prior question on who who is accountable, who's responsible, who's liable. At the end of the day, any solution needs to be integrated into how the education system runs its schools,

teaches the students, what's the role of the teachers, how is their capacity being built, how are they being supported, how are they also being held accountable. So a system which gets

anchored on pedagogy on relevant instructional practices with human judgment and adoption at the center age and grade appropriate for students assistive and transparent for teachers.

&gt;&gt; Fantastic. But I want to just push back a little bit. I mean and uh both you and Swati sort of seem to indicate maybe I'm or maybe I'm getting this wrong which is like hey safety is more or less the same

whether it's global north or global south uh it's the same yeah but but the the the context seems to be very different in global south the the access issues

and so on. So I'm just I'm just asking can it be the same or uh you know whatever there's no right wrong answer but I just want to &gt;&gt; I'll tell you from my perspective right

access is a different dimension that we're talking of how many children access AI in global north versus global &gt;&gt; the quantum of students can change &gt;&gt; now whether in the global north 100

students are accessing and in the global south five are accessing why should safety norms be different &gt;&gt; to me the axis of safety doesn't override the access of access and vice

versa. At least that's how I look at it. But Swati, you want to add? &gt;&gt; Yeah, I actually completely agree with what Shvata said and I think uh what you might be looking for uh which again is

more on the access side and less on the safety side is the ability of the student to be able to actually benefit from the AI and interact with it comfortably by making it in their own

language, making it uh easier to interact with uh because the the content that it's pulling is also in vernacular. the interaction is in vernacular. I think those are some of the things that

you might be thinking about but to me that's again more access side. Yeah. &gt;&gt; I I'll I'll tell you one perspective like uh in my company uh we we've run some you know sort of digital society

surveys. Uh now one of the one of the things that we find different in in India is is a trust in the government systems and the and the reason one of the

hypothesis we gave was because the literacy levels in digital is lesser in India. They they they generally depend on a on an external system to for uh you know

approval and and so on. And so given that the literacy levels among children here are lower perhaps even among the teachers are lower I'm once again I'm just I'm just pushing this out saying so

in the in the global north you might say hey teacher can take responsibility but I might I might go around and say even even in India even teachers may not be a aware so maybe there is greater thing in

terms of putting in the system itself some guard rails uh for example which may be different &gt;&gt; very fair point and in fact I have an example to

Exactly your point and add to that &gt;&gt; uh you're right in the overall learning journey there are more stakeholders involved in India &gt;&gt; um that need more awareness building and

capacity building including parents because and the process of doing that is very different because in the US if you don't do that capacity building and awareness building for the parents you

can still get away with a little bit of that uh and I know I'm going on a limb here but to to to say that out loud but in India you cannot afford to do that for example

um the devices are shared in India in the government school system. So the students do not get adequate time on a device to be able to access an AI tool and work on it. So what we need is a

seamless integration of classroom and at home and the moment you talk about at home again to make it safe it needs to be supervised and how do you and who's going to supervise it a parent and most

of these parents for the underserved students government school students in India are some literate to illiterate so how do you ensure safety over there when they you know get past that school

boundary and get into the homes so I think that's where you're exactly right that point does come in and We have had to take extra precaution of doing B to G to C utilizing the teachers to and

equipping them with all the tools and um communication um um collaterals etc for them to be able to have a commun that conversation with the parents and the parent teacher meeting to make the

parents aware so that they have some mechanism to apply that supervision even though they're illiterate. For example, is okay, right? We've literally had to do that.

&gt;&gt; In fact, uh Shavita, that's a great segue for for the question uh to you next. You know, through AI summer initiative that uh you and I mad and others are are driving. I mean you we

are working on AI literacy for for school children and teachers. Yeah. So tell us a little bit about that and how why this is important. I mean we already set the context but

&gt;&gt; hit it for a six now. I think it goes back to um you know we are taking the initial steps to the vision of again I'm going back to when professor Shini was talking about AI fluency

again I'm repeating myself but we live in a digital country we are in a country that's par that's proud to be a digital powerhouse you know we're talking about okay teachers and students on an average

are more literate in the global north versus global south but we are a digital first country in many ways is ahead of the so-called global north right now in this context whether or not we realize

it AI is governing my search history even for a student even for a teacher uh it's showing up recommendations it's giving up unsolicited answers not everything follows the socritic method

uh it is of course not sharing with me what percentage of error I am is there a human loop or is there a tool in the loop in this world for us The very first step towards this vision of AI for all

is does everyone every student every teacher and parent understand what is AI? How is it already beginning to engage in my education journey? And based on the

two, how can I become an active user of AI? Whether or not we like it, AI is shaping any child who's spending time on a device for learning. As a 2024 showed, 82% of children in the 14 to 16 years of

age group use smartphones for learning. CSF conducted a bare tech survey in 2023. upwards of three quarters children are spending more than 30 minutes on their device. Now the moment we look at

these two factual these two figures right we know that that percent of children is interfacing with AI without realizing it. How do we move them from passive users to actually having agency

making informed safe and responsible decisions? And that is really the attempt with AI Samart. Uh proud of the work that's already happening in close collaboration with IIT Midros. As of

last month, already 1 million students and teachers across 10 states in India have started engaging on AI literacy. And the vision is for that to you know build on to the levels of AI fluency and

when the human in the loop is actually an empowered aware and active user rather than you know I don't know what's taking over my life &gt;&gt; right no so kudos on the 1 million one

small cheer okay so the next question to the audience Should schools keep logs of student AI conversations?

You know, for safety and audits, of course, but should they keep logs of student AI conversations? What do you think? I mean Shini does have a good point. He

says look we can have logs but but really who has access to the logs? That's the important question. Good. Triny, you're not grading my my questions. No,

&gt;&gt; Rabbi is doing great. &gt;&gt; Okay, it's &gt;&gt; okay. It's settling in here. Yes, but anonymized and minimized. You know, we did have a discussion. You

see the the thing with logs. uh of course it helps in in making more personalized learning and so on so that there is some way for example teachers also have access to it so they they they

can they can come back that's on one side but on the other side there are issues about students having a uh a safe space to to answer questions mental health issues and things like that but

really who has access to this that's the the critical question okay Sunil we come to you Next, the uh put on the philanthropic funer hat. Uh how do you decide whether an an AI and education

idea is is worth funding scaling? &gt;&gt; Sure. Before I answer that question, let me just respond to the conversation that's been happening. Forgive me. So just for context, my own

background is a little bit tech based. I went to IIT then I went to the US went to Carnegie Melon got a master's degree and I've started a few technology companies both company failed other

companies did a little better one thing I learned very early on is that there is nothing in the world there is no solution in the world tech or AI that is perfect right everything

involves a trade-off my first company was a medical device company but these things didn't work patients got harmed But did it work 100% of the time?

Probably not. But overall, the benefits outweigh the risks. Automobiles are a great example, right? We all use cars. We don't think about it. They kill a million people a year

plus around the world. Yet, society has made a choice that it's worthwhile. The benefits outweigh the risks. When we come to AI, we have to keep that perspective in mind. And my concern in

discussions like this is we tilt too far one we tilt too far one way or the other. So let's look at the social sector, right? We've got over 8 billion people in the world. 3 and a

half to four billion people do not have access to decent healthcare, do not have access to decent education. AI could be transformative today. It is starting to become transformative today.

Yet are these systems 100% perfect? No. Do the benefits greatly outweigh the risks? Yes. So I'll give you a practical example. So I started six seven years ago in India an artificial intelligence

foundation and prime minister Modi G came inaugurated lava. I've got about 400 full-time people in this foundation in Bombay, Delhi, Bangalore. We've developed over 25 AI platforms that are

now scaling up nationally. Many of them are becoming national platforms. As part of this about 18 months ago, we got a call from the government of Gujarat.

My team went in. They said, "We have a large problem with the very high school dropout rate that we have in early grades, grades 1 through five, especially among young girls. Do you

think AI can help?" We did the analysis and we learned that the primary reason for this and of course once you drop out of school it affects the rest of your

life. It affects the earnings you make. It affects the health that you have. it affects you know your skills and especially when it happens to young girls it it affects not only them but

their families so we did the analysis on why is there this high and by the way this high dropout rate is not just Gujarat it's around India and it's the entire global

the single biggest reason it turns out for this high dropout rate is the inability of these young children to read proficiently in their mother tongue so in this case this was Gujarat

and 50 to 60% of the children in grade five couldn't read in Gujarati effectively even at the second grade level when you can't read it affects how you do in every subject geography

science history literature and if you struggle in every subject you say why am I doing this and in low-income families your f you know your parents say okay come home start working etc so we've

come up with a suite of AI solutions that basically we do an assessment in 20 seconds for each child we figure out what's their reading proficiency level where exactly are they struggling on

what words what are the patterns etc based on that we come up with a diagnostic based on that we come up with a remediation plan we divi we divide each class into cohorts of people with

similar issues and we guide the teacher and the parents on how to address this the results results that we started getting in the pilot were impressive enough that about six seven months ago

the Gujad government made it mandatory. All 3 million children and government schools in Gujarat are getting assessed and remediated with the tools that we have. Thank you. Then Rajasthan saw this

and about 3 months ago we became mandatory in all all the schools in Rajasthan. Now it's spreading into 10 states and if all goes well by the end of next year

2027 million children in India will be improving their reading proficiency thanks to this and again I'm not bragging about what we've done. Any

other competent AI team could have developed any of this. Here's the point I'm I'm leading up to. Would these systems pass all these AI audits and frameworks and all? Probably

not. I don't know should we wait 5 years or 10 years to have the perfect system and in the meantime 30 million or 50 million kids in the global south don't get educated. So the only point I'm

trying to make is it's good we need safety obviously in AI systems. We need lack of bias obviously but we have to keep in mind again that we have to make an intelligent choice

and are the benefits strong enough to outweigh the risks? We have to manage the risks but we push ahead. Sorry that was a digression to come back to your question. How do we select what AI

issues to work on? Whether it's healthcare or education or agriculture, we work in all these domains. We take a look at number one, is it an issue of importance to the government? So whether

it's the national government or the state government, is this one of their top three or four priorities over the next three or four years? So as an example in health, we work very closely

with the health ministry in Delhi and with about 12 15 states. They told us two or three years ago tuberculosis is a huge issue. It's probably the number one or number two priority in India and in

fact much of the global south. Close to 2 million people every year die of TB. So we've developed a whole suite of TB solutions that are now being used by the central TB division. In education this

oral reading fluency is expanding dramatically. So again number one we look at how important is it for government. The reason we do that is the only way systems scale

when you're talking about disadvantaged communities is by working with government. So you have you talk to them right from the beginning. The second thing we look

at is is this actually appropriate for AI. M &gt;&gt; do we have the right kind of data or can we collect the right kind of data so you can train your models on good data and

that is where safety and bias and all of that comes in thirdly before we start building any AI system we ask this very important question how will it scale and we've learned the hard way

it's complex when you're talking about giant government systems So let's say in education, you know, you've you're talking about working at the last mile with teachers. You're talking about

working with state governments on execution. You're talking about the central government on policy. How will this get out to the last mile? It's not easy. And that is the single biggest

reason why 98% of all the wonderful AI solutions that have been developed for the social sector don't scale. They go nowhere. They may be totally safe. They may be

unbiased but they don't improve people's lives. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; So right up front we work with government. We'll talk to the joint

secretaries in Delhi. We'll talk to the heads of the national health min missions at the state level. How are we going to train the frontline health workers or teachers or farmers to use

the system? Where will that data go? How do we manage it at the state level etc. So we look at that. Absolutely. We look at safety and bias and then there's a feedback loop as you go through.

&gt;&gt; Good. Triny, you had a point to make. &gt;&gt; No, I I was in complete agreement. I I think that's the reason Ohio State's embarking on this AI fluency. It's a total embracing of the AI and and the

fact that it's here to stay and it's really really important for you know democratizing access and your example in Gujarat which I had read about um is is is you know really a valuable learning

experience in terms of the kinds of things AI can bring to the table. I think the the the key challenge for us in terms of implementation is that we have to work with our state government

and our you know federal laws and things like that to make sure that you know whatever we're doing because like for example the holy grail of you know related to this question that you asked

all student logs are kept but access to those are incredibly protected and and they can be really useful for you know student learning outcomes. and things like that. So I think I mean 100% agree

with the point you made. Right. &gt;&gt; Okay. Excellent. We'll go to the uh the next uh audience question. The last one

&gt;&gt; since we were talking about this See that &gt;&gt; parent? Yes. It's uh you know we'll we'll we'll wait for a few more minutes for the thing to

settle. Time is up. Yes. &gt;&gt; Okay. So what what we were essentially looking at if you see whether people are choosing more decentralized

uh mechanisms or centralized mechanisms. Yeah. So the the teacher principle perhaps is more decentralized in that sense. So that's about uh 50 60% of the the answers are are there. Okay.

Excellent. So we've we've had a fantastic uh round. I mean I they they've told me we are run we have run out of time. There were a few more rapidfire questions but we will reserve

that for the later and I just want to uh end this with some closing thoughts. I mean I I've made tons of notes here. Uh teacher directed uh peer interactions was something that

I that I picked up. Uh human in the loop that was something that came out. uh a framework for fairness and unbiased way uh pedagogy rules etc. number of different points have come

out. These are some closing thoughts. Uh like I like I initially said the coin systems I think it's important to look at trustworthy by design across the six layers uh all the six layers uh harm

management for example uh as an ecosystem governance. So uh harm to students uh harm to institutions and harms to the society. So think at uh multiple levels and how how we can uh

prevent them. Uh safety is co-agency. Yeah. So this is a very important uh uh aspect especially for digitally unsophisticated learners. How do we give that uh that uh agency that this is

exactly the human in the loop? Yeah. So routed to a teacher and so on that becomes important. Uh and the last point you know the scale inclusion governance as an infrastructure layer. Just uh uh

two days back we had a a conference here called the Bodhen AI conclave where you know exactly in Barat Mandapam where where uh the uh government of India's center of excellence for AI and

education was uh was announced uh IT Madras is uh is leading that that effort and the effort is to create such kind of DPIs uh for uh for education. So that's the

thing. Thank you. A warm round of applause to &gt;&gt; we have a small uh No, there's one.

&gt;&gt; Yes. Uh we have a small moment from Oh, thank you. This one. This one. &gt;&gt; I think they want the logo. Sir, how are you sir? Hold on.

Oh, here we are. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. Are y'all? Heat. Heat. I

feel Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey. Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.

Hey. Hey. Hey. Hallelujah. How? Watch out.

global priority not just the national priority. Today we are going to witness magnificent stride by seeding seeds of global collaboration between India and Israel for jointly pushing the global AI

agriculture agenda. We from IIT Roper are looking forward to global collaboration for technology assisted agriculture. We at IIT Roper a new generation of Indian Institute of

Technology from the state of Punjab that is regarded as an agriculture basket of the country. Thanks to Miss Maya from Embassy of Israel to India to cultivate this global collaboration that started

from an Indian delegation to Israel to this day where we are having a joint dialogue for global collaboration to bring artificial intelligence impact on agriculture. We at IIT Roper are

dwelling into AI revolution for agriculture with our national initiative Anam AI foundation an artificial intelligence center of excellence for agriculture under Ministry of Education

a nodal center of excellence of the entire country for agriculture. Ladies and gentlemen, as we kickstart our session on Egri AI, advancing responsible artificial intelligence for

agriculture, please join me in welcoming our inaugural panel speakers, our chief patron director, IIT Roper, Professor Rajiv Ahuja. I'll request you to please be standing here. We will also invite

everyone for a group photograph. I take pleasure in welcoming professor Victor, research scientist, Institute of Agriculture and Biosystem Engineering from Israel.

&gt;&gt; So join me in welcoming Dr. Gal, head of research and policy department, Israeli public employment services. Dr. Gal will request you to be here with us. Please join me in welcoming Professor

Dove, founder and director of Zevi Mater Institute. Please Dr. Da &gt;&gt; and ladies and gentlemen join me in welcoming his excellency Ruan Ezar ambassador of Israel to India.

We'll also take a moment of inviting our other speakers Miss Nimsisa, Mr. Mayures, Miss Urmi, Miss Maya and Dr. MKkesh Keswal for a group photograph.

Should we come? So you can come &gt;&gt; gender balance. Five, please.

It's our almost pleasure to have the amazing lineup. We look forward to have thoughtprovoking inputs on global AI for agriculture collaboration. The new dawn for AI impact jointly together by India

and Israel. to start with our panel. We are awaiting for professor Victor but I think so we can start with the panel. So to kickstart the session and for setting the right tone for this global

collaboration between India and Israel for artificial intelligence and agriculture I request our chief patron professor Rajiv Bahuja to start with the vision behind bringing India and Israel

together for agriculture. I think I we can start now. So thanks Radhika and uh thanks for his excellency you came here all the way and uh it's a really a great pleasure for IT roer be

part of this uh collaboration and a part of this event actually and uh if you as Radhika already mentioned that uh we are not the old generation I we are young generation IT and uh we believe more in

advancement in technology and we are well adapted to the new technologies. So and uh although IIT Roper is a IIT which are is situated in Punjab and as I said that Punjab was known to be a football

of India and agree very well with IIT robot because being in a Punjab and out of 23 I think I can assure you that we are only IT which are working in the very heavily in area of agreech. So

agreech is a part of the main curricula in also in IIT ROER and keeping that in mind we are the first IIT which is running a BTE program in digital agriculture and we see that Israel is a

very natural partner with IIT Robot because we have got very recently last year we got a new center of excellence which is AI for agriculture. This is a three sectoral application where

ministry has set up three different center one in med one in digital health, one in agriculture and one in smart cities. So, so we are holding the AICE for agreech and we are looking forward

to work with all our knowledge partner and especially the country which are far in the forefront of the technology how they are adopting technology in the agree sector because India there more

than 70% of population living in a in a countryside and the main profession is agriculture the food security is very important for all of us especially in India and We also want to help our

farmer how they can grow the or how we can increase their productivity, how we can AI can be help them uh for example in weather forecasting or the soil testing or or even um uh anyone else

also. So there are many verticals which IIT Robot is working and also we are developing a big large language model which we call agri LLM. So we are we can we can help our farmers when they ask

some questions some queries we can help them in a better way. So the AI agree LM is also where we are developing at IIT ROER and whatever the solution what we have developed in IIT ROER they are make

in made in IIT robot including the electronics it's not like that we assemble the components we make all electronics and and we are for example our weather station are installed all

over the India right now and our weather station has a accuracy of 99% given by IMD department in Pune so we are setting of a weather station in UP, Punjab, Hana, Andra, GNK so many states. So, so

they can get accurate weather data our farmers can and they can also get the soil tested in a better way. So, they can grow their crops in a different manner or very productive manner. So, so

this is our aim and we are in talking terms with the FPOS and farmers directly actually. So this give us also a a due kind of feedback where we are working directly with the farmers and in Punjab

some of the farmers are very progressive so they are adopting this technology and of course uh we are working with the Andra also and we are working in UP also being a bigger state so we are putting

all these weather station at least one in one gram panchay and the cost is very effectable and it's very scalable we have put the cost almost around 15,000 Indian rupees only so So it's very cheap

solution for farmers and same thing it can give not only the weather but it also give the information about your rain radiation wind speed and the soil temperature humidity of your soil in

your field. So, so this gives you a multi-dimensional weather station with very high accuracy and based on this data we can make uh perfect or responsible AI models and in the end the

data is a is a what you say data is a oil for today actually our minister was saying day before yesterday because he was a oil minister petroleum minister he was saying I didn't know that data will

also become a petrol or oil so so data is the oil and the future and India has a data so we can make a really a very responsible and a predictable AI uh for our farmers to so they can increase

their productivity and also the pest control and the the crop damage all these can be studied while sitting uh and getting this information in their apps. So this is the way it roer is

growing and uh we are very proud of that we got this center and we have a we have got opportunity to work with the with Israel and uh we are looking forward to work with you.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you so much professor huja for setting the right tone for this session where what is there from our side and we look forward to collaborate with Israel on the same side. So uh we

move next to Dr. Gal for his inputs listening to what is coming from an Indian side from the nodal center of excellence for artificial intelligence in agriculture. How you see the

potential opportunities of collaborating with the Indian counterparts for the joint uh AI impact together. &gt;&gt; All right. uh professor gal I'll request uh as our ambassador has to has some

important assignments lined in couple of uh minutes. So before we move to our fellow panelist I would like in fact we all would like to have the thought proating session and the vision for

India and Israel coming together from his excellency from ambassador himself. Hello everybody. Uh I'm really thrilled to be here at the AI summit and I want to thank the organizers it roofar and

Maya Sherman from the embassy as well as welcoming my colleagues from Israel. Thank you for making all the way to come here and speak with us. Um, imagine a day in which every farmer in India,

every one of the millions and millions of farmers will be able to have in his cell phone the entire knowledge that research has gathered in history and make it available for him to

implement in Hills plot whether in a sit a situation that all The weather information, all the knowledge gathered about soil analysis, all the knowledge

gathered about the quality of the right seeds to put. All the knowledge guiding him when to plant, what to plant, when to fertilize, when to irrigate, how much to irrigate.

the satellite imagery that would analyze the soil uh the the water in the soil, the humidity of the soil will be available not just for the entire plot for every plant in his plot. Imagine

that all that would be available thanks to the huge amount of knowledge has been gathered and that is accumulated by AI. Well, the news ladies and gentlemen is that this technology is already

and we are going to use the platform that we have built with the government of India in the last 30 years to make this knowledge available to each and every farmer. We as you know have uh

built together with a huge investment from the Indian government that has spent between three to four million dollars in each one of the 34 centers of excellence that are spread all around

um with modern uh irrigation systems, modern nurseries that supply subsidized seedlings to the farmers, seedlings that have the qualities that are required in order to get better crops and to use

less pesticides. This is all working today and we are going to add a layer that we started actually experimenting this year in nine plots in Punjab, Harana and Maharashtra.

And these plots are being uh uh are are being uh basically are demonstrating the technology of an Israeli company called NRIP. You might want to look it up. ndrip.com.

This company has developed a system that actually not only does all of almost all of what I mentioned before, but also does it with a requirement of almost zero energy.

&gt;&gt; And why is that? It's because Andre is using a very specific technology in which the irrigation chip doesn't need uh a lot of pressure in the water. You can use actually gravity to irrigate a

plot of 150 m on 150 m. And this system that costs no more than $2,000 and can be useful for a farmer for several years can gather with sensors the analysis of the ground and transmit it directly

to an AI center that actually helps the farmer and tells him what is the situation of his soil, when to plant, when to harvest, when to fertilize. Guys, everything is available now. Uh,

Andre has already implemented uh, you know, is applied in several fields around the country in private farms. I personally visited one of them uh, about a month

ago in uh, in uh, near Agra in Uttar Pradesh. And now we have finished establishing as I said nine demonstration plots in the centers of excellence. We hope that after the

ministry of agriculture analyzes the results of this uh of these plots they will decide to adopt it nation nationwide and once that happens the implications for the average Indian

farmer will be huge. So we are so happy that thanks to the trust that we have built with the Indian government, thanks to the cooperation we have have been having with the uh research agriculture

research institutes such as IIT Ropart, we are bringing this uh news to uh the agricultural sector in India to the farmers of India and I know that uh as much as we have succeeded so far in

getting modern irrigation systems to millions and millions of farmers around the country. We are going to do the same with AI thanks to technologies like NRIP and many other technologies that

together we will bring to this country. Thank you very much. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you so much for the vibrant words and the thought that you have shared with us. Of course the

success lies in joint collaboration and together not just starting with the Agra but of course reaching to Punjab with IIT ROER. Thank you. Thank you for your words. Uh now I jump back to Professor

Gal for his perspective on how the way forward for India and Israel coming together to take it forward from here. &gt;&gt; Well, uh I don't know if you if if you if you

know that in Israel there's a labor shortage right now. So when when there's a labor shortage, what do you do actually is you you have one option is to raise salaries for attract people.

Another way is to bring to find more workers and we're trying to find workers. We can't find workers anywhere. But and at the same time there's an an alternatives to uh implement automation

and start working with with new tools and and the genai and the LLA models and all all of the models for fits for for the artificial intelligence right now allows us to make uh this technology

available for everyone. uh for instance the dem if you know the democratization of the technology allows us for each one of us to be a developer in that uh building applications this this allows

us for every everyone during agriculture when you're in field of agriculture in other businesses as well to develop things by by your own to and each one of us has this potential to become some

kind of inventor and this artificial intelligence and that's one thing that we're doing in Israel, I think, is allows us to to work with this uh this new technology to fits together and to

find the best way to co to coordinate allows all of the all of the people to be part of this process and that's something we're trying to do in Israel and I know you're trying to do that as

well in India in India to to make this technology available to for everyone to use it more commonly. This is allows us to make this quantum leap in uh working with uh being more efficient, being more

productive and what so there's a lot of things a lot of aging with smart agriculture in Israel a lot of practices what to do with the with the crops and understanding working with data for each

one of us it's this technology has become available so that's something we're I think it's one advantage of working together do joint ventures in order to allow more people to to be part

of this process. What we do for instance at the Israeli employment services in Israel is like trying to find to work on the on both sides of the aisle working with employers understanding introducing

new technology and at at and at the same time introducing also skills for the for the labor market in order them to to know how to use this technology. Sometimes it's very basic and that's

something we're trying to to develop and I think that's a lot of pros in this uh kind of interventions and there's a lot for us uh to bring and a lot of us a lot of things for us to to understand and to

know and I think working together allows us to implement that very efficiently. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Thank you. Thank you so much professor gal for sharing these thoughts and of course uh collaborating together

to understand the pain point from both the sides and how we can jointly work together for this. Now for a different perspective as we were having a pre-introduction uh chat with uh

professor dove so would like to have your thoughts on how the seeding of this collaboration can take forward in terms of modernizing agriculture. &gt;&gt; Okay, thank you very much. I want to

thank uh Maya and the embassy of Israel and I roer um for hosting this. I want to actually talk about some governance issues that my institute is thinking about about an emerging technology in

this space. Um I a lot of people when they talk about AI and biotech talk about automation, they talk about data, they talk about sensors, they talk about information. I want to talk about a

novel area again u where we are thinking about governance in this space and um really quickly I'm totally uh switching track so all of life on the planet follows the exact same rules for the

most part uh we're all made up of DNA DNA is comprised of how many letters anyone know &gt;&gt; four that's right and DNA letters make up words that we call codons those

codons translate into amino acids which are the basis for our proteins. Each codon is three letters long. That means the dictionary of DNA words is any mathematicians here? The dictionary of

DNA words is 64 words. That's what we have. 64 words of DNA in the entirety of life on the planet for the most part with some exceptions. Interestingly enough, what that means is there's only

20 amino acids that we have. We have 64 words for 20 amino acids which means that we have what we call a degenerate system. We have a lot of redundancy in the system. And what is emerging now is

the technology facilitated by AI for for refactoring the human genome or for refactoring biotechnological crops. What does refactoring mean? That means that we can take a codeodon that is that is

redundant and we can add some and we can change it. We can change it to allow not only optimization facilitated facilitated by artificial intelligence but we can actually introduce novel

aspects to proteins. We can introduce non-organic components to proteins which creates huge opportunities in the area of biotechnology. Thinking about this though, thinking

about the governance issues in this space, there are a lot of really interesting issues that have to be tackled before we can uh promote this sort of technology. For example, you

have to think about um patenting, who owns these emerging technologies, who who facilitates this, who will implement this. We have to think about to some degree whether or not there are concerns

with the development of Frankenstein like crops. Crops that we don't what what we call unknowable unknowables. What will happen down the road when we start changing the fundamental aspects

of genomes. We have to think about whether or not this qualifies as genetically mod modified organisms or not. Unfortunately, we also have to think about the weaponization of this

technology. whether or not you can create mal whether or not malicious actors can create novel sorts of crops that are effectively undetectable because our technologies don't allow for

the detection of these sort of novel refactor genomes. Another concern is that the pace of artificial intelligence in allowing us to refactor these genomes sort of

outpaces the governance that we currently have and thinking about how to implement governance today that will be useful tomorrow when this emerging technology erupts. How do we think about

those things as well? Of course, AI provides low barriers of entry. So whereas in the past you may need a large university laboratory to develop these refactor genomes, nowadays you can have

biohackers in their garages developing these technologies. How do we how do we uh govern this? How do we protect ourselves from malicious actors? How do we protect ourselves from negligent

actors in this sort of space? um thinking about c sort of the consolidation of of farming where that we have optimized sort of biotechnological

outputs and those optimizations are owned by large corporations. What does that mean for the millions of farmers here in India and abroad? And of course ultimately

who decides whether or not we move on with this? Who decides whether or not we pass on this technology? How do we decide how to implement these technologies? These are all questions

for emerging technologies. My institute is thinking about. These are things that we both in Israel and in India have to think about the implementation of artificial intelligence in the

biotechnological sector. A lot of very interesting questions. Very few good answers. So thank you very much for the time. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you uh so much for

bringing this uh concept of ATGC the four letters that play a very important role in making up the DNA that makes up the whole biome. Thank you. Thank you for your perspective. Now I'll request u

and before that we welcome you professor Victor a research scientist from Institute of Agriculture and Biosystem Engineering to this particular session and we would love to have your thoughts

in terms of how you see AI for agriculture specifically happening in India and Israel. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much for inviting me and being here. I'm very happy and thank you

for all for being here. Um I'm a researcher. I'm a scientist. I'm an engineer in in the institute of an engineering and bios engineering in Israel working in um um AI in

agriculture and I'm I want to bring here a probably completely different aspect than those that have heard the last u few hours that have been in this summit. Um we do research in agriculture in

order to uh uh solve the problem of uh food security. We need to provide food to billions of people and this exponentially increases during the last years. And

agriculture is the way that we have to feed all these people and um using the conventional methods of agriculture uh usually they pollute the environment and they are not sustainable.

The new technologies that they are now used in agriculture like precision agriculture and digital agriculture which have been developed from the last years of the previous century 1990

1990s 2000 and so forth. They keep using uh both technological systems in order to h produce a lot of data, a lot of measurements to understand what is happening and make the agricultural

production more efficient. And this has been a struggle of a lot of years of how to use all this information in order to make agriculture more efficient. The last 10 years AI has come in and uh

suddenly all this data that is gathered and measured around the world in different uh crops in different countries in different climates. They can all be combined together in order to

get some knowledge or some incentives that were not so evident before. But are we there? because we are there probably in some other disciplines. Uh like uh when you uh ask your uh Chad GPT or

Gemini about things uh to have some knowledge and some incentives then they give you in different in different topics and those are the topics that the AI models have been trained upon. Those

topics are usually that all the data is available in digital form and the models can be trained. But is this the case in agriculture? Probably not. Not yet at least. All this knowledge and all this

data exists in agriculture. But we cannot really use it. We cannot make an agricultural advisor who is a a a robust and generalized advisor all over the world. It's different in India,

different in Israel, different in Europe, different in South America. But we can go and uh try to generalize this and build AI models, LLM models, large language models in order to do

that. But AI in agriculture is also in a much uh more basic uh place. Uh we use uh in well we develop in agriculture uh systems like um detection system for detecting weeds in the field in order to

spray just the points where the weeds are detected. We develop systems that they detect um diseases and pests in a very early stages in order to treat them locally.

uh we we develop systems that uh they can see how the plants are developing. Uh we can uh we develop systems that they link between uh the phenotype how the plants look and the genotype how the

genes are. And here I refer to what you are talking about uh the the genotypes. uh AI uh are today tools that they um improve and they enable the genetic selection, not genetic engineering but

genetic selection of varieties that are more resilient to the climate change, more resilient to to heat waves, more resilient to to salts in the soil and so forth. So AI tools in agriculture come

in many different levels from the level of uh being in the field and detecting and doing things to the level of uh having the knowledge and and address the the whole management the management

strategy. uh but uh this is a little bit far from today because the uh data that we have in agriculture uh is not shared as it is in other

disciplines in the world and also it's not in the standard format. uh standardization is a very difficult and problem that has to be addressed in agriculture but the AI they have the

possibility to uh solve these problems and uh get agriculture in a much uh better place. The adoption of AI in agriculture still has other barriers like the legal barrier, the financial

barrier has to be economical. Um and uh these are still challenges to be met. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you so much. And you rightly said that in terms of adoption

there are number of challenges and barriers that together we have to come forward. Uh with this we come to the end of the inaugural panel. I would request professor Rajiva for the final words

from on behalf of our Israel friends and from an Indian representation for his final remarks. So it's already well said actually Radhika and uh we are going to have a very active collaboration and to

work together in a team from Indian side and from Israel side and I'm sure that uh when we will work together and there were lot of other opportunities will come up also and then because he has

said very many diver diverse thing actually so we have to think about that also and which we are not thinking before and it's good to have a people with a different mindset coming and we

are going to work together and I'm sure that uh uh with the support of Israel governments and and with Indian government support and uh we are going to use AI for for the best of our

farmers. So and so we can make farmer most prosperous farmers in this India using AI. So this is our vision and and the former uh should be the main priority here. So thank you.

wonderful panel and the thoughtprovoking inputs that we have received from all the speakers. &gt;&gt; All right. Uh so with this we thank everyone for joining us. We'll move to

the next panel and uh for that I'll in request my colleague Dr. MKkesh to please be on the floor. Thank you Radika for mo moderating this uh panel wonderfully and uh to all the

speakers as well for joining us from Israel as well as from the India. We also really uh thanks to all the audience who were able to come here in the last panel of the day while we have

another one more largely from the investment community side and when we talk about the agreech industry it's very important to have the investment side as well and from the corporate side

I would like to request my panelist over here now where we'll be having discussion around bridging nence through the AI and also talking about scaling AI innovation for the public good I would

like to call first panelist or the moderator for is Miss Maya, a good friend from the Israel embassy side. I also would like to call Miss Nimisa on the stage

uh to Miss Omi, please. If she could also join us and uh Mr. a good friend from the C fund side. &gt;&gt; Siman can you help them?

&gt;&gt; Uh Siman will help you to put people name there. &gt;&gt; So we'll be having a discussion around that. But before uh before this I also wanted to give some insight about IIT

Ruper in terms of the investment and the agree ecosystem that we are building. As of now we host almost 250 plus startups where we have made investment of somewhere around 17 cr plus in the last

two and a half year and very proud to say that this particular portfolio has raised almost 120 cr from the external community side from the VC side and uh we are also very proud to say that when

we look out to the anam aad and various ministries like startup India and all these all have been playing out a very powerful role in terms of enabling out the agree ecosystem. I will be handing

over this to Maya from here and uh I hope that we will have a very insightful conversation and the discussion around it. Thank you once again and my over to &gt;&gt; So hello everyone long day but I think a

lot of insights and quite exciting milestone for India with the summit and very grateful first of all to have uh representative from our government presenting a bit about the work uh and

generally very grateful for the work with Europa over uh the last few months. It's been it's been very intense but I think a lot of very important milestones. Um I'm also quite excited

about the panelists we have today again dear colleagues and friends but I think also bringing fascinating expertise across the ecosystem in India from the VCC space from the governance space big

tech. So we'll be very glad to hear your insight as we go forward. Um as we embark I'll be glad perhaps a quick overview from your side a bit on how your first of all how are you perceiving

this big event and how it's relevant for you um but if you can share a bit on some of the challenges that you're seeing about crossber innovation today and how do you think we should go

forward and if AI is relevant at all in this regard &gt;&gt; is that with you &gt;&gt; so um I roer team thanks for having me I'm trying to I think when was the last

time I was in a panel where we had as many women as we have in this panel. It's largely all male or a token women. So kudos to you. You could have very well had a all women panel also but

we'll run with what you have. Um I was observing what you have up here. The transcription is at about 85 90%. But the translation is almost 95 100%. So kudos to what Bashini is doing right and

we need more of uh such programs in India. Um let me give you some introduction of what I do. Um um I was the earlier lot that G hired in the country to do data science all the way

back in the early 90s which obviously became machine learning and which is now AI to all of us. Um we've been do making investments for almost 15 years um um as a fund almost 8 years we be deep tech is

a focus area of focus for us. Uh when we spoke to our investors in 2018 that we want to do deep tech, we were laughed out of the room and for us deep tech was semiconductor space uh defense u similar

investors who have a uh an inclination to invest when we go and say that we want to make areas in these uh investments in these areas they're not blinking. They're still not laughing

away uh seeing money but they're they're not blinking. What is the relevance of this um this event? I think u um on two parts. One um we clearly need this. I think this is the third big uh third or

fourth event. &gt;&gt; First and the biggest. &gt;&gt; Yeah. But fourth, right? There was one in um &gt;&gt; the UK, France. Correct. Correct. Um I

think it is about time that uh an emerging economy like uh India um has to start playing or having a seat at the table. I'll tell you why. Um I think some data came out a few weeks back u as

to what which which countries are how well disposed towards AI the west there's a whole lot of fear China there's a whole lot of optimism so is the case in the far east I think we are

somewhere in the middle um this is a different beast for sure but you can't be running away from a technology um it it has never worked historically and it won't work this way also so you have to

have a positive pred disposition and focus on what are the positives that it can give. uh one small example I don't know how much how many of us had problems getting in but it's criminal in

this in this day and age where there is such loss of uh all our times and productivity right uh there are three things that are important for our economics to grow um there's uh capital

there's labor and there's productivity uh till this current burst of productivity that the US has had um productivity productivity has plateaued uh but if we have aspirations to be uh

developed country in the next 25 30 years I AI has to play a crucial role. what is working is obviously um all these elements and I'll pause there and I'll let the other panel speak.

&gt;&gt; Thank you for having me. Um I'm Umi. I work for a company called Salesforce. Um so we are majorly into agents and this is something that we've invested in and we're looking at deploying agents for

public good and public use cases in healthcare in finance and incredibly sensitive areas as and when we look at it. So a big part of the responsibility that we have is deploying this

responsibly at scale. So innovating but also having the right guard rails so that this is something that builds trust. And Maya when you asked about some of the biggest challenges that we

have when we look at deploying agents or AI is institutional trust is telling people that can you trust this AI system is your data secure um are they able to use this for longer and I think that's

one of the main conversations we have when we think about adoption because for a company like ours um you know it's great to have a product but you need people to understand the value of it you

need people to adopt it and use it make it relevant in their daily lives. So how can they do that if they don't trust the system? So it's also not just you know educating people about the risks or the

benefits or what is it that they can control what AI can do cannot do what they should be mindful of but also looking at the ecosystem around it that supports um large scale and a large

scale adoption of technology for a sustained period. So those are some of the things that we're working on. We're trying to solve for. So not just the technology but the human element of

trust. &gt;&gt; Uh hello. Hi, I'm Nemesisa and it's uh really an honor to be here. Uh thanks to it Roper and the embassy of Israel to um organize this very important discussion.

uh you know when we talk about agriculture uh in India half of the population half of the working population is actually engaged in agriculture and um uh only 1/5if of

the GDP is being uh agriculture is only contributing to uh the GDP it's less than 15%. uh 65% of the farmers have got smartphones and 80% of all fresh water

which is used in India is used in agriculture uh while if you think about it at least uh 20% of all agriculture produce is is damaged so the case for AI in agriculture is so strong and when we

say today we have so many startups doing so many things out of 200,000 startups in India India only 1500 to 2,000 are actually working in agit. So this this discussion is very important. Uh I have

been part of this ecosystem uh since I think 2011. I am working for an organization called Hunch Ventures. It's a family office. Uh we have deployed more than hund00 million dollars across

sectors, industries within India, outside India. uh one of the last investments uh that we made was in an agit startup uh which is doing a farmtofork model while we are also

looking at creating food parks uh across different uh states in India and I'm here today to talk like the work that I do with the circle which is an organization uh doing crossber startup

programs uh I I sit at the intersection of ecosystems uh helping innovation find market or actually uh supporting them to face market realities and in AI as much as we are talking today there are a lot

of market realities that have to that has to be faced by the startups by those who are creating innovation because if you think of something like agriculture which is the bread and butter of people

uh so many people to get them to use it at scale there are many challenges But u if that happens then the kind of u um output we will get that would be unprecedented. So I think it's a very

important discussion and it's great that we are having it today. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Thank you three of you. Mesh I mean such such a wonderful maybe want to share a bit from your side. How do

you see the biggest challenges on crossber innovation? &gt;&gt; So I think I'll take very less time on that. We had a wonderful insight from all the members as a opening remark. But

largely when you talk about the agree and we were having this conversation just before this the biggest challenge is on the adoption. We are talking about a community which works you know as a

conventional mechanism and even if there's 1% chance of failure we are talking about going out the entire crop cycle as a waste over there. So it means that whatever technology you are

building be it a startup be it a government tech or be it a technocrat that technology has to have you know 100% efficiency and has to be 100% accuracy the moment you say 1% fails we

are talking about one particular crop cycle and not only that there's a very heavy reason that you know government is not going behind the GM crop because the crop also have a huge impact on the

humanity over there and this is where you have to be very precise both in terms of adoption and in terms of building out that technology which is one of the biggest challenge that we

find while working with the agree community there. &gt;&gt; Fantastic. Thank you for this. Um again so many questions can come out of it. Now Mr. S let us start with you. I mean

with the hunch and and the circle you've invested in so many programs and crossber programs worldwide. What are the next country that you feel will lead crossber innovation in the

next decade? &gt;&gt; Uh sure Maya. Um I think um the the future of AI um is not uh will not happen via some specific countries but it will be uh through clusters. So uh

from where I see there are three kinds of clusters. One is the uh the government governance centers those who are defining the rules uh which includes the US for uh say uh models compute the

kind of um um um investments that are happening over there and the EU from the regulation standpoint while the other cluster could be uh those countries where the use cases are being defined

because of the scalable deployments such as China, India, Brazil and they say that if you know something uh succeeds in India in agriculture, it can succeed anywhere. And I think the third cluster

is the high precision um uh high techch u agriculture um um innovation which is happening uh by uh through um uh research and um um um technology being developed in say Israel in um um

Netherlands in Australia. So I think these clusters are very important and the future would be uh the corridors such as the India Israel corridor uh the India Ashan corridor which will prove

very very critical uh for defining how things grow and scale. &gt;&gt; Fantastic. I think you know it brings such an interesting input here that while many countries are trying to to

fight against each other and kind of create this AI supremacy in the end we are seeing clusters being formed um across different technology I think especially AI is a great example for

this uh with the pilica Israel and India are part of this but it's true I think that's exactly what's perhaps setting the next decade of future technologies going forward would it be full

multilateralism or perhaps still the arms I think it's still a question but one insights. Um, Mr. Smayash, of course, CIFA fund has been such an early believer in deep tech. I'll be glad to

hear a bit more on your broader vision for uh deep tech investing. How do you see instruments like again research development innovation fund shaping the next decade of technologies?

&gt;&gt; I think um we've come to a very critical point um at least with uh what's happening in India. Um there'll be a fair amount of us uh who've probably studied in the US have been

beneficiaries of programs like DARPA, NSF. Um and for the longest time we were talking with our policy makers, we need to have something similar to that. Um it's taken a long time coming but uh um

we finally have a program this we still our GDP is probably u $2,000 or there sorry our per capita income is thereabouts but for a country at our uh sca scale of development we have a 12.5

billion dollar uh program that brings together what DARPA does what NS NSF does and what uh the Euroar does in Europe um I think that is going to be absolutely crucial because all basic

research research and elements of transport research it has to be and has been historically governed. Um no no investor like us uh forget investors even angel investors will not

participate where uh the startup is at a lap stage and it can't even move to a product. So that is going to be absolutely crucial. The first and second order effects of this are there is going

to be enormous amount of money is going to be relatively for our size a flood of money in the ecosystem. Now a lot of this like with most government programs may be wasted but uh we've seen

historically that uh there have been uh platforms there have been startups uh that have been built out um the Indian uh digital public goods is a great example um and there is absolute hope

that the AI mission the quantum mission uh the uh DI scheme which we have for semiconductors uh defense that is absolutely going to work out well. What the government did did smartly was u a

few uh years back they figured out where are the top three four areas where the country has the most forest outflow and shouldn't be a surprise u oil commodities was the first one the second

one was defense the third one was u uh electronic manufacturing and they passed each one of this had schemes for them so for the longest time um investors wouldn't touch anything that was

manufacturing related but things have changed So dramatically like you have the 800 lb gorilla in the VC ecosystem which is Axel talking about uh or putting out a thesis about smart

manufacturers right so uh whoever are the manufacturing or the real world physical intelligence kind of founders I think these are great days it's not going to change uh dramatically but it's

definitely better than not having any money commoditized manufacturing there's nothing there but if you're doing something along these lines there there's absolutely money coming to

agriculture um the problems are well known right I mean small land parcels data uh uh is strewn all across so much so that u uh defense is an area most investors will not touch but we are

looking at a startup where the the sucker we are getting is oh okay it's dual use uh there is assured in uh income from defense and okay there's an agriculture use case so maybe we can

live with that so that's where agriculture falls on the hierarchy of investments the first set of agri startups have been these platforms the form far uh farm to fork kind of

place but going and addressing the problems that a farmer faces throwing uh earth observation throwing satellite imagery throwing data uh and the ability to serve these products at the minimal

price points that we have that is still a problem that is still to has to be corrected in India &gt;&gt; wonderful insight I think that it's true that in many ways uh you know this kind

of hierarchy of investments uh put agriculture side but in many ways I also feel that again this shift into dual use technologies has enabled in perhaps a new avenue for agric ag startups as a

whole you know even I guess from the Israeli perspective we know we have dozens of center of excellency in the country they always worked on agriculture now we're trying to shift a

bit more into agreech in them so hopefully this is something we'll be able perhaps to I guess give a different lens or a different avenue for agit startups to get the right investments

especially as again economywise it's clearly needed and relevant or me now a bit to you um again I you have different hats of course the wonderful work in Salesforce but again also I know the

wonderful AI fellowship from Rina where you did such great work around climate AI and I I wanted to hear a bit more from you on how how you see India positioning itself as a responsible AI

leader especially in agreech and public uh good cases &gt;&gt; that's a great question Um I think India has a few problems that it's identified very clearly or that it wants to solve

for what their priorities are in this space. One is scale. The other is innovation but inclusive innovation and it's also striking a balance between regulation and innovation. So some of

the ways in which India's been doing this is through as we mentioned um creating highquality data sets. of AI coach is the program I think and what they're trying to do is create um these

data sets which will feed into more precise interventions from AI systems um and will really help solutions especially in critical sectors like healthcare and agriculture. So and apart

from that leveraging DPI uh has also been a priority for India. Um and it's one of those uh and you know it's one of India's best exports to the world uh in terms of having this public basic

infrastructure that others can use and build on and to use that in agriculture to use that in in public health or uh public good cases is one of India's biggest strengths. Um and we've seen

this as becoming very fertile ground for uh companies and private and private sector and governments and and civil society to really come together and build something together. So it's really

providing that foundational architecture or foundational um field for companies and other stakeholders to come and collaborate and to build on these principles to build on accountability,

transparency um and create a solution together. So I think it's it's that field that India is offering that it's it's it wants to be innovative but it also wants to have

those guardrails. It doesn't want to fence itself away from the private sector. And uh we've also been able to develop a pilot for example with the government of Andhra Pradesh which is

looking at regenerative agriculture again because of um the kind of focus that India has that it wants to be collaborative and I think that's something that the world can really

learn from. Fantastic. I think that you know in the end you know seeing the level of government investment and relevance in this sector it's not it's not something

that you're seeing all over the world. I think that India is definitely pioneering this discussion and narrative. So thank you for this. Um Nemesisa back to you. Um again I think

that crossber innovation has become kind of your your your second name in a way but and again there are some upcoming delegations coming in to to Korea and

Taiwan and a lot of very exciting milestones ahead for Hunch Venture. Um I will be glad to hear from you if you know if you were to pitch in a way what do you think makes India as again a

perfect destination for global agree startups today for any other countries again Israel is one but how would you say that India is currently positioned? Sure. Thank you Maya. I think uh we are

in very exciting times. Uh India can be the perfect test bed for all sorts of AI solutions particularly uh in agriculture and agreech I think uh there is lots of opportunity the kind of data that can be

made available right now it I don't think it is there but it can be made available. the kind of um um uh you know use cases we can have things that you know uh you know so many farmers

multiple kind of crops u climate issues uh inefficient supply chains all sorts of use cases are there so I think that is that is one place where a lot of testing can be done second is I think

mures already mentioned about uh the digital public infrastructure and I think all the panelists have mentioned uh which India has created and uh the AI innovation is evolving as the

infrastructure is evolving. So I think that's a great place to be because uh you know when both are growing together there is whole opportunity of again testing and coming to real solutions

which can be scaled fast and the final thing is a very pilot ready market. The corporates are interested the government is ready to provide sandboxes. the startups want to work within India,

outside India, whether it is you know um um Bihar or Uttar Pradesh or Vietnam, Southeast Asia, the the founders are very hungry to go and test and deploy and create get new market opportunities.

So I think it's a great time and if uh you know if you look at it um uh in an overall ecosystem manner also I think uh India is not just a market to enter right now it's uh it's a market from

where you can build and scale to the world I'm convinced what wonderful words say say and I think that um you know if if you look for a moment at the size of the impact summit and you know the level

of scholars coming from all over the world to India I think it's it shows the level of regor and scale the data ecosystem is bringing today. Um my rash back to you. Um clearly again a a lot of

work and great work done by C fund. You're managing over 250 uh million kores over sectors but I'll be glad to hear a bit more from you. How do you differentiate AI and agree from other

frontier deep technologies especially as you were mentioning the difficulties in investment? So, I'll be glad to hear from you how you're perceiving it and what would be the right way to to reach

it from your angle. &gt;&gt; See, we can't play the US game. We just don't have the domestic capital um to throw at problems, right? Um we don't have the billions of dollars to go out

and uh buy compute and do LLMs. Neither can we play the Chinese game where they've finally passed out manufacturing uh with AI. Um we've got to find our own way. um we have to solve our India

specific problems. We are a voice first nation and uh we have many languages. So u anything that is being done by somebody sitting in the US um I don't think Indian founders should be um even

trying to solve it in the same by the same playbook. I'll give you an example. uh the old SAS playbook hitting a 1 million in ARR within 2 3 years was a monumental achieve a achievement that

has gone out of the uh out of the window. You hear crazy stories and these are on the consumer side uh startups hitting um $100 million in 6 months. The best I've seen in India is somebody

doing half a million uh RR in 45 days. That doesn't compound to uh even 10 million in 5 years. Um so how do you play that game? Um as a fund we are betting a lot on uh physical

intelligence in the real world. Things will change dramatically here too but not to the extent that we are seeing on the software side of things. There's still things to be played out in the

next 5 to 10 5 to 10 years. And I think agriculture if we solve all the problems that India has um I think that falls in the sweet spot of that. You can't run a startup having uh Silicon Valley uh uh

salary level cost cost levels with Indian paying power. If you can crack that puzzle uh if you can start making products especially on the agra side for bhat as we call it beyond the metro tier

one cities I think there's a huge uh the market is huge uh and you won't find this market anywhere else. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Thank you for this. Um last question for you. um you know you

mentioned the the again the very interesting initiative in pilot with the government of Andra Pradesh. I'll be glad generally to hear from you how do you see again big tech companies such as

Salesforce enabling this work with governments to be able to move um again AI pilots into national level impact brokers because the question is also about the scale. That's the

million-dollar question that we're all trying to solve for. Um but I think two things that have uh that we're trying to focus on I think other uh companies who are working with governments at the

pilot stage are trying to focus on um is co-creation. So sort of uh from the idea ideational stage itself to deployment involving stakeholders at every step. So that is for us it could be the

government of Andhra Pradesh but it also involves other stakeholders like farmers groups um uh or SGS or NGOs that are working in this space. So if we are able to conceptualize the idea with all with

with as many pitfalls as many difficulties from the inception stage it sort of uh becomes embedded by design in the solution rather than something that surprises us towards the end. It's

easier said than done, but this is the approach that works and um is something that we're striving to achieve. The other is also taking the ecosystem along with you. So having an ecosystem

approach, what I mean by that is um focusing on scaling and capacity building so that people are able to understand the benefits of the technology that they are going to use

and deploy. That is the only way that you see sustained adoption. um that is the only way that you see um an ecosystem growing with you when you're trying to encourage a solution. So it's

sort of taking everyone with you when you're developing and also taking everyone's ideas with you co-creating these are two of the pathways that I think a lot of us are exploring.

&gt;&gt; Fantastic. Thank you. I I I absolutely agree. I mean co-creation is key and I think you know the wonderful work that TS has done I think definitely is is making this kind of change I feel in the

ecosystem now as we are nearing to an end I'll be glad for 30 seconds for you you know we've had great insights on the ecosystem how VCs are enabling the ecosystem how we're able to push the

government investment VCs in the end farmers are the are the core um how do you see the future and more interestingly how do we make sure that farmers are not left behind when we are

pushing these innovations. But again, crisp 30 seconds interventions mukesh to this one. I also be glad to hear from I think um rightly said by all the members we are at an inflection point

where we have to talk about farmers. We have to talk about the yield. We have to talk about the you know funds that can be deployed by the government and also so that the community could grow

together for the betterment of the impact and betterment of the society. Um I'll just I'll just say one line. I think uh farmers as as the the the community is today across the country.

They trust they need trust and they need to trust the technology. They need to trust the people who are creating the technology and for that they need two things. one it is introduced to them by

people they already know intermediaries and B they are educated and once they are educated the support is also given to them post once they have got a solution and they're facing challenges

that they don't know how to solve so if those things are done I think uh it will be a great uh boost &gt;&gt; I think we've you know spoken about co-creation and capacity building but

one element that I would introduce is also working on the explanability aspect of the models um so the farmer or whoever the stakeholder is should know where AI has come into the decision

making and where and what is the process that has led to that decision. It is an ongoing endeavor with most companies trying to figure out the mechanisms to do this but that should always be the

endeavor. &gt;&gt; I think I'll echo what your ambassador said. Everybody has the the tech in their pocket. The pipe has been laid. India has the lowest cost per uh GB in

the world. Um it's incumbent on all of us to make sure the intelligence is provided to the farmer at the price point he can afford. &gt;&gt; Fantastic. Big rounds of applause for

our wonderful panelist. Thank you so much. No, it's been a long day. I don't know if you have time for questions. Do we have I think we we don't have so you still try to catch us afterwards. Thank

you so much for the panelist and I roer again. Wonderful to have been working on it. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you Maya for wonderfully moderating the session. Uh

before we conclude with this session we have a special gratitude to our speaker and we want to express this with our felicitation from our side. Uh Maya I would like you to please step forward
