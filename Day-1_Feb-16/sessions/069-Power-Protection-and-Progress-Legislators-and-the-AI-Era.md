## 📝 Transcript

so that we can have an uninterrupted interesting session. Not very easy. So before we begin, I would request the panel to uh please rise for a picture.

So, good afternoon everyone. May I request everybody with a seat to take the seat, please? And we're so grateful to all of you to be standing here and Apologies for not being able to

cater for more seats here. On behalf of Future Shift Labs, it is a privilege to welcome you to this session on legislators and the AI era, a continuation

of the conversations we began through the AI legislators forum. I'm not going to take too much time in introducing what we're here to talk about. I will let Udwell do that. Uh I

will however introduce our esteemed moderator and panelists in the meantime. Uh we are joined by Udwell Kumar. He is the founder of Quantum Alliance and Cogniz AI joining us all the way from

Harvard Kennedy School. Can we give him a big round of applause? [applause] We have with us Sri Lu Sri Krishna G who is member of parliament Lok Sabha from Andhra Pradesh a founding member of AI

legislators forum if I may add can we please give him a big round of applause [applause] joining us is Sri Raghav Chhatta he's member of parliament Raja Sabha and I

think we have a lot of people gathered here to have A LOOK AT &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE WORST POSSIBLE INTRODUCTION TO IT. [laughter]

&gt;&gt; It's the truth. I think sir has garnered so much uh I mean he's he's right now at the helm of such important conversations happening in the parliament and we're very very grateful to have you here with

us. Moving on, uh we have advocate Sarith Felba who is senior director from the Ministry of Justice uh Israel. And ma'am, thank you so much for gracing us with your presence. Can we please have a

huge round of applause without further ado, I know we all want to hear what the panelists have to say today. Over to you, Udal. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Uh wow, it's full house.

Definitely they want to see someone [laughter] Okay, good afternoon everyone. Welcome to power protection and progress legislators in the AI era

2017 and before no one used to talk about artificial intelligence that name no one wanted to take speak with any academician they'll say no it's

deep learning it's machine learning something happened after 2018 I don't know what happened but a A lot of people started talking about artificial intelligence,

generative AI, autonomous systems which can decide what to do on their own. Once Alonmus told bringing Genai is summoning the de

demon. Well, we all have summoned the demon. Stephan Hawkins said or actually warned is the biggest threat to humankind.

Now I think we are passed some of these debates and we are here to discuss what AI can do for good or how we can use AI for good. I'm Ujel Kumar, co-founder of Cognissi,

a public benefit corporation. Before that, I worked on digital transformation at UN Food and Agriculture Organization with governments with local communities working on preserving local knowledge.

I I'm also coming from Harvard Kennedy School as me fellow which means I tend to look at technology less as a product problem but more as a governance problem.

Here is the frame I want to start with. Democracy at its core is an information system. It depends on what people want, what they experience and

what they want to express. [snorts] And this information system translates it into governance. However, AI changes how information is shaped,

amplified, and acted upon. AI transforms information. That's why we all are here. That makes it a democracy question more than a technology question.

India developed Aadhaar. India developed UPI showing the world how open-source technology with sovereign identity can

be applied at population scale. Now I personally feel another layer to AI is a knowledge layer which can be taken

from highly skill-based people either as artisans, farmers. How do we take that knowledge and not replace them but augment their understanding augment humans knowledge?

At this time I personally feel there are two ways AI is being developed. Either you are replacing human thinking or you're augmenting human thinking. And the best way to decide where we are

going is this amazing panel. First when I heard about this panel I told okay like the first memory I got it from US Senate when the senator was questioning Mark

Jookerberg asking oh how do you Mark how do you make money and Mark told okay we run ads I think those memories keep coming to us multiple times when we

talk about AI high governance because the challenge is technology is moving way faster than the people who are trying to legislate it.

We already had a small intro. So I would like to directly get into some of our questions and try to figure out if legislator are ready to shape the AI governance process or they are being

shaped by it. Starting from Krishna, sir, you have a you have a CS degree. This week you have been talking about

social media restrictions. I was just wondering do you think how important it is for the legislators to have the understanding of LLMs the models or it is the work of the

institution to enable it for the legislators to work on that. Yeah, thanks for having me and uh good to see such a great

gatherings. It shows how much interest have in this new field of new technology of AI and uh and we mentioned about CS degree coming from South India, coming from Andhra Pradesh. Um you cannot get

by your parents without having an engineering degree either engineer or doctor. So that is in the past. But uh uh the question that you are asking about um how uh legislators need to

understand LLM's you know GPUs I think more than that more than the technical aspect say for example um I give you a parallel uh the nuclear nuclear energy legislators doesn't have

to know about the fision what what's the raw material that is used you know that's not But it's okay if they know it but that's not the prerequisite. The prerequisite is how it's shaping the

economy of the country, how it's empowering the youth of this country. In the same way with the artificial intelligence also and uh it goes the same way you know the data is being

produced here. The amount of uh you know almost shows like almost 20% of it is being produced here in India. where which companies are actually getting that

valuation why the those companies are getting valuation the number of tokens that are being produced here on on what LLMs they're being produced

how on what GPUs they're being produced why only three companies are making cornering this GPU infrastructure whether that will impact the sound so on the that level if legislators know where

the economy is going and how um in this aspect how it can impact the country and how it can impact the next coming generation. Second thing is with regards to um when you look at the AI uh the

technology that is available right now uh there's already a huge difference in India with the learning outcomes u you know if you see uh the number of people using the internet or the students that

have access to the internet not having access to the internet add to that now when you give few set of people access to good air um apps

uh whereas you leave out 90% of them out of it. See the difference the vast difference that is going to make in the opportunities for the people opportunities for the next. So these are

the things that as legislators we need to think about uh not just going into the uh code not not understanding not trying to understand the lms and those things. So that is one thing. Second

thing is you asked about the social media uh bans here. I'm not talking about social media ban per se but I'm talking about social media um you know restrictions for the age group until 16.

Again it's the same thing we are producing if you've seen the data also YouTube Facebook's all Instagram majority of the data is being produced from India and um you know where the

valuation is going uh what is what these companies are bringing back to the country you know these are the things that we need to look at it and whether we are going to pawn the uh teenagers

childhood um versus what the these companies are looking for from the data of these youngsters. So these are the arguments I think we need to have as a legislators.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. You touched upon sovereign AI which um I was hoping to get a bit later but amazing you touched that. So I'll go to Zagab G like you spoke about

India having 34,000 GPU in Zajya Sabha and you told there's no it's not a talent problem it's not a capital problem it's a compute problem what my colleague at Harvard professor

Bruce Nyer he says AI is an amplifier it enhances whoever uses it if democracy uses it it enhances democracy if it goes in the hands which is we don't want to it enhances that also

and when we speak about GPU as Krishna also mentioned there are only few companies who control GPUs how do you look at it as a supply chain

problem or a institutional problem &gt;&gt; look first of all thank you so much for having me on this panel. I think uh AI summit that's happening uh in New Delhi

from the 16th of Feb to the 20th of Feb certainly puts India on the map uh when it comes to the conversation around AI and and building AI in that sense. Uh to answer your question, I did raise that u

question in parliament about GPUs uh and the lack of GPUs when it comes to India's compute capacity. Now I didn't raise that to sound technical. I raised that question to sound practical. Today

whichever country has the compute capacity is going to rule the roost is going to uh have governance efficiency is going to have military capability is going to

have have more and more economic prosperity. So this compute capacity which has today become a supply chain issue but at the very heart of it is a sovereign issue. It is not a supply

chain issue in my to my mind. Now why do I say that it is a sovereign issue or it is an issue of strategic autonomy and less of an issue of supply chain is simply because there is a monopoly today

that exists in the world of AI. When I say monopoly I mean three things. design, manufacturing and export. Design almost entirely is controlled by a select few select companies like Nvidia

that have had the first mover advantage whose chips and GPUs etc. and the design architecture is being used effectively by virtually all uh LLMs, generative AI models, so [snorts] on and so forth. So

even if there is a new company that comes about the resistance to change or to move from the Nvidia chips to any other company's chip is going to be huge. So they have a design advantage or

a design monopoly. The second is the manufacturing monopoly. 90% of the chips today are being manufactured by a company sitting in Taiwan, the TSMC that manufactures 90% of the world's chips.

So therefore they in that sense have the monopoly. And third is the export controls which countries like the United States of America have imposed and they have uh effectively classified the GPUs

and the chips so on and so forth and this entire AI architecture as a strategic asset for the country. So therefore even if you have the money to buy these chips you cannot buy these

chips merely because the United States have has imposed uh sanctions or export controls in that sense right so three things design monopoly manufacturing monopoly and third is the export control

now unfortunately as we stand today India doesn't have any of the three but what India has is the air talent our AI talent is likely to double by the year 2027 we are world number one when it

comes to AI skill penetration and in that sense when it comes to talent it is India that the world looks up to but talent alone without compute in my view is merely an aspiration

right and compute without sovereignity will lead to India's dependence on some supply chain on some country on some geopolitical relationship so therefore it is important important that

India today and legislators like Krishna and myself today work towards from an India standpoint building milestones to secure access at the first level to have clear-cut direct goals so that

India has access to the AI ecosystem. The second is diversifying supply. Once we have access, we must diversify our supply so that we are not dependent merely on one

or two three economies or countries in that sense. And the third thing that we must do is build infra have the AI ecosystem here in India from having data centers to chip manufacturing

capabilities so on and so forth. I fundamentally believe and I you know quite strongly hold this view that in the 20th century power was controlled by those who had

oil, gas and steel. In the 21st century power will be controlled by those who are who have access and AI compute capability, AI capability as well as uh you know chip manufacturing abilities.

Whosoever controls this will controls effectively control the levers of power in the 21st century. Thank you. [applause] picking up from talent and um some of

the regulation aspect one one study which I've seen recently is about AI tools which we are it's a irony that we are trying to sitting here also trying to

discuss regulate the tools aspect AI tools is also helping in making better laws doing better analysis. I would like to

ask Miss Fela if Israel has done any experimentation in this space. &gt;&gt; So, uh hello everybody. Thank you for uh having me on this uh panel with this

distinguished guest. I'm truly privileged and honored and thank you for all the audience uh that came. um as I think when you opened your opening remarks was AI should not replace us but

augment us and I think it's a very um it's a very challenging to to make this line it's it's very convenient to rely on AI sometimes uh from the small things to the big to the big things so I think

every experimentation we do with um uh getting AI into government into parliament should be in in small measures. Uh so uh I work in the Ministry of Justice. We work a lot. I

come to the parliament a lot to speak about legislation and I'm not a politician. Um but I I truly appreciate discussion in I I but I understand that there's politics involved but it's very

important that when we get to parliament we with new policy to introduce and to get politician to support it. will come with evidence based with come with um uh a strategic uh why we're doing what

we're doing. To be honest, I don't think it's time to we can uh it's time that legislators we use AI in a uh extensive way. Uh it should support the work. It should support the work we're uh we're

doing. I think we in Israel we say artificial intelligence needs uh human trust. uh if we'll move too fast towards towards AI, I'm afraid that the trust in AI and in parliament uh might might

might reduce and it's not as high already, right? Uh people um no offense of course um uh have some kind of suspicions toward politicians. Uh so if we'll move too fast and not in a

measured way, I'm I'm I truly afraid that uh it will um it will harm the the the trust and in the long run will make a like the penetration of AI into civil service slower. We have this term that

we call it in Hebrew, I don't know if it translate well to English, we call it uh winter of regulation. Okay. When something happens and regulator failed, for example, it can be in

transportation, it can be in food and there is a crisis all of a sudden everyone runs towards like uh more regulation um um more severe like punishments on every not because we need

it just because we're afraid of it and that stifle innovation at the end. So I don't I think that uh in order to in in a year or two have AI in our government in our parliament it's worth the wait

and do it in a more measured and responsible way. &gt;&gt; Thank you. I have a followup to you if it's okay. So I saw something very bold from your government publishing an

opinion that uh copyright material can be used for training AI data. Could you please give more light on that and because when you speak about trust how do you think the people can like uh

connect with that trust part if that's the case? Uh so to to give context uh there was a legal opinion from the ministry of justice saying that when AI trains on

others people creation it's considered fair use as and it's because it's considered fair use there's no there it's allowed it's not a violation or a breach of

IP law. Israel was quite a pioneer in this uh legal opinion. It was you said people were trying started talking about AI in uh 2018, right? Uh this this opinion is from 2020. So you can you can

assume it's quite it's quite early. I think that was a um um it's not a legislation. It's a legal opinion translating the Israeli legislation. So that's that's one thing. If the

legislature would want to change the ballots that the legal opinion has set uh there they can do that. I think it said um it sent a message right it sent a message that Israel wants to innovate

in order to innovate this models and I I totally agree with what what was said earlier we don't need to rely only on foreign companies we have to have our own companies and once this legal

opinion came to air it meant that Israeli companies can train on data in in certain restrictions because it's a it has to be within the fair use and and I think in terms of public trust. I

think when you communicate this legal opinion not as a yes we want to steal creation of other people and not pay for it but we want to balance between innovation and and IP law that is how we

see the balance at the moment. I I don't know in two or three years if LLM will um will be even more prominent. Maybe we should change that balance. That's a question. But I want to say that's not a

question. That's a question for parliament members. they have to choose the right balance between artists uh writers and innovation. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's that's that's AI I think

raises like we we uh raises question that not will not all will find an answer in the law book. It will find answer with legislators that will have to choose which direction are we going

how do we balance values and um and I and I think that's also one way for the public trust. &gt;&gt; Thank you. It goes back to like something which I said earlier that I

personally believe again I'll repeat that because it's important that the way AI is being developed I see two ways one is replacing human reasoning human

like &gt;&gt; exactly and second one is like how do you augment the human learning so yeah thank you for that uh coming to Krishna like uh going deeper in your um proposal

of the bill which you are talking about hefty like penalties to the companies who are not who are not able to save the children if I'm getting it correctly

how do you think those are global companies we are talking about like let's be frank here like global companies we are talking about how do you think a national legis

legislator stand a chance to is the law or do you think is the capacity which is built that you will be able to enforce that? &gt;&gt; Yeah, there are global companies uh um

I'm sure most of you who are into tech space uh must have gone through the epic games versus app store um case which was there in US for so many years. If you've gone through the history, they

found ways to evade it. Even India CCI has a few startups have approached uh CCI saying uh app store and on the Android as well as the iPhone. We have these problems. When they went to CCI,

they CCI levied penalties on the app stores, but they threw lawyers at them and still they haven't paid it. Of obviously there are problems. Obviously we are we know what we are up against

and of course they have uh lot of uh legis lot of lawyer power behind them. Maybe people like Rago also not on the legislative side but as a lawyer you must be accountant right not a

lawyer chart sorry to get it wrong. So uh there are a lot of power behind them in in that sense but at the same time why we are proposing that um this has been in works for the last five 6 months

we've been talking about it about restriction age restriction for the social media. Reason being uh that if you seen uh how much uh the time that is being spent by the children 14 15 or 16

year old children even the other a couple of weeks back you must have seen the incident that has happened in Gazyabad also the effect that it had so not not just the time that is being

wasted at the same more than that the conference the you know there are studies that say that the children are not even making the eye contact with other others when they're talking. You

know, these are the side effects of uh you over overlay on social media. Obviously, do you think we need this legislation? Obvious if you say um tobacco is there, smoking is there,

whether you want to give the choice to the children to choose it or not. No, we're going to say no. Because these most of these social media apps are developed in such a way they're very

much addictive. Not it's not just from India that's I'm I'm saying it even in the US I think last week they called all of these people to depose before them all these social media platforms to

depose before them what what evils or what wrongdoings that that has been happening. So there's a reason why we are proposing that and uh there are enough evidence that is there uh which

is causing lot of um pain to lot of uh not only parents for the children also. So I think uh uh we know what we are up against more than the legisl legislation it's more about the will to actually

not just passing the law but making sure it's get implemented. That is the most important thing that is that is there because most of the times even if you lay penalty penalties are there I I give

an example of CCI they're there but how can you implement it how can you get them to the table negotiate on our terms and uh you know if you can do it with Tik Tok why can't we do it with others

that that's a question that I have thank you &gt;&gt; interesting any quick comments Raghav on the same bill &gt;&gt; I have one quick comment to make on the

comment uh the argument made by our colleague from Israel about uh the copyright issue and how uh the government has come out with a legal opinion right that effectively frees up

the space and effectively defines fair use. Interestingly enough, last uh session of parliament, I raised this issue uh during my zero hour intervention in Rajya Sabha and I did

refer to the exact same thing and I said that look today there are content creators, there are coders, there are there are innovators who are doing their own innovation,

creating their own original content. However, for educational purposes [snorts] or uh for any other purpose, they are using already published

content, code etc. in a very limited way in order to either comment on it or from an educational point of view use it and that must fall under the definition of fair use. Now India's copyright act goes

back to 19 late 50s or early 60s if my memory serves me right. At that point in time fair use is defined but fair use is defined viz the medium that was available or the sources of information

dissemination that were available in the 50s for example fair use viz journals magazines newspaper published articles so on and so forth but the definition of fair use in the

21st century in the uh year of 2025 26 doesn't exist. So therefore as a result whether it's innovators coders digital content creators all of them in that sense are suffering because of a lack of

clarity when it comes to fair use. So therefore while we need to respect the original content creator or the original coder or the or the ma the person who holds the IP but at the same time we

must permit fair use and strike a balance between the two because if you do not effect you know enable fair use you are curtailing innovation in that sense and

something what the Israelis have done is is is worth noting and I think hopefully in India we will have either a regulation or an amendment to the Indian copyright act and perhaps fair use will

will find place in the Indian you know statutes. &gt;&gt; Um first of all I want to say it's admirable that I can be in a panel with parliament members and have such a

profound conversation on AI. Um I don't know if in Israel they they are hearing me but uh um &gt;&gt; that's because there is a perception that politicians don't know anything

about AI. Exactly. [laughter] &gt;&gt; That's why she's amazed. &gt;&gt; We we are changing it here. &gt;&gt; I I I want to share just uh if I have in Israel it's not a qu sometimes when you

talk about technology there is the question of access to technology. You mentioned it in Israel we also have the issue of some population that doesn't want technology. Uh they refuse to use

it for their own if it's a religious re uh usually it's religious reasons. we have a population that doesn't have smartphones. They don't have a televisions at home. Now that's created

a challenge for the government when we want Israel was in a in a in a war just uh until recently if we want to communicate uh alarms or all kind of messages to the public it is difficult

now when we go to parliament and I'm and I'm telling it to myself as someone who love technology endorse technology and believe in innovation we also I think it's it's it's important and I think

that this summit sums it up well that we think about those who doesn't access and those who perhaps don't want it for ideological reason for in our run to innovation we won't leave anyone behind

and that goes also to the harms of technology like was mentioned like with social so social media so I think while we all love innovation and it sounds good um we should think about the effect

it has on all of our all of our community uh at the end of the day we don't want to leave anyone behind or just with the risks of this technology so uh I think it's an important

discussion and it's it's good that you're involving legislator in it. &gt;&gt; On a lighter note, I just want to add [laughter] something. So there was a uh journalist who asked u IT services

founder way back in early 20201 or something. Why did India do well so well in IT services? The answer was from the founder. The politicians couldn't understand what was happening. That's

why it it did it did really well by the time because sometimes when the bureaucrats politicians understand too much too many bricks are applied. So I think uh on the lighter note yeah

it goes to the same thing we're talking like is regulating AI or AI regulation how far can we go or is it worth it? You know like that's the whole idea behind some of these topics. It's an irony as I

mentioned earlier like some research showing that oh like it's helping a lot at the same time uh research which came out of MIT recently said that okay like using a AI like if you're dumping a lot

of things on AI your cognitive capacity is going down drastically and which is part of risk but I'll go with the risk when I started I told I I was seeing everything from the lens of

democracy so I'll try to bring the risk on that part. I think this is one panel where none of you want AI to impersonate you very well. [laughter] So what do you think about very like

straightforward question to you uh like uh how do you think when deep fakes are coming in the challenge is okay uh before that I'll give you an

example I I was doing a morning walk today in the park and someone told oh like you are from US right like my related what's happening in US I told oh and then before I could say anything she

told me she was I think 75 years old lady and she told me oh it's all AI right everything keeps coming on my phone I don't believe in anything and that was really terrible to hear

because this is where I was what I was thinking about in a democracy if you are not believing on the things you are seeing ultimately you do not believe anything and how do you think it it

would like uh in context of democracy. &gt;&gt; The context of democracy I think uh uh there are enough social media revolutions that have happened I think in at least in the Middle East. I think

the orange revolution those sort of it uh the social media was booming. I think uh there will be disruptions that will happen when the AI actually kicks up and uh majority of the users start using it.

I think it it will be better for the democracy going forward. Uh but the crux of the matter is again right now there is a digital divide. I don't want to have a intelligence divide going

forward. Say for example 10% 8% of them can afford to have access to these rest of the 90 92% people don't have access to it. So what will happen then? What will be the effects then whether

these 9 to 10% will try to control too much whether we can play give that level playing level playing field for that's our job as a legislators whe so these are the

questions that I think uh um going forward we should be thinking but for that unless unless we we don't have that intelligence divide I don't think there'll lot of ill effects to the

democracy but only when we have that these kind of observations will come like everything is fake I don't believe anything on the internet but uh I think going forward that sort of confidence

that sort of authentication going forward has to happen uh and uh it will only happen when that divide is minimal rather than maximum so I think uh it will be good

but there's there's There will be a lot of disruption that will happen. They won't it won't happen just like that. &gt;&gt; Thank you. So what I heard from you,

the information which we are seeing as a whole, as a society, do you think there will be any direct impact on people going for vote or like they're

saying oh for for example what I've heard from couple of people saying oh like oh they all are the same like how like I cannot choose so democracy gives you the power to choose

and do you think if there is a collapse of trust rav do you have any comments I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; Collapse of trust between the government and the citizen.

&gt;&gt; No, collapse of trust between the information the people are seeing because of deep fakes. Look, you see every new technology uh when it comes at the forefront comes

with its own challenges. Now you can't really brush aside AI today simply because there are you know some aspects of some misuse somewhere. you know deep fakes being one of the most uh talked

about you know ills of uh AI in that sense my sense is that the government and we as lawmakers uh two of them two of Indian lawmakers are there on this panel I mean we collectively need to you

know uh very clearly lay down as a as a as a country the accountability safety and the regulatory framework for AI Okay. Now, simply because the government will get

of these generative AI LLMs until and unless India comes up with its own LLM we must give access to the other LLMs that are there in the world the few of them that I've just named right India

will not be the first country to do so there are several countries that are doing this I believe UAE is doing this, Singapore is doing this and as a result there is a huge potential that the

country is unlocking whether it's for a trader, for a farmer, for a bureaucrat, for a politician, for a student, uh for a homemaker in every facet and aspect of life, it comes to your aid and

assistance and it can be leveraged in a big way. So when it comes to the purely the question of access I think one of the solutions is uh that with the intervention of either private

enterprise or government we give free access. Now in India [snorts] uh I'll give you a small example. Those who are subscribers of a particular um network provider, cell phone network provider, I

won't name it, it's not right. But if you are a subscriber of that particular network provider, you get free access to one of the generative LLMs free of cost merely because that private enterprise

has tied up with uh that particular company operating out of the Silicon Valley and they're giving access to almost I mean 50 60% of their uh subscriber base. So with the

intervention of private enterprise it is already being accessed by many people. perhaps with the intention of government it'll be available for the rest of the people as well and with that I think we

create a level playing field for everybody &gt;&gt; please I I think I'll uh there's one parallel I can um think of what Raav said um you remember I think seven or

eight years back or much much beyond that um Facebook has come up with uh new uh facility or new option for people in India saying we want to give free internet. There was huge advertisements

and everything and when I went to US at the time everyone was saying why India is not taking this this opportunity why you not doing this there was a lot of question in the in the Silicon Valley

this is a golden opportunity that Facebook is providing a free uh internet everything but I at that time I was gio was not there but still I was able to tell them India can actually bring down

the cost of the data we have the scale and we did it in the next four four to 5 years our data charges are much much lower than compared to any anywhere else that's the inference I can take but at

the same time the parallel I can bring in this aspect with the AI is also the similar thing yes we are giving access to say um cloud or other other LLMs that are there in the

[clears throat] Indian market for free maybe in the next 2 years or so Indian politicians will go and say um like how they give laptops as a promise for uh during the elections they'll say we'll

give this uh as a promise uh in the election also but that's one way of solving it but the most uh difficult way of solving it is how you can bring in Indian

designed LLMs into play and make our data accessible on that our people using those LLMs our people generating tokens on that our people actually value add

adding value to those companies. This is a easier route where one network provider can provide a free access to certain uh uh certain um cloud or something on their mobile. But how can

we as you mentioned earlier we have only 34,000 GPUs you know how can you we manufacture prepare those uh LLM so that our people can generate that. So going forward I think we can do it that's

example is there where we brought down the data prices definitely we can bring do the same thing in a space also because there a lot of youngsters here talented ones only pushes uh that is

needed is from the government side to actually add the infrastructure that is needed for this country thank you thank you'll get back to later. Very

quickly comment like u this was very bold statement I would say when we talk about like talking about indigenous LLM something like which we just uh recently saw Switzerland coming in those lines uh

creating with another university which which I felt uh is one way to look at it. Uh going to S like do you have any comments like we are two different democracies here and like uh we know

that like sometimes we club this AI governance as like okay like is the kind of overarching thing but like what are the specific things like which you are looking things differently when we talk

about AI governance and when we are talking in this space. &gt;&gt; So just to go back also to your question about uh AI trust in democracy. Okay. &gt;&gt; And then I I I want to say that and

regul I think it was said here and I want to uh repeat that regulation cannot solve everything. Regul regulation it doesn't come uh instead of education and education for critical thinking um and

for uh being more aware um we don't put a sign we don't put a fence for kids uh before every danger. We educate them to be aware of their uh surrounding and to be careful. So I I do think we need to

regulate AI but I just I think we cannot there is a certain limit and I think uh like you said of what we can and should regulate and you know when I when I sorry uh the microphone is augmenting me

at the moment um when I went to school and learned English we had the wh questions right uh and that's the question when you think about regulating AI is you have to to ask yourself what

do you regulate the European decided to regulate the technology as a whole. They have a law on artificial intelligence. I think it's the first law that I know that regulate technology, not its

specific uses, not for it harms. Um, so saying that I do a law just for artificial intelligence. It's a question whether that's that's the way to regulate technology. There's the

question of when uh is the time right to regulate technology now, right? um when the European introduced the law to parliament it was 2019. Uh think about how much AI involved since and when

you're doing a law it's so well I don't know in India but in Israel when you do a law it's really hard to go back to parliament and change it. So I think we need to regulate AI when we know what we

want to what we want to regulate and do it in the in the sweet spot of the timing when the regula the the technology is mature enough but it's not uh uh too too late and um and we have to

ask why why do we want to regulate AI because I think just to say um we want to regulate AI because it's something new and novel and we don't know it is not enough. We have to understand

specifically what in AI needs to be regulated. Whether it's the transparency that we're using AI, whether it's if it's a component in something very structural that we want to observe it uh

better. But I think and I believe that we um that in Israel at least the time has not come there but I think each regulator should see AI in its own domain and make sure that is used in a

responsible manner and that the public is not getting hurt but getting the opportunities of it and uh and introduce practical tool to to do to to to make AI uh safer. The time for regulation will

come. Uh but we should be very very I think realistic about what we can achieve through regulation. It's not going to replace what we have to do in other domains in order to make AI safer.

&gt;&gt; I think it's just to supplement what she said. It's somewhat similar to freedom of expression and speech. Now article 19 of the Indian constitution gives you freedom of expression and speech. Right?

It's a right that's been fundamental right given to all Indians. However, within the same article in the constitution, there are certain I think three or four constitutional safeguards

&gt;&gt; that your speech must not tantamount to treason. It must so there are three four constitutional safeguards that are inbuilt in that. So similarly we must be very careful when it comes to regulation

of AI that what we can regulate and should regulate and what we must not regulate and we should not regulate. &gt;&gt; Very good. So we we are in the last leg. We have less than five minutes left. I

wanted to touch base on like we spoke about data, we spoke about sovereign AI. Something which I would like to bring here like which not many people would know that every 14 days one language

vanishes and when it vanishes it takes away all the collective knowledge and wisdom of that community with it. I was just wondering this is this could

be an infrastructure problem. This could be uh like uh like this could be an technology problem. But I would love to hear very quickly who do you think should build a infrastructure like that

so that we do not miss on this human wisdom which has been developed since many decades. Please

&gt;&gt; I think uh more than building the infrastructure I think we need to take a step back as I mentioned earlier about social media if we start speaking if we start interacting I think there's a lot

of things that can flourish but on the other side yes there is technology that is available definitely we need to use it but as I mentioned as as you were asking me earlier how will it create the

uh democracy how it will be in the next 10 years and everything. Again, I come to the same point here. When I go to my um constituency which is having urban and rural I speak to the rural

constituents, they are much I feel they are much more informed because they have multiple sources of information that is coming in. They just don't rely on uh uh on the WhatsApp or they don't rely on

the newspaper but they actually sit down and have a discussion that happens in the villages and everything. when I go there they go sit and have a conversation that happens but when I go

to the urban constituents their only source of information is either your phone or your TV or some source that's telling you where it's actually uh killing your intuition

because someone is actually feeding it into your head. So again coming to this one the languages thing or anything that needs to be saved there'll be technology that will be

available for that to happen but at the same time that interactions that sort of uh uh no uh parallel things has to happen only then it can survive I think. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Oh sorry any quick comment

please go ahead. &gt;&gt; I just I wanted to tell you that in Israel we speak Hebrew. Not a lot of people in the world speak Hebrew. There's a lot of people pray in Hebrew,

Jewish people around the world, but we they don't speak Hebrew. 10 million people speak Hebrew. And we were afraid that when LLMs that are developed elsewhere are developed, they will

ignore the knowledge in Hebrew. We were afraid that Israelis will not have good enough LLMs that they can use in Hebrew. Um, so I don't have a solution, but I can say that the government maybe they

should take a step back. But in Israel, they also um supported companies that worked on LLM in Hebrew. So the so that the Hebrew language will be so the Hebrew the knowledge made in Hebrew will

be part of the big LLMs. That's for for one and that we'll have also our own local LLM and I think it was a great initiative to preserve the language and the knowledge uh in it. So that's one

idea to do. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; I think the question that you asked is more pertinent in the Indian context. uh I mean Israel in that sense would have 1

2 3 at max four five languages that are prevalent largely. India on the other hand has several languages. I mean I think about 22 24 languages are there which are mentioned in the as you know

within our uh constitutional scheme of things and beyond that as well there are so many different languages, culture so on and so forth. So therefore this question is very relevant in the Indian

context and I strongly feel about this. I strongly feel about this because AI and we talk about this will lead to job displacement as we all say and feel and are perhaps even seeing in some parts of

the industry. But AI can potentially also lead to not just job displacement but knowledge displacement. Now to very simply place this argument

anything that is not digitized or not searchable is not codified is not something that AI's compute brain or compute capability will apply itself to. In India you have civilizational wisdom.

You have oral traditions. &gt;&gt; You have uh you know community dos and don'ts. you have uh you know civilizational uh you know culture that has been

flowing through generation to generation to generation and a lot of this exists within families within communities is not codified is not written it's not digitized so therefore AI perhaps will

not apply itself to this huge knowledge bank and as a result the fear is that when we are building AI models for the future as we are in this day and age we are building those future models based

on a fraction of human knowledge and human intelligence. So therefore we must find ways to augment the knowledge to digitize the knowledge. I mean I'm given to understand the Indian government is

doing uh a separate AI mission and programs like Bhashini where they're trying to codify and and digitize several regional languages and I think that is something which is of utmost

importance. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you so much. We ran little bit over time but this sorry &gt;&gt; director of future shift labate our esteemed panel

&gt;&gt; too I'll present Thank you everybody. Thank you so much for attending.
