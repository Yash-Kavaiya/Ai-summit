## 📝 Transcript

the session with all your permission and uh in the traditional Indian way we thought we'll start with welcoming the panelists here and then we'll dive straight into the session right I'm

going to uh you know call on in no particular order in the order of how they are seated Dr. Vijay Kumar from MIT. Thank you so much sir. May I request Nilachal Mishra

Nilachal Mishra is the leader for our government and public sector advisory for those of you most of you know him for those of you who don't and he's been the force behind making this happen.

Thanks Nilachal. And next Ashish Kulkarnney. Ashish Kulkarni is the founder director of IICT which you would have seen in the uh you know budget so much but it's been

around for more than a decade. Thank you so much Ash Nilachal. Please welcome Ashish. And then we have Dr. Manish Kumar. Most of you know Dr. Manish Kumar. Manish

Kumar is the um you know he was earlier the managing director of NSDC and he was also with the administrative services. Thank you coming in sir of Manish Kumar as we go. I'm learning a

lot of what he is doing every day. Thank you so much sir. Shankar Maruada Mr. Shankar Maruada as you know is the founder of Xstep Foundation. Much of his work is something that is impacting us

every day. Who can forget Adar thank you so much sir. Thank you for being here and a heartfelt thanks to Dr. Romesh Rascar, professor with MIT Media Labs. He's been so kind enough. Professor

Vijkar and uh Dr. Manish, Dr. Romesh landed few hours before in India and we are thankful for them for turning India. Thank you sir. [applause] And it kind of puts us to shame like

they're so bright and nice after you know hardly an hour or two of sleep. So before the procedure I understand is there going to be a photo op before we start. So if I request

that we have a photo of the panel before we start. Let me open the door. Check. Honorable Minister uh Shri Ashi Shu

couldn't join us. He's perhaps on his way and unfortunately we starting on time and there are multiple sessions. So we are going ahead with this. But rest of the profiles I'm sure you had an

opportunity to look at them because we have only 55 minutes. We are not spending time in introducing them in detail. What I was afraid is if I start introducing that will take more than an

hour each one of them separately. So with all your permission sir maybe we will not get detailed into the introduction and your words will speak louder. So we'll start without further

ado in terms of why we are here and what we are doing and in the next 55 minutes or so we're going to have a round of discussions amongst us and then we thought of also

having a round with the audience here. My request there I'll repeat this rule as we go. You will have about 30 seconds or two to air your thoughts about the session and what you think and and what

we'll do is we will stick to the 30 seconds to 1 minute so that we can have as many views as possible. So we'll come to that a little later. Let me start by uh the topic itself AI and the future of

skilling strengthening human resources and transformation of higher education institutions. It's a long one. It's a long topic. We thought through this and then we realized the future is more

skilling. Whatever the word means, it has multiple connotations rather than degrees and diplomas and other things. Already we see a lot of youngsters and I see a lot

of young faces here who say what I need is what I'm skilled at, what I'm competent and not necessarily some paper that says I'm so competent in other things. So we are looking at future of

skilling from the perspective of how it is going to transform educational institutions and why is it important? AI is the buzzword now but the disruption is not as if it is new. I go back to

similar such disruptions that has happened in the past in the 18th century or so when industrial revolution happened people said machines are going to come over they are going to be so

efficient they'll take away all our jobs. there's not going to be anything for us to do and we are all doomed. So then it was more agriculture and trade and other things. Then manufacturing as

an industry came nothing lost. The economy just got bigger. More people got jobs and more prosperity happened. More recently when the computers were introduced I was young and I was a

student then everybody said computers have come in they're going to think for humans we don't have any more jobs and there are dhas and other things happening. Computers are taking away our

jobs. Of course, there were changes that happened. More new jobs created. Some of the jobs went away. But the economy improved, more jobs happened, more competency came into and nothing changed

and life went on. When internet happened again, similar stories happened. They said internet has come. It's now connecting everybody. I was overroad with the worldwide web and how

information and it changed some. As consultants, we used to make a living out of gathering information, collecting it, and giving to our clients. And suddenly that was gone. There was

internet that literally could give you access to anything and everything. Once again people thought, you know, there's not going to be any jobs. Just that ordinary males became electronic mails.

Ordinary commerce became electronic commerce. It continued. There were more jobs and the only difference I guess is certain things vanished. And I don't know some of you would remember it was

called department of posts and telegraphs once upon a time telegraphs was unceremoniously dropped and it became department of post. So the changes did happen but it also

introduced a whole new things like for example your social media happened, Apple happened, Google happened and things now you see jobs that are happening in a big way. So why I'm

saying this? Artificial intelligence is one such big disruption that has come in. Once again people are saying here is something that has come that is so disruptive it's going it's it can do

things faster. What we did in days it can do in minutes. Is there any role for us? Are there going to be anything left out for humans? My suspicion is it's going to create new industries like it

did in the past. It's going to create new competencies. The economies are only going to get better and bigger. And here we are going to discuss if this is the scenario, what are our educational

institutions going to do? Human resources are going to be crucial for somebody to succeed in this post AI world. Are we ready? Are our educational institutions ready? Or should we do

something? Like for example, we had this new course called computer applications. There were bachelors of computer applications and masters of computer applications that happened just because

there was a new disruption that happened. Are we looking at new courses, new formats, new pedagogy? How is it going to evolve? With that as the backdrop, our panelists here come from

very different backgrounds. They there are academicians, tenured academicians who kind of define how education is going to happen. There are people who predicted how things have happened and

there are people amongst the panelists who created this new industry basis this who been part of this making things happen and digital public good as a norm was introduced by somebody in the panel

today who is going to speak more about this with that I'm going to go straight into the panel I'm going to request Dr. Vijay Kumar to share to open with his thoughts on he's been a pioneer in these

new models of education online education in MIT um many years back was some of his thought and I know there are many other things that he's going to share with us. I'm going to request you sir

that if you can share some of your views views on not just what's going to change but perhaps what are things that don't change in your perspective. &gt;&gt; Thank you.

This should be okay. I work at MIT in a whole season. [laughter] Um, good morning and thank you Nana really for the for inviting me and uh putting

me together with this very illustrious group of people and thank you all for being here. Um, I will you know share some perspectives offhand. I'll tell you that uh I like to you know as an

educator as an as as an educationist I want to put AI in the context of educational change and uh so there'll be more about educational change than actually about AI you know and there's

lots of stuff about AI and we'll hear some uh very interesting things the other thing that you mentioned you know in terms of predicting in the future I do like to remember and remind people

that I'm actually by preparation an educational futurist and one of the things that we did as a futurist we said we don't predict the future we make it possible for others to realize preferred

futures so that's the business that we certainly are in as educators and we hope all of us are in and uh the thing that you know and Nana and I were talking about this in advance for some

weeks now about this topic not necessarily for this and uh uh he said what do we keep you know uh I should this is a little plug I am in the process process of uh with my colleague

Lana Cook at MIT process of writing uh a sec second book and it's called invariance and innovation essentially saying look with all the educational innovation at MIT I've been there for 30

years are there some core beliefs principles practice values that we really latch on to hang on that drive this even that help us navigate change you know what is it that we keep as we

ch keep changing things for the future But uh the the thing that I talk about a lot uh is you know and I I I believe this new world both has the affordances to address and the need to address is

quality at scale. So that's the dimension I want to bring and what I want to do is say a little bit about what do I mean quality and what do I mean by scale in in and uh in this

context. So I'll just take you give you a little brief history of the future. Uh in uh 1999 uh MIT launched something called open courseware. Many of you know it was

making the content of all its courses available for free to the world. What is interesting is what was going on at that time. We were actually trying to figure out how do we engage in distance

education. Now as Nana was saying there have been these cycles. You know what do we do with distance education? How do we take this MIT learning experience and extend it to audiences that we typically

don't serve outside and and how do we scale it and at that time some of you might know that there were lots of initiatives for taking content and commercializing

content and stuff and our uh I used to operate something called the council on education technology. Our faculty, my colleagues, our leadership said, "Look, look, look, if you want to extend value,

we have to know what this value is about. What is the essential value proposition, quality proposition of MIT education?" And we use some very typical words like intensity and drinking from

the fire hose, things words that you will recognize. And he said, "No, what does it really mean?" And we said, "Look, there are some things that we care about. We care a lot about active

learning. We care about in fact we use terms like minds on hands-on the you know learning MIT's uh logo is says men's atmanas you know mind and hand of course we've had in mind hand and heart

now you know to bring in the compassion element but active learning meant a lot and the the fusion of sort of analytical rigor with practical engagement to solve hard problems and that you will see

across the MIT curriculum and We said this is some this is what we do and at that time circa 1999 we only knew how to do that in face-to-face experiences on-site experiences right because said

well education like this is a contact sport and it's also a team sport right so we did that and so we said the only honest thing to do at that time to scale because we know only how to do this over

here is to take a picture of everything that we do and share it with the world. That's how we're going to scale this. And it was it was a statement in humility because we said this is not an

MIT education. It is a publishing of MIT education resources and that's how we are sharing. It was used as supplement. It was used. So scale meant and was exercised in that way at that time. But

it was I mean to your point about this stage that we are here in these are forcing functions like today's AI or disruptive force to really reflect on what is it that we care about what do we

mean for the new skill economy what is it that we want uh in terms of foundational competencies etc as we prepare learners and I'm saying learners for another reason by the way scale at

that time as you all know much has changed now nowadays we have very very complex hard problems in society. We talk about climate, we talk about AI, there's all

kinds of upheavalss and one and you know health and one thing that is clear is that the problems global problems of society cannot be solved in individual disciplines. You need cross-d

disciplinary you need to transcend boundaries of discipline. Right? And the other thing that but we say yes all that has to be done and the hard problems increase their hardness because of this

complexity but you still do those hard problems but we do not want to lose sight of the fact that we want this active practice-based learning experience and see how do we do this in

this new world. The thing about scale is very interesting. 1999 we took all this thing. It was almost like there was a homogeneous market out there. we'll take this and

you know it's like the McDonald metrics we'll just distribute this to millions of people and you know open courseware has been accessed by millions of learners around the world over the years

but something has changed now now we say that look you know if you look at your learners they come with different aspirations they come with different motivations they come with different

preparation they they come for you know upskilling they come at during various stages in their career They're not your traditional 17 year olds. They're adult learners. So suddenly you find that

scale does not mean taking one thing and distributing it to millions. But take means taking one thing. Taking many things and giving it to many different kinds of people. I like to joke with my

colleagues at MIT saying that scale is not a scalar. It's a vector. You know it's got magnitude and direction. Now you're which increases the complexity. So it's these and it seems daunting the

complexity of hard problems and we believe that we see that in various programs at MIT. Two years ago was sitting here doing day of AI. We're you know launching day of AI. You'll see

that the kinds of problems that are picked by the students themselves to do are problems that they care about, problems that are relevant and problems that they feel they can contribute to

society for. Right? So that's the doing part and they want to come up with real solutions now but the scale dimensions come and then you say my god this is daunting and this is where I will sort

of uh taper it down which is it's daunting but not just because I'm a perennial optimist but we have lots of good things on the supply side we've got some assets okay we've got learning

science we have learned a lot about learning about how people learn about learning curves, forgetting curves so that you can actually create differentiated pathways for learning

right how do you scale that AI so we got much we've learned a lot about learning science which is an asset on the supply side we've also got new affordances of technology particularly AI we can do

formative testing you know we can provide guided pathways so that we can actually meet the needs of large numbers of people for different kinds of things and there is a third thing which is we

actually have an ecosystem that we engage much more with. So we actually look at partnerships amongst institutions, amongst groups, with industry. With these three things we can

uh we can really address this new definition of scale and the new complexity. But in all this I think what we we at least this is what and uh I'm sorry but I have to give you one last

thing. We started just as a book end. We had started with open courseware. Today what we have done is launched a platform which you know during the course I'll tell you called universal AI. This is at

and this is a set of modular courses for foundational AI learning right modular interactive courses and then another layer of domain related AI vertical AI for topics in health like precision

medicine AI for manufacturing. So the foundational courses this has just been launched in spring. Our intent is to reach a billion learners. Certainly it is the intent of Dimitris Bertimas who's

been leading this uh initiative in open learning and universal AI has all this it's modular it uses AI provides different pathways for learning. So that's today's version of our open

courseware in this it's universal learning and the first offering there is universal AI. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. Thanks. Thanks doctor. Thank you so much. Exactly.

Yeah, &gt;&gt; that is precisely what we need. Quality at scale. And you also said the art of forgetting. Maybe we need to unlearn a lot before we relearn. And what you said

sounds music because billion learners you have all of them here in fact more. So we are eagerly looking forward to not just quality at scale but also some of the AI related stuff because we are we

at one level we don't understand what is there but another level we are hungry and as typically Indians do once we get on to it we move fast so we are looking forward to some of those things thank

you so much sir it's my honor now to introduce and request um Ashit Kulkarni Ash Kulkarnney is I call him the father of the AVGC XR revolution that has I don't know if some of you know the term

AVGC was coined by Ashish not today decades back and I realized it was before even uh what we thought that word existed so animation visual effects gaming comics extreme reality are now

are some part of our life &gt;&gt; extended reality &gt;&gt; extended reality are part of our life and recently in the in the budgets you would have read about this new

institution initute called Indian Institute of Creative Technologies and that is something that Ashish is the founding director and also somebody who's been envisioning this for many

years. Ashish we would like to turn to you and and also by the way entertainment is a sector obviously and entertainment has seen a lot of changes like from the theater days to gaming and

uh you know uh the visual effects now it's immersive experience I understand so where is this heading and where do you think AI can help and what in fact is the reason why educational

institutions and you are and we had the great opportunity at KPMG to work with Ashish G on some some of the new age institutions that he's building. So what is your take on what's the impact on

institutions for that s? Well, as far as uh the media and entertainment is concerned, uh AI pretty much has entered every single aspect of uh our business right

from graphics to even writing scripts to uh giving you the final video u and uh also creating uh something which is you know uh of different scale altogether. Uh nevertheless the thing is u few of

the challenges that I see as we design curriculums for the the new age storytellers is that every semester will have to be a different semester as you define it because the foundational

skills are the ones that you can actually look at going early. India unfortunately uh with the first uh uh like uh education policies [snorts]

uh didn't have creative arts, performing arts, design and sports into the mainstream curriculum and it's kind of coming in only after NEP 2020 and that too after the sixth grade onwards on

from 6th to 12th grade. So one of the aspects that ICT that we are doing is to really look at a foundational pathway for kids uh to find their uh you know uh like you do physics, chemistry,

mathematics to go to engineering, physics, chemistry, biology to go to medical and then the commerce pathway. We are creating a pathway for design, storytelling, filmm and sports uh with a

base of creative arts and performing arts. And we consider sports as performing arts too. While doing this we realize that of course AI is impacting us really uh into

every single process that we have and from ideation to script to screen. We have 52 different processes and today we cannot think of any process which cannot be done by AI and cannot be done at

scale. The issues are still there but the issues can be sorted out. There are few things that we are looking at. We are looking at beyond AI at this point in time to be precise because our

business is not only about artificial intelligence. Our business is mostly about emotional intelligence. Because the storyteller is the one who is emotionally evolved and emotionally

intelligent person because you start watching any film, you get hooked to a film and you want to continue. Just give me a hands up as to how many of you watch uh web series these days.

Most of you do. Can you also tell me if a new season gets released for 10 episodes of 1 hour each, do you watch it over 10 months? Do you watch it over 10 weeks?

You want to watch it within the first 24 hours. You know why? Because the storyteller is a evot emotionally evolved person. He's a emotionally intelligent person and that's what goes

into the storytelling. The the way they start the story and the way we end the episode, you cannot resist going to the next episode come what may. So the issue is now even with the complete AI

ecosystem on the other side which is the distribution and the marketing side of it and the reach side of it is also phenomenally higher. India is the greatest case study of all. We have 700

million active smartphone users. In 2027, we'll be about you know 1 billion active smartphone users with access to good data uh at the at the lowest prices and people have an access

to the content in the best possible way and that goes into the gaming ecosystem as well. So what I call it as we actually have decided to set up Indian Institute of Creative Technologies which

actually got sanctioned after 20 years of hard push but nevertheless it is uh it's a great beginning and when it cames to formation of schools um and I had to put my foot down and people say that

let's have a AI school uh and all and I said AI can be a center of excellence but the school that we have is a school of emerging intelligence Because we are going to deal not only

with AI, we are going to deal with emotional intelligence and we are also going to deal with behavioral intelligence and I have said digital behavioral intelligence of people who

actually have devices and different screens. We are in the screen era today because come what may about 4 hours to 5 hours or 6 hours you spend in front of some

screen or the other. So we call it a screen error and in the screen error there are different kind of uh content activations that AI is enabling us right now in the in the process of creation.

One is that we create films, we create web series, we create whole lot of things which are passive uh creations where you are watching it and consuming it. You might get engaged

with it deeply uh even by watching it uh in a passive manner. The second is the extended reality and the gaming where you are engaged with taking the story forward and that's where your engagement

is higher and then extended reality is one that even your environment around you is going to change you are inside the environment and that's the the emerging storytelling at this point in

time in in various forms. India is making more than 150 odd museums at this point in time with a great technology that is getting used in various forms and I'm lucky to be involved with quite

a few of them and the education has to really keep a pace with this there was a time that you know when you said uh you need to take this now the thing is that AI is creating

that images for you AI is creating that film for you but you need to know whether what AI is given an output is correct for you to put it to the public. The role of an editor that Raj Kumar

Hirani is one of the best editors that we have today. Whether that kind of an edit editor can be taken into the system and whether that human in the loop what we call it

can be avoided. I would say at this point in time no the thing is that sense actually comes from the experience that is happening around you and it will of course we we know that it might also get

overcome by AI in some time but the foundational skills for the kids are very important and that's why we are saying starting early in life is very important for the kids to understand

what is the grammar of storytelling and we need to prepare them from the sixth grade to the 12th grade that's This budget talked about that we are going to impact it with 15,000

schools to start with. We also had a meeting with utter tinkling uh tinkering labs. We there are 10,000 right now. There are going to be 50,000 more labs being set up. Uh and we just had a

workshop on the 12th in Delhi and Deepak GI told us that 50,000 are the new ones which are coming in and we would like to really see that the creative arts, performing arts is a part of it. Another

question what is going to be enabling for you is how many of you wanted to learn music in your life? Can you raise your hands please? And how many of you tried learning music

and how many of you are continuing with it? So the thing is AI is now going to enable you to learn music online all the time and we have two people sitting here

Lauren and Aubrey who have created Lauren Musicacademy uh.ai AI and they have actually now creating this for the thing and we are taking them to all the schools and the

universities and it's it's an amazing platform that has been created and I'm very proud that this platform has come out of India and it's going to enable people to learn uh creative arts and

performing arts at whatever age uh ages and at whatever time that they get on whatever devices that they can actually uh be. So the challenge for the skilling ecosystem is to constantly look at your

curriculums where it the school curriculum or the higher education uh because of AI you need to have a balance of foundational skills have to be there at one layer because the grammar has to

be taught to them. The issue is that when it comes to the implementation and our industry is impacted by the digital ecosystem very strongly. they need to constantly be updated with

the latest technology and the outputs are in uh in the latest technology uh as the consumers actually consume the content through that &gt;&gt; and that's why every semester will have

to be redefined as you go forward it's going to be a herculean task for all educational system yeah absolutely because what you teach in the first semester that cannot be relevant for

many things in the second semester and I think that's the challenge that I foresee in time to come and you will have to be updated with the whole thing so that the students can actually find

their way. &gt;&gt; More strongly and well informed way. &gt;&gt; Thanks Ash. Thank you so much. Big round of applause. I know the future is not scary very exciting actually but uh you

know at a foundational level makes a lot of sense. Thank you so much for sharing your thoughts. Let me turn to Dr. Manish Kumar. Manish Kumar has multiple authorative

services career and what he did for NSDC. He's now a part-time academician. He's an author. He's a writer and he advises institutions like World Bank. But what I'm very very curious and

interested is how he is trying to use AI to help higher education institutions in their journey. Right? To quote him says the goal that he has is to equip leadership with the strategic skills to

transition from a factory model of education to an adaptive AI integrated pedagogy. Sir, may I request you to share your thoughts on that please? &gt;&gt; Uh thank you very much. So I'll be

speaking from a perspective of economics uh and more of institutional economics perspective on how I look at education and AI and um what I find is if you look at it from a from a perspective of the

past uh education and industry more or less grew together. So when we had industry 1.0 We had the education 1.0. That's way back in 1760s. Uh about 1870 we came to industry 2.0

and that was the patch you know the the manufacturing systems that were being developed at that point of time. Education system also then adapted uh to that situation. Over time in about last

150 years I think the industry has really accelerated off late very very speedily. So you'll find we are at industry 4.0. the education still at is still at education 2.0. I think that's

the biggest biggest challenge that we have. Uh there are of course efforts being made including the national education policy of India which is far much more forward-looking than it

predecessor and trying to adapt. But I guess one of the challenge which comes uh is the desire for predictability and the desire for stability within the educational system and the fear among

people that how much change can you really adapt to. So therefore there is a lack uh there quite obviously and I think this is important to be aware of that particular aspect uh that there is

a forward move of industry which you cannot stop and with artificial intelligence is really really going cracking ahead. uh it's one of those technology which is called the general

purpose technology EI same as internet uh we had the steam power in the past there has been electricity in the past so there are not too many general purpose technology maybe about five of

them in last two 300 years the earliest one being wheel as people often say as an example that these are ones which changes the foundation of how human civilization operates how you think how

you interact how you behave with each other and and uh that's one of The thing which has come latest is AI and we are not going to go back on that simply by the force of technology that has come

in. It's a question of how quick we adapt, how well we adapt. So I think this is one aspect of it. Coming to the educational part of it that how should we uh now relate uh to the world. I

think there are few very important aspects of it. One is uh the fact that industry demands certain competencies and uh if we continue the old style is often very expensive education. I have

had friends in Harvard, in MIT and various others often talking to me about extremely expensive education in US whereas the industry seems to demand something very different and that people

need to reskill themselves when they actually go out uh go out to the industry. So the question was how should we break it down? what is it that we should be doing? So, one of the thing

which I strongly believe in is competency based learning. Uh because that's uh one way that you could convert every syllabus that you have into things that the industry needs. How do you

convert a syllabus into competencies that is actually demanded by the industry and you need to I think map that on a continuous basis because my discussion with industry often also has

led me to understand that there's so much change happening in the in the industry that they themselves are not aware how things will change next year. So just to give you an example if any of

you have used replete which is one of the w coding tool one year back it was chasing its own tail. it was pretty poor. But if you look at it today, it's very advanced comparatively just in one

year's time. So a lot of tools actually are very rapidly improving uh and and the technology is changing very quick. So industry itself actually struggles in a way to identify what is it that they

will require in the coming years and therefore the need that competency frameworks also keep changing keep adapting to that and then responding to the need of the industry. I think that's

very very critical. The second thing which I feel very important in the whole educational system is u the the speed at which I have noticed youngsters pick up the new tools extremely fast they know

how to do things but they don't know what to do so therefore they are busy with gaming making things etc which they enjoy I mean that's a good part of life that's perfectly okay the the the older

people uh people of my generation for example would know what to do but to them a python is a snake. They don't understand that how what is it that they need as a tool to convert that problem

into something which is easy and solvable. So I think if you are able to make this intergenerational learning much easier that you make people uh who understand what to do sit with people

who know how to do if you are able to make these two work in a more informal kind of environment not in the typical educational setting but more in a mentorship kind of environment where

where there is a freedom to express and freedom to uh freedom to communicate in a much better way. I think that could lead to changes which are far far faster uh than it is today. So I guess the AI

is throwing us a lot of opportunity. Uh there's need for a lot of lateral thinking. Uh I think education system is not going to change overnight that this doesn't institutions don't change

overnight. It takes time. But realization that change is necessary that in fringes you'll have to add new things and you have to become much more creative uh together with AI. I think

that's very critical. Uh that's how I think we can make best use of AI. So that's what what I think at at this point of time I'll add. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you Manish. Thank you so much. A

big round of applause please. As usual Shanker put in some really wonderful fundamental far-reaching things in his own simple manner. Everything except including that

silver economy bit that you said like you know the older people coming together with younger people. We trying our best. Let's see how it happens. But AI is going to provide perhaps some some

recourse there. It's my pleasure now turn to turn to Shankar Maruada. I'm sure all of you know Aadhaar. Is there anybody here who came in without Adhar? Here is the person who made it happen.

Co-founder of XEP Foundation. Not many of you know that he had a very thriving marketing career. Uh their loss is our gain. So thank you so much sir for being here. My question to you is you've been

in the forefront of this digital public good. The digital infrastructure for education is something that you are creating. What is your guideline? And obviously there are going to be more and

more people who are going to jump into it and that's why it's called digital public good right? There are others who are going to come into it. Are there any guidelines any learnings any uh you know

pears of wisdom that you want to share with people who want to be part of this digital public good and what is your views on how that will impact education system?

&gt;&gt; Thank you Nana. First of all, it's wonderful to see a packed audience first day of an AI impact summit at so earlier a time. 2007 I sold my company and was looking

to do something good for society. That's how I went into uh a lot of the work we did. My son was born in 2006. He will graduate couple of years from now. If you look in these and you know that time

my paranoia was if I as a successful wealthy Indian do not do something for India. I was envisioning a civil war in India by 2020. Uh the gap between halves and have

nots if you project that and 2026 we're doing pretty well right now. What happened in between was when problems are growing nonlinearly our solutions cannot grow linearly. the

gap will only increase and that stress will result in some kind of a fracture. So we need our solutions to also grow nonlinearly and that is how uh lot of you have

Aadhaar anybody who's not used up UPI in this hall okay anybody who's not used digil locker okay anybody who's not used uh digi

yatra in airports so you know all of this how do you take something to the scale of a billion plus in a country as large and diverse as India again and again and again right

the we did something and then you have to create a word for it it's called digital public infrastructure so India has now more than a decade of experience of coming up with nonlinear

ways of handling problems that are growing nonlinearly why is this important now AI is the ultimate nonlinear uh disruptor of this generation

We saw internet when we began, but this is going to be much bigger. When the year my son was born, 2006, if somebody told me that there's actually a career for people who travel and take videos of

it and allows others to see, somebody who cooks takes videos of it and allows others to see, so on and so forth. And these guys will be millionaires and that will be their profession. I would say

take a hike. But we are the largest uh YouTube content creator economy in the world and there's a word for it now orange economy and thanks to people like Ashish that

will only grow exponentially. If somebody told me that a youngster while still in college to get his pocket money has become a gig worker who will deliver stuff and get money as much as

anybody else would make at entry level. I would say take a hike because what do you mean you'll deliver and make money? So the gig economy 10 million jobs now right two professions that we did not

exist when my son was born the child who's born today who will graduate in around the time of our vixit bharat goal 204647 we don't even know the next five

professions that are going to come up and as Manish put it beautifully education is growing linearly It caught up with IR 1.02.0 which and rapidly fell behind. How do we

have a realistic chance with our demographic of giving them of training them now for careers that don't even exist? There's only one way as I see it that is using the principles of digital

public infrastructure here. What do I mean? Currently while we are doing very well as a country a lot of people face a lot of severe bottlenecks.

One if you're in some village and if you haven't learned English or Hindi your prospects of learning forget earning your prospects of learning are severely reduced. Two as we are transitioning to

a digital economy we've seen the benefits of digatra but a lot of people still live in the world of paper. Why? Three to find market access where are jobs

where can I get trained right is difficult can that be changed can I find in around me you can find pizza around you can find cabs around you can you find jobs

around you can you find skills around you right so there are these structural bottlenecks like this using a DPI example what does it mean if there is a way where we collect high quality data

language data that allows anyone to use it for voice services in indic language then anyone can learn anything anywhere with AI as my fellow speakers have said the only gap is motivation if you're

motivated 20 years ago if you're passionate about cooking or if you're passionate about music you would have got slapped by your parents if you want to say that I want

to take that as a career right going forward this will be the norm unless you're passionate about engineering I would advise anybody do not get into engineering do not get into what you're

not passionate about because that may not exist by the time your children graduate so given all of this the way India has created a shared capability one Aadhaar allows anyone to

use it in whatever way whether you're getting a SIM card a bank account etc by the way this is not rocket science this is a reason why we have roads somebody builds roads somebody else

builds cars What is nonlinear? The road maker does not care whether you're driving a horse car, bulock car, hydrogen, EV, autonomous. Let nonlinear scale come.

We will take advantage of it. Right? That is the philosophy we have been doing for the last 15 years and that is what we will do in the next 15 years. How do we prepare our children? The

answer is we cannot prepare them. The markets will ask specific skills. At that point, we give them the basic competencies and the human competencies and sensitivities are much more

important and NEP is doing a good job of that. The child will figure out what they're good in, what they're uh motivated to and they'll have all facilities around

them to learn. There will be local experts like the way IT industry did not exist four decades ago, right? Then you had Apple and Appech and all of these guys come and set it up. We will find

thanks to people like organization like ICT many small organizations, institutes, entrepreneurs who will set this up. We need to trust that the market will innovate for the industry

needs by finishing that and providing skilling. If I went somewhere and got a skilling course on editing, how do I know it's genuine? So you need to create reduce the cost of trust

in the digital world in voice in indic AI in the world of AI all of this can happen much easily and by the way this is already happening I don't have time to go into the details

I'm not talking science fiction right and it is not going to be science fiction when I end by saying that in 2025 when Rajni from Barabanki

is dreaming of doing research on bioothermal something she will do it in Marathi by talking to some agency agent who will do the best research because by then our

data centers and AI would have progressed to the level of Nobel scientists. So imagine you have a data center full of Nobel scientists right what can Rajni do with her we cannot

even begin to I mean cannot even imagine now but we have to have the belief that working backwards from those specific stories like a Rajani like a 72year-old

amma who's sharing a general wisdom and also making money right if you start with those use cases and work back and use the philosophy of create roads technology will come and the what's the

equivalent of roads for establishing trust verifiable credentials the equivalent of allowing anyone to learn voice indic AI all of these are being built as infrastructure blue dot you can

find a pizza you can find art can you find a job a girl child has to go and search for scholarship why can the girl can the scholarship find the girl child all

possible all happens Right. &gt;&gt; This is being built as infrastructure so that anyone can innovate on top and build their apps and not as thing that I

think is also &gt;&gt; not even future it's happening. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And also some way how 2026 India is different from 2009 when we started working on Aadhaar. Right. The world is

looking up to India to see how India handles it because when India will finally solve it for a country of a billion and a half the world will learn from it and reapply

in their world. I think that is what is exciting for me. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. And part of it is happening here. Big round of applause. And in some sense that uh science

fiction magic happened with UPI. There are days that I've uh and many of us here have moved around without money in our person. That happened thanks to this. Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Tell you the story this T sellers was asking when we had a bunch of foreigners in G20 coming and seeing UPI. He's saying sir what's the big deal about this? Right. I I had to tell him in

their country this is not there. This is magical for them. I don't understand. So the magical technology when it becomes boring and invisible that is when it can serve a business.

&gt;&gt; Absolutely well said it. Absolutely well said like you know the the trick is not just the technology but making it ubiquitous making it invisible and at scale and making it reliable and we've

not heard of frauds happening in such a big round of applause and thank you so much digital public each one of it explain. So it's my pleasure now sir I mean this has been a wonderful forum.

Thank you so much. Uh, Professor Romesh Razar has come like I said like you know few hours before he's landed. Thank you so much sir. He's also the head of uh MIT's media lab especially in certain

areas which is going to talk about more but I was more intrigued about uh the distributed technologies in AI that you're working where you're talking about agents multiple agents and you are

empowering them how are they going to work in tandem and how is education institutions going to benefit out of this &gt;&gt; thank you thank you for having me here

uh I feel like this is the very first session we're kind of the opening batsman uh for the you know for the India AI mission and we're playing more like

Kishan than Abhishek by the way. So uh it's good to be here. Uh by the way I'm not the director of the MIT media lab but I'm a professor at MIT. Um and um Mr. Shankr, I just want to say that

every time you say, you know, by cooking, you know, by doing TV shows, but take a hike, I want people to start doing hikes and still make money. [laughter]

Um, I would say, you know, we are in a a know a very difficult phase right now. I think the moment you described back in 2006 we thought this could be the world of halves and have nots. I'm really glad

you brought that up because um many of us are probably feeling that way. How many of you here are excited about AI and how many of you are really scared and how about both right and so I think

you know I think that's the moment it's like 20 years later uh we are in the same moment. Um and the reason for that is uh we all think we are in a kind of the factory phase of AI which is some

four or five companies will build AI and they're just downstream and we'll use it and the worry all of us have is that uh there'll be exactly one math teacher for the whole world you know there'll be

exactly one you know diabetic expert for the whole world and everybody else is just going to be taking those AI uh you know as master and become slave. So we're going to move into this I would

call intelligence slavery where even if people don't lose their jobs they'll be soulless heartless jobs where all they are doing is using those AI and delivering it uh a math teacher

delivering it to her student and so on. So that's the risk where we move in and this is what happened in the industrial revolution as well where you know the machines became the masters and uh and

the employees were just the slaves uh you know working very unsafe conditions um but that's because we're in the factory mode of AI um because so expensive you know very uh you know high

capex lot of data $100 million salaries nuclear power plants and so on but fortunately we're moving away from it to the garage era of AI where many of us can build our own AI models you know and

start serving which is good but not millions of them maybe few hundred uh but very soon we will be in the bazar of a model of AI bazar era of AI where any one of us can create our own AI

models train our own AI models and becomes part of our livelihood and become parts of our pride in our identity of who we are and uh once you move to the bazar

You know what we just heard from Mr. Shanker about the discovery and making this multi-sided marketplace becomes very critical and there's only one country in the world that has that bazar

model already figured out you know like we heard you know the student should be finding the scholarship the scholarship should find her um and when we switch this push and pull aspect of it there's

only one country that has done that and thanks to DPI we know which country that is so we need to kind of switch as quickly as we can to the bazar model to avoid

getting rid of the dystopian world where we only have this one, you know, master models and we're just downstream for it. So, so that's kind of one aspect of it. The other aspect of it is what does what

does it mean to have our own micro AIS? Now, if every one of you, you know, take an example of say PowerPoint, right? I mean, yes, Microsoft might sell PowerPoint, but your slides look very

different than my slides. By the way, my slides look more beautiful than you. I think I would like to believe you would like to believe the same. And the pride that I have in the slides I have made is

not a pride I give to Microsoft. I take the credit for that myself. And we want to live in a similar world where the AI micro AIs that each of us create, let's call them AI agents, the AI agents each

of us create will be our representatives. you know our digital representatives you know our Duth our messenger our envoy and so on and that certainly requires us to think in a

highly decentralized way not in a centralized way and again DPI makes that possible so when it comes to education when it comes to health when it comes to travel when it comes to energy

decentralization is kind of the strength of the of the DPI model so what does it mean for us in the skilling aspect for uh for DPI. We just heard earlier that you know you'll have access to

hundreds of Nobel laurate quality scientists at your fingertips you know through this AIS but I would say we should we need 1.5 billion you know Nobel laurate equivalent experts in this

country because each of them has so much to offer but because of you know friction they're not able to contribute to the economy because they're in a village or because they don't didn't get

the right kind of education but you know the agent entic world, the Asentic web uh is going to be a massive equalizer. Uh that's what we're excited about. Uh and this is my research for last 10

year. We call the internet of AI agents. So it's not about AI, it's not about AI agents, but the internet of AI agents. Um and a small plug, that's what the project Nanda stands for. Always joke

with Nanda Nilakan that it's kind of named after him, but forgot to put the N. So Nanda stands for uh network AI agents in decentralized architecture. It's I know it's a long mouthful but

it's also the name of my sister and so go to projectnanda.org and I think uh I think the opportunity for all of us is to change the mental model because we're going to transact

without banks. We're going to get care without going to the hospitals but more importantly we'll get education learning without building more schools. So this is a very interesting phase for all of

us as we think about the skilling of the of the nation. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much doctor. Thank you so much. It's been wonderful. Unfortunately what's happening is in this one hour

time format before we go out the other team is just nudging and pushing us in before they actually pour in. Maybe we need to stop here. But thank you so much for uh being such a lovely audience and

thank you all for sharing your thoughts and these are so much that each one of them could go on for more than a day and there are so much to learn from them. It's it's my pleasure now to uh give

away some small momentos and I would request Nilachal and Pier Stefano. Pier Stefano is the IMA head of uh government advisory for KPMG global. Unfortunately, we wanted audience to

speak but we definitely don't have any time at all because like I said it's a very strict timing that we have. So may I request Pier and Nilachal to give away a small little momentto from

our side along with the shawl that is wrapped inside. &gt;&gt; But thank you so much. Thanks so much for being such a lovely panelist and wonderful audience. Thank you so much

for turning in. Hope you found it useful. We'll have more of this. We have five days to go. Thank you so much. Good day. Walk and talk.

Go to the next session.
