## 📝 Transcript

the global south skilling for opportunity and social mobility and we have a very exciting panel for you. My name is Ained. I'm vice president with access partnership and our panel

includes obviously I'll start from there Nana who is the CEO of AVPN. She obviously has uh done a lot of work since 2013 has mobilized financial human and intellectual capital to drive

equitable development outcomes and inclusive growth across Asia. To her next we have Anjeli who is uh Aneli is a senior associate with the Indian emerging Asia program as CSIS

with expertise in technology enabled development and inclusive growth. to her. Next I have Chenny. Uh Chenny Yun is public affairs lead for government affairs and public policy at Google Asia

Pacific based in Singapore and she spearheads strategic engagement with policy makers and public sector stakeholders. And finally we have Angelica. Angelica Salvid Pero is a

senior adviser to the OECD's director for employment, labor and social affairs where she leads the work on the ethics of AI adoption in the workplace and the OECD project on AI in work, innovation,

productivity and skills which is really a mouthful a lot of work. So as you can see we have a very interesting panel uh for you today. Now we all talk about AI adoption. You would have heard panels

since morning talking about AI adoption. The key question is there's been a lot of focus on AI adoption. Most of you use AI in some way or form. Uh however, what research shows, what studies show, there

are two important aspects. One, the gap between global north and global south in terms of AI adoption is massive at least 2x more in global north as compared to AI adoption in global north is two times

larger than AI adoption in global south. Number two, AI skilling programs has actually been a wave behind for AI adoption. So there's a lot of AI adoption happening, but most of the

companies we talk to, most of the companies you will see in research actually talk about the fact that they can't find the right talent. They don't have the right people right now who

understand AI from a different as a lot of aspects, right? It's not about just engineering but the ethics, the implementation, the literacy aspect of it, which is what we'll talk about

today. uh looking at this on top of it obviously AI has the propensity to exaborate the the inequalities whether it's gender inequalities whether it's uh in digital divide so on and so forth if

not implemented and adopted in the right way uh a lot of research we have done for example we see uh females employees are using or are talking about AI as an

generational opportunity to uplift themselves in their careers and break the glass ceiling. We see that across a lot of different markets, right? However, are there the right

opportunities? Do we have the scaling opportunities for them to do that? So, that's again another area we'll talk about today. India obviously has a lot of policy leadership that's why we have

this the impact summit here. Uh the India AI mission launched in 2024. The Sham Shakti Niti 2025 obviously on the labor side which not only looks at it from a microenterprise level skilling

but also from a macro labor market dynamic as well which is another thing the fact that if you don't know what are what the challenges or where the gaps are if it's not measured you actually

don't know what to solve for uh DPI approach for example we have heard you would have heard a lot of sessions to since morning I we have talked to a lot of people recently outside the rooms as

well looking at how India's approach to DPI to AI development is very unique something which can be easily be adopted throughout the world but that also comes with the fact that how do we ensure that

the other countries are able to uplift their scaling and initiatives as well and the vixith India 2047 which is obviously the big macro mission we all have here in this room

to do that uh we all I wanted to introduce this uh AI for all workforce scaling policy toolkit and you can site use the QR code download the thing have a read but essentially what it does is

to t to guide the design and development of AI skilling initiatives for broad-based participation when you look at it is something which is very very common sense you identify

the needs the skills needed for AI easier said than done we don't even know which skills are required because we don't know which task is AI coming from so there's a lot

analysis and stuff which is required there. Talk about once you know what to measure or what skills are you talking about where the gaps are again very easy said and done but nobody responds to

survey anymore. So how do we actually do that? Uh so that's the other part we talk about. So once you know the gaps what are the implementation how do we implement a workforce skilling road map.

So that's another thing which the uh the the the toolkit talks about and finally how do you monitor and evaluate progress. So it becomes a very iterative process. I leave that at the back end.

So anybody who wants to download the QR code, happy to do that. So what we'll talk about over the next 44 minutes as per my clock are a few different areas. Maybe I'll start with uh generally

talking about the government and multilateral perspective on workforce readiness and maybe I'll start with you Angelica. uh in your work on analysis of labor markets, what are the most

pressing emerging AI related skill gaps that you see both globally and across the global south? &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you very much and thank you for for having me here today. So um

I would say that uh skills are going to be one decisive factor for workers and employers in their opportunities to benefit from the adoption of AI. Um there are three main findings from our

work that I want to bring here today. One is that a lack of skills is holding back the adoption of AI. Two that uh AI is obviously changing the type of skills that employers are looking for. And I'll

talk about that in more detail. And then three that training is becoming the most important lever to give employers and workers the opportunity to use AI and benefit from it. So taking one point at

a time the first on uh lack of skills being a barrier to AI adoption. In our service we see for example that um we did a survey of manufacturing and uh and finance firms in uh at the end of 2022

40% of them said they couldn't adopt AI because they didn't have uh this the skills in their workforce that they needed. And in a survey of SMMES that we did last year in 2025, 50% of the SMMES

are saying this in terms of the second point. So the change in skills needs um we find that AI really raising the bar for skills. Um employment has grown faster in faster in

the in the uh jobs and occupations that are most exposed to AI. Um and these are jobs where AI tends to complement workers. So therefore the the demand for these skills increases. Um and these uh

so the the the overall this is a trend right that uh we are requiring more highly educated workers than before. And the third key message is about the need for policy to be the pipeline uh of

highskilled workers. And this is uh and importantly not all about coding or AI specialists. Uh it it that's only about 1% of the workforce. Um we need to think about all of the rest of the workers

that are going to be needing uh to know how to use AI. So these are skills about uh understanding data, analyzing it, but also uh applying really AI tools to their own jobs in in the various

specifications they have and then understanding the limitations and potentials of these tools. And so to conclude rapidly, basically investing in retraining, upskilling is going to be a

you know the challenge really for for policy makers. Um and these investments are already paying off. We find that about half of the workers say in the surveys we did that they are receiving

training from their employers and when they do they have better outcomes in terms of the impact of AI on the quality of their jobs and on their performance. So what does it mean in ter well it

means first of all doing training in the topics that matter as we said but also doing it in more modular and flexible way so that people can do it throughout their lives um and in ways that is are

less attached to uh the specific job contract they have. So what I'm getting here at is training needs to be available for temporary workers, workers in the informal sector, uh platform

workers, not just full-time employees as it tends to be right now. And then a last point on the recognition of qualifications. Uh so especially when you think about um

micro credits these credits need to be easily certified and acknowledged by potential employers so that uh these skills that are gained can be then used to uh find other jobs both in the

country and across. So this collaboration across countries is really important uh and it's what's going to give countries especially those in the global south an opportunity to move from

up the eye chain you know from low value added uh AI um jobs and activities to higher value ad ones. Thank you. &gt;&gt; I think you raised some very interesting points. I think the platform workers is

a important one. We do keep talking a lot about the white collar jobs but AI isn't just coming for them is AI is coming for a lot of other jobs as well. I think you also talked about the

importance of the role of employer employees contract or the social compact between them to understand how what is the role for each of the parties there. Chenny maybe I'll come to you. Uh we do

there's a lot of focus on the fact that the labor impact of AI is very nuanced right. uh some studies say 40% of the jobs global jobs will be enhanced, transformed, displaced by AI. Some

studies say no jobs people with AI skills will displace people without AI skills which is you know the the new new thing these days. Um in your experience where where do you see which roles do

you see are the are are the are transforming the greatest and which areas you think will require the greatest mitigation interventions? &gt;&gt; Great. Um thank you Abin. So I take that

as a sort of the future work um framework. Um very nice to meet you um everyone. My name is Chenny. U before I give my official answer. I'm going off script. I have one comment one question.

My first comment is that I purposefully dress green. It's always a delight to come back to Delhi and then I thought that I needed to add orange. So green and orange. Love coming back to to

Delhi. My first time. Thank you. um in Barabanda Pam and I want to thank all of you for for coming here you know taking the time to to listen to some of these conversations on the latest um on the

deployment and development of AI. So thank you for that and uh my question is do you all use AI products every day? I use Gemini or you know for that better you know any other um AI products. So if

you're nodding to this question I think you're doing a great job. you are actually on the front line of you know people who are on this AI race who are thinking about what does the future work

mean to me um and I've been in this private tech sector for um eight years now and when I think about my parents um I'm originally from Korea um I'm based out of Singapore I'm working at the

Google Asia-Pacific headquarters and so my parents they were born in the 1950s and whenever my father asked me so why do to do um you know and I tell him what I do and you realize so this job

that I have didn't exist in my parents' generation and when I think about my own children 20 years down the road they probably have something that I may not be able to imagine today so that is

where we are uh at this critical trajectory um of AI and for all and the positive impact as this summit um is looking to to address and Abina to your question I I think um at the end of the

day there's what we call this quote unquote um human in the loop. So even if you're using AI chatbot if you want to augment your skills you know and etc. There's always this human element,

right? You need to have the crit critical thinking skills. You need to have creativity. You have to have that uh that human touch at the end of the day. You are not just taking whatever

output that you're getting out of Gemini verbatim, right? You have to think about like what does that mean for us or mean for my my employer. So that is very critical and I think the only thing that

is constant is the the change that we have. If we had had this summit say a year ago, probably the conversation was slightly different and then from here now when I think about

uh you know February 2027, I cannot even imagine you know where we will be at u say a year from now. Um and to the point you know Abinet I think you know the future of work how we are upskilling our

you know the the future generation or even including you know current generation. And I think just look at this room uh we have you know representative from you know the the

international organization from the private sector you know from think tank from the philanthropic sector. I think br you know making the bridge uh you know amongst the sectors talking to the

government showing up with the government stakeholders putting our hands together to think about yes how do we then upskill you know as um Angelica pointed out you know some of say some

rural population you know asha workers you know in India for example how we make sure that you know as the India government has so rightly pointed out this benefits all of us right this isn't

just a conversation for you know global north global souths um so that's why we are here. So I'll add my first answer. &gt;&gt; Welcome to India Chenny. This is my first time in Bat Mandapam as well and I

also dressed up in white just for the colors. Uh uh Anil moving on to you. Um in one of your commentaries which you had written last year um you talked about how 54% of

South Asian youth lack skills for decent jobs which could erode labor labor advantage. We do talk about the demographic dividend for most of the global south countries in South Asia

included. Uh how do you potentially how do you see the reality shaping AI skilling priorities in global south? &gt;&gt; Great. Thank you again and and it's a pleasure to be here with all of you

today. When I wrote this piece a few months back leading up to the AI summit, I was really thinking about how we reframe this statistic of 54%. Right? This is not simply a skills gap. It's

really a systems mismatch. And this is also really obvious by looking around you at the AI summit and how many youth you see attending this summit even just on the first day. And [snorts] across

South Asia and much of the global south, millions of young people are entering labor markets that were already struggling to absorb them even before AI began reshaping entrylevel work. So what

does that tell us? It tells us that our response must reflect three structural realities. And this is really about high informality that we're seeing, the labor mobility and institutional capacity that

these are all framing constraints that we're facing in order to be able to capture the labor market that's shifting, but also the young people that are looking for jobs in this shifting

environment. So let's first look at foundational AI literacy at scale, which we really truly see as a key component here. And this I'm not talking about advanced coding. I'm not talking about

elite boot camps, none of this, but really short modular mobile first programs in local languages that teach workers how to use AI tools safely and productively in their existing sectors.

Right? So, this is portable stackable credentials that any worker can take with them, not the employer. And because we recognize that labor mobility is high, but we also need to be realistic,

right? In informal economies, AI adoption will not primarily happen through classroom training. It will happen through embedded tools. And so those are tools that people are using

every single day. That's things like AI built into WhatsApp business tools. It's helping small vendors share customer messages. It's AI embedded in digital payment apps that we know exist across

India that track sales trends and suggest inventory levels or AI crop advisory systems delivering localized farmer guidance. So for many informal workers, AI will function as

infrastructure, not as a standalone product. And I think that's really important for us to recognize. And the worker is not going to be learning AI for instance. They will use a tool that

quietly improves pricing, inventory management, logistics, or credit access for example. The next piece we need to think about is productivity focused skilling. And so what I mean by that is

70 to 80% of employment in the global south is in micro or smallmedium enterprises. And so in these sectors displaced workers will be entering them and intensify competition and compressed

incomes. So we need to be prepared for that. So AI skilling needs to be paired with uh tool adoption specifically through partnerships with different kinds of financial tech platforms, agri

tech startups, different types of software providers for small and medium enterprises and governments need to be enabling adoption through co-inancing a lot of

this through regulatory clarity through integration with digital public infrastructure. And then lastly we need to think about institutional agility. So vocational systems like the ones that

exist in India like the ITIs they need to be they need to be adopted and adapted for what's to come right now. What exists with ITI is really meant for slower industrial cycles. It

is not meant for where AI is right now. So we need an annual skill gap review. We need to think about instructors retaining every retraining their skills every 18 months. And so this is where I

really see AVPN's AI workforce skilling policy toolkit stepping in because their emphasis on contextualized sector strategies and agile review cycles is really going to be able to show us how

we translate these types of frameworks into measurable income mobility on the ground. And so I feel like with embedded low friction adoption models and institutional reform, AI can actually

raise productivity and income resilience. And so that's the policy choice in front of all of us. &gt;&gt; Um, thanks Nana. Coming to you, uh, we hear both sides of the equation. We hear

from students that they don't know what to learn because there's obviously a lot of stuff happening. So a lot of them are going either for vocational training or for hard sciences for example. and also

on the employer side they don't know where to start right uh and I believe obviously the toolkit is a good starting point for a lot of folks but from your perspective as you know you have deep

networks across philanthropy social investments private sector ecosystem development how do you see the role uh in linking governments nos all of these things how do you think the skilling in

initiatives can effectively reach underserved communities andor obviously medium and micro and small medium &gt;&gt; thanks thanks abinit Um so I think you know what uh the speakers before me have

said are very true. We need to look at how do we reach the most marginalized the ones who are most affected. How do we actually embed these tools? How do we actually um really look at well you know

really interesting that all of you in this room are using AI tools right now as as Sheni got did a did a dipstick test but I think for us especially given that we're sitting here in India we need

to be figuring out how AI skilling is really reaching those that are not sitting in this room and that's that's where you know the workforce will come from that's where the economy will grow

from and that is very much an ecosystem approach. It's not really one thing followed by another thing followed by another thing. The other thing we have to be very clear of especially in

markets like India is that we scale what works locally not what looks good globally. I think that is very very important. So for us in order to do that we have um you know we've launched this

policy toolkit which please do scan the QR code please tell us what you think of it but it's been really great we have a partnership with Google with the American development uh with the Asian

Development Bank and we are doing this AI opportunity fund. We're in phase two right now, which really is looking at working with organizations across the ground to reach those who are left out,

who are not in the conversation right now in this room. And I think that's where you know Anjali said this, I think Sheni said this, I think Angelica also said this is that it's important that we

work with workers with MSMES and actually with women. So we did uh an AI landscape mapping across Asia and actually less than 10% of the AI technology even reaches women. So I

think you know having a gender lens is is crucial. So not just looking at the most marginalized, not just looking at workers but also looking at women and how do we actually reach women.

As I said I think for us everything starts on the ground. How do you actually listen to people on the ground and figure out what is it that they need to do? How do we actually keep gathering

feedback and real life stories and look at training that will actually reach them? So one example I have through our AI opportunity fund is actually working with one of our local training providers

people's action for development or pad who went straight to the rural villages and actually delivered fully offline face-to-face training. So, we're talking about AI skilling, but we delivered this

training completely offline, which is actually very important when you think about it, when you want to remove access barriers and you want to build confidence in communities who are

starting out with very low digital literacy. So, the result, more than 4,000 villagers actually completed their training and they actually used AI tools like Gemini. So they're now able to do

voice-based inquiry with local language to get practical information on farming, on weather, on government schemes, health and everyday problem solving. So that's a local solution that works.

That's how you actually really get AI to work for people to get AI to actually AI tools as you said analie to get them embedded in local communities. And I think it's important that we also look

at working with policy makers. I think Angelica you referred to that and especially in countries like India. So I think for us at AVPN it's looking at an entire ecosystem approach.

&gt;&gt; Yeah I think great point D. I think u I think you touched the point about gender that we need to have gender minority. I think all of that has to be inbuilt in the design process. Uh a lot of our

research typically which we have done says that women are less likely to use chatbots as compared to men. they obviously are less lot less presented in STEM related education as well. However,

in countries where there's a massive disparity between uh male and female employment, we see women much more likely or much more keener to use or learn about AI scaling. Countries like

India, Saudi Arabia for example, Japan, Korea for example, they are we see there's a lot more uh interest to learn about AI. So I think that has to be built into the design stage as well.

Maybe on on the same point, I'll come to you maybe Angelica. uh how do you see for for let's say if we have to build on that how important are non-traditional pathways I think you talked about micro

credentials for example in bringing more women into the AI enabled roles yeah &gt;&gt; um well so I I think I think that in terms of training and and lifelong learning uh

women are not less likely to participate in these programs than men uh the the the differences are in the topic. So again going back to the importance of making this training not about becoming

an AI specialist if that's not exactly what we want to get out but how to use these tools in your own job so that they're useful and you know in that in that sense we have a lot of access

because women do participate in training. we just need to make it not sound as if we're trying to make coders out of them if that's not what we want, right? Um and and then also in the

workplace because what we see from our evidence is that well there's a there's an issue there that's sort of structural meaning that women are in jobs that are less likely to be uh highly exposed to

AI. So they are they have less need and opportunity to use AI tools. But as these generative tools become more embedded as we were saying that will not be even an issue. So it's just a matter

of you know making it a day-to-day thing. &gt;&gt; Anjali I'll come to you. I think we did talk about MSMES as well. U the skills needed for larger companies are more

tailored towards software development. We were talking about this outside as well engineering skills whereas for a lot of smaller companies they are looking more towards application based

skills a one-size fit obviously one size fit all doesn't necessarily work so how would scaling initiative approach these differences &gt;&gt; sorry um I want to just address you know

whether it be MSMES or women in um these spaces as we think about how to be able to reach them. I want to just focus on intentional design. What does that look like? Right? How do you reach people

where they are right now? So, we can talk about embedding AI into structures and infrastructure that they use, but also we need to figure out where the people are that we're missing, right?

And and Nana raised this. It's not all of you in the room because we're not missing you and you're going to figure out how to get there. You figured out how to get into the AI summit and use a

QR code, right? But how do we think about where these people are and especially where women are as they grow in force in MSMES and these are four places where I think that we could use

institutional design and that's one delivering the tools through self-help groups and cooperatives. We see this is an age-old program that continues to work. We find women and micro and small

enterprises focusing and working through these cooperatives and self-hel help groups from the most local village level through the districts and they're effective. They're communitydriven and

they've got a localized context in addressing problems and solutions. Right. Second is using the voice interface rather than textheavy apps. That is the best way to be able to

create remove these barriers. We know that using local languages and using technology with voicebased which is so accessible right now seems to be effective. So why not have more tools in

this medium? Third track gender disagregated income changes that is going to tell you the shifts that are happening across these sectors and it's going to tell you across micro and small

medium enterprises what's functioning and what's not. Where should AI tools be inserted? where is there a need and what is actually not progressing. You can be able to see that through labor data

which we're going to talk through more later within a year. You can address where the income changes are happening and how AI's help that productivity. And then lastly, align the AI tool access

with micro finance networks. These are not old school ideas. Micro finance networks are still alive and kicking and women are driving these changes and micro and small medium enterprises rely

on them still and they're effective. So how do we think about this intentional design so that we don't let the AI widen the gap even further? &gt;&gt; Great points Anjelie Sheni I'll come to

you now. Um from a private sector perspective, what are the top two three emerging AI capabilities and workforce shifts that you are seeing globally and how can cross sector partnerships

effectively accelerate AI adoption and economic opportunities in the global &gt;&gt; south? Thank you. Um so I think in terms of the cross- sector partnership um I mean I

alluded to to a little bit about you know just look at this panel and also if you look at the gender ratio [laughter] we're very happy we have all women panel um so I actually want to go back to the

AI opportunity fund uh Nana so for those who are a little less familiar with what um she introduced earlier so this is AI opportunity fund uh with the support from Google the Asian Development Bank

you know our partner ABPN is rolling out this uh skilling initiative. This is not just India, across the entire Asia-Pacific region uh a total of you know 27 US uh um 27 million US dollars

and I'm very happy to share that just India on now looking at 174,000 beneficiary. So meaning this is reaching yes the the rural communities uh relatively sort of less um familiar with

the latest uh you know AI adoption. So we are very um proud of that. And one thing also Abin I forgot to answer your question earlier about this fear that people have that oh wow AI will replace

my job and I do get this question probably everywhere I go across the region. Uh but oftent times I say you know AI will not replace your job but probably somebody who knows how to use

AI might. So this there's a lot of food for thought when you think about you are not competing against AI. AI is augmenting you know your capabilities right uh basically

if you have a cell phone um and also if you have been using Google products probably in the last decade AI is already um part of your life right so whether you use Gmail you know Google

maps uh you know so I the first app that I open when I land you know the airports you know Google maps um Gemini obviously so I think that gives us a bit of perspective

um and also I giving real life examples if it's um helpful for for the the people here to basically draw the picture. Um so this is live testimonial um colleague

students um majoring in cinema and filming. Um and then they say I mean if I have the freedom to talk about more Google products they say hey you know Chenny we used Gemini and VO3 which is a

video creating tool and with um just couple hundred dollars they were able to create this short film which was created entirely by AI. and they were referring to how that actually removed the barrier

to entry. If they didn't have this support uh from AI, it probably would have cost them a entire professional studio uh staff to actually film uh you know the movie and also the actors to be

in the movie and etc. So they these say thanks to AI. So these are like college students um as I speak they say the the barrier to entry doesn't exist anymore. Um so I think this is a great example of

how people are there isn't like a traditional or one fixed idea of AI of skilling. I see we hear all of these different sets of testimonials from students um you know in their 20s um how

they actually going out of their traditional way of how will AI help my job hunting for example or my career growth. Um so these are some of the the live examples. Um I think I I won't mind

AI taking some part of my job. I or it would have made the ordering food ordering process more efficient. I would have definitely loved that. Uh before I come to you Nana quick question. I think

we did have like most of you use AI. How many of you actually find AI saves you time and how many of you think that you are spending less time in office because of

that? Okay. See well for which basically means that you are doing more revenue so it's a good for productivity but if you are saving

time please use that time to learn more AI skills that should be the important aspect but Dana coming back to you uh from your experience what are some effective strategies for designing AI

skilling initiatives as you said that are locally relevant and can reach underserved communities in global south I think you talked about some of them so I'm just trying to think how do we align

all of that &gt;&gt; so I think I think Abini just bas Based on the question that you asked, I think you know that's where the AI skilling is really important. The majority of this

room put up their hand where they felt that AI actually saves you time or you use it regularly and you find it efficient. But I think there were just four hands that went up that said it

doesn't really make you spend less time in the office. And I think that's the telling example. I think the skilling needs to be very much tailored and very specific to what is it the problem that

you're trying to solve and that's what we've done with our AI opportunity fund phase two. So phase one was basically a train the trainer model and you know we went ahead to say let's train all these

trainers who can reach the last mile who can reach those people who are not here. But when we did phase two, we actually went a little bit deeper, used the learnings from phase one and then

designed phase two to be much more efficient, which was really looking at how do we empower these training providers to design their programs based on what we learned, which is what we

learned today that yes, everyone uses AI, but it doesn't make you more efficient at work. So our local training provider in India, for example, in um in Gujarat, Junior Achievement India

Services trained more than 52,000 workers. It was a 15-hour curriculum delivered in person with a two two to three day sort of in-person model. And what was the

differentiator? The differentiator was relevance. The curriculum was sector specific and designed for businesses like food processing, but muticians and micro entrepreneurs who had so it had

practical outputs like how do you produce a logo? How do I actually produce a price list? How do I actually use AI to help me with packaging and with promotions tools that the

businesses already used became the gateway and as Anjali said it was voice-based. So voice-based AI in Gujarati which made AI accessible for the firsttime users and I'm sure if they

were in the room they would actually tell you that the time that they spent doing their work was less I hope at least &gt;&gt; which which basically means that you are

doing more valuable stuff as you go along right so that's that's obviously the hope or you are spending the time uh learning more AI skills and not watching Netflix uh that's ideal situation an

coming to you uh you did talk about the labor lab data aspect, right? So, in your analysis of AI and the global south, what are the biggest blind spots in existing labor data that risk

distorting AI scaling priorities? &gt;&gt; Great. Um, I don't know how many people pay attention to labor data. I don't know if it's relevant to you. I don't know if you look at it based on what you

see produced annually but when I started looking at it I started seeing that our labor data globally especially in the global south was built for industrial area economies right so what I'm trying

to say is that AI changes tasks rapidly sometimes quarterly but most countries track employment annually by broad sectors and so what I'm seeing is that there three major blind spots in labor.

The first is the informal sector invisibility. Right? So in many global south economies, most workers are informal yet they lack real time productivity and AI adoption data in

micro and small medium enterprises. Second, what we've spoken about a bit today is the gender invisibility. So women's unpaid care work, we know all should know about this by now. We've

been talking about it for decades, but their homebased production and agricultural labor are still often undercounted. And then third, it's the outcome distortion. So systems track

enrollment and certification, but they rarely 6 to 12 month income mobility is tracked or employment stability is being tracked. Right? So the question is given these factors how do we fix this in

lowcapacity countries because many people in the room will tell me great these are big problems how do we actually do this we could do this in the US but we don't start with national AI

powered labor dashboards we start incrementally and I really think this is where change can be created so let's think about sector pilots for example in agriculture partner with an agri tech

platform to track adoption and yield changes among participating farmers. I know in India we have so many apps for farmers right now and so many different apps get your crop here go based on this

temperature but imagine an AI functioning app for a group of people that would depend on it so holistically that could actually actually change productivity right so second leverage

the existing digital rails things like mobile bunny platforms super successful in India but also across South Asia as India takes this platform form to other global south economies and use the

digital payment systems to generate transaction level data that can indicate income patterns without new bureaucracies. And then lastly, require skilling programs to track income

change. And that's really, you know, looking at follow-ups at six and 12 months, which can provide better insight than enrollment statistics alone. and then structure annual industry

consultations. Right? So my idea [snorts] that I'm trying to say is start small, use existing platforms, trans track income outcomes and institutionalize one review cycle per

year and then with that what you'll get is data systems will mature policy is going to assume imperfect information and design for adaptability. The reason why I stress this so much is that you're

not going to see the impact of AI on labor and on income unless you start tracking it effectively. And so it's really essential especially for the informal sector.

&gt;&gt; And I think that's a point you also raised out earlier Angelica. Um I think these these are all valid points. I'm just wondering from a traditional labor market information obviously they're not

useful enough. We just came up with a report last month at Davos which talked about that how our labor systems are not useful in the age of AI and how how AI can also augment how do we track track

labor data. So from your perspective what do you think are the minimum data and indicators that governments in global south should prioritize to steer AI scaling policy responsibly?

Um, so we we do a lot of work on labor market information systems, not just producing statistics on the labor market, but helping countries set up systems to

track the evolution of the labor market. Um, one of the key findings that we have is that mixing quantitative and qualitative data really helps use the data for policym because it's true we

don't have a lot of you know the data that we have is not perfect but it's even worse that the data that we do have is not really used fully to inform policym there are delays uh it's all

exposed it doesn't help fixing things that are coming up so this mix of quantitative and quality Qualitative really helps. Quantitative uh will help measure emerging needs and qualitative

is that helps um you know have a 360 understanding of the challenges really more granular feeling of what the issues are and promote collaboration with other you know across stakeholders. So policy

makers, employers, trade unions uh and training providers. Um many countries are moving towards using uh online job vacancies to understand how uh the market the labor markets are evolving.

Um and this data is is granular. It's timely. Uh actually you know like by using AI itself you can you should be analyzing that. But just because of what I just said, it's also data that is

expensive both in times of the amount of financing, you know, the the the money that you need to get it and process it and the human skills, the the cap human capital that you need to process it. Um,

on top of that, for uh countries with large informal markets, they're not very representative of the of the situation of their labor markets. So they need to be complemented especially in global

south by qualitative data and it's already quite a lot of uh of uh activities that's that's happening in this sense. &gt;&gt; No I think that's those are fair point

in fact one of our recommendation in that paper were also talking about how we could use twins or labor data twins to sort of actively regularly manage how the the actual labor market is changing.

So that's obviously something AI can augment labor data collection as well. uh Chenny coming to you and I won't don't worry I won't talk about labor data to you but how does how do you

suggest that we access and measure the long-term societal and economic impact of AI adoption in global south and what do you think can industry what type of actionable recommendation can industry

offer governments &gt;&gt; yeah thank you I see we have five minutes uh and we have to go to the other panelists um just very quick um so three aspects from Google to think about

sort of global um talent mobility and how we think about measuring um the success you talk about you know monitoring and you know evaluation uh but I think number one is probably

standardizing digital credentials so we have what we call from Google side uh Google career certificate I don't know if you have any graduates of Google career certificate in this room uh we

have across the globe 1 million certificates issued uh so you get trained uh you know with with the Google team and then you get the certificate and for example in India it is

integrated into you know the skill India digital hub so I think that's a great way to encourage people to basically this is the latest technology that you can leverage uh for your career. Um and

number two is I will say you know agile governance uh for skilling and keeping pace with what is it ladies like I talked about you know the development and deployment of AI and I cannot think

of better example than this week what's happening in Delhi the world is watching what's happening out of India this week so this is a very exciting moments I think that's a great example um and

number three is uh a bit of sort of regional mobility frameworks I think one of the panelists talked about you know intercountry you know support and sharing knowledge is also crucial. So

going back to the AVPN example I think regionally to think about a bit of mutually recognized framework. So we don't just think about India. Uh I think uh I mean you know I think one of the

panelists talked about how are how they are doing this in Singapore right in Japan in Korea and etc. So I think looking at it sort of the broader region that really helps us to stay focused on

what's you know and how we can you know leverage uh the best that AI can offer. &gt;&gt; Yeah and and that's a fair point. I think there's a lot of lessons which country like India can teach the world.

There's a lot of talent. We keep talking about demographic dividend which we need obviously need to use. uh but but that's something which we can teach the world and obviously learn from the world as

well as to what's working in different parts of the uh globe as well. We're down to our last three minutes. What I'll do is I'll just go through the panel ask you one qu one thing which you

think we should have solved by Feb 2027 one year from now when the next similar session happens I know Chenny said she doesn't know how the world will future will look like but I'll go through that

but while I do that while maybe you can think about it I would want to obviously encourage everybody in the room please download the toolkit use it in your organizations talk to your countries

figure out how you can deploy this check out all the great work AVPN and the team is Look at what all the great work CSIS and Anji and her team are doing in in throughout the world including how they

are helping countries companies scale upskill themselves. Look at all the work which Jenny talked about Google certificates for example how all the great aspects of skilling initiives

Google is supporting throughout not only for individuals but also for enterprises and also obviously from Angelica and her OECD team as to how they are bringing the best of knowledge global not only

global north but across the world to all the world talking about labor market as well. So maybe Nana I'll start with you on what do you think one thing which you think we should be doing by 2027. So I

think we should be looking at AI skilling with with you know some careful research. I think u you know every country right now talks about AI and you know AI is is something which brings in

a lot of people but AI is not firstly a a fix for everything. We need to be clear what is it that we are going to try to solve and then intelligently use that AI to solve it. So I feel like if

we can if we can do that by 2027 February we'd have made a huge sort of progress especially in Asia which is um you know got the advantage to try and really figure this out with research

with seeing what has worked and not worked in other parts of the world. &gt;&gt; Aneli &gt;&gt; great um I think that the labor mobility piece is going to be really important.

So I'm hoping by next year this time we're going to recognize that uh the labor workforce is going to be moving between informal and formal sectors and how do we make sure that the AI literacy

is portable as a result addresses both sectors effectively. &gt;&gt; Jenny, &gt;&gt; yeah I want to um introduce uh what's called health bonnie uh by Google. So

this is an AI powered voice tool um that democratizes medical information by communicating that information and knowledge in the native tongue uh in different languages right so you don't

have to be able to speak English to understand it is bringing um that information in your native tongue and I want to go back to you know Angel's point earlier there's this amazing

impact if you can access that information by voice not everybody has the otory to open their laptop have the desktop or have the latest version of you know you know Pixel you know or

iPhone. So I think that these voice models are really something that I'm very excited to continue to to watch out for. Y Angelica &gt;&gt; um I would maybe say that I would like

to see expanded certified micro training uh on how to use that in say top 50 jobs &gt;&gt; and also acceptable by employers right um I forgot to say this but if you don't know more about access partnership

please do also check out check us out as well uh my my wish for 2027 when I was looking at the when we were planning this was that we will have more women in our panel like this. But we already have

a good thing which is which is obviously houseful which is I'm very happy to be the diversity candidate today. Uh so thank thanks a lot everyone for your time and and I hope you enjoy the panel

just on time. [applause] We must You're already providing reach out to us. Our next phase is really around

the website. someone
