## 📝 Transcript

digital infrastructure record in a few moments. But this is a really energetic, vibrant, exciting summit really showcasing Asia-Pacific and India as a as a genuine tech leader. There's a real

buzz in the air and it's it's it's very noticeable as soon as you walk through the door, even if you have have to wait a few minutes to get through security. Um, and this event really represents a

crucial part of that story. Um, India is a global tech leader. Asia-Pacific is increasingly a global tech powerhouse and data centers are an essential for that leadership in artificial

intelligence. the building data centers to to meet that demand obviously which is is is essential for the region but it's also essential that data centers are built

sustainably and innovation meets that need for sustainability which is why the sector are innovating and focusing so much on sustainability and I think it's notable that planet is

one of the sutras of this event and I think that's very welcome Um a key plank of the focus of sustainability from the data center sector in the region will be the

sustainable digital digital infrastructure accord which is emerging. We'll be launching this in the spring in March or April. But this is a really useful session to

talk about the higher level goals of the SDIA and we'll be discussing this in more detail over the next few few minutes. So we've got a really stellar panel to discuss this over the next

hour. Delighted to be joined by Ms. Rena Sund Rajan um who is the chairperson of the broadband India forum and we're really delighted to have the partnership of the BIF this afternoon. Also joined

by Bimal Candelwwell who's the CEO of ST Teledia Global Data Centers India by Alexander Smith who's the principal for global infrastructure and energy at Google

and by Sukrit Anand who's the vice president investments and strategy at digital connection. Thank you very much to to all of the panel for making making time this afternoon.

like to say a little more about the APDCA and what we are looking to achieve. So the APDCA um is composed of of 10 collocation data centers

in the Asia-Pacific region. Our goal is to support policy deliberations and foster informed discussion on building a secure and sustainable digital future. Um between us the APDCA members have 250

data centers in the APAC region. Um this includes 42 completed data centers in India and 15 under construction. Um, as I say, we're also delighted to partner with Broadband India Forum, a

nonpartisan technology forum and think tank representing India's broadband, digital infrastructure and emerging technology ecosystem.

It's important to note that sustainability has been and will continue to be a real priority for the data sector industry in the region. And this is summarized by the ongoing

work regarding the sustainable digital infrastructure accord. This is a collaborative effort to promote and advance sustainability in the sector by establishing shared

voluntary targets that reflect the diverse climat climatic and environmental conditions across APA. It's inspired by the European Union's climate neutral data center pact. But I

think I think it's important that Asia to note that Asia Pacific is a more diverse region in terms of climate and al also does not have a single regulator in the way that the European Union does

which makes it all the more important for this to be an important collaborative effort between partners. The objectives of the the sustainable digital infrastructure accord are one to

establish a regional baseline of industry commitment to complement national standards and policies and this is the first APACwide baseline of industry commitments and

second to create a structured platform for government industry dialogue and collaboration to facilitate knowledge exchange on what is realistically achievable grounded in data and evidence

and enable joint discussions on how to raise a bar further drawing on regional and global best practice and shared experience. We are still finalizing the details of

the SDIA but we can say that these will be divided into four different categories. The first is energy efficiency which will look at PUE targets.

Um and the these targets will be reconsidered on an annual basis. The second is looking at the amount of clean energy which is used within data centers

particularly carbon-f free and renewable energy coverage. Um and also looking at international best practice such as so solar, wind, hydro and nuclear energy as well as renewable energy procured

directly by consumers or operators. Um the third target will be around water use um assessing local walk water stress and implementing various water management plans and obviously this will

be a different target in water stressed areas than in other areas. And the fourth element will be around the circular economy. Um with data centers looking to set a high bar bar

for circular economy practices um including measures to consider the opportunities to manage waste heat for all new projects as well as considering issues such as

embodied carbon. Now, as as I say, the exact targets are still being discussed, but the these four areas uh where we're finalizing the targets represent a really bold baseline for the industry in

the region and they also show the genuine priority that is being given to sustainability in the region by the entire industry. An important thing is that this is a collaborative initiative

which includes not only the APDCA members but we're also discussing with various hyperscalers and have engaged governments in the region and we received a positive response from

governments in the region on this. What will this achieve? It will achieve a common APAwide baseline to inform national and and regional policy frameworks. will create a structured

platform for government industry engagement. We regard the governor's mechanism as something where where governments and industry can formally discuss these issues and learn around

these issues and also will will help spur the industry to further accelerate and innovate on these on these issues. Uh we we look to be launching um hopefully

March or April. We are um actively discussing these issues with stakeholders including hyperscalers and and governments. So we we we hope to be launching this soon with with with

detailed um targets and frameworks. But can I just conclude by saying this is extremely important for the industry um as as demand for data centers is increased with the surge of AI. Um, as

the importance of AI for the entire Asia-Pacific economy has become clear in terms of meeting national goals, it's also be become clear that data centers will continue to innovate to ensure good

and best practice in sustainability. The SDIA will provide a real framework to discuss this and a real baseline to measure this against and this is something we want to involve local data

center providers, local governments and other associations in this. So we we really delighted to see such a good turnout in the room and such enthusiasm for sustainability within the data

center space but really looking forward to hearing from the practitioners on the panel. Um I I would love to um ask Miss Sundra Ranjan to either step up or or or speak from the table whichever you

prefer. &gt;&gt; Brilliant. And talk more about this from a broadband India perspective. Thank you very much. &gt;&gt; Good evening ladies and gentlemen. At

the outset, thanks David for setting out the context and what we hope to achieve uh during this session but subsequently as well. Uh thanks to the

uh APDCA, the broadband uh India forum which I have the privilege of representing and matey for bringing this very important topic into the heart of this summit.

Until a few years ago, if one were to ask what was the single most overriding existential issue that the planet faced, it was about sustainability and energy use.

And this was the position until AI came and began to uh emerge both as an existential threat and as an opportunity. But I'm glad that this session and this

theme is actually taking us back to the original issues which is that even AI must take into account the fact that first and foremost we need to ensure the sustainability of

the planet. Otherwise, AI would become irrelevant and meaningless if the existential threat that this can pose is not addressed. Uh

it some people may imagine that it's a bit of an exaggeration to call this issue uh existential threat. Yet uh there are estimates which put the use

of energy for the digital part of the ecosystem alone at anywhere between 8 to 10% in the coming years and it's possible that it could even uh move beyond that. And therefore it is not

entirely an exaggeration to say that sustainability is absolutely key. The summit's three chakras leading with the planet acknowledges the preeeminent importance of this issue and therefore

we are very keen to hear from the discussions because they represent the industry that is driving this and we would like to hear their thoughts on how they are

thinking about sustainability and how all of us can come together to make sure that the sustainability of the planet is indeed ensured. uh

this has this theme also has specific relevance for India because there are estimates which suggest that India's data usage can be anywhere between 15 to 20% of the

world's data usage given the kind of population that we represent and the fact that we are in the process of becoming an increasingly intensive digital economy

when we look at the number of data centers and the data center capacity in India uh it is estimated to be fairly modest in terms of the data usage but this is set to change. Um as you all

know uh hyperscalers uh beginning with Google have announced very ambitious plans. I was delighted to hear uh from Alexander that you know things are indeed moving very fast.

uh we know that uh the minister has announced that the total amount of investment in this field is somewhere around $90 billion if you look at the total and it's possible that this would

uh go up even more given that US alone is likely to invest anywhere between 700 billion dollars to 1 trillion uh in building up this kind of uh energy and data center capacity

Uh so in India it is estimated that the data centers may triple or quadruple electricity consumption by [snorts] 2030 with India becoming the world the Asia-Pacific's second largest data

center power consumer and David already referred to this. Uh the question therefore for this session is not should India really worry about data center use because I think

we're past that. It's already demonstrated that we do need to be concerned but how can India use this opportunity to accelerate a cleaner more reliable more sustainable grid. The good

news here is that India is one of the few large economies which has actually been working over the last few years uh to build up its renewable energy resources.

So as of last year, India had built around uh 220 gawatt of renewable and other non-fossil capacity [snorts] and the target is to go up to 500 gawatt of non fossil capacity and net zero uh by

2030. [clears throat] 61% of our energy needs are hopefully to be met through renewable energy. Now data centers will certainly be anchor customers for this transition.

Sustainability of course is not only about energy use. It is first and last about the communities and ecosystems that host this infrastructure and related to that the uh resources the

critical resource of water. So cooling and water are where the tradeoffs are beginning to become the most visible. It is estimated that a single hypers scale facility can use up to 1.5 million

liters of water a day for cooling uh or roughly 25 million liters a year per megawatt of it load. In India where 18% of the world's population lives on about 4% of freshwater resources that

footprint matters enormously. Investigations around emerging AI data center clusters in greater Nida for example have already captured local anxieties about falling groundwater

tables, bore wells and so on. So can we think of creating water and recycling water [snorts] uh so that we are able to ensure that the water resources of communities are met.

big region adds one more layer of complexity from Singapore's experiments with mortoriia and a green data center road map to Australia's debates over water

permits to Malaysia's push for AI ready campuses in water stressed corridors policy makers have to think about improvising and innovating under very very diverse climatic economic and grid

conditions Without coordination, there is a real risk of fragmentation. Each country and sometimes each state or city could end up with its own bespoke

checklists which would mean that uh our efforts could get very badly fragmented. This is exactly the gap I believe that the sustainable digital infrastructure

accord the SDIA which uh David presented here seeks to fill. A regional accord could be valuable for the industry, policy makers and civil society to set sustainability

targets for data centers that can help balance the delicate demand on already constrained grids and water resources. For India specifically and for this summit specifically, this conversation

could not be more pivotal or more timely. The India AI mission will dramatically increase the demand for compute even as the country races to triple its green

energy capacity and manage acute water stress in many of the regions where data centers are clustering. I hope we can anchor these targets in triad that this summit has chosen so

well. a planet that can sustain not only our digital ambitions but uh the overall sustainability of the planet. Um with these few remarks, I'm looking forward to a very very

interesting discussion with our panelists. Thank you very much indeed for those those very important words and I thought the point about avoiding fragmentation

and having some level of baseline certainty via the SDIA is very important too. now keen to bring in the the panelists. If I can turn to Bimal first. Obviously over recent years we've seen

the the AI surge um data centers recognized as a really foundational infrastructure um w within the AI fueled growth and that that technological fuel growth which all APAC

economies are looking to achieve. Um could I could I just ask how how you've seen the conversation change over recent years about sustainability and particularly how you've seen the

industry really innovate and prioritize sustainability as part of this growth. Uh thank you uh thank you David and uh thanks to APDCA uh broadband India forum and uh METI for

organizing this uh the topic as Miss Sundar Rajan said could not have been better uh at this uh juncture and uh uh in this India impact uh AI summit. Well, uh let me start by saying uh AI

and sustainability they go hand in hand. Uh they are uh uh two sides of the same coin. uh AI uh accelerates the progress

uh growth and efficiency and uh sustainability gets in the purpose uh resilience and then built to scale. uh India is at the cusp of a once in a

generation digital and AIled growth cycle clearly uh driven by scale and demographic cloud adoption and AI gen AI sovereign AI

and government regulatory interventions like DPTCA act from a demand uh perspective duly supported by uh the the enabling

ecosystem which takes care of the supply side. Well, as Miss Sundar Rajan said uh we are currently at 1.7 gawatt of capacity from a data center standpoint.

Uh we grew four times over last 5 years. So we started with 400 megawatt in 2020. In 5 years uh we are at 1.7 gawatt. Let's let's keep in mind 3 years where co

now from there clearly we believe we would be more than 6 gawatt plus between 2030 to 2032. So, so that's the number we are looking at and and as we

move ahead a year passes the number only increases from wherever we are. Now with this uh uh numbers in in in perspective the data center industry is is poised to grow. uh the key requirement as we all

uh heard is the energy and hence the discussion around the sustainability of of the overall growth sustainability uh over past few years have been more of a uh what do you call

driven by compliance requirement or a policydriven uh atmost and and and what do you call it uh uh interplay of of the the way things are to be seen

But over last few years uh there has been a fundamental change and there has been a maturity in the way the sustainability is being looked upon by the industry uh and the government and

the regulators as well. uh the overall sustainability discussion conversation has matured over time and and let me put this in in in uh three ways the way I I

look at it. uh first and foremost uh just from tracking the efficiency uh level uh it it has converged into a full scale decarbonization

uh at the the com at the country at the uh industry level. So earlier the the companies were tracking the pees uh which is important but now they have a full-fledged plan and a program to to be

uh a full fully decarbonized uh o over time. So they have a a plan to get into a carbon net neutral. uh while they have a plan uh there are road maps and the pathways that have

been developed to get into a renewable energy uh duly backed by the support and the policies by the government as well. Uh that that's first thing. Secondly uh what what has been realized is there

is no one player who can get into a sustainability agenda that we have. The whole ecosystem has to work uh clearly driven by the customers which in in uh data center parlance hyperscalers

they they drive the overall sustainability agenda. Uh clearly uh there has been asked as to uh the the uh sustainability has to be there in all the the the the contracts the

hyperscalers are looking at. So it's clearly driven by the customer uh hence the data center industry again is looking at it and and taking it forward uh duly supported by the government and

the regulators. So it's a full 360deree uh perspective which is there and that's what will will make it happen and it's making it happen. So uh that's the second thing.

Thirdly, uh what we have seen is earlier it was seen as a more of an operational optimization uh with regard to sustainability let's say POE effectiveness the water usage

and all now uh what what we have seen and is happening is it's gone at the design level and and nothing better at time like this when we are we are at a stage to uh take off. As far as the

overall capacity is concerned uh over last 3 years uh where the major capacity has come and uh what we see is going to come clearly the focus is at the design level to get the right

technologies and the equipments which will ensure that we get the best of the technologies to take care of the sustainable agenda. So clearly uh it it goes at the

conceptualization phase wherein things are planned in a manner that the sustainability agenda is is not pushed at a later point of time it is taken care of at the concept conceptualization

level. So uh in a way uh sustainability is not only influencing and impacting how we build uh where we build what we build. Sustainability is at the core of the

data center design and the delivery and of course the operations as well. That's it. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much indeed. some really important points there including that

the SDA is very much an industry first initiative. Um the industry is taking the lead in setting this baseline and and the importance as you make the point um of technological advance helping to

meet these sustainability issues is really important. Innovation is so important to to addressing sustainability. Um very keen to bring Alex in Alex, um I know as a former

Googler that sustainability has always been a priority for for Google within data centers. Um would love to hear more about how you see the the kind of regional approach to sustainability and

how you're approaching this. &gt;&gt; Certainly I'll steal your microphone whilst there. Um look, let me join um Bimal and and just say a big thank you to the APDCA and uh broadband India

forum together with Matei and the government of India for convening us here. This is a really amazing week that's full of opportunity for us to get the AI agenda right and I think um as

Miss Sundar Rajan mentioned this is such an important conversation and I think one of the most important conversations that needs to happen in this venue this week because you cannot have an AI

future without robust digital AI ready infrastructure. That is the reality of part of the trade-off that we face here. However, I think there are a couple of really positive

pieces of news that that I sort of want to frame up as we think about this discussion. The the first is that the discussion around sustainability and digital infrastructure is not entirely

net new. You know, if we think about the migration into cloud that started happening, you know, a decade and a half now ago, that was largely driven by sustainability and efficiency metrics.

You know, as organizations and enterprises looked to move old server rooms that were super inefficient into the cloud, whether that's operated by hyperscalers or others, you saw amazing

efficiency dividends that enterprises have been able to gain over the last decade and a half. Now, the good news with AI on that journey is that we are really still at the starting line. And I

don't want this to come out the wrong way because AI will evolve in different ways and none of us really know just yet where we'll be in 10 years time. But it is likely true that artificial

intelligence now is the most inefficient that it's ever going to be and that there's significant upside and part of this goes to what Bahal was saying the significant positive upside when it

comes to the efficiency of these operations to be gained and let me just give you a couple of recent data points. So at Google um our uh you know marquee AI product is obviously Gemini and over

a 12 month period we recently released research about Gemini that demonstrated that it's basically now 33 times more efficient per prompt than it was at the beginning of that 12 month period.

That's incredible when you think about it. Like I think many of us have become very spoiled in the industry by Mo's law and thinking about the incredible exponential growth and pace of

acceleration that we've you know witnessed over the last half a century. I have every reason to expect that AI will function the same way. You know in the last 5 years the amount of compute

capacity that one of our average Google data centers per unit of electricity can output has increased more than sixfold. And so the first thing I'd say is research and innovation has a huge role

to play across industry, across government, across stakeholders in the AI ecosystem from design of chips through the design of the physical infrastructure itself in giving us as a

society and a global community the opportunity to scale AI and to do AI the right way. Because if we don't invest to make the infrastructure itself more efficient, the problem only builds and

compounds as usage, adoption, and diffusion increases. And all of those things are what we want to see and what many in this building will discuss throughout the course of this week. But

as that happens, the only way for us to scale is to do it more efficiently than ever before. But I think that this is also an example where industry has not needed to be dragged kicking and

screaming to this sustainability discussion. that that sometimes happens as we sort of look to decarbonize different sectors of the economy in recent decades and I'd say part of that

is also what Vimal pointed to which is at the end of the day sustainability is good for business and there is very significant strong alignment I think on this topic between most regulators most

governments across APAC and most industry players now I'm not going to pretend that it's a uniform operating field that's never the case but what we hear from our enterprise customers with

Google Cloud What we hear from our consumer customers who are using products like search and Gemini, all of which is underpinned by AI today is that they want to make sure that we are doing

it in a responsible way. So what does that mean? Look, at least speaking for ourselves, we've tried to set a number of moonshot objectives, set very very high ambitious targets for us to reach.

One of which includes, you know, since 2017, we've now been 100% uh matching renewable energy with all of our data center operations globally. We are still seeking to operate off of 247

uh 100% carbon-f free energy uh by the early 2030s. We're currently sitting, you know, close to two to two/ird of that. And it also means um as Miss Sundan mentioned as well that we need to

think very very carefully about what the local communities need and that includes water and that includes balancing the trade-off between your power use efficiency and the amount of water that

you're taking in. And so on Google's side, we've set again another ambitious moonshot that we aim to replenish 120% of the fresh water that's consumed in our data centers again by 2030. So it

means that you're actually giving back more to the local wersheds and where you operate. And I think taken together, this presents us all and it presents industry and policy makers alike with an

opportunity to do AI the right way. Because if it is done the right way, then there's no reason that it cannot be sustainable. There's no reason that it doesn't need to result in you know moms

and dads or startups paying more for their their electricity bills. It means doing things like we've done here in India as we've entered the market with our initially first our Google cloud

data centers and eventually with our recently announced investment into the Shaka partner to build a gigawatt plus facility that we have to be thinking about how do we pay for the transmission

infrastructure and how do we bring more renewable energy online in India already we've invested to bring over 18 new additional uh megawatts of renewable energy onto the grid and to spread it

around different loces where it makes sense not just from an economic perspective but also from a community perspective to bring those net new resources onto the grid to ensure that

operations are as efficient as possible and are as green as possible. Now at the scale that AI needs to move it does mean and we can talk about this a little bit if we um sort of want to talk about some

of the policy considerations here. It does mean industry needs to to move very very closely with regulators and with policy makers to get the balance right and I'd say what's right for different

parts of India is not necessarily the right approach for you know rural Australia um I'm from Australia for those of you who don't know or you know for parts of Southeast Asia where their

constraints might look different you might come from a water rich area there's land constraint and so how you think about land as a sustainability constraint is also very very important

we need to think about this end to end Um so let me stop there but I'm happy to happy to talk more. &gt;&gt; Thanks so much Alex. I think doing AI AI the right way is a really powerful way

of approaching this and as you say the as AI gets more efficient and innovation happens more and more then AI can and and and will be green. Um can I can I bring in now? I'd love to hear from you

um about how you see the importance of sustainability and some of the innovation which you've been seeing in in this arena. &gt;&gt; Sure. So thanks thanks everyone and just

reflecting on what all my co-panelists said I think one thing is established that power has emerged as a protagonist in this AI growth story uh and I would actually like to talk uh uh some numbers

uh from an India perspective I think uh last week uh it was announced that India added around 52 gawatt of new generation capacity around 70% of that capacity was non-fossil fuel uh capacity. Uh so I

think uh and and uh adding to that our non fossil fuel capacity and generation actually exceeded the fossil fuel generation for the first time. So I feel India that ways is extremely well

positioned in the entire APAC region to take on this AI and power challenge that comes along and I think we have the infrastructure base infrastructure ready and in place. Now the responsibility is

on uh the industry, the operators, the users, the hyperscalers, the power providers to actually integrate sustainability and energy into the base design itself. I can actually speak

about ourselves how we are thinking through this infrastructure. We are actually thinking through it in a power first format. And what this means is we are looking at infrastructure from two

base pillars that is scalability and sustainability. And I would like to deep dive slightly more into the sustainability bit. We are actually as I think Bim mentioned we are trying to

integrate sustainability in all the base elements of the uh life cycle of building a data center right right from designing to execution and even operations and when we are thinking in

this format and we are able to bring the entire ecosystem together I think we'll be able to achieve the desired K or the targets that we have the net zero goals that the hyperscalers have and all our

customers have. So that's that's how we need to think through as an ecosystem and we feel India is extremely well positioned in the entire AP pack and APAC today to be a base for this global

infrastructure. &gt;&gt; Thank thank you very much. Um we'll have time for for questions from the audience. Can I just pick up very briefly about your your point about very

very different climates and very different conditions in different parts of Asia Pacific. Obviously you've got Singapore and Malaysia which are tropical and you've got other parts

parts of Japan which can be very cold and talking about parts of Australia. How are you dealing with the the different challenges of innovating around those sustainability issues?

Yeah, it's a great question and what we've discovered maybe unsurprisingly is that a onesizefits all solution to sustainability is probably too simple of a solution. Um, you know, I'll give you

an example. We we are looking at a number of projects where you can build data centers potential potentially in far more remote and rural locations. Now, often in those locations, they tend

to be more water scarce than you will have on the periphery of well populated jurisdictions and locations. And I mention that because the sustainability trade-off suddenly looks very very

different. If your objective is simply to, you know, minimize your your power use or to make your data centers as power efficient as possible, the best way to do that is to ensure that you are

water cooling your facilities. But and and this is where Miss Sund's point comes that there is the potential for data centers to use significant amounts of water. If you're doing that water

scarce area though that I would say to you from a sustainability perspective is probably not the right answer for that region and that if you want to bring that digital infrastructure to those

communities you should be looking at alternate design mechanisms like aircooled data centers that yes use a bit more power but significantly less water so that you're not drawing from

the local wershed and putting nearly as much strain on those communities as you would otherwise need to do. The challenge that policy makers have is to have in any framework or any sort of

guidelines or policy requirements that they're setting for industry. That type of flexibility that recognizes there are real technical trade-offs in the sustainability um exercise that need to

be balanced. And that goes that that's just one high level example which I think really touches on two of the most prominent sustainability considerations being water and energy. But it goes

right the way through the building codes in terms of materials used thinking about local sourcing first and how you the entirety of the supply chain that really needs to be taken into

consideration. So, like many complex industries, there's a lot of nuance here, but we should be taking an evidence-based technically informed approach that underpins our

sustainability um uh approach in a given jurisdiction because otherwise this one-sizefits-all approach I worry a little bit uh will be sort of copy pasted which can lead to some suboptimal

solutions. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much. Um could I bring the secret in now ju just about obviously this is not something industry can do alone. So just wondering for your

thoughts on what the policy interventions might need to be to ensure sustainability for and innovation around the data center space. May I? Okay. But before I get into it,

David, a couple of po thoughts that I had on on the discussion that we have had so far. So clearly uh as Alex said uh from a water usage perspective uh the industry is more of now tilting

towards uh air cooled chillers uh where we don't have fresh water available and in India we we know it's a case uh water is case uh but then we have balance out the overall power usage there and then

the technology ology has evolved whereby the the overall chiller system they they take they have a closed loop uh water system whereby the water evaporation is also minimal. So as such that the water

usage in an air cold cher with the latest technology is is almost negligible and they have become power efficient as well. So uh that that's the decision one

has to take uh depending upon different geographies one one is into but in India we are seeing air cooled chillers getting prevalent uh more uh from a sustainability perspective uh

uh different states have different uh regulations whereby uh the industry at large uh is is able to have a runway to get into 60 65% of their power consumption ion through

green uh meaning it's a green power uh up to 60 65% and they they are cost effective as well. So industry is uh on the path uh to get there and we as an organization uh are already there uh in

in most of the states that we operate and and three of our uh data centers are 100% green as well and I'm sure we have examples of that in in other organizations in the data center uh

industry. Now uh coming to the u uh government enablement David clearly uh there has to be a way to bridge the gap between the policy and the execution at

the government level. uh in 2022 budget uh data center as an industry was categorized as an infrastructure status and since then uh we have we have seen the uh budget

announcement of 2026 as well whereby a tax holiday uh for 22 years for a foreign company uh taking capacity from an India data center uh company I think it's never heard of huh

uh I I have a 30 years of tracking of the budgets I don't think I have heard such a huge uh tax exemption holiday for any industry and of of this size so I think this is big now uh the point I was

referring to is uh and then and and over and above these two uh announcements uh there have been uh data center policies shared by um the the 10 state governments as well.

Now all in all while the intent is there uh there has to be a mechanism to fasttrack the the intent and and ensure that the execution happens uh faster that that's uh uh uh first thing and

then uh I think yeah that that's it uh David so &gt;&gt; so uh I think uh so we we have actually invested Ed significantly in power infra. We have actually set up very

recently an on-site uh substation uh as well in one of our sites. Uh we have uh we have been actually very well supported by some of the local authorities agencies and thanks to uh

the local government. The project has really been executed at a very exceptional uh speed. I think the only thing that we all need to invest as a group is the last mile interconnection.

uh I would say at the grid level uh I think we have the generational capacity the plants are there but the last mile interconnection into the grid is something that we all need to kind of

invest more so that power can reach the places where it needs to be uh that's that's one of the requirements they &gt;&gt; yeah you may go ahead

jump in with um a couple of quick things that I think are important for policy makers to consider in this case the first is I I think long-term policy certainty is a precondition for this

industry to succeed in any given market. This really is about infrastructure investment and investors are thinking about infrastructure for AI over 20 to 30 year time horizons. So whether it is

green energy open access schemes, whether it is the preconditions u for investing, whether it is efficiency targets, whether it is taxation requirements, those things need to be

made clear for investors because of the long-term nature and the scale of the stakes that are involved. The second thing I think policy makers should really think about is speed.

Industry is looking to move really quickly and is looking to move at scale because that's what the market is demanding. And I think that policy makers and regulators need to try as

best as possible to work with industry. You know, we're seeing some jurisdictions across APAC where you've got wonderful renewable energy zones that can be brought online within sort

of 24 to 36 months, but the transmission infrastructure might not be able to get permitted for 10 years. And like that's causing some of the real sustainability constraints where green electrons just

cannot flow fast enough and far enough. And ultimately it breaks some of the economics of building infrastructure in a sustainable way. That to me falls into the category of totally fixable problems

if industry and policy makers can align and work on it closely together. Um I think the third thing is like we got to think really carefully about the electricity markets that we're building

across um you know not not just India I think there are lots of good lessons to be learned from India across Asia but there are other markets that have been far more constrained for example in the

ability to do things like corporate power purchase agreements. Um I think that markets where you have greater flexibility, greater investment being driven into solar projects, hydro

projects, wind projects and the ability to then unlock that generation with new transmission. Those are the markets that are really going to succeed here. Not just with digital infrastructure but

ensuring that it is built in a sustainable way. David if I may add [clears throat] see currently uh from the concept stage to the go live of any data center

capacity currently it's it's longish right uh the demand is huge now if India has to move ahead in the curve uh with respect to other regions

what is required is to build large dig digital infrastructure zones by the state governments and and governments where where they identify huge land parcels have power

infrastructure build in advance over there and the connectivity as well that could fast forward the overall uh data center ambition that we have as a country uh and and uh we should take it

forward that way we I have seen pockets of of uh such things happening in in different uh states. Uh if I may take name uh let's say and then it's done in an uh not so organized manner. Let's

talk Ambaturur in Chennai. Now one could see it's a cluster of data centers getting developed. Now it's by chance. It's not by design. Right? Similarly, if you look at Kolkata again a small uh

salt lake place near salt lake that you can see five six data centers coming up there and now in Mumbai if you look at all the data centers are there now it's not organized rightfully

and hence if we have to move forward uh on a faster track uh in our in our ambition a larger digital infrastructure zones with this facility could help the cause.

&gt;&gt; Thank you very much. I'm afraid we're about to run out of time, so we're not going to have time for questions from the floor. There's a rather intimidating ticking clock which is going down to my

left. Um if I can just ask the panel just to briefly um sum up um in in 30 seconds to a minute or so if we start. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Uh to sum up I think India as a country within the APAC region is

positioned extremely well. We just need to do the execution right. Uh power AI uh go hand in hand and does th does the need of sustainability and uh we just need to do the execution right and we'll

emerge as one of the leading infrastructure providers in the region. And what we've heard is very encouraging because clearly each of them is uh a little ahead of the curve in thinking

about what needs to be done. uh so clearly any initiative where industry takes a lead in this area I think would be an optimal approach uh and then of course policy will look to align itself

and enable uh that kind of uh those kind of frameworks. Uh one question that I wanted to ask was uh you know if there was if each of you can tell me you know one thing that you would want the Indian

government or the their respective state governments to absolutely do you know some anything that kind of showstopper if if you can just indicate that. &gt;&gt; Well I uh already said that and then

before I get there what I can uh I may want to assure to all of us and which is what I can see through happening is uh data center industry for sure has taken off. uh AI is further uh accelerating

it. Uh clearly it's it's the backbone of the uh economy and the overall GDP growth that we are seeing of 6 and a half 7% clearly 100 basis point bump up we can

easily see through coming our way let's say in two years three years time. Sorry I didn't answer your question but but I thought it's important for me to share this. I think one thing would be

uniformity of uh green power norms uh like banking, solar. So each state today has different norms. I think uniformity will help bring uh consistency in implementation.

Look, I I would say the Indian government has set a very bold vision and I think that at the moment when you look at the investment that is going to this sector is heading down the right

path and I'd say the Indian government my my top tip would be be optimistic. Feel confident that the skills, the knowledge, the talent exists in this market to do AI the right way. India has

made incredible strides in the renewable energy economy. um it is making investments across its networks to ensure that the energy infrastructure can support the transfer of those

electrons. Um I would say similar comments that that um it's really important to ensure uniformity of access across states so that the benefits can be very broadly shared and can be really

sort of penetrating deep into tier 2 tier three cities. Um so that like yes there are benefits from clustering but there are also benefits that come to local communities from spreading the

supply chain spreading the jobs and ultimately spreading new renewable technologies to industry. So I would be very very optimistic about all of that. I think overall to sum up I'd say we are

still in the first innings of AI. It is not too late for us to uh you know get this right and I think that industry and governments across this region are very very forwardleaning and have a huge

investment window in front of them. But the time to move is now. The investment window and the capital allocation window is open right now. Um it probably won't be in sort of five or six years. And so

now's the time to get it right. And some good cricketing imagery to to finish things off as well. Um I think this has been a really fascinating uh really interesting and optimistic

discussion. Um I I think we we've seen how important AI and data centers are to the future of the Indian economy and the AP pack economy, but we've also seen how serious the industry is about

sustainability and just to to use Alex's great words again to do AI right. I think that that's really important. Um I would urge you to to follow um the APDCA on LinkedIn um where we will be

launching the sustainable digital infrastructure record over the next few months. Um I want to thank everybody for attending um this fascinating discussion. Particularly want to thank

the panelists. Could we please thank the panelists in the usual way and have a good rest of summit. Thank you. Thank you so much all the panelists here. We had an amazing

session and thank you everyone in the audience for joining us. Uh we have a small moment for the panelist here. So I request uh Aruna ma'am if you can give the moment to our panelist.

Yeah. And I request uh brigadier Anil Tandan, director general broadband India forum to please present the momentum to ma'am Aruna. &gt;&gt; We have

&gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you sir. Thank you ma'am. Thank you everyone. Have a good day. Uh we'll be having the next session here in 5 minutes. I request the audience uh

to please leave the room for the new audience to come in. Thank you.
