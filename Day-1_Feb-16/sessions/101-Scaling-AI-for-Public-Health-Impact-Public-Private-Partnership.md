## 📝 Transcript

representatives from the state governments and the private sector to critically examine how AI enabled solutions are being implemented within public health systems, identify key

constraints to scale and articulate what an enabling ecosystem for responsible AI in health should look like at the state level. The discussion will focus on implementation experience, system level

challenges and institutional pathways that shape AI adoption in real world public sector settings. I would be introducing the chair and esteemed panelists one by one. I would

request uh the esteemed panelists and chair to join us on the stage. First and foremost, it is my honor to introduce the keynote speaker and chair for the panel today, Miss Puna

Shvastava. Miss Puna Shvastava joined the Indian Administrative Service in 1993 and is currently serving as Secretary in the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare,

Government of India, leading initiatives aimed at improving public health and healthcare delivery. We welcome you ma'am. It is my pleasure to introduce our

distinguished panel today. I extend a warm welcome to Dr. Sunil Kumar Banwal, a a distinguished Indian administrative service officer of the 1997 batch currently serving as the chief executive

officer of the National Health Authority. I welcome Shri Satkumar, an Indian administrative service officer of the 1997 batch serving as principal

secretary and development commissioner to the government of Migghalia. I welcome Dr. Push Singla an is officer of the 2012 batch currently serving as secretary of the information technology

department government of Jammu and Kashmir. I would also like to welcome Dr. Gita Majnunath the founder CEO and CTO of Nira Health Analytics.

I would like to welcome Dr. Anand Saraman, CEO, Remedio Innovative Solutions. Now I would like to extend a warm welcome to Shri Kiran Gopal Vasca who

will be moderating the panel discussion today. Shri Kiran Gopal Vasca is an Indian administrative service officer of the 2008 patch currently serving as the joint secretary and mission director of

the Aayushman Bharat digital mission at the national health authority. Thank you sir. With this I hand over the mic to Shri Kiran Gopal Vascur to moderate the panel

discussion today. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you Dika. I once again welcome the chair and the panelists to this very important uh panel discussion

on scaling AI for public health impact through public private partnerships. This panel is an extremely important panel where we tried to bring together senior experts, seniors from uh both the

public and the private sector mainly to focus on one point that we may have the best of models, we may procure the best of the compute, we may have the best of the ecosystems

but [clears throat] the winners in this AI world are the ones who actually start implementing and using them at scale and especially in a country like ours where we have a varied

populations requiring [clears throat] different kinds of uh having different kinds of constraints. It is essential that we bring down the cost of expertise. We bring down and and we we

democratize services health services to the last mile and using AI effectively becomes very very important here. So through this session we expect to explore a few themes and

understand how we can develop a shared understanding of what enables responsible AI at scale within state health systems because ultimately it is the state governments who implement the

systems generate practical insights on transitioning AI enabled solutions from pilots to sustained implementation because we just don't want to run small pilots and then lose sight of what's

happening Then highlight procurement, governance and inst institutional challenges on how we can translate a solution from a pilot SC pilot to a scaled implementation. Identify some

best practices that is where our states can give us that ideas and inform future policy development on how we can go about sustaining these efforts and efforts of

enablement at the state and the national level. So with that I request the chair Shrimati Punast, Secretary Minister of Health and Family Welfare Ma'am to kindly give her keynote address and set

the tone for the panel discussion. So uh good evening everybody and a warm welcome to the panel discussion today. Before we delve into the questions that Kiran has uh posed before us, I thought

it might be a good idea to sort of give you give everybody here because some of us might be new, some might be old to the uh to the landscape of health ministry and give a brief idea as to uh

what is the progress that we have made so far at least from the perspective of health ministry. So as you are aware over the past decade our entire health system has undergone a steady digital

transformation. We all began with digitizing records improving the data reporting and now we have the interoperable digital health ecosystem at a national scale. The Aayushman

Bharat digital mission the national health policy had set the goal before us that we have to ensure the highest attainable standard of health and well-being for all uh of all

citizens. And it is this vision that the national digital health blueprint of 2019 uh was building upon and these and it has laid out the essential principles

for India's digital health ecosystem based on uh uh this policy directive and therefore this blueprint promotes open standards enables interoperability adopts emerging technologies such as Gen

AI to strengthen service delivery and enable early disease detection while ensuring privacy at every step. So many of you would have looked at the Aayushman Bharat digital mission. It is

interoperable. It is open. It is a standardsbased digital system and it has actually evolved into a comprehensive health ecosystem for better service delivery. And why I'm saying so is that

this is something has been which has been demonstrated time and again whether when we look at our data which is being captured through various portals or when we looked at the 11 K footfall that we

had during the swastari sashak par Ahan it is it the ABDM has been proving very useful to us at every stage and today we have 859 million citizens who now have ABA

accounts linked to more than 878 million health records across the country. I do hope everyone in this hall has an ABA ID. If not, please make it today. So uh with the expansion of our

primary healthcare network, some of you might be aware the uh the sub centers and the primary health centers that we had, we have upgraded them into what we call the Aayushman Aroa Mandr or the

Aayush Man Aroa Kendra. We have now 180,000 across the country. We have the e Sanjivnney the tele medicine facility which is provide being provided at each of these uh uh centers. We have uh the

AI assisted clinical decision support system which is assisting the tele medicine platform and it has facilitated over 449 million uh consultations through over 2.2 lakh registered

healthcare providers. So all of these make India's teley medicine initiative I think amongst the world's largest in primary healthcare. Our numbers are humongous and therefore our systems do

get tested for their robustness and their ability to deliver. We are also of course uh promoting the adoption of uh clinical decision support systems in the private sector under the

ABDM's open standards and responsible generative AI frameworks and my request in every gathering where private sector hospitals and health facilities are there is that do join the ABDM it will

prove useful to all of us in the long run and to each one of us as a citizen as well as a health facility. So digital systems enable us to capture, store and transmit information. AI as you all are

the experts here know allow allows us to interpret, prioritize and act on it more effectively. And therefore one of the key expectations from AI especially in public health is that it should reduce

the burden on our health care workforce complementing the physician patient relationship that remains at the heart of health care uh delivery and therefore the question before us is can AI help

bridge these gaps. You must be aware that every time uh at least till a few years back we came up with a new digital initiative there was a lot of resistance that we will need to do a lot more to do

this. So that's why we keep on talking about how to make the lives of our healthcare workforce easier especially in the government still systems where the public pressure is really high. You

have a 15,000 OPD in Sabdar Jang. You have another 15,000 OPD in as so expecting everyone to use the system means that I need a system which assists them in the way that they would like it

to assist them. uh we have uh with many support of some of you who are there in this hall we have the Madu Netra AI under the national diabetic retinopathy screening

program which is allowing non-speist health workers to capture retinal images I'm told it has benefited over 7,000 patients across 38 uh facilities that means we can decentralize its capability

similarly in tuberculosis the AI enabled handheld X-rays are being deployed for early detection of TB and we have been using it very effectively and state governments have been demanding more and

more of such machines because such equipment and we hope and we think it is contributing to the decline of incidence of TB in India. The cough against TB is also being uh used over 1.6 lakh

individuals have been screened using this tool. you are aware about the AI enabled tools such as the media disease surveillance system which is in which is there with our integrated health

information portal platform. It helps me a lot at least and it helps our entire NCDC uh team because not every incident gets reported even by the vigilant state government. So the AI assisted media

alerts do help us. We have also established three centers of excellence for AI in healthcare. Ames Delhi, PGI, ME Chandigar and Ames Rishies. So our primary objective is that we

prove that AI can work in the real world public health settings. So that's why we need to design it with clear objectives and integrate it into service delivery so that people come saying that we want

more of it and we have to avoid any kinds of uh flaws in it so that it can become inclusive and affordable while being very robust and effective. So um I would be very keen to hear from our

participants that what are the challenges that you face while working with government systems and how can our processes, procurement models or data frameworks evolve to enable more

effective collaboration while following government norms. That is the challenge often with many of us here that how do we follow our norms and at the same time get the best most effective system for

our uh uh for our uh uh for our digital solutions. Then uh from the states I would of course like to h I would like to hear their feedback on the AI solutions that they are using. Which

have they found most useful? Which have they found difficult? Which have they found flawed if any? What is the support they would require from the union government? Uh the teams are here. We

have been trying to work on policy. We have been trying on would you like more technical docs from us? Uh financial support in what way that also is something that uh we can see and how can

we assure ensure a smoother adoption and a scale up across the diverse health systems. So I really would like to hear from the panelists today and from some of you as to what uh uh we can uh do

ahead. I would just like to emphasize uh that the cornerstone of this discussion has to be the principles that have been laid down by the honorable prime minister Narendra Modi G. He has been

emphasizing that the digital public infrastructure is a tool for inclusion and equity. Therefore, whatever we are doing in digital health and AI is an extension of that commitment and uh

ultimately uh as many of you are aware we are all working with the goal of Vix Bharat at 2047 and we feel that whatever discussions that we have today and over the next few days can do uh have an

impact on uh enabling us to achieve our goals. with this a big thank you to all of you uh for coming here and a thank you to the participants. Let's start the discussion. That was pretty long. I hope

not too long. Okay. &gt;&gt; Thank you ma'am. That was optimum from a time point of view and uh you you've you've given us the whole canvas of what the government is doing, what efforts

have been ongoing and where we are already seeing some results. And this sets the tone for the further discussion going forward here. Now u I come to our first panelist my my CEO uh doc Dr.

Sunil Kumar Banwal. Sir uh AI is here and it is the new general purpose technology that can revolutionize a lot of areas and healthcare is one of one of them. So sir uh from a

perspective of looking at how this is this can transform and how we are going ahead uh I'd like to understand from you and also the panel the the pres the uh audience here and if you look at five

years ahead what would a mature AI enabled public health ecosystem in India would look like and what must we do differently starting today to get there. &gt;&gt; Thank you Kiran. I think uh madam has

set the tone what all we are doing in the healthcare using technology. AI is something which has been added in a big way and it is going to actually transform the whole healthcare delivery.

Let me tell you how it is going to work in next uh few years five years time has been given. The point is uh if we take AI as a standalone innovation or a technology which is going to just help

you or enable you, I think we are not harnessing the full potential of AI. So we need to move from project or a scheme uh kind of implementation to actually create a or enable a ecosystem

development for uh using AI in healthcare delivery. When I say ecosystem development we see there are so many players who bring value in the healthcare delivery. It's not just the

government or the government institutions. There are private institutions. There are private health care professionals. There are health tech companies. There are innovators,

startups, everyone brings value in the system. Now if we just take it as a project, I don't think we will be able to actually leverage the full potential of AI. So

that is one part and second, we should not be treating AI just one additional help. it has to become part or rather get embedded in the healthcare delivery. So it has to become integral part of it

as madam also mentioned it should not be a just a tool which just uh you know like we moved from paper to a digital we needed you know from type is to a uh data entry operator. So something like

that is not a great value addition rather if it reduces the whole uh you know work of the health care professionals whether it is a frontline worker or it's a doctor or a nurse I

think then only we can actually take full advantage of it and that is going to happen if we see AI in two ways one we all see AI will improve the clinical efficiency of the know treatment whether

it is you know cutting edge technology or robotics etc etc. On the other hand, see the how much workflow improvement it does uh in uh healthcare delivery like even if we know there is a highly

specialized doctor how much time does he spend only on treatment and how much time he does non-clinical work which includes you know listening to the patient writing prescriptions and doing

many more administrative work. So these all can be done away with if we really integrate AI in the whole workflow completely into the healthcare delivery system and that can happen if we

actually work on standards and the architecture should be open interoperable and that is what manhar digital mission is doing. So when we talk of uh deployment of AI even if the

data is not centralized its application can be there across all the facilities and this is what we are looking at if we really want to develop and harness the full potential of AI. We need to

actually develop the ecosystem rather than using one or the other isolated solutions and that is what is being done when uh madam spoke about the clinical decision support system integrated

integration in the tele medicine because it automatically becomes part of the healthcare delivery. people come for the treatment it uh you know the uh uh doctor or the whoever is the frontline

worker will see based on the symptom what could be the possible diagnosis. So this is what I think should be done in next five years. We should be enabling ecosystem development where every player

in the AI uh you know uh innovation uh development deployment and monitoring everyone plays a very creative and effective role. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you sir.

building an ecosystem is the key and that will actually help us harness the full potential of AI for better healthcare. So now I come to uh Sat Kumar sir. Sir, you are heading the

health department in the state government and uh you are you are you are the one who is overseeing the delivery of healthcare services in the state and when some solutions come to

you earlier it used to be digital solutions simple plain digital digitization now these are there are AI solutions so sir when solutions come to you or when when somebody comes with to

you with a solution saying look there is a problem so I have a solution for this so from a state implement implementation standpoint sir what are the AI use cases that have been easiest to operate and

what are the reasons I mean what is enabling them you and that you are able to use them and scale them so what are the characteristics of such solutions thank you thank you Kiran and thank you

ma'am uh and my colleague uh my batchmate some you know Mr. Sunil uh so I uh and also all the panelists uh thank you uh for this opportunity. I just wanted to reflect on what uh you said in

fact as madam also said the states have a responsibility for implementation. So one of the uh things actually what uh you know in Mallaya especially what we have been trying to do is that how do we

um leverage the AI uh for uh effective implementation of the programs because one of the challenges for the states is that while we have a you know I think all of you are aware you know we have

massive programs you know massive national programs we have you know lot of uh you know resources. In fact, I think I would say there's no depth of resources. There's a very good intent is

there in terms of uh implementing the programs. What actually the states really look at is that how effectively we are able to do this. Are we able to achieve the purpose for which actually

these programs have been designed? So what we did, we did a small experiment. I wanted to tell three use cases so that like how actually we did this. Uh we started actually way back in 2020 during

the COVID period. We started actually looking at our data of especially the maternal deaths. You know we have a huge maternal mortality rates. So then when we looked at the data we were actually

we're collecting the data but we are not effectively using the data to analyze the data and how actually we can solve the problems. So what we did was actually we not only you know taking the

data that is coming from the HMIS we should also collecting the data why actually the challenges are there. We also started collecting the socioeconomic determinants you know and

mapping all the data put together and started actually having an analysis you know why actually a mother is actually you know has you know come to this kind of a very you know you know stage where

actually we should have prevented. So while doing this what we could able to by effectively using the data we you know we could able to you know give that capacity to the front line that you know

here is a mother she's a multigraida she's also poor she's also living in the hard to area she needs to be actually brought to the health facility well in advance so a simple you know I'm what

what I would like basically prediction prediction with much more data so once we started actually using this data we could able to see like you there is a there is a tremendous you know

motivation for the you know frontline functionaries in saving lives of mothers in fact we could able to reduce maternal deaths by over 50% in the last 5 years so that's one use case I would say in

fact our honorable chief minister has written about this one recently in the Indian express you know after the regional AI summit that has been held in shong with NHA and world health

organization so what uh we have been saying is that by by what we are seeing is that the using the data effective use you know effective use of data and analysis of it actually helping us in

solving the problems that is the key thing then the second use case I would like to share is that like uh you know we also have tremendous challenge in terms of specialists in fact all over

this you know country might be there is a challenge but Miguel has severe challenge we don't have specialists enough specialists so when it comes to like a TB I think as madam has already

mentioned we have used a beautiful use case handheld x-ray you know in last 2 years 90,000 people have been screened and using the AI offline AI data we could able to you

know identify who actually needs you know like a like a radiologist the AI is doing like a radiologist and and we could able to identify about 110 positive cases and you know we could

able to put them on the treatment. So one second important thing is that like it has to help the states in terms of solving the problems. In fact, we did an costbenefit analysis of this particular

solution that we have actually used for uh you know for TB. In fact, we actually saved know 4 crores you know in terms of uh you know the transportation cost you know if we have to bring all of them to

the radiologist for a you know it would have you know costed that much money. So this is again a second interesting use case. And third uh thing that I would like to share is that uh electronic

health records. In fact this is again uh this is a our honorable CM actually tells this one. We need to reduce the administrative burden of the doctors. Doctors actually have a huge

administrative burden. How do you reduce administrative in fact uh my you know CU NH was mentioning how actually AI can be used for reducing administrative burden. So what for your question just like to

sum up is that we you know whatever you know basically what we look at is that like what is actually useful what is purposeful I think that actually we will try to experiment through a process we

call it like problem-driven iterative adaptation approach you know you test it and see how it is functioning and you modify it and you know implement it. Thank you.

Yeah, PDIA it is problemdriven iterative adaptation. Uh absolutely sir I mean so basically the use cases that are easier to operate operationalize are the one where the state finds value where the

state's problems of finding specialists or helping solving other problems or the administrative burden are chosen are are are identified or they're able to solve those problems then both the

administration and the political executive are able to help solve and and take that solution on board. So basically un a problem or an AI solution has to create value. So now with that I

come to the private sector participant private sector panel here Dr. Gita Mangjunad uh from uh from Name. Uh Dr. Mangjunad uh you are now have been running this uh uh this organization

that that that uh that is providing uh AI based solutions. So from a private sector perspective, I'd like to hear from you what are the main challenges private companies feel while working

with government health systems in terms of procurement timelines, data access, deployment at scale or even long-term sustainability or any other challenge that the challenge that you want to

highlight. Basically what we have seen is yes there is a beginning when you come you speak then we say okay let us try it out in one or two hospitals after that what so what are the challenges you

are facing and how do you think what if you are a what are those issues that if you you can be addressed so that this transition from lab to pilot to scale can actually happen. Thank you very much

for that question and uh it's really really wonderful to be part of the AI impact summit and full house and it shows the amount of excitement AI has created and that to sort of you know for

enabling uh good public health right use of uh this technology. So uh just uh sort of two minutes on what we do so we can relate to the answers. Uh so yeah you know I lead a um startup called Nami

Namay in this forum I'll say nam.ai AI so it sounds better. Uh where uh we've developed a new method of detecting breast cancer. We just measure the temperature variations on the chest

using a thermal sensor infrared imaging device like one of these cameras and convert four like temperature points uh which uh kind of are proxies to the tissue activity at different points on

the breast and convert that automatically into a breast health report. So in a rural area you can use this uh simple uh health worker can be uh empowered just like click click

photograph types and uh uh the AI actually provides uh triage redo green uh automatically and obviously it's a screening test people who are high-risk need to be taken uh for uh you know

further diagnostic workup in terms of imaging like mamogram ultrasound MRI whatever is needed because you know it's a it's a very very big problem and uh uh we know the affordability accessibility

issues and uh so we end up losing every alternate lady to breast cancer that is uh 50% mortality right uh who has got detected with breast cancer every alternate lady dies so really early

detection is important so we've kind of made this work uh uh it's a new innovation uh made in India and now uh we've been able oh my god thank you thank you so much uh we have made this

uh you know with multiple uh state governments we have collaborated uh including uh uh Punjab, Karnataka, Maharashtra uh now Migallaya also sir actually last three months we are

running with Migallaya as well wonderful uh effect there Rotarakand many many places we have done so coming to the uh question that you asked Gan sir is uh first and foremost I think uh starting

off a pilot with uh a state government uh because health is a state matter Right. Every state uh uh officials we need to sort of uh impress upon and uh you know convince them that uh the

solution works. Uh so it's kind of fragmented uh we would say the decision-m process. Now next is uh obviously pilots have so I'll be very and it's it's a wonderful

opportunity to keep cribing sorry but please take it in the right really it's a huge opportunity that's why. So next of course we need to find uh funds to actually do the pilots because first few

pilots have to be free right uh but of course some states have been benevolent in uh trying to sort of allocate funds even for pilots or maybe we figured out how to do that uh working with the

government officials. So for that again we'll have to find and it has to be large scale. So as a small startup you know it's it's difficult to for us to fund those things and um I think there's

a lot of knowledge gap and I think ma'am mentioned sir you gave a lot of information about what government is doing but if you look at it from a startup founder perspective uh we don't

know how to sort of get to that right you know there is arrogant there uh 180,000 it's amazing right I got the numbers wrong maybe but somewhere around that right uh but how do I get to it's

really a dream for many of the founders here I'm sure how do I get into those right at least 10 of them then I'll make it 100 so that pathway is not clear ma'am if there is some pathway like you

it could be a governance body which takes we we won the national startup award we've won many many awards but that doesn't get to the pathway right so what is that rule or the process to get

into this you know that's not very clear uh in our minds and uh probably there is one but it's not communicated to the right people who are innovating is what my knowledge many times also uh we can

do pilots we'll get funds for the large scale adoption we understand there should be some kind of a program funding we have to create new programs to get the funding for it looks like some of

the uh people who are working very closely with the uh government like distributor type people they know exactly where the funds is and so on so forth right but it's still for the full

scale up you know again if we don't know we just stuck doing pilots, pilots, pilots, you know, I'm really sorry, maybe it's an obvious one for you, but it's really killing so many innovations

uh from scaling is what I feel right. Um so um now switching to AI per se. Uh we do AI on thermal imaging. We don't manufacture thermal uh cameras as such. It's a pure software as a medical

device. And many of you here again appreciate how AI has grown uh to make an impact for clinical decision support in healthcare is that it can just take images uh from MRI, CT, X-rays like

ma'am mentioned TB for example all of this and so it's an image in and uh result out so it's a simple software so many people are like okay how can a device be just a software right you know

it's an AI is a medical device right it has to have a touch and feel Obviously there's a hardware which is attached to it and so should we really pay for it you know just for software you want to

pay so these kind of you know um uh notions come in but of course now it's uh uh it's getting um better we say okay here we have done and this is happening u uh I mean prior uh usage will

definitely help there and the third part I want to mention is for preventative we all know that prevention is definitely better than cure especially for cancer early detection can cut down the uh

treatment cost by 10 times, 20 times, maybe 100 times also, right? So if you can detect in stage zero, stage one um you know versus a stage three, stage four, which is what is happening today,

most women are detecting their cancer by hand, you know, the screening rate for breast breast cancer with mamography in India is 1.3%. 98.7% of uh people ma'am are detecting

their cancer by hand and even the resource constraint settings who guidelines is do clinical breast examination handbased examination a little bit more trained so why can't we

use AI kind of uh you know AI with affordable devices that uh you know many of the innovators like ours do so that we can detect early and save on treatment cost and so on so forth as

well so uh in this case um I understand that uh PMJI for example, Aishman Bharat and all basically um are mainly for treatment uh you know so maybe we should have a preventative care budget as well.

I can go on and on but I think uh but it's really wonderful to be on the same stage as you know decision makers and people who are driving this and voice it's not just my opinion it's the

opinion of so many such startups that are out there trying and wanting to make a difference uh to the public health thank you so much for the opportunity &gt;&gt; thank you so much Dr. Manjinad for that

very uh candid uh answer where the whole idea of having to convince the state government that this solution works finding the funds for the initial pilots

which most of the time we expect to be done for free and the knowledge gap I mean how do we tell the private sector that okay look these are the facilities available this is what the government is

already doing so that you can complement us better and then the whole idea of bringing in preventive care into PMJI is also very very uh useful. Thank you so much for that. So now we move on to our

next panelist who is a doctor but heading the IT department of Jammu and Kashmir. So that is a very deadly combination when it comes to AI in healthcare and uh and Push is a good

friend and uh we've known him from earlier. So P you are now in the department that drives technology in the states and uh the startups would in fact be first more identified by you they

might be coming to first to the IT department and then how you link them up with the concerned department be it health or education or any other department matters. So from a state

government perspective, how do you think states are positioning themselves as ecosystem curators where they are bringing together academic institutions for research, the private sector for

innovation and public systems for real world deployment to translate AI ideas into actually scalable and market ready solutions. So we'd like to hear from you on that.

&gt;&gt; Good afternoon all these team panelists and good afternoon everyone one and all in the audience. uh I think what ABDM has done it has set up the framework beautifully for the

states and UTS to implement. Uh various interoperability standards and other issues which normally states will struggle for standardization has been beautifully rolled out. But I see states

and UTS at this point of time as a conveners not just implementers because real public health challenge the data uh the issues which are prevalent on the ground the disease burden on the ground

uh they can convene uh various kind of stakeholder consultation and come up with the solution in JNK we recently had uh one discussion with ICMR to set up one computitional health unit. So I went

to a institution as a preAI summit uh skim sora in kash in in shinagar. So what was amusing was the enthusiasm from the medical fraternity. They equally want to learn uh what are the new AI

models how to come up with the solution. So I see them as a very important stakeholders. So now we are in discussion with IIT Jammu uh one of the HIS uh present in Jammu and Kashmir to

set up a computational health unit. So that based on the priorities of uh the local disease burden, the local data availability, the total uh we know the challenge of the data fragmentation

available, we can come up with a certain set of brainstorming with the available infrastructure and then accordingly pick the use cases which are actually relevant for our disease burden rather

than as a knee-jerk reaction. We do not just want to push AI to any use case which comes our way and will not be uh very useful in the longer run. So this is one strategy we are adopting and we

are we have been inviting we have been giving public notices as well as inviting various uh startups to please come up discuss be our partners in the uh in the overall discussion and

national health mission has been equally uh on board for all the discussions. Uh second importantly we saw a a a gap which we want u we trying to fill it is the uh learning from the

medical facility visa with the technical expertise. I see a lot of doctors they want to do many AI courses. So they were very interested where can I do this course data mining course. So when I

went to the skiara tertiary care center I think with the audience almost 10 doctors must have said I want to do one data analytics course so that was very amusing. I discussed with uh Kiran sir

and uh good to learn that there are initiatives already taken and we can link those up. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you Dr. Push. And uh I think this collaboration or the lead that uh you as

uh the head of IT in the state is taking in building this computational processing unit I think will go a long way in placing the state uh in readying the state for using AI much more

effectively. So now we turn to our next panelist from the private sector Dr. Anand Seaman. Uh Dr. Anand uh basically Dr. Mangjunath told you about the challenges told us

about the challenges of of of the private sector of trying to operate in the public sector space. What I want to understand from you is what role can private sector play beyond technology

because at the end of the day and as we have learned through the in the in the hard way through implementing ABDM that it's not just about building the backbone or and getting an HMI solution.

It is also about the change management. It is also about training. So what do you think the private sector can bring beyond technology such as training, change management, capacity building as

far as government systems are concerned especially in healthcare and with your experience where you've rolled out uh the uh AI based solutions for uh I health I mean if you can please tell us

what are the ways in which this collaboration between the private sector and the states can go beyond just procurement of technology so that that bond becomes much more stronger please.

Thank you so much. Uh wonderful being part of this panel. And just to tell you a little bit about Remedio, the organization that I'm part of. Uh what we solve for is the problem where in

rural areas you have one of themologists for two lakh people and how do you now think in terms of a smartphone based device that takes highquality pictures of the retina and is able to screen for

um chronic retinal diseases. There are around 300 million at risk in India for that. How do you actually t shift that to health workers? That's problem statement number one. So the hardware

device that we built that is completely indigenously developed here in India. Today we have around 3,000 of those in use in India and around thousand in the US. So it is a case where it was built

for the health worker in Kerala in Mgalia but now is also being used by primary care physicians and nurses in the US as well. So it's something that was built for India but has allowed us

to go global thanks to the fact that that was uh that is possible. The second part to it is you solve for this the problem with respect to imaging but how do you now solve for a

specialist? So that's really where the AI comes in. So in 201920 when we got into it we realized we didn't have the Nvidia chips etc at that time as mature but we realized that we cannot do

anything on the cloud because the cost was going to be expensive. So we developed what are called privacy preserving algorithms that work on the smartphone itself and within 5 to 10

seconds of taking an image you're automatically able to see whether or not the patient has diabetic retnopathy glaucoma macular degeneration and what has been amazing about that is again

showing what is advantage to all all of us as founders what India really gives us is the same algorithm developed here um it's so resilient that when NHS in UK actually tested these algorithms on 1.2

2 million images in UK. We came out to be the best among all international global AI algorithms with the best balance of clinical sensitivity and specificity.

And thank you to a large extent this is made possible because when you design under constraints in India, you are able to get the design right that it is globally

relevant. That is one key part. For example, we had to train the images on actual images that are taken by health workers. They are not going to be of the same quality as what you would get

inside an opthalmologist clinic because their hands may shake. But how do you build a resilient AI algorithm that is able to still detect disease in spite of not being offered the best images is

really the problem that I think India as a nation can solve for the world in population health screening. Um now coming to the key question. um what is it that we can so what we did was we

worked very early with uh the government of Kerala as a sandbox where we brought in the solution there the first the hardware um and at that point in time we worked very closely with uh uh one of

the health systems globally that has eliminated blindness due to diabetic retnopathy which is the UK NHS we realized we can't create programs around technology because there would be a

conflict of interest so they designed the programs but the government of Kerala implemented Ed it and what was interesting is we not only published the results um 99% of those that were found

to have a problem did not know that they had a problem. So which was the big one. The second was from a health economics uh analysis perspective. Again this is published where we showed that there was

an 85% reduction in the cost of screening which was the second part that we were able to look at. And the third part is really around we come at it from a public health perspective because

after screening you still have to ensure that there's a loop closure in terms of care that happens once you detect there is a disease. So one of the models that we did is how do you therefore link

public health centers to district hospitals where the treatment is actually made possible and how do you now create registries because in chronic disease it does not matter that you just

screen once you need to screen every year but now how do you create registries? How can you create governance guard rails around how this registry is kept all of this was

actually part of what happened and in fact the nice thing is after the entire u select screenings that we have gone through we've actually had ABD and PMJ now uh Gita to your point u ofthal

themology conditions diabetic retnopathy glaucom and ROP screening is now reimbured as part of AMD ABDM PMJ so that any physician and this we have to really give it to the government where

they didn't restrict it to of mologist they said that any physician who would use any technology doesn't matter whether it's ours or anybody else's and are able to detect the disease there's a

reimbursement for them so this came about thanks to a lot of the evidence that came in so really a great step forward there now what are the challenges um three key challenges one

is um more than I'm going to talk about what I felt we should do as founders or companies that are part of it we need to work with the government not transactionally in terms of a tender We

have to work in terms of how do you build programs and sustain programs with them that is very very important because I can tell you that the business interest of the private sectors also in

terms of doing this I'll give you an example of it the first 16 centers around Tandrum is where the pilot was done it was part of an IndoK grant and thereafter it was scaled to 250 centers

but what we had to do was build capacity you had to go there and make sure that you build capacity because the capacity will be different in different uh family health centers. Not every health center

will be the same. So it's important for the private sector to get into programmatic delivery where you are going to be responsible in a way to help uh build capacity build dashboards by

which you can actually show utilization rate because I'll be very honest there were some centers where the devices were not getting used as much as what we would have expected epidemiologically

but by giving dashboards there's a way by which you are able to show the program managers what the actual utilization is and you can actually go in and solve for problems. Uh in fact

now what we are moving to is moving to models by which can we incentive align everyone in including the private sector in it where you don't go for capital equipment based uh sales but instead can

you start looking at how much everyone earns on the basis of a person screened which now aligns everyone in the pathway creates this as a program that's for a long-term and there I agree with Dr. Dr.

Panval where he made the point on ecosystems because I feel that is very very important. Um the other way by which I think uh we need to look at this differently is when we first went to the

government and we got feedback saying that look can you look at I not as part of a separate program but as part of NCD. So what that meant is we went back and said what else can we do with that

one retinal image? Can we start looking at CT calcium score as predicted from the retina? Can we start looking at cardiovascular risk along with chronic kidney disease risk? Now what happens

automatically is the amount the 85% reduction now goes to 99% because now with the same test you're able to detect more in the population. So that was something that where we had to redefine

the problem of what we are working on on the basis of the fact that when you have that one screening event how do you actually make sure that you're able to get as much as possible out of it. So I

think to summarize where I think the private sector really needs to play a role is look at this as a public health problem not as a problem of selling devices into and I think that is

something that we have learned. Uh we are we have benefited from having a public health team within the company that is responsible for looking at utilization rates after we place devices

and I think it's really helped us understand the problems like what Dr. Dr. Banal talked about in terms of how do you fit into workflow? How do you make it simple for the Asha worker

there, the health worker, she has hundreds of things to do? And you have to make it simple enough for her to do it. And that only happens if you look at it as a public health problem, not as a

business problem of selling devices, which I think is the key thing that all of us would uh would take well from it. It's helped us. We've been able to scale. uh the second opportunity I feel

is once you're done in Kerala you have to repeat now with every state instead I'm hoping that with the publications that come out it's a way by which there may be a translation of technology that

happens and the last part is the ecosystem part that um was talked about I think that's very important when we took u our algorithms through CDSO approval there was no predicate device

we the first to go through it so it took us around 3 years but now we are a predicate as a result of which there are two more solutions that have come and I can tell you that it's not competition.

The more we are able to get more people into this ecosystem of AI based solutions, I think the awareness goes up. There is enough of a market and more importantly from a public health

perspective, we have 300 million people that we have to actually prevent blindness in. So that's really how we got started and how we see the role of the of the private sector when it comes

to what else we can possibly do. now expanding to systemic diseases from blindness. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much Dr. Anand. That that's a very very uh uh what do you call a

different way of looking at how a startup should engage with the government. I mean this whole idea of not looking at a relationship from a purely transactional point of view or

purely selling a device point of view trying to build the solution along around the problem help in post implementation I mean after after the roll out and and and further evaluation

and if only publications can help us in procurement nothing like it then I hope it leads to that one day. Um sir before we come to uh the chair for her uh way forward and concluding remarks I have

one question for the CEO because sir by putting AI and with within health and and and saying that yes all states will now be trying to implement the solutions we are also setting a cat in the among

the pigeon saying okay now there is generative AI where everybody thinks they have a solution for everything. So many a times we see people coming saying I have a solution do you have a problem

right? So sir in such a situation we also need to make sure that the solutions that are getting developed are interoperable transparent explainable and aligned with public health goals. So

how do you think sir we we we need to make sure that this also happens along the way while we are adopting more and more AI solutions into our systems. &gt;&gt; Yeah. uh when we talk of AI solution as

long as we are doing you know proof of concept or the pilot I think it is fine to you know experiment with it but when we talk of AI solution to be implemented at population scale it has to follow

certain you know guard rails and that is where I believe in case of whatever AI solution we use it there has to be certain things which should be inbuilt it like it must have you know govern uh

governance has to be by design there cannot be deployment and then governance. So something like that it has to pass through the trust and also have a privacy by design. So if these

things are kept in mind and also make a arrangements where you know data uh security consents are all gets inbuilt into the whole mechanism of implementing AI. It makes lot of sense to scale up at

the population level. But one two more things are very important when we talk of AI in healthcare. It may not be true with many other sectors but when we talk of the health care which is extremely

sensitive and people just can't risk their life based on you know somebody's else assessment of efficacy or accuracy of the solutions. So at that point of time it is very important that we see

that not AI takes decision rather it helps human [snorts] in the loop to take decision. So it should not be replacing the technician or the doctors it should be actually enabling

or act multiplying the capacity of the uh doctors to deliver more. So uh if we are take uh thinking of a AI solution to deploy at population scale, this has to be kept in mind. And last but not the

least, the AI solution should not should actually mitigate inequity and the bias. This is something which we are finding and there is lot of uh you know uh uh uh research or ideas which is coming. Many

a times it promotes bias. It uh you know builds inequity. So if we are talking of a AI solution at population scale, this must be built into the system much before it is deployed and it not should

only be at the beginning of deployment also should be monitored throughout its life cycle. So AI deployment is not just one time affairs. It has to be the whole life cycle and that is where our role is

very important and I think uh ministry of health is working in that direction that how should we have and therefore we are coming out with a strategy for AI in healthcare exclusively which will

actually set the framework in which AI deployment implementation monitoring and even decommissioning can take place at appropriate time. So I think this is uh which I feel is very important when we

talk of AI particularly in healthcare. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much sir. So now ma'am uh we'd like to uh listen from you from about way forward and your concluding remark.

&gt;&gt; So I think the way forward has come out very clearly through this uh dis panel uh discussion. So Sunil has already laid down the fact that we have to view the ecosystem as a whole and I think Dr.

Anand brought it beautifully that the solution has to uh address the public health ch uh challenge and it has to view the challenge as an ecosystem. So a solution

has to be uh viewed in a holistic perspective because only then can you succeed. I think we in ABDM and in NHA will have to work out uh maybe have a brainstorming session and work out what

could the whether it's possible to lay down certain pathways as guidance documents. So if we can do that then I think that might uh make it some states are of course doing fantastic work most

are doing but maybe laying down the possible pathways and where uh where the challenges come and what are the possible ways to address those challenges which uh Dr. Dr. Mangjunath

also brought out what could be the possible ways to address that challenge is something that we need to see. Then of course regulatory capacities. So I think a regulator is missing amongst us.

But the regulatory capacities how do we enhance it? The more we do the better it will become. So it's a kind of a generative system in itself. So that is uh also which will require the

attention. Then like in the ICMR we have a health technology assessment. So supposing her solution has come and she has got the regulators approval whether from public health perspective does it

make sense to bring it there not just in terms of cost effectiveness but also in terms of its implementability we'll have to see. So presently that is seen on one hand by the health

technology assessment board of ICMR and on the other hand by NHM team that if we upscale it is it implementable will it make life easier for the Asha worker or tougher and will she do it or will they

not do it so we don't want a fancy solution out there which nobody will use. So I think those are the things then maybe a registry of possible solutions. I may be using the wrong

word. You're free to uh use the right words but if this registry is available then maybe it can help. Then under the NHM because a lot of us are talking about public uh health uh perspective

which is largely through the flagship program we have uh sharing of best practices regularly and sometimes it does help states and adopting each other's uh practices. So uh once you

have the registry of solutions maybe in every uh uh regional conference or national conference that we have one section could be devoted to the AI solutions which NHA could compile and

present. So that may also help integrate the whole thing. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much ma'am. I would like to thank the chair and all the panel members for their valuable insights and

over to you DA. &gt;&gt; Thank you sir. Thank you to our esteemed chair and panelists for a deeply engaging session. Now I would like to request Dr. Sunil Kumar Bwal CO NHA to

present a token of gratitude to Miss Pune Shvastava, Secretary Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. Thank you sir. Thank you ma'am. I would now request Sri Kiran Gopal Vasa.
