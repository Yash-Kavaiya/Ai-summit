## 📝 Transcript

which deep deep you know the structural data which was all very well found and presently available you could actually I think some of the speakers will talk about it how that really got converted

into an AI model which is actually also led to the Nobel Prize activity so therefore one needs to look at how the AI is functioning now and if you really look at for the first time we are

creating systems that learn design and also interpret along with human beings and I think in the biological context This is very very critical and important to understand because what we look at is

life processes which are fairly dynamic and has large number of evolutionary pathways also embedded within it which actually survives in a models which are quite unique and unprecedented of its

kind. The other thing one wants to understand from a biological functions that the scales are very different in biology. While you work at the molecular level then you work at the protein level

you work at the cell level you work at an organism level and you work at an ecosystem level as well and so these are all have to be balance it out in different ways of looking at how to do

this from DBT Brack what we've been trying to do is to develop various programs to bring academia startup industry such that we can accelerate the biio manufacturing point of view of our

country's ecosystem and as you would have realized the biomu manufacturing really got taken off during the covid times. The amount the number of vaccines that were created using biio

manufacturing capacity was unprecedented and ever heard before like more than 2 million vaccines 2 billion vaccines doses were available to be provide to be empowering the entire country's

ecosystem and therefore this is a much time to really look at how to be able to ensure through this. So I think what we have is the two sessions right now we

have and one is the AI powering biio manufacturing for next generation therapeutics and what department is trying to do is to set up large scale genomics data in the Indian population

which can provide wonderful phenotypic phenotypes model as well as disease models that are of available in different settings available as well. What has happened in the past is that

10,000 genomes have been identified and uh but these are healthy genomes that are being provided whose genome sequence is available in biological data center. Now what we want

to expand and build it to a million genomes which is a program that is going to be announced very soon from the government of India. At the same time BioAI hubs actually allows you to put

the pieces together. So there are various partners as I showed you in this cartoon. One is a biologist. The second one is a computer. The third one is the you know the ecosystem IT professionals

that are working with and you need to cross talk across ecosystem to be able to ensure that that's sufficiently works together. The second panel has got to do with the AIdriven biofactories for

sustainable materials and you can imagine that all the materials that we have coming in our country right now for the chemical industry that talks about tremendous progress actually produces

about 60,000 to 70,000 molecules. They all come from the prochemical sector as a precursors come from the petrochemical sector and then as the prochemical sector will undergo changes the dynamic

changes that are associated with in terms of you know regenerative energy sources you will have a challenge of becoming these prochemical sectors to also resource activities to able to

bring out into these kind of models. So for example these are biodegradable polymers, biiobased chemicals, sustainable materials, carbon capture technologies. All of this will undergo

transitions in next 20 to 25 years which will be of unprecedented nature and cannot be imagined how they will actually transit through &gt;&gt; and that's where the Indian biio

Biology is no more an observational science alone but now we can make we can engineer biology of the future. uh people have talked about uh people have talked about healthcare

and other examples and when I was sharing this with a friend he said that if you looked at how we treated our people 100 years back we would laugh at the way they were treating our patients

100 years back but if you look at the next 15 20 years I think people will laugh at how we treat our patients today in the context of what are the changes that are likely to happen so we know so

little about biology ology and there is so much more for us to learn. And today with the kind of advent of technology and AI, we are now at a point where biology is not just

materials. So there's a lot of activity along those areas as well. And in general, if you look at health or plant health or any of those kinds of things, I think how we engineer next generation

biology uh and how we make the interventions happen is going to define the future of how we are looking at these kinds of science. So I think we are at a very exciting age and I see a

lot of students here for [snorts] those of you who are in this area this is I think the best area for you to be if you look at the next 25 30 years and I'll share a personal story here when I

started to be in the software industry in 1990 it just felt like very fuzzy and hazy but now if you look at it today it's a very large industry and I think a similar opportunity exists for biology

especially because of the changes that we see here in The second thing that I'm going to mention here is that AI has become the microscope for uh for modern biology and it is allowing us to see

patterns that we could have never seen before. So AI is not just being used for various things but because of the ability to uh look at micro images lots of other things uh you can see

structures beyond complex biology. There is signals that you can detect which you could not have detected through human eye or human observation. Now we can look at much finer details and then

connecting different concepts. This is again a very exciting thing with multimodality of AI. The ability to connect different concepts in biology and other sciences with each other is

going to be possible for the very first time. So with AI as a companion for biology now we have the ability to look at things that we had never possibly imagined and maybe I should have added

that it's not only the microscope but it is also the telescope as well. So we can look at things that are far away which we had never thought of. So this is where it becomes very exciting. Uh third

point I want to make is the fact that AI has made it possible for us to build biio manufacturing which is both scalable, precise and more effective. And we're going to have a bigger panel

on this specific topic. So I will not spend a whole lot of time trying to explain this because that's what we're going to do next. But essentially you can define in silicon build in silicon

or meaning build in a model first before you put it into manufacturing. As we all know uh one of the challenges in biological manufacturing is the search space so to say that you have for the

number of proteins molecules how they can be combined is extremely large and over evolution biology has figured out the best ways for how these things communicate or connect. But this is very

hard to do when you are starting to build new molecules or new proteins or new substances. And AI will allow us to have this opportunity to look at multiple different kinds of data sets

and combine them in very very effective ways which is really what some of the work that has been done in alpha folds and all the other thing that has happened through uh deep mind you will

see that but the ability to be more precise is what manufacturing is possible because of AI. The last the fourth thing that I'm going to mention is that this is actually an

important time for us to invest in biology. So we have um three broad areas that I'm going to share. One is of course research. Um there is so much more to do that has still not been

figured out. So I think there is a time for us to invest in the science and the research and some of the scientists that are in India and I'm familiar with them. They are doing pretty amazing work in

this area. So those students who are thinking about what is the future for them. There is a lot of opportunities for research in India and I would like to encourage you to take a look at the

DBT labs because there's a lot of action there. uh manufacturing we will spend some more time on just now and finally there is a need for setting up an ecosystem and the DVD has been working

together with many educational institutions and other institutions to see how to build an ecosystem so that we get the right kinds of trained people who understand biology and computing and

various other things. Now this is very important because many of us who are kind of my age, we actually had to make a choice between biology and mathematics in the ninth standard. So you know how

things were at that time. Today it's we cannot work unless we work collaboratively. So this is really a lot of activity going on here. And I want to mention this last thing which is the

number five item that I wanted to share is that this is a you know um we are at the AI summit here in India with lots of you here and this is India's opportunity. I think if you look at it,

we have large volumes of biodiversity within India, whether it's genomics or other things and the secretary talked about the need for creating genomics related projects in India because we

have unique diversity and there is an opportunity for us to find things that nobody else in the world can find. In addition to that, we have a very healthy system that has come from ancient times

including Ay and others where we may not have had a chance to identify some of the things that we have always done if they're where what is the data backing on that and can we bring it to a

scientific place where we can connect some of our ancient traditions where somehow we know that they work but we don't know why and how what are the pathways. So this is an opportunity for

us to differentiate as compared to the rest of the world and u we have in India uh an opportunity to build at scale. This is something that we have demonstrated through various of our

projects and I think biology requires us to think about problems not just at small lab but at population scale and this is where India can really be the driver for the rest of the world and

finally I think this is our decade and this is our opportunity and I think I'm very excited to see so much interest here and uh I'm going to I'm also equally excited to learn more about it

from the panelists. So I'll stop here and I want to thank you all for being here and thank you for inviting me. [applause] &gt;&gt; Thank you Dr. Despand for that

insightful keynote address. Uh so now we now move to the next segment for our session engaging panel discussion on AI enabled biio manufacturing for nextgen medicine. So now now I will invite our

estimate moderator for this panel Dr. Anra Agraal sir and joining him are Dr. Depiti Takural ma'am Dr. Arvind Dr. Madura ma'am u so over to you Dr. Graal. Thank you very much. I will not consume

much time in introducing. We'll manage. We'll manage. First of all, I want to amplify two points mate. All of you have chosen the right room to be in in various good things about AI.

Biology is the most happy. So, Deis Hassab is basically spoke recently just as math turned out to be the language of physics. AI will be the new language of biology. Why is that important?

&gt;&gt; Dr. Gokri had mentioned about how so far we were looking at nature being inspired to build AI very soon with AI we might be inspired to build new life good or bad we will talk about that later but

basically we're already at a point where an entire synthetic chromosome can be made and new bacteria can be made. If you could imagine what a new sequence could be, you could create brand new

life. And of course, in areas like biio manufacturing, being able to create living factories is absolutely critical. But my panel is about biommanufacturing was next generation medicine. So I'm

going to focus a bit on nextgen medicine, which is basically the type of medicine we have not seen before. And we are seeing plenty of examples. We are seeing AI made antibiotics that are

killing MDRs that we couldn't find treatment for. We are coming up with genetic therapies by looking at genetic sequences. So I'll go to Alvin. I'm going to go to you first. Recently we

saw that we had virtual labs basically creating new novel mutations never seen before. A team of AI agents building new nanobodies to SARS code V2. [singing] Where do you see this entire direction

with AI itself helps us discover new things in medicine going? &gt;&gt; Yeah, thank you Andra and thank you to DBT for this uh for giving this opportunity. Uh I'll start with a

slightly humorous note. Uh in 2021 when uh the deep mind team and the David Baker lab put out Rosetta Fold and alold many of my colleagues in other branches of biology given that I'm an

experimental structural biologist started asking me when are you losing your job? uh but 5 years down the line uh you know uh I I can and uh reaffirm that AI has been deeply empowering to

people experimentalists like us. Uh on a more serious note uh you know we know that many of these processes are going to add immense value to the pharmaceutical sector close to a few

hundred billion dollars and from and most of it is through biology oriented uh discoveries. Now uh these biology oriented discoveries as Anand had pointed out uh you know he mentioned

that biology can be engineered but with the advent of AI it is more more and more accurate. So B biology can be engineered more accurately. Now this can be applied to as uh Anerog already

pointed out to building virtual labs where biologists who need not necessarily have a computational background can resource these AI based uh you know integrated tools so that

they can design molecules of their interest. One example is that of the antibbody design that has come up where they integrate the diffusion models with the uh inverse folding models with with

simulations or first principle based uh studies in order to design higher and more improved therapeutics. Of course, it does not substitute for experiments but then it brings you more accuracy

towards what could be your starting molecules that you can screen. Now the advantage that is manifold because you are not necessarily sticking to uh you know animal derived antibodies which is

the norm and now you can design antibodies in silicon and test them in your labs and also develop uh you know an entire pipeline which does not require animal based uh you know

molecules and this is not just empowering both from a biology standpoint but from a sustainability science standpoint also. So I think this is where the field is going and it's

really really going to get exponential as we go along. Thank you very much. Madra I'm going to come to you next. You have used informatics to advance biomolecular design pharma.

You have seen the field grow from narrow AI to generative AI and you also recently received a grant to the bio3 AI mission. &gt;&gt; So tell us about as a person from that

side industry how do you see Gen AI the latest things helping you? Okay, thank you Dr. Anurat and I also thank DBT for giving this opportunity to share the industrial uh perspective on this. Uh

yes it has been a transformational journey for me because when I started uh curating data manually to using automation talking about ML to eventually using AI to optimize a

parameter to generate AI where we are talking about multiparametric uh um use case for example a current use case that you know we are working on is about enzyme engineering and uh enzyme

not only that we are trying to the biology is proven here biology is working but that does not mean that the uh treatment is uh perfect because there are uh there has to be a improved

efficacy then there is toxicity there is imunogenicity and there is a myio manufacturer problem of this particular enzyme so what we have done is that we have developed a platform through which

you know we have built a generative AI based platform so that multiparametric assessment of all these not just stability or also stability it has to work in the human environment right so

protein should not attack it. So all these parameters are worked upon simultaneously and the iterations which otherwise happens traditionally by mutagenesis experiment in the lab and

takes several iteration including again failure in the test testing of the molecule that is not now happening because we have reduced the timing to up to 50%. It depends on use case but we

have seen a 50% reduction and that adds so much of value and we have built not just generative AI because there are hallucinations right hallucinations come with generative AI but this has to be

grounded in experimental reality and that's what we have built a bio AI loop wherein we design we build we test and we share and the same information the same data goes back into the system and

uh that's where the beauty is that it keeps getting updated. The models are updating themselves [clears throat] very rapidly and eventually in very few iterations we get we have seen a very

great success and this is not for a single use case. The platform has expandability to other enzymes, therapeutics, uh antibodies, uh matics like many proteins

and even cytoines. So this can be used made use of as a hub to which several spokes can join and utilize the facility. This has been a transformative journey for me to start from where I

started and reach where I am. I would like to uh comment here before I end that uh Mark Anderson's comment 15 years back was that software will be eating the world. What it means is that it will

eventually be everywhere. Now see where we are and now we heard these two visionary people's comments. We know where AI in biology is heading. We are no more a biotech. We are going to be

take bio. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much. You know predicting the future is famously said is difficult business because it keeps on changing. So Lippy, I'm going to come to you. I

mean I remember the time when your molecular dynamic simulations you take up 50% of IGIB's usage on HPCs and while AI has become quite good at predicting binding, you do full simulations even

after the binding occurs. We have seen recently isomorphic labs come up with a brand new reasoning model type vastly improving upon alpha 4. Where do you see this going where not everything is in

the open source world a lot of cutting edge reasoning models are coming developing these kind of AI takes compute at a very very high level and of course we need to do little bit more

than just finding and design over to you. &gt;&gt; Sure. Thanks Aar and also thanks to DVD for this timely panel. I'm just going to introduce you to this concept of

isomorphic and other AI labs that are based on the concept of drug delivery. Now drug delivery essentially relies on protein structure prediction. And for the folks who are not from the biology

field, protein structure is nothing but the shape. So if you get the shape right, you essentially can get the drug under this tenant. I come from very first principle based methods where I

did my PhD 20 years back and the title was the mechanism of protein folding meaning you need to understand how the proteins shape to find their meaning but alpha actually proved us all wrong it

essentially said that I'm going to do a shortcut we can predict just the shape and how is not essential so now it has all the shape memory isomorphic In other lab what they're saying is that if you

have shape memory can we do shape reasoning and that's where it get really interesting. So now if you have shape you can get more complexes you can get more targets and the reasoning can tell

you how the drug is binding to the protein. So it's a very exciting phase and for example in our own lab we are trying to understand the print the the biology in a realistic way

computationally but also things that are interactable experimentally. So I think that's where the space is going ahead you do biology in a sense where experimentally things are seeing the

forest from top but inside forest you have lot of things that are moving. So empty simulations is one of the next layer on isomorphic labs where you can also predict in a realistic environment

how things are moving. So I think it's going to be very interesting in a way that we are capturing biology and how we are capturing. Thanks mother to do my first follow-up

question with you cuz when you mentioned we are still thinking of the experimental part being human somebody's doing it on the bench and you get the feedback very similar that in medicine

you know surgeons still think they are safe from AI cuz they are the one working with their hands but already in the west we are starting to see complete robotic loops

&gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; where the design is starting to occur robots are synthesizing even the experiments are done robotically. Data is flowing back to the AI agents. Where

do you see the human value additions roles in this particular loop? They are but I want you to bring it out so everybody knows their job is very safe. The way Arvin was talking about

&gt;&gt; secure yes I think one thing that is non-negotiable in this entire process of course uh I know what you are talking about and whether we will be reaching that stage. Yes, it's a matter of time

for us. We may not be there right now in India but we are. However, I think um non-negotiable component here is trained resources for data because data is of utmost utmost importance and I think a

proprietary data sets which are gold standard curated data sets are adding huge value to the platform that we are building. People we all talk about large language models. Yes. Uh they are there

and they're very useful. almost everyone is finding it its daily usage in their daily use. However, in biology, I feel uh I'm sure others would agree too that the data need not be large to the extent

where large language models we speak about. But the it it has to be specific. It has to be uh very accurate and highly curated with all the meta data

associated with I think that's where humans will always be playing a big role. So to the two academics you train students and you are training them for this next generation of biio

manufacturing for next generation of medicine. Where do you focus? So uh what we had painted in the previous discussion was uh the power of

this methodology in you know doing a lot of the biological applications. But there's also the flip side which is where uh you know many of these solutions that a IML based algorithms

put out are not necessarily fully customized to the uh to the experimental requirements maybe as a therapeutic maybe as a vaccine or or even as a diagnostic tool. So where the human

element comes in and especially for for to have students who have a future in this area is particularly for making these models a lot more accurate at one level and then subsequently developing

high throughput platforms where many of these solutions insilico solutions can be tested for proper experimental and therapeutic outcomes. So I think this is where the student human resource focus

should be on I think in the next few years. Yeah, I think that is something um very uh challenging at the same time exciting because uh some of these departments in

our Indian institution university setup have been always in silos. Chemistry department, biology department and computer science department and I think largely because of the advancements in

the alpha fold there's a lot of drifting which is happening naturally from the computer science folks to the biology and as Dr. Pandy was also saying it there is a realization that there are

cuttingedge uh algorithms that can really have a real world impact in biology. So I've had really a nice experience in interacting with core computer science students lately who

will take an initial learning curve to understand biology but at the same time they're really doing some phenomenal work in application development. So I think at the same time biology student

need to ramp up their understanding of basic algorithms which is as you all know we are coding in English nowadays. So that is also parally happening and I think it's really really interesting how

these two things are merging together. So I want to end by kind of quoting my friend of mine who wrote a book human edge in the age of AI Nan the point is there'll never be a shortage for people

who understand the problem and I think those of you who understand the problem and leverage the power of AI we'll always have a very good life out thank you

&gt;&gt; thank you doc thank you Dr. and all our panelist for those reach insights. We now move to our second panel discussion that is manufacturing materials with biology the AIdriven

bioactory. Now I will invite professors SR Chri and joining him are Dr. Dwas Montis and Dr. Rasi Sing over to you sir. &gt;&gt; Thank you. I think uh this is a very

interesting panel and I'm actually coordinating this panel coming completely from an engineering side and non Therefore, [clears throat] if you look

into it, we are moving from the core biological questions being addressed with the help of the to bringing into a manufacturing. The engineering of the science that gets

discovered into production is another challenge. In fact, that challenge requires that also today biology comes in and we need to have

better because that defines an overall process [laughter] and if we have a process now there are various new technologies which are emerging

which are which have a key role in terms of managing these processes. This is number one which you have to think in a different way in the context of biologic what you have thought in terms of

and when it comes to bio manufacturing there's also another interesting part is that when you talk in terms of biology the uncertainty of biology also impacts the production process. Now the evolving

biology how it impacts the production process how it is factored [music] and that is something very important to look at and the third is how do you do a quality control because in the industry

when you get a product if there is a reliability there are questions and quality monitoring is time. So if you look at from all these perspectives, I think we have very distinguished panel

who have actually been involved into these kind of research regarding bio manufacturing and actually having processes which are really &gt;&gt; uh involved in this space. So I first

ask Ashish to Yeah. Okay. So Ashish that with your experience of running an industry you should really tell us that what are the challenges really these bi manufacturing

processes are posing and you think that a fusion of biosciences and AI is necessary to handle those challenges &gt;&gt; absolutely um first of all a very good afternoon everybody a packed uh call uh

so really appreciate everybody's time and uh privilege to be a part of this uh August session. Uh I represent a company um which is in the industrial biotech right. So uh what we do is we take uh

the feed from the biosources and we convert them into either fuels or into materials that are useful. That's what we do at PR industries the company that I'm representing. And um um this has

been a journey for the company for over four decades. And if we looked at uh the historical um data and data is important as we just saw in the previous discussion. Uh what it suggests is that

in the past we had to really physically do a lot of stuff in terms of laboratory experiments, building pilot plants, taking those pilot plants to a slightly higher um capacity plant before any of

these uh biotech industrial biotech um technologies are brought for a real commercialization and a and a large production. And this meant uh hundreds of kres of rupees that needed to be

spent and let alone the money that gets wasted if the experiment was not successful and therefore it creates a deterrent you know because money is uh not always available cheap and uh you

know you have multiple options uh to you know exercise when you have limited amount of money. So what is coming to the four and why I gave that background to you is uh a concept of what is now

being called as digital twins is coming up very very strongly. It's essentially nothing but a um representation of the physical things uh in terms of science and mathematics that it can represent on

a computer. So you need [clears throat] not build things physically either in a lab or in a pirate plant or in a commercial plant but way before you actually spend that kind of money. You

can do multiple experiments just by uh creating creatively a model that represents those physical things and those are very important when it comes to biio manufacturing. question uh that

you are alluding to. Um we've been working in technologies um in the company where today we can just uh use the models that we have created uh for let's say creating fuels out of the

biological sources for example the agri waste you know we can take rice patty uh we can take uh many other uh such uh agricultural uh produce that can convert uh the um uh different chemicals uh that

we can use uh into the industry. But all of these today can be first experimented with the the models that we have and then we can also tweak them. We can you know experiment with them what we call

as the whatif scenarios and before even building uh even one rupee or spending one rupee of capital expenditure uh we are able to come up with multiple um uh sort of outcomes that we can then choose

from as to which ones will really yield us uh the best uh results. So um in summary what I'm saying is that uh there is a lot of uh computational technology and also there is a lot of knowledge

that is available in the past. uh the trick would be for the students who are in the room today to ingenuously convert that into high fidelity models uh that will be used by the industries like us

so that we can carry on these experiments and with a fraction of the uh money that goes into either R&amp;D labs or in the capital expenditure for uh any kind of uh equipment uh we will be able

to produce much more efficiently. Thank youish. Let me just put this question in a slightly different context in a sense that all these biological systems suffer

from a challenge of variability and when it comes to the industry and definition of industrial process and digital twins they have to be actually handled these variabilities in a very scientific way.

So if you look at from a process point of view how science can what do you think of it? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Uh see the see the the variability of course is in the natural system it is

part of it. Uh but one is of course you try to decode and understand but under biio manufacturing what you try to do you are trying to engineer the system. See let us say some of the examples you

give let us say seaweed you have kagin and you want to convert it into a sugar. So now if you try to understand which enzymes are trying to make it which pathway you will report you express that

chlor that pathway into another organism. So now your variability would be much under your control. So you you are not working on the actual bacteria or wherever or the plant where it come

from. you are cloning or removing that cell like trying to decode it and bringing it to another organism which is much under your control which is the ecoli or the east or something and in

that context how AI is going to help us like this has been done for last 25 years we started doing genome sequencing just for this purpose it was the genome guided screening or something we used

our conventional bionformatics and computational biology but the limitation we had that where we could only deal with labeled data So whichever pathways are characterized, whichever enzymes are

experimentally characterized, we could do that. But we could not do deal with unlabelled data. So what these foundation models LLM have come is and our encodings were all biohysics based

or or understanding based. But with this LLM and all these foundation models you can use lot of unlabelled data like the sequence of not only the enzyme which you are interested in all other enzymes

and all other this thing build a foundation model and try to inherent the latent space what you call in this one and because of that a lot of power has come from unlabelled data and if we see

the example of alpha code Dr. Vocal said they not only used the sequence of proteins in PDB they use something called BFD big fantastic database which a sequence of each and every protein

which occurs anywhere in the world. So because of that two things and other thing which came for is this attention like which bio physicists knew there are two rescues that have to come closer but

they were not able to decode it but the attention which came from a computer transfer model which mean a computer scientist may not have understood what is the role of attention for protein

structure when these two things combined it became very very powerful. So in that context if we do it from the enzyme sequence to pathway to this thing and chlorating to east or ecoli we have a

good scope and that is where all the generative AI which Andra gave this which we just discussed that is going to help in a big way like the designing of the mutations designing of the pathway

that's going to help a lot. So I think if you look at it in that sense that AI is also not leading to scientific discovery but also it's a very useful tool in terms of tuning and making

production process more efficient. Yeah I'll just add to it. It is it is per say could lead to also scientific discovery because if you bring the explanable AI concept in many cases if you bring the

attention scores and try to see in the context of biological understanding how we are discovering certain things which you would not have discovered. See uh just one question to activate is that

when you are actually through this whole process both of you you're making a product which is a bas and there has to be a user confidence how do you establish how do you propose

to take it to industrial grade specification or certification confidence in the product that they can actually use it without any other kind of risk I

Yeah, maybe I can attempt to answer this question and then uh hand it over to professor. Uh so um I talked about digital twins and uh I talked about how they uh from the business perspective

help us uh but also when you get into uh the production side. One of the systems that uh we are developing is you can actually run the physical process of production and the digital twin which is

based on either the first principles or the first principles models that are aided by the AI you know because there are so many combinations possible so many permutations possible getting the

right insights uh can be a problem if you do it in a conventional way. So we have a combination of both the first principles as well as the AI based engines as they are called and uh we can

run the physical processes but we can run the digital processes even faster so faster than the real time because biological processes can be slower in terms of just making uh the production

cycles and so by running them faster even before you can spoil a manufacturing patch by wrong operations or by wrong controls, you can correct them because you'll start to see some

aberrations or some excursions in the in the parameters and therefore you can course correct them way before your entire batch can get spoiled. just as an example and so therefore combining these

two you can really bring this whole technology that we are talking about to the actual industry applications that can start getting a lot more productivity through it just as an

example I want to talk &gt;&gt; yeah I think we already added the digital twin part but I would say is let us say I mean if your question was to the actual biological product see let us

say I'm making one compound for the flavor industry which the chemical industry was making and we made it in a biosynthetic pathway. We took it from others but the actual product of course

there could be predicted properties can be checked through AI model but once you start making the compound it has to go through the same sets of tests which the actual product goes through and then

only it will be accepted but we can bring AI models which will reduce the actual screening part where a lot of things we can rule out using the AI model. So what you telling is that this

combination really increases the efficiency of the production process. So I would just try have a last question to address both of you because to run an an industry you require qualified manpower.

So I think do you do you suggest that these whole bioengineering that we talking about that requires repositioning itself to really meet the need of emerging bio industry?

&gt;&gt; That's a great question. Uh I'll give you a practical um uh sort of challenge that we are going through. Uh one of our processes is called as second generation ethanol generation uh creation process

where we take parali or the you know rice patty and convert that into uh ethanol. Right now u there are not too many plants that are working like this uh worldwide and so getting trained

manpower to operate the plant in a manner that we really want it to uh is not easy. And so again there the technology comes to our help. Uh we can create what are called as the operator

training simulators which are again another type of digital twins but more oriented towards training uh the panel operators, the field operators, the people who sit on the uh control systems

inside a control room and we can actually make use of these technologies which are like I said based on simulation and AI so that we can train the people just like how the new pilots

are trained on a on a simulator before they take um into a cockpit and fly a plane. Very similar concept for the operators in these new emerging um bio-industrial plants uh which are

coming up and which will come up in the future and we can really make use of this for the startup sequence, the shutdown sequence, any malfunctions, how do you handle the plants, uh any kind of

aberrations that the processes go through. So all of these can be very much uh utilized and therefore we can you know make uh use of the technology for practical applications in the

industry &gt;&gt; extension. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I I think that's a very important point. I think we touched it already.

Anand told even I we segregate like if you think of bioai, you need people quantitative understanding, computer science understanding and biology. But we segregate too early into a physical

science or a biological science. So we need to change that. That is one level of change. Even in 95 when I went to Israel for postoc most favored subjects in their undergraduates was computer

science life science together. So but somehow this has not happened maybe some of the iss that that is one thing but at this but that will all take time so at this stage

even if I'm a professor in a biological institute whatever I need maybe I should also undergo in a training in a computer science person and we should design such multi- tire trainings depending on what

is required at the different level with that only we can bridge this gap and that's a real challenge and I think we can come to the end of this panel discussion. And I think I brought this

question uh specifically because I think in the total academic ecosystem in the country this convergence is not really practiced in a detail and it is absolutely important that this whole

panel discussion has clearly shown from science and production point of view and we move to nextp something only.

&gt;&gt; My question is open to the entire panel. Uh first of all uh amazing discussion that we had. Uh going back to the question uh you ma'am you had mentioned that uh generative AI models you use uh

experimental data to ground those particular models but uh aren't experimental data by its nature inaccurate? How does how do we make sure that it's not steering towards the wrong

direction? Yes, it's a good question. Okay. So uh even if even if genetic AI or AI weren't there the data was still flawed

&gt;&gt; and still the discoveries were made inventions were made and we have reached the point where we are now talking about this very high technology induced um outcomes in terms of efficacy in

terms of time saving and in terms of cost saving because otherwise you know biologist is expensive subject. So that's what I said a very highly trained

&gt;&gt; data or gold standard data still stays the key to all of this right and that's where human in the loop so that's why the loop has to be developed the human

in the loop is imperative we cannot at least right now get away from you know use of human also one more thing that we need to um establish here is that the data that comes from the experiment okay

itself is either proven in the lab or not. So the laboratory experiments is also imperative. So unless AI generative AI AI is grounded in these two things there

are chances that what you say would happen but if we keep this loop continuously working the chances that we get to reduce these errors would be very high and still we are developing right

AI is still a technology as maturing &gt;&gt; so 15 years down the line these problems may have some solutions which are more easier &gt;&gt; I'll just quickly add one thing I think

it's as The blanket statement is inaccurate to say that XT data is not really correct. In fact, what I would say is ML architectures take this ground truth data. Okay, protein sequences,

protein structures that are coming out of genomics and crystalallography are as close as you can get to the ground. In fact, to say that they are inaccurate is not true. Now, you could say the other

layers which are cell and tissue based and largely biology is conditional. So under a particular condition using high resolution data would give you really good data set. You could now say if I

have different what is the result? So there is a lot of in that space not &gt;&gt; so I have a question because I want to understand industrial mindset uh sir from uh Dr. this funding while we

recognize that uh uh AI is accelerating engineering biology as never before while investment in big AI infrastructure is important we are also focusing on uh small uh purpose-built

model to empower distributed innovations. So from industry perspective what you think government as a enabler can do few things immediately to get off the block fast.

&gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; So I think um as I said we need to work on all three areas research [singing] manufacturing and uh ecosystem work and uh if we have to build these next

generation models in India. I think as was already discussed, we need collaboration between [music] uh computer science people, biologists and the industry to work together to

make these happen because you need very large volumes of data and large volumes of compute to be building these models. So I think bringing everyone together and investing in these kinds of projects

with priority is I think the goal that we need to do and I know that DBT is kind of exploring these areas. &gt;&gt; Okay. Now as we are coming to the end and India team is forcing us to close

quickly. So may I respectfully respectfully invite Dr. Jan Kumar managing director direct to kindly come forward for the presentation of momento. Sir may I request you to kindly present

the moment to drill sir for his inspiring opening remarks and and continued leadership in advancing India's biology ecosystem. Thank you sir. [applause]

May I now request our Dr. Rajes Gogar to kindly present the momento to Dr. Anand is Despandes and also to our moderator Dr. Andraal to Mr. Sanjulus
