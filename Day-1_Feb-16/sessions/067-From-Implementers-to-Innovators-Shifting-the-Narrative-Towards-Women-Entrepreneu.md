## 📝 Transcript

a very good afternoon distinguished guests, respected dignitaries, esteemed speakers and dear delegates. Welcome to this special session at the India AI impact summit 2026.

On behalf of the BRICS Chamber of Commerce and Industry, it is my pleasure to welcome you to the panel discussion titled from implementers to innovators shifting the narrative towards women

entrepreneurship in AI. Before we begin, allow me to briefly introduce the institution behind this initiative. The BRICS Chamber of Commerce and Industry is a leading industry body working to

strengthen trade, investment, innovation, and policy dialogue among bricks and bricks plus nations. The chamber serves as a bridge between businesses, governments, and

institutions, fostering collaboration across sectors such as technology, energy, manufacturing, finance, and now increasingly digital transformation and artificial intelligence. Under India's

BRICS Presidency 2026, the chamber is committed to advancing future focus partnership, responsible innovation and inclusive economic growth across member nations. Within the chamber, the brick

CCI women empowerment vertical plays a pivotal role in promoting women led enterprises, leadership, development, global mentorship and crossber collaborations. Brick CCIV works

actively to act to to create platforms where women are not only participants in economic growth but leaders shaping it. Today's session is a reflection of that commitment. AI is redefining industries

at an unprecedented pace. However, the real transformation will happen when women move beyond being users and implementers of AI systems to becoming founders, innovators, policy makers and

investors in AI ecosystem. To formally commence the session, I now have the honor of inviting a visionary leader who has been the driving force behind Chamber's key initiatives. A

passionate advocate for youth empowerment and sustainable development. He has dedicated himself to creating platforms that inspire skill building, leadership and social responsibility.

His efforts extend to taking leadership roles in prestigious organizations, promoting governance and youth engagement and active involvement in national initiatives like Swatch Bharat

and Atman Bharbarat. Please join me in welcoming the vice chairman of Brick CCI, Mr. Samep Shastri to deliver the welcome address. May I please May I please have a huge round of applause.

Thank you. [applause] Distinguished guests, respected speakers, industry leaders and dear friends, good afternoon. It is my privilege to welcome

you all on behalf of Bricks Chamber of Commerce and Industry to the India Impact Summit 2026, the first day. The summit is a cauldron of ideas where innovation and leadership comes

together. Artificial intelligence is changing the way we work, learn and do business and solve global challenges. India today is in emerging as a strong voice in the

global AI ecosystem and the summit reflects our commitment to using this technology for inclusive and sustainable growth. As India takes on the bricks presidency in 2026, we do so with

futuristic and forward-looking vision under India's leadership. We aim to strengthen cooperation in technology, digital innovation, entrepreneurship and responsible AI development. We

believe that AI must not only be powerful, it must be inclusive. And that is why today's panel panel discussion from implement implementers to innovators. Shifting the

narrative towards women entrepreneurship in AI is so very relevant. Women should not only be users of AI tools. They should also be creators, founders, decision makers and leaders in AI

ecosystem. When women lead in technology, innovation becomes more balanced, ethical and impactful. I would like to sincerely thank Miss Ruby Sina, president of bricks CCI women

Good afternoon everyone. On behalf of the women's vertical of the bricks chamber of commerce and industry, I would like to extend a warm welcome to you and thank you for taking our time to

be a part of the panel. So when you talk about AI, AI is no longer a future technology. It's no longer a buzzword. It's it's it's totally in the infrastructure of the current landscape.

And because I have come from a communications background, I I'll take a quote from what uh Mr. Martin sir Martin Martin Sorel has talked about AI that the AI has navigated through the wow

phase of 2023 and the how phase of 2024 to the current phase where it is all about now that is the execution phase, the impact phase and that is what the summit is all about. And when we talk

about AI today as you're seeing the landscape has really changed for women in AI. For decades the narrative for us women was that you know we were just trying to get access access into the

room. But today it's all changed. Today women are no longer just the users the data points the algorithms the consumer. Today women women are going to shape the AI revolution. And we're increasingly

seeing the influence that women have. Now it's no longer about just finding a seat in the table. It's about designing the table itself and that's what we're going to focus here today in our

discussion. And while I'm talking about this, I just wanted to tell you a bit about what we've done at brick CCIV at the uh previous summit in Brazil during the bricks WBA plan plenary session

reneurship globally which is our effort our endeavor to create a global platform a collaborative platform to bring together women so that we mentor them and create a leadership pipeline

globally and uh this platform is something that we are actively working on and uh the entire focus is on women in future technologies and especially AI. Coming to the current summit you

know theme Sarvajan Haya Sravajan Sukya which means welfare for all and happiness for all and this is focuses on our honorable prime minister's vision of democratizing AI and when you talk about

democratizing AI without the gender equality parameter it's of no use. So this is a key focus of the summit here and we thank uh Matei for giving us this platform to take our discussion forward.

Our esteemed panel here today is very diverse. We also have one male representative to ensure the diversity quotient [laughter] and we've kept him right in the center so that nobody can

miss him. And so we have the founders, we have the investors, we have the policy experts and the disruptors and we look into an interesting deliberation amongst this imminent panel on the topic

that we've talked about over here from implementers to innovators shaping the narrative for women entrepreneurship in EI you know basically shifting the narrative more. So when I start off now

my first question is to Amita the tech entrepreneur amongst us here. She's Amita, you know, we're talking about shaping the AI revolution for women and things like that, but you've been a tech

entrepreneur. You can really give me a take on how this shift is happening, whether it's actually happening, whether we are still users of AI as women, more users, or we are actually moving towards

being entrepreneurs in the AI space. Over to you. &gt;&gt; Thanks, Ruby. So uh absolutely like you know it's an exciting uh time to be uh an entrepreneur today. Uh but numbers

wise like you know if we see today uh startups and MSMES about 20% of uh uh companies are led by women as founders or co-founders. So the number is still like you know like uh small but it is

growing like you know year on year. Uh now when we come to like you know the usage of AI across like you know many of these sectors and like you know by uh companies which are being headed by

women you'll see that there is a lot of AI that is already being adopted in many of these uh companies. So [snorts] if you uh look at like you know for example fintech like you know there are a lot of

companies who are looking at priority sector lending and so on like you know which are using AI algorithms in there. There are companies uh like you know looking at uh models like you know uh

for retail and retail tech uh you know whether it be in marketing whether it be in like you know like uh supply chain like you know and so on. Uh if I look at my own area like you know which is urban

development uh sustainability infrastructure and so on there's a lot that has already been happening uh with the usage of AI in these areas. So if you're looking at any of our smart

cities like you know they are actually indeed um while like you know we may say okay it's it's not like you know smart enough yet but uh you know at the core infrastructure level there is already a

lot of tech that is already uh there if you're looking at uh the safe cities and if you're from Delhi you'll see a lot of like you know these cameras which are around like you know the city so they

using uh surveillance algorithms like they're using like you know like incident detection algorithms like you know there are use cases where like you know things are being tracked and uh you

If there is a person of interest or an object of interest like you know those are being tracked on a regular basis. We also work a lot in let's say smart mobility. Uh in there like you know

there is a lot of like you know women led founders also like you know who are in uh running companies related to toll management systems like you know there are people uh there's a very interesting

like you know bus uh mobility card platform where like you know women are there. We are working on like you know uh um right now um a national like you know multi-lane free flow system again

like you know involving a lot of like you know like AI algorithms which are going to look at real time processing of uh vehicles as they are passing by so that the toll uh is processed

immediately without like you know you needing to stop at the toll plaza. So I think there is like you know interesting things interesting times and uh the number of women is low but it is growing

and uh you know um it will continue to grow hopefully with all the effort and um uh you know like uh u support that is being provided right now. &gt;&gt; Good to hear that you know and good to

see women like you shaping the AI revolution. Now when we talk about women entrepreneurship, regulation and entrepreneurship go hand in hand and you know uh the we have somebody here with

us Elva from uh Russia and when you talk about the global south she's one of the key figures in the AI regulatory ecosystem. So if you look at it Alva today's the AI impact summit that we are

having in India it's focused a lot around seven chakras and one of the important focus areas of the seven chakra is safe and trusted AI. So when you think from a regulatory perspective,

how important is it for women to be at the leadership level when it comes to making regulations for the AI sector? &gt;&gt; Okay, great question Rub. Thank you very much. Uh thank you participants for

coming. Thank you for speakers to be here with me. It's quite a pleasure to be here. Well, I do feel it's really critical uh for women to be um like uh to be on the leading role in regulation

and antics and I will explain why. Um um as you can see from my position I work uh in regulation and uh I know how it's going on in Russia and all over the world because I work in international

law as well. And um uh what I faced last year I had a project scientific project uh quite a big one international one we had more than uh 217 scientists on different fields also like on AI and

ethics at the same time [laughter] um and I faced the problem that uh the majority of scientists participated and contributed somehow to the project were 99% men and I was wondering why it

happened like this. I've never thought before that uh we had such problem in Russia because no one was speaking that uh we had problems with uh women entrepreneurship or with women in AI in

general or with women in IT in general. Yeah, I've never thought about it. And I started thinking like how it's really in Russia. And I started talking to my colleagues from every sector in AI, in

startups, uh in um big uh big techs in Russia, uh in in educational institutions, basically everywhere. And I happened uh to see that really the percentage of women it's like 8 8% in

the whole uh and uh I was wondering whether it's possible uh to create maybe a very large community for uh Russian AI women uh and especially for uh entpreneurship

women inter entrepreneurship in AI. So I'm thinking about it right now and want to uh work together with other countries uh from the global south but uh so that's why uh I came to that topic about

uh woman in AI and as as we are talking about safe and trusted AI this is very important because the whole world leading to trustworthy and whatsoever how we call it [gasps] and uh we happen

to live in the world uh where we train um our models on the very uh no no I can't say very uh like uh the data uh like collected 10 or 15 years ago. Yeah, the situation changes pretty fast. It's

constantly changing and we need to collect all the time new data where women uh like uh shows in different areas and their leading shows show their leading positions in that sectors. But

uh okay if uh the country uh can um collect this data. Yeah. But what we're talking about the countries from the global cells uh which came to that problem like uh five six years ago you

need to collect data for like five six years to train the model good so not to be abusive towards women. Yeah. So I I will say this word because I'm representing right now the um financial

institution and I know everything about credit scoring and other stuff and we know that uh um gender is also the feature included in in credit scoring of course among others among there are lots

of features included in credit scoring but uh one of them is gender and we need to fix this problem but to fix this problem we need to collect lots of data proven that uh world uh is going to

different direction right now and um it also concerns uh women uh in internship when they come for the loan. Yeah, it's like going to my next question. Uh so yeah it's really important um women to

be uh the part of uh legislation and ethics part of AI uh to close this gap in safe and trusted AI. Great great what you're talking about data sharing in the global south I think

that's a big concern for all countries and uh how we share the data amongst ourselves that's a key concern we are trying to create a database of women entrepreneurs in technology globally as

a chamber and I know that there's a lot of uh information that you cannot share and can share across countries but that's definitely come to the lone male panelist who's trying to I mean I'll

come to the easy question right now is the inaugural question. So you are an agentic AI entrepreneur and uh uh and you know agentic is the smartest AI model currently. So when you look at the

agentic AI landscape, how do you see women you know uh women entrepreneurs making their presence felt in in this space? &gt;&gt; Um firstly it's an honor to be the only

man on the panel. Um at the same time I'll also be very uh cautious about not telling women what they should do telling women I would rather talk about what we should we as men as founders as

initutions should but to answer your question Ruby founders I think women are already making their presence into AI space pretty well to answer your question I had the opportunity of mira

president of the US a couple of months Agility AI is pretty. I think one thing which she spoke to me about I had the opport one thing she spoke to me about was in India

involvement of women in AI like in data is much higher than some other countries which was which I read right before entering the room. I think one thing which she on the

scale to me about was women in India one thing which she spoke good to me about the scale of 1.91 you know the AI just just a little ahead of involvement of India 1.7 in terms of data is much

higher they're already doing a lot in some of the space for that matter which I read right was able to meet that on the scale Adam Lee who founder of 1.9 overall so

people are already doing too much it's around 1.7 in terms of the most popular already doing a lot of space for that matter. the CTO and I also was able to meet was a woman proven who is the

founder of &gt;&gt; it's about what next it's about what next [laughter] women are already doing too much if you know startup today which is open which

are women led in the AI space &gt;&gt; the CTO and the co-ounder was what's happening is women it's already women co-ounders especially &gt;&gt; it's about able to put in a lot of

context a lot of long-term you know meeting so many startups a lot of responsibility into the AI models or what's happening today. Um and why that is important is not just for women also

for the able to put in a lot of confidence lot of in some form or the other today responsibility influencing models today and decision making and why that is important not just if that

doesn't the right intent the right the right kind of responsibility some form or the other today the doision for the real and hence of the right intent the right context

the right kind of responsibility are on the will probably do more damage to us and it's an invite and hence I firmly believe that in terms of request to women out there that will probably

agent and it's an invite and a male friend of yours request to join them join hands with them and the space in the space that's what my thought if a male friend of yours or colleague is

building the name that you referred to that's what my thought is can you name me the biggest Everybody say this but if you look at it the names that you refer to

and when I ask the all nobody will talk about co-ounder who happens so you know that's how it is nobody will talk about co-ounder who happens to be a woman so you know that's how it is but we are

that's my you never that's my next question to you as an investor I'll Right now we had been to Brazil and we saw economies. We had been to Brazil very similar to India

very strong relationships very similar to India. So when you look at very strong relationships at the entire you look at in terms of collaboration crosser collaboration how

like yours can come together can come together impact of women scalable impact for women in AI. &gt;&gt; Good afternoon everyone. Good afternoon everyone.

&gt;&gt; It's really great to be here. It's really great to be here. &gt;&gt; Well, right now right now very special special morning for AI collaboration collaboration between countries because

I don't know if you guys are aware but this week we are going to have President Lula here and he's bringing the largest commercial and diplomatic delegation to Asia and this will be a great

opportunity for to meet in person. We are going to have over 200 business leaders here. So you can meet them at the hall and discuss you know the possibility whatever industry because I

I see a full spectrum that we could collaborate from female health from the creative economy that is in agriculture there are many possibilities that we can collaborate and this delegation is

coming here also they're going to inaugurate a permanent office here aex Brazil is the agents that really promotes Brazilian uh trade globally. So from now on

because I I always see our countries are underexplored. We we know little about each other and uh our trade is considered is small $15 billion and can be so much more but we

have to reach out and I really believe you know this initiative right now of the Brazilian government of coming here and having a physical office is going to be a gamecher for women and for men. So

really the possibility of business is is endless and that's way I see that we need to start talking each other knowing about our economies and saying where can we uh develop more business like for the

creative economy. So your industry here you are the largest producer in the world and Brazil is the largest hub in Latin America. So together we are 1.6 6 billion market that is very little

explored. That's why I really uh give would like to give you know the incentive go and meet the Brazilian delegates and also if you don't have a chance please go to the office aex

office and uh and talk to them. So I really believe that's the what we need most is the reach out to each other and we are also launching right now um a new artistic residency called AI residency

in Rio for uh young female creators to produce verticals using AI and we're really hoping know India is going to be part of this and some more countries from the global south and we are very

excited now to talk more about it at the end if you are interested. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Great. Great. I think a lot of women can be a part of this residency in the creative

industry space. In fact, we as brick CCI we also Najila if you're aware we are in talks with SER to in work closely in the MSME and theme space for women entrepreneurs because I think the

biggest challenge lies there not with the bigger startups. Now over to Shivani here. Shivani has you know she she does a very interesting thing she actually works with the younger generation on

embibing this entire love for technology and Shivani if you look about the numbers uh of course when you look overall it looks there like there's a lot of women in technology in India for

example our numbers in STEM education are 43% globally around 22% women are in AI but when you look at the numbers moving from uh you know there there is the the gleeking

tap you know women join the uh join the join the industry but most of them don't become entrepreneurs I don't know how many of us really encourage our daughters to go on and become

entrepreneurs the first thing we'll tell her is go and work for an entrepreneur in a big company but how many of us really encourage them to become an entrepreneur so Shivani my question to

you is you as think startup are working on a lot of youth ideans and college youth ideatons and you're working with the younger generation where do to see you know what what is it about the

mindset of these women that you feel the young girls are they really looking at entrepreneurship in tech as a career or I mean I just want your viewpoints &gt;&gt; hello

yeah thank you so much Ruby for that uh for having me here on this panel and bringing this uh really important uh topic to the forefront So uh we uh for the last 5 years we have

been running um pan India innovation entrepreneurship competition which runs at school and college level and let's start with the good news. uh year on year we have been seeing increasing

participation from girls and increasingly uh tech ideas tech first AI first uh this year ideas coming from girls this year in fact we hit about 45% participation so that's a really great

number um the other thing we see with girls who are building very confidently with tech today is that they're very purpose-driven right they are not limiting their thinking to traditional

industries they are looking at glo global problems. They're looking at national problems, local problems. Um in fact uh in this youth hideathon some of the uh girls ideas which really stood

out which were very tech first, very AI first. Uh we have uh we had a eighth grader who's building a variable device for the elderly driven by what she sees as a struggle from her uh with her

grandparents. Then there there are two girls from Merritt who got fed up with the whole air pollution um challenge and said why aren't we doing anything and they have created a bio decomposting

solution which can be spread on fields using drones and uh is actually going to improve soil quality and you know stop this crop burning issue. So absolutely inspiring. Um then there were uh there

were four girls from uh Tamil Nadu who um have created a prototype for a cow shed cleaner like that's a really local problem but here are girls very confidently coming from all parts of

India and coming uh you know taking up embracing AI embracing technology and building so what's missing is the missing middle and how we as uh you know the people who are kind of shaping this

in the next 12 months how do How do we take those girls who are dreaming and building today and how do we create the ecosystem to allow them to become the female entrepreneurs of tomorrow. Great

great Shivani. I think it's so optimistic to hear you know all this uh good news. So uh in fact there was a recent news report also about uh you the entrepreneurship is moving from the

metros to the rural areas now. So it's no longer that it moves from the metro. It's no longer the hub and spoke model only. My next question to you women because all of us here are talking about

that women are very interested in becoming entrepreneurs but somewhere uh you know somewhere there is a gap there's a leaking pipeline as I told so uh you are also an investor and when you

put on your investor's hat and you look at a startup be it a woman run startup or a you know or a male run startup let's talk about it as a startup what are the factors that you look at and

what is it that you look at which makes you feel that this startup is there for the long run. Obviously, as an investor, you won't invest because it's a women run startup. So, what are the key things

that you're looking at when you're looking at a startup, be it a male or a female run, so that we can avoid uh stumbling more. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, this one I would want to

answer just as an investor, not not thinking it's a women led or a &gt;&gt; uh but I but I'll also answer you to your question that what do I find good in women led uh you know startups. So I

I'll start with the later one first. So what I find good in women startups is a lot of times women startups focus on durability much more than the noise. Uh which means there might be trends

shifting and and still uh women founders will stick to their real goal and and the real problem. They are actually very clear on the problem statement which they're trying to solve. That's

something which I really like about u you know women women founders or women led startups. But something which I'm very keen on looking at startups is is more of proof um you know proof over

valuations that uh you know are you are you chasing a valuation are you chasing something which is probably unrealistic and just probably synthetically created um that is one and when I say proof I'm

I also want proof in terms of numbers that that can be as good as doing a small pilot right and and I will I will also accept here that a lot of times women led founders have been able to do

it much better Um because they are okay to have those first 100 users validate them, understand their pain, you know pain points and deliver again and again optimizing the solution to those 100

users and end up becoming the uh the to the go-to you know product. That is one important thing. Second um you know is of course not pivoting a lot on the basis of you know feedback because

pivoting a lot also shows lack of um focus or or lack of focus towards the problem which I previously mentioned. Third um don't run behind valuations uh run behind revenues and for some

reasons I've also found women founders doing that pretty well. they've been able to get that early revenues uh that can be as good as probably as low as $1,000 but they've been able to crack

that and a lot of times I mean I end up meeting founders who have a valuation of like a few hundred million and not even having a sale of $100 right just because they have a novelty of a technology so

these are you know particularly a few things that I look at of course you know in the end there are those common things such as the team so of course just because you're a women founder doesn't

mean you know means that you will get money you have to be the right fit of the team. You need to be building the right product at the right time. There has to be validation of your product.

There has to be numbers that show that your product is somebody's going to use it. Have you identified who is going to pay for it? Users and customers are different. Right? A lot of people use

chat jubility today. Don't not all of them pay for it. Right? So these are a few things which I focus on. Uh I believe I've answered your question. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I agree. Just one quick question

to Elvid on what he's saying. uh you know and and speed talking to you you know women I was feeling why is it that after an investor is saying that we women are so much better when it comes

to all the qualities that you're mentioning we still are still not getting all the funds Amita and Shivani you need to send all your women startups to him okay [laughter] so Elva I mean

you you are from a financial institution what is it that organizations like you can do to improve the scene scenario better for women in terms of creditf free loans because a lot of collateral

issues are with women and in terms of incentives etc. &gt;&gt; Okay. Uh well uh when we're talking about funds and getting funds for startups I guess women and men are on

the same uh level here I guess but in Russia I'm judging by Russia but I guess in global south the situation is quite different and I understand why because I do I I do know and I do believe that in

global south uh countries they still use but please correct me if I'm wrong um like for uh as a cor as a they use as a collateral. Yeah. Uh I don't know maybe the property or other assets and uh

historic only uh like men possessed it. Yeah. And here comes the question to historic data uh which is used for training um models. Yeah. But uh if we're talking about how we change it uh

and uh go straight from the traditional banking system to the like uh modern opportunities for inter for entrepreneurs uh and women in particular uh for instance in spar bank we have

bear accelerator uh 500 plus we call it and each year um startups doesn't matter who owns it women or men they can imply uh for funds. They show uh what they

offer. Yeah. Uh by uh creating this startup they show their results uh for like several months of working and what do they expect uh to get uh in six months or in a year. Uh they participate

in some competitive um um uh assignments. Yeah. from Spear Bank and in the end during Moscow Startup Summit uh they received their uh how to say their funds yeah according

to uh their needs and uh they participate of all people as I said men women so it doesn't matter so we don't have that that criteria and also we have uh in Russia we have Skolkava innovation

institution skola foundation we call it this way and if uh startups start with this Kolkova foundation they can easily get funds doesn't matter on their agenda so um um what what I want to say that uh

if we're talking about how it is easier to get funds we need to go to the banks which provide some uh sort of uh programs as I mentioned in bear bank so it will be easier for startups to get

funds or Maybe governmental institutions. Yeah, maybe uh governments uh should create special policies for um entrepreneur interpreneurs. &gt;&gt; Thanks. Thanks. Great. Great. You know

Amitriita uh there's just a point on this because you are from the sustainability space and it's increasingly becoming a big mandate globally sustainability and climate uh

aspects. So uh how do you feel women founders can scale up their businesses in this space especially in the AI? &gt;&gt; Absolutely. uh like you know Ruby I think uh uh when we are looking at the

planet and the cities and the ecosystems that we live in like you know it's really important to uh design solutions like you know for the planet as a whole but also if I may just add like you know

one lens like you know that uh we often don't design solutions with women citizens or women users in mind right like you know we're designing for uh the average and uh like you know we're

designing in general and not inspecific like you know the way women and children like you know use for example our cities and our infrastructure. So I'll give you a couple of examples of like you know

how uh for example like you know when we were designing uh safe city in Noa uh the whole idea is to create a digital twin of the city and to look at for example all the uh black spots or like

you know the hotspots where incidents are happening uh lay that with like you know information about like you know where are the road networks like you know where is the public transportation

like you know where what else like you know needs to be done to create it into a holistic like you know city-led system and solution so that [snorts] women are safe there is better lighting on those

streets where like you know lighting needs to be better there is better connectivity and public transport on the streets where like you know it is required. Uh again if we are looking at

like you know traffic and mobility planning um you know uh there's a very interesting concept called trip chaining right so uh so women like you know so when we are designing like you know um

uh traffic systems we actually look and we do studies and we look at what is the peak traffic what is the congestion like you know uh uh like you know coefficient and so on and like you know based on

that you're looking at your adaptive traffic systems like like where are signal uh uh signals being placed like you know what is the signal frequency and timing and so on but you're putting

that lens of women moving in the city, right? And women for example like you know uh I was uh talking about this concept of trip chaining that for example they uh do a lot of short hop

trips in a city uh it might be to drop a child to school to like you know do their groceries to take like you know their u elderly in the family to uh some place nearby and so on. So when you're

looking at uh you know we looked at data from um uh like you know this is u uh crowdsource data from uh um uh some of the right sharing companies you're able to look at like you know what those

movement patterns are which are different from like you know the movement patterns for example which are happening at like you know specific um time of the day or day of the week and

so on. So you can use like you know interesting things to build solutions for women and [snorts] again like you know from a policy lens like you know uh there is a lot that is happening but uh

what we need is like you know a larger procurement come policy lens where government buyers because government is the buyer in this case are like you know telling u you know the um municipalities

or the companies to actually bring in this lens when we are designing these solutions. &gt;&gt; Great. Thanks. Thanks. We are running out of time I think. So, so uh my next

question to you Najila is uh you are working on creating this ecosystem through your EI residency program and all. So why do you feel it's very important beyond funding and credit

lines to get the softer skills uh there for women to become truly successful entrepreneurs? Well, as we know women the access the skills is very important of course but

also what I feel that is lucky more for us is the capital we really need to get the funds and um and this particular air rio that we are planning in a way that women they are

going to have you know their IP they're going to have their shorts or a first episode of a serious and we are also going to put them to the next level. It's not just okay you are have this

residency and then it's over. No, you need to have that peers network. So from here you are meeting producers, you are meeting distributors and you are going to understand how we can use AI

to really make the best of your film because AI literally is quite important and of course it's very new but people in reality they are not using to the max and that's the way we feel that is going

to give them okay you're going to use this tool that is going to make your film from your product that is going to be very high quality and it's not just going to stop here. We're also going to

give you you know the possibility to continue your career because women in this I'm talking particularly in the audiovisisual so they get to the middle career and they stop there

&gt;&gt; for most case it's very difficult you know to go to the next level and they stop and sometimes they even give up completely &gt;&gt; and uh and the other thing like

institutes that I work for we are our mission is really to prepare leadership because when you prepare leaders they are going to multiply they are going to hire more women and the leadership is

going to multiply more and more so that is very important that you just don't give the skills you have to go beyond &gt;&gt; yeah true true so skills are also very important and increasing this women in

the top that's what you're talking about the leadership numbers is very important in fact we at brick CCI where we also do a global women leadership mentoring program focusing on this aspect. Uh

Shivani, one quick one policy change that you feel would really encourage women to become more of AI entrepreneurs in the next uh 12 months, 24 months, whatever timeline you're looking at.

What is it that you want from the summit here? uh uh increase the pipeline of uh women coming in aspiring to be entrepreneurs which means interventions at school and college level uh pathways

to take uh innovative ideas out into the real market access to market and also top down uh some very specific vertical focused innovation challenges places where we want India to be to be shining

we want to be at the you know global edge of AI uh something like what we are working with the bricks vi as well a vertical focused innovation challenge open it up to India we are very creative

people uh we will come up with solutions and then incubate those solutions uh to uh to create a really thriving AI economy great now we are running short of time so I'll just quickly ask each of

you to give one line of advice to aspiring women entrepreneurs in the AI space over to you Amriita &gt;&gt; thank you so much Ruby so I think uh like you know uh obviously the most

important thing is skilling and uh education but also learning the context because the solution resides in the context and AI is as useful as like you know the depth of the context to which

it understands and applies to. So um yeah &gt;&gt; I have &gt;&gt; for Elva because you have moved from a different role to the AI role from DPO

from a data protection officer what is that one technical skill that women require to move make that change to the AI role? All of us need to be adaptive to what's going on around us, especially

if we're talking about technology and AI. But what I want to advise women who who are in internship right now or they want to go there, uh pay um if you want to go to EI, uh you need to pay

attention at large language models because AI agentic is everything. And uh if you want to create good startup you you need to be aware of this and to be professional in the sphere. It doesn't

mean you need to be like the the coder. No you know but you need to understand how it works. That's for sure. &gt;&gt; Great women. One line of advice for women entrepreneurs to get more

monies from you aspiring women entrepreneurs. &gt;&gt; One piece of &gt;&gt; Yeah. I have one piece of advice for um um for

men out there. Uh I think we should stop supporting women and rather fix systems. Uh they are doing good on the table already. Let them let them lead. That's one. To the women out there, you don't

need permission to lead in AI. Uh we need what we are what you guys are building. Build more. Uh the capital is out there. The support is out there. Just go out and build.

&gt;&gt; Great. Najila, one line. I would say for women do not think what AI can do for their career but what their career can do for AI and keep human and inclusive is very important.

&gt;&gt; Shivani over to you. &gt;&gt; Uh for women it is just uh shed any limiting beliefs that you have um and don't wait until you feel you're ready.

Just build and take your ideas into the world. With that I want to thank the panelists for a very insightful discussion and before Ankita comes here to give the board of thanks. Just one

line from us from the V vertical there's a very famous saying as you told you know one famous advice for women is you have to decide whether you want to be a thermometer or a thermostat in the room

whether you want to really just measure the temperature or you want to create and control the temperature or be the change. So it's up to us to decide what we want to be in the larger narrative

and thank you to everyone here for being a great audience. Over to you Yashika. Thank you so much to our wonderful panelists for your insightful addresses. Now taking uh over the thermostat of the

room may I please invite Miss Ankita Saj joint director brick CCI to deliver a vote of thanks. Good afternoon everybody. I had couple of things in mind to speak up but

because of the posity of time I'll keep it as brief as possible. So be the change as Ruby said I'll extend my sincere appreciation and gratitude to the government of India for its

continued vision and commitments towards strengthening India's AI ecosystem. It's unbelievable how these four days that are there in the pipeline, how our government of India has focused and

implemented the minutest of the things altogether. I extend my heartfelt gratitude to our vice chairman Mr. Sam Shastri who's always there as a guiding light and thank you for his continued

guidance and a special thanks to our moderator Ruby SA president of woman vertical. Her never say die attitude never dies for sure. Her vision and dedication curated this impactful

session. Her commitment to advancing women entrepreneurship continues a strong and global platform for change. I would like to I would like to uh sincerely thank our esteemed panelist

Miss Amit Chadri, Miss Elvira Chache, Mr. Bibbin Babu, Miss Najila and Miss Shivani Kapoor Singh for sharing their valuable insights, experiences and global perspectives.

I would also like to place on record my appreciation for the entire brick CCI team whose hard work behind the scene made this session seamless and successful. Your dedication,

coordination and commitment are deeply valued. Finally, thank you to the wonderful audience for your engagement and thoughtful participation with gratitude and optimism for continued

collaboration. I conclude this session. Thank you for a very wonderful day. Thank you so much. [applause] With this, this is Brick CCI, Bricks Chamber of Commerce and Industry signing

off for today. Thank you so much for being a lovely audience. [clears throat] What? capitalized.
