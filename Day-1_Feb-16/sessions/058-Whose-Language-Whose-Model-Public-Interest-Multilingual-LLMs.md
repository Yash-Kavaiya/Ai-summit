## 📝 Summary

LLM development is critical to the public interest in the Global South, yet decisions about their development and use remain concentrated in the Global North. This workshop brings together global civil society, NLP researchers, and technologists to inform responsible LLM development globally. The AI Summit hosted in India this year offers a timely opportunity to convene groups that often work in isolation and to advance questions of language access and global AI governance, including systems.
