## 📝 Transcript

We're delighted to be here today for this session. Uh my name is Amir Benfatimi. uh my uh job is chief responsible officer at company called Cognizant and we're super excited about

this discussion today which is about really AI for inclusive economic progress aligned with the theme of this summit but also try to attempt to discuss what we call the public services

AI stack we'll know about the stack of AI and today we're going to talk about evolution of this stack together as a group uh in fact um this story started about 10 years ago where a conjunction

of events happened. In 2015, the United Nation came with this new approach called the sustainable development goals. At the same time, AI started coming out of the labs and being more

present. And this culture did lead to something that we call today for good. But this afro good gradually grew over the years and all the companies all the NOS's and all the institutions and

policy makers took a close look at it and started thinking about how we can implement AI for the good of people for the common good for the public and led to this evolution of a number of

applications and examples and demonstration and pilots about how AI can be used for the good of humanity. At the same time, a increase of AI systems have developed very rapidly mostly uh

for productivity and commercializations and the scale of AI has gone so fast that probably we have a chance to talk about how this rapid pace is basically benefiting people as well beyond the

opportunities for commercializations and productivity gains but also the stack that we're talking about the infrastructure that we're building is basically serving those uh that uh that

goal. So today we're gathered today to talk about really what it means to build sustainable infrastructure that could help people and create services that governments, communities can provide to

their citizens and constituents in a manner that could be not only guaranteed, accountable, sustainable and transparent, but also built on a foundational that on foundation of

digital public goods and infrastructure that could be governed that could be sustained and could be respectful of cultures, communities and the wishes of people and as we talk about sovereign AI

these days sovereignty is important for governments but also one of the questions that what is important for individuals for every citizen how the citizen can benefit from it individually

and separately so we're delighted together to be today uh with each other and then have this conversation I'm going to introduce from far left uh our speakers and you can see their pictures

on the on the on the on the uh on the screen uh I'm going to start not on the screen but on the order over there. So on far left Al Peshaw is the managing director of atriup police

standards and he may talk a little bit about what they do. Uh next you have uh uh Gabriela Ramos who's head of the task force on always forget digital inequalities

uh but former uh assistant director general of the UNESCO until recently and then Joanna Shields who is the CEO of a company called precognition but also executive chair of the responsible

foundation uh Mark Surman who's the president of Modzilla uh talking about open source of course professor Ravin ran an which I have the pleasure to have known uh

recently but he's not only head of data science and and AI at IIT Madras but also he's chairing a number of issues including the center for responsible India and final but not last Weli who's

the director of uh information incom authority media authority in Singapore INDA to join us today uh we have prepared a lot of questions uh for you and to discuss but maybe it will

simplify some of them because we are running short of time. Hopefully we can give me a second please so I can bring those questions back to you. But I would like to start with

maybe uh starting with Gabriela talk about if we talk about benefiting people and creating infrastructure to benefit people from the far end of this conversation. What is that we should

absolutely not forget about that could be missed if we forget about that? Can you start us with that? &gt;&gt; Well, thank you. Thank you so much and so nice to be with these wonderful

speakers. &gt;&gt; I think the microphone is not working. &gt;&gt; It's not working. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. [laughter] That was good. Uh well no it's a it's I

think that the question is is is is really not about AI the question is about what is the context in which this transition is happening and it's a context as you know

with very high inequalities inequalities that are there independent of AI inequalities in terms of income opportunities outcomes for people and we see it not only in developing the

developing world that is still confronting uh many social challenges but also in the advanced economies and therefore the AI transition is not happening in a vacuum and actually is

contributing to increase inequalities because it's highly concentrated two countries producing the major foundational models um in English particularly

uh and and the global south we are takers of technology users of technology u it's good that we now how open source and that we can also frame the the models in a way that is suited for us.

So I feel that we need to consider that as a very important framing of the issue because at the end the governments need to govern AI but they also need to govern with AI and therefore they are

the enablers they are the ones that need to be ensuring connectivity when there is one-third of the world that has no access to stable internet they need to be doing the investments in skills and

these are huge challenges they need to be producing the incentives because they cannot do it by themselves. So they can use the procurement systems probably to ensure that the companies are also

investing in their people. So I feel uh we have these all frameworks that need to be put together to deliver a much more inclusive uh outcomes. Just think about one single issue that is so

incredive because it's not only the pervasiveness of the transition but it's also the very fast speed. When I started working at the OECDM, we were looking at what kind of jobs were going to be

transformed uh disappear from the from the er markets thanks to the technologies and we were just looking at those that could have uh their task codified the clerical jobs. Now we're in

GI everybody's going to be touched and the transition is so fast. How do we adapt the social protection systems? And therefore, I feel that all of these investments is not only about the

financial issues, but is the adapting the systems in a way that deliver for people. &gt;&gt; Uh I would like to ask uh I would like to go to Joanna, but before I would like

to ask Professor Rabi, the title is called Ayafu inclusive economic progress. what does economic inclusive economic progress means in practice. &gt;&gt; So I mean I completely agree with what

Capella said. So I mean we're talking about inclusive economic progress especially I I mean I'll talk about the country I know best about India right so it's not the question of AI enabling

inclusive economic progress there is already a significant digital divide that exists in this country. So when you're going to start talking about inclusive economic progress, we really

have to go down to that level and start addressing that. And uh and you know, so it's not just a question of economic progress. Economic progress comes from a whole bunch of

other things like making sure you have better access to health, better access to education. And so there are so many layers at which AI can potentially help as long as you're making sure that you

know you get past the uh you know the digital access barrier and which is something that uh you know we should take a fresh look at. I mean you you mentioned about few countries that are

AI producers and the global south or AI consumers. In fact most of global north also is a or AI consumers right now. So there are like literally four people in the world who control the direction of

AI and and in some sense is that the right direction for for us when you start we start talking about inclusive economic progress should it be something that is predicated on using uh uh you

know the frontier model uh to build our entire AI infrastructure on it's not clear to me right so I think we really have to step back and start thinking about what is the right AI stack so that

we can start talking about deployment at the you know at the population scale in a country like India right should it be you know the next greatest uh you know the GPT model or whatever is coming out

or should it be something more you know local focus you know at least server has been in the news recently for a lot of these smaller models that they are building that are very good at solving

India specific problems I think there should be significant rethink as to what is the right AI stack for the global south to ensure economic progress &gt;&gt; thank you for that uh setting

uh and we're going to go to the Azac but before I had a question from from Joanna. You have a very vantage interesting vantage point being in government and private sector and now

with the uh responsible foundation. In your opinion, what have been the decisions and investment that we have done so far in the past 5 to 10 years that you think create dependencies that

we cannot reverse? &gt;&gt; I could hear the last part. What are the investments and decisions that we have made that create dependencies that we cannot reverse today?

&gt;&gt; Dependencies. &gt;&gt; Sorry, I have a back. &gt;&gt; She has an infection ear infection. So, sorry I share that information. &gt;&gt; So, um okay. So, first of all, before we

start, can I ask the audience a question? How many people in this audience are entrepreneurs using AI to build software products? Quite a few. And how many of you guys are in um

public sector? Okay, it's about evenly split. So for those of you in the in the um the camp that are building these AI products, how many of you guys have witnessed the

incredible transformation in the last couple of months in terms of capabilities both in the the the foundational models um proprietary ones, but also in the open- source side. So I

think what we're witnessing here, it's almost kind of like Mark, [laughter] we're we're at a stage now where um things so have so dramatically changed that the we have to look at this from

and going back to what Gabriella was saying, we have to look at this not just as you know what can we do to deliver better services in government. We need to look at it like you know as a massive

economic opportunity for all these young entrepreneurs. So having been on both sides been in government and also in private sector building these products it's absolutely vital at this stage to

activate the entrepreneurs and the network of people in the country. And the reason I I want to say that here is because if we're going to have AI diffuse to the global south, the AI that

we build has to represent the cultures, the language, the characteristics, the the people we are in in every country that we live in. And that's the role you're all playing here is such a vital

role. So as a government person, I would say, you know, almost throw the playbook away and think about how do you build those services with entrepreneurs that solve real problems in your country and

advance, you know, empowerment and create economic opportunity. And I think it I mean, Amir, your question was what are what's been changing? What are the dependencies? But it's actually changed

so much in the last couple months that my answer is changing. I mean because all the bestlaid plans every government has an AI strategy and an economic you know plan but almost you if you think

about the progress recently you have to you have to almost re reinvent this on a daily basis. Now when you get to the next stage of of applications where human outcomes are impacted things like

health and um disaster relief and all these other applications, it's a different you know type of decision. It takes more time. You have to take more care. Um you know you're using people's

private data. So there's all kinds of considerations there. But on this basic level of citizen services, the daily things that you go to government for, that's a huge opportunity for

entrepreneurs in every country around the world. &gt;&gt; Well, you're putting the stakes uh in front of all of us and really high. But to meet that stakes, this if public

services that you're defining to benefit people everywhere and solve the real problems are are important, what is the architectural uh standing for that? what is the the the stack that we need to

define the typical stack that is a very technical stack which infrastructure and data and models and applications but uh I would like to turn to al pesh to help us uh maybe have a uh interesting

viewpoint on how do you see this tax evolving and how what's the role of standards to make the stack trustworthy because we're building all as entrepreneurs and researchers and

activists and policy makers to new services and the new services are based on a mechanism of a stack that is agreed upon for everyone technically speaking. How do you see this stack evolving?

Uh sorry air amir we were playing with the microphones here trying to get the right one but uh if I &gt;&gt; should I repeat the question or &gt;&gt; uh if I understood the question

correctly uh it was about where do we see the opportunities to enable economic development across uh existing infrastructure

and in particular when applying AI technologies in a more stackbased approach. Is that right? &gt;&gt; And specifically the fact that we're defining that the opportunity for

entrepreneurs and all resources everywhere is that we define services that benefit people and society. It requires an infrastructure and in this structure. Is it the same stack that

we've been using or there's a new stack needs to emerge? &gt;&gt; Yeah. So it's a good question. I I think first maybe a disclaimer. All opinions here are my own. So you know I won't say

I'm speaking for my entire organization here. Uh the second is um I think the way I'm thinking about what you're describing uh may be slightly different because first a lot of what

we're we're discussing at the moment you know India's already implemented from a India stack perspective right I mean you look at they have the NCI they have ADA they have all these pieces are there and

they're doing it using a distributed governance model right And this is also an example of standardization and it's a mechanism to also think about how future deployments can occur without

necessarily needing control over everything. I would add now to this that there are several uh additional elements uh personally I would take into account.

The first is that when we're talking about the AI stack, I think everyone at over here uh realizes the value of good governance. Incredibly important. Uh it's very

critical to ensure that we have uh not only the right contextual people at the table. Uh but that on an ongoing basis there's an assessment occurring of those systems so that the biases don't

overtake. Right? I mean this is a part of the a natural occurrence. You get so used to something, the norms become a part of your attune thinking. Along with this, I would say that when I

think of the stack, I'm thinking about it as a distributed model. And therefore, it's not only a public utility that may work in one city. It's a distributed technology that

interconnects across multiple cities. Open source plays a critical role here because open source provides agency and open standards give you the norms to support that to occur. Directions with

the tools give you now a better chance. And when you look at this from the element then of what more could a stack like this offer beyond the analytics and forecasting of how trash from one place

to another could be applied. It's the ability to enable the utilization of policies, procedures already implemented at the base level of a fabric.

Let me ask everyone a question here. How many of you have time to read through an 11,000page document to come up to speed of what needs to be done so that you can be compliant within

your country? &gt;&gt; Nobody. &gt;&gt; Nobody. He got it. Nobody has this time. Even with AI, when you combine all the policies, you

combine all the standards, you combine all the readme codes, this is the tax you're putting on people. And we have to stop doing that. we have to start thinking about is how do we

enable these stacks so that people don't have to go learn all of these other the opportunity cost is too high the barriers are too high the systems need to work in a manner that enable and

encourage and what you could imagine happens when you do something like this is that you can take the same the same incubator uh stage flow that others use and start to use it as a way to certify

folks around stage gates right across this fabric. But what becomes extra interesting is now if you can see here are all the actors in this room that are working on the same problem you're

working on. That's an advantage. That gives you an opportunity to begin to think about, hey, do I need to continue investing in this or can we figure out a way to do this differently? So you're

saying the stack needs to include standards and needs to have some form of uh &gt;&gt; I I'm saying the stack needs to offer the real benefits of what

standardization provides which is lowers barriers to entry which able enables greater trade and economic development. Open source plays a critical role in this. It helps reduce a lot of the

concerns. It reduces vendor lockin. At the same time open standards play a critical role that to go along with it. But these are all tools. The critical mechanism is enabling the environment

that's conducive to inclusion and development. In the end, &gt;&gt; you're you're you're so right. We're going to talk about investment also because uh you need to put fuel to to

work. But I want to turn to Mark because we talk about openness and open source and transparency. Uh you have an opinion about that Mark, I'm sure, about this public AI stack.

Um well so many opinions but I I I think the the key piece in all this is to rem to remember that we have a huge opportunity that is not abstract. I think exactly as Joanna said, I feel it

the the cards have really been thrown up in the air in some ways that are a little bit scary but also very exciting in the last little while and that we can solve problems and build things so much

faster now than we could when we first started talking about a lot of the DPI stacks, you know, that we've talked about in the last 10 years. And and so then how does that relate to how do we

use these technologies today to create real public services that benefit people? Because I think that's at the heart of the question you're asking. And and I would say for me one of the

key principles in it is as we move fast to innovate as we put significant amounts of government money and effort into using AI and other cutting edge technologies for public services. We

have to ground ourselves in the idea that public services need to be based on and build public goods. That public dollars need to produce public goods. if I put public dollars in. So that's not

actually a very complicated or new concept, but it's very easily lost if we're talking about billions and billions and billions of whatever currency you're investing in going into

national AI strategies, sovereign AI strategies, public service strategies, making sure that we produce public goods. And I just I want to say two things that are very practical

underneath that. One is we actually have a way to create digital public goods. It's already been mentioned right now and open source is a proven way to do that. It's a proven licensing method to

do that. You put money in, anyone can use it. You build something, anyone can modify it, anyone can use it. So we have a way to do that and even industry knows that. I mean all of the cloud providers,

all of the big dominant hyperscalers contribute to the Linux ecosystem and so much more because they know if the underlying infrastructure is a public good, it makes industry go faster. It

makes things cheaper for them. It makes things robust. So I think the first thing we need to remember is let's build these new public goods these new public services on the base layer whether it's

the the underlying base layer of of the Linux stack or whether it's open source AI let's make sure that is open source and that's public goods and just demand that expect that of our governments that

that's how they spend money that's what they choose but I think then the other piece you're really getting at Amir is the the services stack above that which really is fruit ripe for innovation on

education on health care on transportation on so many aspects of what our governments rightfully are responsible for in our societies there's so much chance to innovate in

that and that also needs to be public goods and interestingly we don't have a good track record of that as humanity we were great at industry building these public goods to run the tech industry

but it always ends up in being these quite small and I think the India stack is a counter example that does mostly get to the end services layer mostly small boutique commercial players and

maybe not always boutique that dominate in health care in education in public services. We need to take the chance that we have to build new exciting things fast in the services that are at

the top of the stack that we need as citizens as countries and make those open source as well. And by doing that then Canada where I'm coming from India Germany South Korea anywhere we can go

fast together in building better public services uh with AI. In my other role as a past investor, when I talk to entrepreneurs, uh they either don't say it or are shying away

from public service terminology because it's not cool or because something that governments have to do and we are not basically innovating and I think I like what you said about the

innovation the service layer is critical today because it creates so much wealth and value that we have not seen it and not understand it. uh maybe to illustrate we're going to go to two

examples one in Singapore one in India. Maybe ones you can talk about uh how you basically create this framing and environment right to test those ideas uh in Singapore in a safe manner and how

this translate into value uh not only as typical public good but really services that benefit people and create value and maybe professor Ravi can also follow with what India has done which is also

uh extremely interesting. Thanks Amir. That's a big question. Yeah, I I'll see where I can maybe more specifically focus on certain areas. I actually absolutely agree with all of my

fellow p panelists what you've highlighted you know the need to invest in public good and the need to invest in public services you know and where how do we bring AI into this um I think

maybe instead of talking about broad concepts maybe I'll just bring down to the individual right how how do individuals in Singapore for example and how can public services benefit them

individually um or how can AI benefit them individually so they could also be able to be part of this inclusive economic progress. I think individuals need to feel that they are not left

behind. I think that's important. So I can use the public service maybe as an example. I'm I'm in the public service. Um so I hope the money that uh that uh that goes to my salary actually

translate into public good to uh Mark's point. Um but let's look at what public service have done so far in Singapore with regards to AI. um public my colleagues in in public service actually

use AI quite a lot nowadays right um for example in the ministry of education um um colleagues are building using AI to build tools to help students look for self-directed learning right so that's

one way in which they are creating with AI to benefit uh students to benefit in education uh for more mundane things they are using AI to write speeches for ministers and for their bosses uh

translates into some kind of productivity gain, but also to summarize meeting notes and so on. It's a way for them to feel that they could use this tool effectively to help them in the

jobs and they can be part of that progress and being be included, right, in in the development. Um they're using AI to build chat bots, right? Uh augmenting it with documents and data

from the public service so that they can better address citizen queries, right? That they're accurate, reliable, um and actually give the right answers, right? Um so these are all examples of

how the public servants individuals have embraced the technology to actually bring about public good. So this is one element of the public um services tech stack that I want to talk about human

capital development training and skills that is required and if you then think about how you translate this what's happening in the public service in public servants individually and

translating this into the broader economy into more individuals in different sectors in financial services in healthcare in um legal and so on and as individuals feel that they can they

have agency Somebody mentioned agency earlier. they have agency to be part of the AI economy then I think we can definitely create a lot of public good then they can be part of that progress

and so in human capital development with doing a lot of work in training in skills whether it's reskilling upskilling um in literacy I mean we work with um conigen um I mean in some of

these digital literacy kind of um programs to help um young people older people understand how they can use technology effectively how they can interact technology safely, but a lot of

it is really about we need to embrace this technology responsibly and how do we do that as individuals. So that's just one element of the public services stack that I thought we need to

highlight. I mean there's so many many other aspects to that but remembering that at the at the heart of it all is the person who can choose to embrace it who can choose to use it and how do we

provide taking public services money provide that capacity to these individuals. Professor Rabi uh India has uh has given the world a few examples practically

about scaling up in that level. But before you answer, I think it was important to notice that you mentioned the individual. We talk about the in agency. Uh having the ability to be for

instance having access to preventative health in a trusted manner for everyone creates a lot of services opportunities. This is just the government. Government can influence that. But there is so much

innovation to be done over there. But I think the mechanisms are not in place to do that. But maybe India has done something that we can learn from. &gt;&gt; Well, like you said, the one of the

biggest success stories has been the the the DPI that we have built around uh you know identity verification like the Aadhar stack and also the the payment gateway and so on so forth and in fact

so one of the amazing things about doing this at scale is because it opens up so much opportunity. We're talking about inclusive economic progress. So the UPI, the payment interface is allowing us to

record economic transactions at a granularity that has never been possible before. Now when we start thinking about building AI services on top of this kind of data available, we have to start

thinking about new kinds of problems which we can't solve in any other economy. Right? So these are these are things that really opens up uh amazing um avenues for economic progress. So

that's just something I wanted to mention and also uh it's not just in the existing uh uh infrastructure. The government is actually encouraging a lot of large scale uh uh DPI development in

the AI space. In fact uh just uh last week on uh Friday on Thursday and Friday uh there was this major uh uh AI education initiative that was launched in Barat Mandabam where one of the goals

of that the Bodhin AI initiative is to build a digital public uh uh AI stack for education right so this is this will be uh a lot lot more of an open architecture where people can come and

contribute their tools and they can also pull the tools out from this and this is all going to be open right So I mean open access like open licensing, right? Not necessarily open source because I

mean this day and age of large very large AI models I don't know what open source means anymore, right? So I mean it's not like people are going to start training their own models from scratch

even if I give them the code. Anyway, so this is all going to be open access and that's that entire stack is going to be released over the next four to three to four years is the goal for us to have

this AI stack and we will also started onboarding developers who will build education services on top of this stack. So we're trying to replicate the same uh DPI model in this across sectors. So the

education one has been announced and there's going to be one on uh uh healthcare, there'll be one on uh smart cities and then one on agriculture and so on. of the various sectors in which

India has already identified announcing these kinds of open uh stack models for building AI applications. So we are trying to push the boundary with that. &gt;&gt; That's interesting. You're bringing a

variety of stacks here now on education, on healthcare, maybe on public uh maybe mental illness or anything else. Interesting that you bring that as we develop technology there is fast running

technology out there that provide us frameworks and we create dependencies and then these dependencies basically locks us into a mechanism entrepreneur and those who are there basically are in

France Joanna told us that even the last two months things have shaped completely and different now uh I'd like to ask Mark how we can avoid dependency and lock in long term because open source is

one answer but what else is there at if you think about that stacks for education, a stack for healthcare, a stack for financing and so forth and people want to innovate there. What is

this concept of vendor locking in the future? How this will evolve in your opinion? &gt;&gt; Uh, excellent question and and a bunch of places to go with that. I mean, I I

think maybe I'll answer how do we avoid the the lock in in three ways. one is I I do think really looking as we build out and use public dollars on these things something closer to the original

definition of open source and I I think it is a problem in AI but it there's an old kind of adage more from the free software community of you know there there was two ways that they looked at

software one was you know software that was free speech and the other which was free beer and so you got to be careful of the free beer model where it it's just something you can take. It's very

very attractive, but it doesn't actually give you anything in terms of your ability to shape it and take it anywhere. And I worry that whether it is Alibaba or open AI, you have these

open-ish models, these open weights models that you can see inside. You can see the provenence of them. You can take them for free. You can modify them in some ways, but they're not transparent.

They're not inspectable. and actually that you're still locked into them in that way. You can't modify them and take them and make them your own. And free speech means I can take it and I can

shape it. And so I think anytime we're doing anything, whether it's education software or in investing in the national model for this or that, which of course you don't want to train from scratch, we

need to look for something that really we can inspect and change over time. And that inspect and change over time is a key property that avoids lock in. But then the the second thing I would say is

really important is to to spread the economic opportunity globally away from these three four five people in probably two regions of the world. And that means really building the talent base in your

country to build on top of these open source assets and these stacks. Like we need to be again as a Canadian not buying from you know forward deployed engineers from Palunteer or OpenAI or

even Microsoft but from Canadian companies or from Indian companies or from Korean companies and one of the benefits of digital public infrastructure of course there's an

economy in implementing it that's one of the roles of the private sector and build those private sector companies in your country and not rely on others to deliver on there is no reason and so I

think that's one way around the lock in. And then the [snorts] third which I think is an architecture which is still just emerging in the AI era is really this old uh you know old adage of

interoperability or old idea of interoperability. You know many of the things we're talking about whether they're data centers foundation models these things are becoming commodities

and it's it's a trick that gets played on us to think that one is so special over the other. What we really need to see is to understand the commodities and let them be commodities that are useful

to us and then make it easy to switch between them and of course you know that's how you avoid lock in. Uh thank you Mark. Your comments make me think about um not only responsibility

and trustworthiness and trust but also contestability. Do we don't have mechanism for the public for every citizen to contest right what's proposed to them today.

There is no like when we do election we have basically have the record of what's happening today we don't have that so I'd like to ask the question to Joanna and then Alpesh about how should we

think right thinking about public services for society and all this innovation that will come from private or public sector how we should think about accountability

uh and trust building at the individual level not just at institutional because it's easy to talk about think about policy and regulation as a as a guardrail for us. How should we think

about it ourselves? It may require risk healing and training as you suggest. Beyond that, if they think about moving ahead in the future, what is this concept of accountability? If you think

there an answer for that and trust building because at the end we want everyone to be able to contest right what they see to have critical thinking to have a particular answer to that. If

my question is uh is clear to you, I would like to hear your because you have a very interesting outlook on that and I think Alish also has some outlook on that in terms of trust building. Should

I repeat my question? &gt;&gt; So I think one thing I wanted to say before we get to that is around sovereignty in general. Just following up on what Mark said because I can't let

it go. a c a country that accepts a model from you know one of these four or five players um the risk to sovereignty is enormous and when you get back to trust and air's

question how do you assure people that their data is private that you know um that their services are trusted you know this is all starts with the foundation so I really firmly believe that um the

bringing in domain experts within the country. you know, customizing this on um a small model on top of the foundational model, the open source or whatever you choose to use, you know,

using that local expertise from universities, from hospitals, from you know, wherever it comes from researchers is absolutely vital and sends the message to the public that this is this

is a way of, you know, this [snorts] is a civilization uplift moment that AI is meant to be because we're going to do something completely different for you. We're going to deliver services in a new

way. We're going to reinvent how government interacts with people. I mean, all these things are really important. But, you know, in order to do that properly, you can't give away your

sovereignty by using a model that is completely is not transparent and you have no idea how to modify or um build on top of that. It's just extremely risky.

How do you translate this sovereignty from at the government level to the individual level? If someone has an answer for that because many entrepreneurs they use cloud or deepseek

or anything open source and they couldn't much care right about the government sovereignty or or anything else right the concept of that is not really anchored into every individual.

You need to get going. You want to innovate. You want to go fast. You want to test. You want to compare. You want to show your work. uh there's a market opportunity out there. Why should we

bother about the sovereignty issues at the individual level? &gt;&gt; Anyone who can answer that &gt;&gt; at the startup level. &gt;&gt; Yeah, sure. At the startup level or as a

individual uh innovator, it could be p private or public. Well, I I think whether it's a startup or me as an individual, actually the question of sovereignty

matters differently, but but even more uh in that if I'm a startup and I'm trying to build something valuable, do I want to build that on somebody else's rented land, some land they're

renting to me, or do I want to build it in a way that I own it? And [snorts] there's a reason that Facebook or Twitter or whatever were built on Linux, were built on the LAMP stack because

that was the cheap way for them to fully own the technology, not to build on the Microsoft stack or the other things at the time. That that's the reason that open source is the underpinning of the

tech industry because startups know you want to have the raw material that you own. And right now with the major centralized cloud-based AI players, there's no portability. You build your

business on top of them. You are locked into them and you are renting from them forever. So that is the reason to care about sovereignty. If it's your business, you should own it. And you

need to build on technology that you can own. And I would say the same about me and you and our my data and your data. Right now, if I have a open AI subscription or a cloud subscription, I

train it to be me. I train it to know me. I look I train it to talk like me and I cannot take that memory of myself anywhere right now. That is crazy in the architecture of how these things are

built. So one of the things we really need standards on we'd love to kind of have the standards conversation about is making my memory portable and sovereign and mine and private. It's

architecturally quite trivial to do this. It's just not in the interests of the people who currently are dominating the market. So I think there is a sovereignty case at the government

level, at the entrepreneur level and the individual level that we need to solve and it's actually quite solvable &gt;&gt; and and I guess that uh one of the most important things because it's true that

um it's so sensitive when you're going to be producing outcomes for people in in the health systems in education systems to be relying on infrastructure that you do

not control and therefore the question of data is is key uh and governments have a lot of data and that's data that can be used and and deploy in ways that are suitable for themselves.

The good news is also that the cost of producing applications had come down 90% in the last years. Therefore, you can do it. But what does it take to be sovereign? it takes to invest in your

own capacities because at the end when one area that I have been looking very closely is the education systems. When you go into the education systems and you just want to

put the technology in front of the teachers and the students and forgetting that the outcome should be improved learning for kids but that is content sensitive that is culturally relevant

and that you prepare your teachers to do it in a way that is really according to your own nature or whatever you want to keep. I feel we are forgetting again it's not about the technology it's about

how do you organize the systems and that's why you need to be fit for purpose and for me the most important element for that sovereign layer is to be fit for purpose and I don't think

that the governments are doing the massive investment in themselves to be prepared for that &gt;&gt; maybe okay I'll just add on very quickly to what Gabriella just said because I

agree Agree. I think maybe the different way of thinking about sovereignty is less about you know dependency but really about where you have control and where you have back to that point about

agency and I think you have control and agency over context. You know how to apply this in your context to your needs right. Um so a couple of examples right number one um you know making sure that

the models are actually addressing your needs right so making sure that they address your culture your language and so on. So we we've done some work in the space CIN initiative is our way of

trying to you know fine-tune or continuously pre-train um some open source models so that they are applicable to the Southeast Asian context. So that's one way which you

could have sovereignty you have you are able to control the context. to I think to Gabrielle's point the point about how do you apply this in in your environment in education in health care in um

financial services in transport and so on is also another way which you could try and have have be able to benefit um from AI without worrying about I think it's difficult to

have that conversation about I only want to use open source and I don't want to use you know um um the big models because sometimes you know there are some benefits here and there right so in

Singapore we are very small we're not going to be training our own financial a foundation models anyway so but where we think we have some levels of control then is how then do we use

this uh in in in areas that actually translate into real benefits and real outcomes economically or or from a societal perspective that's in the application layer

&gt;&gt; I'll push so &gt;&gt; just um just going back to your your question of accountability and trust and uh appreciating uh I think everyone's

given very good reasons about individual sovereignty. Um so I'm going to speak to it maybe from a a different lens which is that you know we're we're making the conversation about the technology and

the technology is the least important part of it. Technology is the enabler. It must be done a certain way to enable the outcomes we desire. But the other element that comes along with this is

that when we talk about startups and you know running without guardrails right you know we've heard that throughout the the the series so far in another life and I think many of you uh would

appreciate this um you know what helps startups what helps even established companies are good tax incentives okay uh it's the economic value attributed to the things that they must

pursue in order to achieve their goals. And their goals may be their shareholder goals. They may be the goals of their minority holder. It might be their own, you know, interest to get to a certain

level. Whatever it is, there's an economic barrier that that exists there. And we've seen where VCs and others will take and utilize criteria from standards to help identify, you know, what could

be the next group. But what what really needs to kind of be taken better into play as we talk about a lot of this is that there have to be financial incentives on the forefront and on the

back end there need to be tax incentives to enable the delay that people are talking about otherwise there's no reason for anyone to stop right at the same time the asset class that we're

talking about being developed from the DPGs and all the other items that are coming across create an additional opportunity that many You have already noted Mark says it uh very well that you

should own your own data, right? But if you don't own your data, you should at least have the ability to choose who you can engage with, right? And that's the other part of this. So

the financial packages combined with sovereignty plays really give the opportunity for the type of outcome that we're seeking. What would take it a step further is the

ability to access those markets that they're typically cut off from. The combination of those three things allows you to have a step-wise approach to realizing scalable outcomes that are

still responsibly developed. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Alesh. Sure. Last word. &gt;&gt; Well, he he made several of the points that I was going to make. One thing is of course we need to make sure it's not

just a question of controlling the data because even if you say that you have to use a sovereign model right it's still somebody else who's building these LLMs for you to use maybe it is not somebody

outside the borders of your country but still as a startup you are dependent on somebody else providing the service right and this is also the investments required to build these LLMs have become

almost like investing in gen like another utility service it's not that every startup is going to be sovereign at that level of the startup in being building these models. So having said

that uh so of course the economic incentives are a big big factor and the other thing that we are trying to do with the uh AI stack right is to make sure that the models that we build like

you have done with the CLI model are so much more grounded in the local context right so they can actually teach children [snorts] in the local language that's being spoken at home and in

contrary to popular opinion it's not just 22 right so we come India you have a couple of hundred languages which people speak at home. So so if you can how how do you build this kind of AI

from sovereign AI stack that really doesn't make sense for you to go to one of these you know bigger models non-s sovereign models for it to use and again the data is still not available for

people to build these models outside the borders of India. So I think we also have to not just give these economic incentives but also we have to give a technologically

sound reason for people to start choosing sovereign model and just mandating that they should do so is not going to work. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Uh well we approached the

topic under multiple lenses. We talked about sovereignty. We just talk about it talk about human agency. to talk about uh the incentives uh and the standards and also the fact that we have to be

able to choose uh how to do it in sound way. It seems that the public eye stack needs to incorporate at least human agency uh transparency openness but also incentives in in any shape or form and

somehow some pragmatism but uh because not everything can be open or closed at this point. We're still learning. So as this evolving landscape, I think the public AI stack that we use for public

goods should be probably specified that we need services, public services that could be delivered to people in a transparent interoperable manner. That's what you said to close our conversation.

Uh think about this concept of public service in in a simple few words issue of you. What would be the one thing that we should not miss to get there?

the one thing that you should not be see talk for instance I'm sure someone will talk about incentives but what is that one thing that we should be pay attention to because we covered a lot

and we don't have enough time to cover deeper than that and to go everywhere but go ahead &gt;&gt; I'm very sorry but uh this is beyond but I I'm I'm just publishing a a book with

Springer and and I talk about the four eyes which is incentives investments infrastructure and institutions. So for ICE, &gt;&gt; thank you Joanna.

&gt;&gt; Okay, Mark. &gt;&gt; I mean I I think it's come from so many of the people here which is just don't forget the humans in this. I mean this is really about stuff that brings us you

know that that educates us that serves us and that we are in control of and have agency over. uh so just in any of it really we are under testing underd designigning for us as humans in these

systems. &gt;&gt; So I was going to say uh the context right so the context in which you're building these have to be really front and center and it's not like one size

that's going to work for all. So &gt;&gt; thank you. &gt;&gt; I'll say trust. I think it has to be grounded in trust. I think we have to as we deliver all of these things uh we

have to make sure that uh the humans and the public continue to trust the technology that they're using. &gt;&gt; Bes um inclusive

utility I mean what we're talking about is a public utility. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And I would say uh incentives. The last word from you Joanna.

I I would say that the most important thing we learned a lot in the last 10 years or 15 years with um social media and you know which are the most advanced AI systems in the world and they have

shaped our information universe in a way that is not ideal and so we are at a critical moment and I think if I had one word it would be caution and um awareness so I'll give you two sorry air

amir but I really believe that awareness of what's happening Because when you think about bringing a model into education for instance, you're going to be you know educating those children

based on the information ecosystem that was used to train that which is all mostly western data from a certain number of countries right and that's where the bulk of the data is and that

means that your unique culture the capabilities of your you know your country what is unique about you is missing in that equation. So I think we we talked about it from the perspective

of transparency, but we also need to think about it from the perspective of models and how they're trained and how we want to make sure that all these rich cultures around the world continue to

be, you know, represented and we don't become some flat monoculture that is dictated by a certain number of countries. &gt;&gt; Such a nice way to to end this

conversation. Well, it's been a pleasure to have you all. We have six amazing speakers from six countries with a variety of experience. Uh we tried this was not the goal to build a blueprint of

any sort but to open some of this conversation. I think all of you are going to be the architect of this change and as entrepreneurs as you are or thinkers you're going to come up with uh

the new wave and I think the incentives to create value that benefit people should be increased. Thank you all.
