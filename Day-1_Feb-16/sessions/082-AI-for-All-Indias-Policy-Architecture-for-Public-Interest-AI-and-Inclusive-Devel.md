## 📝 Transcript

everyday life and the real question before us is not only what AI can achieve but how it can serve society in fair inclusive and accountable ways. So as India advances towards the vision of

Vix Bharat 2047 technology must strengthen trust between citizens and institutions and ensure that the progress reaches everyone. Now today we bring together experts from policy,

technology, law, economics, healthcare and academia to think through this shared responsibility. We are deeply grateful to our convenor and co-conveners senior professor Raika

Sakenna ma'am professor Sanjiv Kumar Acham professor Vipin Tawari for helping us materialize this idea. Now uh I welcome our HOD and senior professor Raika Sakenna ma'am to officially

welcome our speakers uh distinguished guests, respected panelists, colleagues and my dear students. Uh a very good afternoon and a very warm welcome to all of you. Uh on

behalf of the department of political science, University of Delhi uh it is my pleasure to welcome you to this round table on AI for all India's policy architecture for public interest AI and

inclusive development. uh we have gathered today at Bharat Mandupam to represent dialogue, exchange and forward thinking and it is therefore you know I would say very fitting venue for a

conversation about artificial intelligence you know which is rapidly reshaping now how we live, how we govern and how we even think. So artificial intelligence is no longer a distant

promise you know it is already present in our institutions in our markets in everyday decisions. It influences how public services are delivered how information circulates

how risk are assessed and how opportunities are distributed. So in short AI is not just a technological development but I would say but a structural feature of modern

society and that is precisely why our conversation today is very important. So uh the central question before us is not simply you know what AI can do but what it should do

and under what institutional ethical and policy frameworks. So technological progress you know if it is left unguided it does not automatically produce social justice or democratic accountability. So

these must be consciously designed into the system of governance. So this round table therefore you know invites us to think of AI not only as an innovation but as public policy

not only as efficiency but as responsibility not only as growth but as inclusion. So we are especially fortunate to have with us a very distinguished and diverse

group of speakers whose expertise you know spans uh global governance industry technology public policy and academia. So their presence reflects and a very important truth meaningful conversations

about AI that it cannot happen without disciplinary silos. So we have to come out of that disciplinary silos and we are really honored to have representation from UN women reminding

us that technological futures must remain attentive to equity and social inclusion. Uh we are joined by leaders from innovation and corporate sectors including deote India tennich whose work

you know really demonstrates how datadriven systems are transforming economic and institutional practices. So at the same time we are deeply enriched by the presence of the academic

colleagues from Delhi University my colleague professor Hm Sanjie who is the uh co-convener and professor bipintentari and colleagues and from institutions like hansraj college Hindu

college among other scholars you know across disciplines within our own university their participation ensures that a discussion remains grounded in critical reflection in theoretical ical

clarity and intellectual responsibility. So today's theme is particularly significant in the context of developmental aspirations. Now as India moves forward uh uh towards an ambitious

you know and transformative dream of Bixad Bharat 2047 the challenge before us is clear. How do we harness technological capability while safeguarding democratic values?

How do we design policy framework that promote innovation without deepening inequality and how do we ensure AI strengthens public institutions rather than

bypassing them. So these are not merely technical questions but deeply political, ethnic and institutional questions. Now uh equally important is the need for

dialogue and AI governance I would say cannot be shaped by technologists alone nor by policy makers alone or academicians alone. So it must emerge from continuous engagement you know

across sectors and be informed be reflective and participatory. So public trust in uh emerging technologies depends not only on what systems do but on how transparency and responsibility

you know they are designed and how they are responsible and designed and governed. So I hope &gt;&gt; already running out of time to listen to the speakers if you can make it more

productive. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay. So I before I uh invite I want to introduce my speakers. Thank you so much and uh I think already it's

there in the program. So I welcome all the speakers. Mr. Miss Sudeshna Mukharji uh Mr. Sudhir Goena Mr. Odit Goena Mr. Ashi Shabroll Dr. Ankit Rajpal Dyam Sharma uh Dr. Sudep Raj Kumar Dr. Anime

Nazcar Dr. uh Suprit uh Anerut Gupta thank you so much and also you should have some courtesy if the speaker I'm I was just about to conclude in 20 minutes

&gt;&gt; that's the courty I have already so it was just not even 5 minutes &gt;&gt; okay thank you so much &gt;&gt; brother please listen excuse me why brother please Listen to women.

&gt;&gt; We have not especially &gt;&gt; about this &gt;&gt; brother. Why? Sorry. &gt;&gt; Okay. It's okay. Let's start.

&gt;&gt; Okay. Yeah. &gt;&gt; This is very unfortunate but it's okay. We cannot control everyone's mind. Uh now I'd like to invite Professor Sanjiv VM to moderate this session. Uh

please welcome. Okay, we are already uh running out of time. Uh Mantri G Modi. We will be discussing today and we have

three or four sectors of speakers ranging from academia to industry to innovation and public policy and also international institution. So let me moderate this in terms of beginning with

the basic will AI what we think of AI is all about computers and softwares and quantum theory that is where I want to bring in Ankit Raj. So after that I will give around four to five minutes to

Ankit and then we'll take it from there. Ankit. &gt;&gt; Thank you professor Sanjie. Uh it's my privilege speaking on this topic. So when we talk about this public interest

AI uh whenever this policies are made uh this is made for uh u with the intent of asking or uh giving the answer to these questions that what are these policies meant for whom by whom and how are these

going to be implemented. So when I uh just see uh the people who are sociologist and are speaking on this particular thing, I hear a very beautiful kind of quote which is which

says that technology is not neutral. It mirrors the system that creates it. So rightly mentioned by professor uh Rua Benjamin that AI should mirrors the uh constitutional values not the inherent

bias in it. So for example uh when I say bias uh any policy which has to reach to the stakeholders that needs a proper implementation and if the data is not analyzed properly so that data is of

waste and if that data will be analyzed but late then also it's going to be of no use. So this the use of AI is going to bring a change and of course uh these policies from uh the data from uh NITIO

uh UIDI a AI and uh when I say uh the data from MITI that can actually bring the change in the policy making and not only this policy making but also to by to remove this bias uh and in healthcare

when I See the healthcare sector for example if the system and the uh existing systems uh apply the or I can say decides the medical treatment plan for an individual based on the insurance

policy or any other thing our AI system should not mimic the same. So what we want that in even in AI in healthcare or if and in agriculture it should be able to give timely decision to the farmers

and uh one easy example which we can see with the use of bhashini uh recent uh addition to the national language mission and what is the intent intent is that uh it should promote the

multilinguism that there should not be any obstacle to any particular uh the person who is not well literate. it and so the person is not deprived of using this uh government policies because of

the complex forms and all these things. So multilinguism uh we have seen coming from the bhashini and the the basic uh usage of this particular tool in the Orisa. uh when I uh when I can just

quote that particular thing that is in Odisa the farmers earlier were not able to use those uh policies which were uh implemented by the um by government and why it was not because there was

different different languages with which they were not I can say uh what the familiar of. So thanks to Bhashini which has bring brought a lot of change but yes we should not uh forget about the

ethical uh aspects of the AI. For example, when I say the explainable AI, so the everything which AI does, it should be well explainable. So that a person who is not uh who said by the who

is said by the system that uh that this particular policy is not implemented or not for you. It should be well gi explaining you why that decision and uh uh other way around it should be

accountable also because we when we see the example that when you lose your money maybe for some any cyber fraud or something like that when you go to the banker uh versus you ask AI when do I

get my money back the when the banker says that you will get money in next 15 days and versus the AI says you still believe the banker so that brings empathy because in in AI this

empathetical aspect is missing. So with my aspect if you want if you want to grow in this AI field we should uh this public interest AI should uh will be able to fulfill the vision of Vix Bhara

2047 only if only if it is implemented by taking all stakeholders at one place and of course uh giving the explanable reliable and accountable AI for all. Thank you so much.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Aa Sudep is here. Sudep. &gt;&gt; Okay. He's not here. Professor Tiwari. Vipin Tiwari. &gt;&gt; He's not here. Okay. So now let me

invite my photo. Now only say time group photo. I said yes sir.

&gt;&gt; Yes please. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah &gt;&gt; that's okay. Once AI comes [laughter] all these will not happen automatically a picture will be taken but don't worry

that's why we are working towards it. Okay. Okay, thank you. Long. &gt;&gt; Okay. Uh, now I invite to give you an economic perspective my friend Animesh

because computers will work only with economics. So how would be would we see our economic policies in future for 2047? Over to you Animesh. &gt;&gt; Uh hello. Uh thank you professor Sanjib

uh inviting me to give me an opportunity to [clears throat] send my message to this place. Um actually you know then when we talk

discuss about the economic perspective of AI uh I will focus on two to three things. One is that you know uh closed AI and open AI closed versus open because you know when we talk about the

closed AI just like open AI chat GPT Gemini these are closed AI the problem is that if we allow closed AI to grow and obviously it will it will grow definitely but there will be a

concentration of power and then you know there uh that this concentration of power will actually create a huge inequality in the society and in the other perspective is simultaneously if

we allow the open AI systems where actually you know the open source you can develop you know your program and all such things there is a problem the security

issue there is a challenge between these two things but our p when we consider is that a public good so obviously ly there should be thing is that that is should be inclusive. Now there

we have to channelize this technology because this technology has no fault. Any technology any invention has no has no fault. The problem is that how you will use this technology. So when we

talk about the regulation when we talk about the policy framework and when we consider as a public good public good means obviously the two principal characteristics non-rivalry non

excludability that means it is for everyone. You cannot exclude anyone. You cannot uh whatever the pro service will be provided it will be used by equally by

everyone. So how it is possible? So in that context you know first we have to you know reduce or minimize the digital divide. If there is a digital divide so you know it will actually foster the

inequality. But if we are able to reduce the digital divide, we can reduce the inequality through this AI technology because you know the AI can has a potentiality to the solve of asymmetric

information because the party which has even think about uh you know when we discuss about the public goods or uh even in a private goods also the market fails because of this asymmetric

information. One party has more information, one party has less information. AI can remove these things. Now I come to the welfare perspective and policy perspective of AI. So in this

context, you know, my policy objective is packed into uh the word which is given by our honorable prime minister because this period is Omritk or Bikshit Varat. If I decode the word Omritk this

nine letters. So my policy is basically kept into this what is that is age of mobilizing research innovation uh technology knowledge artificial intelligence and able

leadership. So if we go by each of these word you know we understand that what our policy should be because you know if you see in uh research perspective it's a very pathetic picture because uh

if we compare with our global competitors our R&amp;D expenditure is only 6% of our GDP while in case of China you can find out 2.2% 2% of their GDP. Even in South Korea, Israel there you know

research R&amp;D expenditure 3.5 more than that even uh USA also is that is the highest one. So we have to focus on research because you know AI is not replacing job. AI is redesigning uh the

landscape of the job. Okay. The nature of the job. So here you know that when the technology technological disruption takes place &gt;&gt; 30 seconds 30 seconds

&gt;&gt; okay sorry we need to reformulate so that you know all the you know section of the people can get the benefit out of it. Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. And I have the ugly job of moderating a tough task. Now I invite uh a perspective for global governance miss Sudeshna Mukharhar gi five minutes for you Sudhna Gone

I'm not going take very long. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Hi. Is this better? Okay. So yeah, I guess you all have been hearing a lot of policies and a lot of um you know uh

rule making around uh AI and also the innovation side. So without uh further ado, I would like to share a few quick you know very practical examples and uh globally uh starting with uh how many of

you in this room have heard of invisible women the book? Can I see a show of hand? Oh wow. very bleak. I would highly recommend uh by Caroline Perez. Um it's a brilliant

book on how systems are and data biases come into play. So uh AI unlike popular understanding is not really a very new concept and so u it's been about 50 60 years it's been in the making but it's

in different forms that it has uh been there mostly uh in the systems at a systemic level now with generative AI since 2022 open AI uh brought in that whole revolution by launching chat GPT

and it became a household claim but even before that be it in when uh Google launched uh its search engine uh you would have sentences being completed that's one form of artificial

intelligence you would we would always wonder oh my god it can almost almost read my mind so AI is artificial intelligence is almost like that which reads your mind so now when uh as a as a

person coming from um uh an organization whose mandate is gender equality I wanted to shed light on how biases uh come into play. So invisible men women talks about the case of how cars

were public transport was manufactured uh keeping men in mind because the dummy the test dummy that is being used typically was using a male body type. So uh similarly in uh you know several of

us at least I feel when we are in air conditioned rooms we feel cold because it typically took a white male 40-year-old body type into consideration. So when

systematically it's women who are not even considered during the design process because in the 60s typical offices had men instead of women working. Therefore you know models

systems were not taken taking women into consideration. So similarly when artificial intelligence and it's not just gender bias but somebody mentioned disability cast you know all those

systematic uh systemic uh biases then they get uh like you know the just like the idea of AI being um you know a leveler it also can uh create these discrimination or

biases manyfold. So I would say as a global policy uh making institution it's important that we take into consideration what are the very gendered uh you know uh use a gendered lens in

policym take into consideration these systems these processes these new technologies that are coming out how can how are women in particular being being impacted so my quick two things and I

know time is short is mandatory impact assessment which by that I mean uh you know it should not be post factor it should &gt;&gt; sure so uh one is of course like I said

impact assessment the second is getting women at the design table so I think uh with that said whenever it's very encouraging that we are here for the next 5 days we are going to hear lots of

policy makers but keep in mind that uh every target group has its own needs and we need to take that into consideration thank you very Thank you. Uh AI and commerce have

become a very deadly combination because of the flip side of it. But anyway, I want we will know this. I want to invite Suprit for giving us this perspective. &gt;&gt; Thank you sir. I'm audible. Yeah. So

good evening everyone. From the lens of finance I see public interest AI as a fiscal bridge to Vix Bharat 2047. Now when I say this fiscal bridge that means that is anchored on five

foundational pillars which are transparency, inclusivity, equity, accountability and sustainability. And these are the pillars which can

modernize this fiscal architecture. Right? So when I see finance, finance being the bedrock of your nation building, be it every activity, be it infrastructure projects, be it your

welfare schemes, that depends on to two major variables, which is your revenue generation and expenditure efficiency. Now stranding onto these two variables without eroding the public trust that is

a very key challenge when we are talking about this journey towards 2047 and this is precisely where we can see that public interest AI becomes transformative because how does it help?

It will help model the uh you could say policy outcomes which will you know eliminate duplicases which will uh you could say simulate the directional effect before the implementation of the

policies which will predict the models which will see into where are the lags which will you know when we talk about with the respect of financial inclusion which will deepen this financial

inclusion and we'll see that how to reduce this credit gaps how to fill this uh you know this very gaps in terms of the leakages. So I'll give you one simple example of your DBT.

DBT is linked with this jam trinity and you know how much did it help to save out 3.48 lakh Kes. So that is a amount which is in trillions. So this is with the jam trinity which is nothing but a

public interest AI being used into the same and thereby we are not just you know saving that much you know whooping amount but also able to reduce the cost that is expenditure from 16% to 9%. So

here in where we see this public interest AI amalgamation this convergence taking place on real grounds right further when we talk about the inclus inclusivity parameter so we see

that vernacular AI assistance into your tax and compliance frameworks which is there into your GSTN wherein your GST network is able to red flag higher risky transactions. It is able to detect the

anomalies into your data taxes. Right? So this is how it will bring your fiscal efficiency. Right? And also when we are talking about eliminating all these bogus entities, it is going to

strengthen your fiscal space. So this way what we are building on to that this transparency will build the trust, trust will bring the compliance and compliance will lead to development. And this is

where we say that you know this um uh public uh this very uh you know your tool it is not just a mere tool of revenue extraction but to be seen as a structural enabler of your greater you

could say compliance or a simpler compliance fairness uh enabling participatory policies and uh finally the welfare optimization and this is what is the essence of your vix bat

2046. 7. Thank you. [applause] &gt;&gt; Okay. So, let's get a perspective from innovation. I would like to invite Ani Ruth.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. Am I audible? &gt;&gt; Okay. Uh so I have worked nearly 18 years in the industry. uh different types of clients uh have been working with the policy makers also have worked

with many of the captives unit have worked with some of the consulting organizations and first of all why we are discussing this topic today right why public

interest AI is so important right now because AI is no more a futuristic lab experiment stuff right it is already there uh in everyone's hand you can do lots of lots of things with AI in your

mobile right and that's where uh it is very important to talk about the public interest AI at this moment and for those who want to be very sure what is public interest AI it is like how you use AI

for uh better larger good societal good right and most of the time what happens u the pe the masses are ignored by AI like as Sudesh ma'am was also There are AI which are biased who are

not considering women right similarly there are biases for uh not only gender but ethnicity and multiple other criterias. So that's why this topic is very important to discuss currently. So

I also did some study uh on this and uh for for me I will uh architect my answer or or my submission to this uh discussion in this way. First we have to understand if we really want to have an

inclusive de development and public interest AI what are the gaps because only if we understand what are the gaps we will be able to talk about uh that what we should do and of uh there are

several things like data and infrastructure and that is where we will need the policy makers uh the organization and the academia all three to come together and that's why if you

see uh this panel is very very beautifully created to cover all these three aspects. then talents and the skill gaps and that is where some of the uh let's say the NOS's the social

aspects apart from these three are also involved and then uh I got to know that there are some students here so an effort from your side is also required right and uh then regulatory and

governance because there has to be a common uh AI policy framework which should be there which can be followed because most as you know the when the AI cames the digital arrest the various

scams also stepped in right so there is very easy to create a policy but it is even easier to create a loopholes in the policy so that's why we should have uh let's say a AI policy labs which will uh

be uh taking care of all these stuffs uh then obviously taking care of the biases etc and uh to tackle all this because I am seeing the time also so We we we like what I thought that we should

have something at a state level and at a national level something like AI policy labs where there are policy makers there are uh representatives from the uh academia and the uh corporate who comes

together and who ensures that a proper social impact assessment has been done whenever an AI solution is getting implemented. They also see that there is a coverage of all the biases. Everything

is being taken care on. Uh then uh there are lot of data which will get registered uh when we uh open like when we talk about the public interest AI. So there has to be proper gatekeepers for

ensuring that the data is correctly used. It is used for the intent purpose also. It should not be like you say that okay the purpose is X but it is getting used for XY Z right so that is another

and then there has to be a national AI ethics council and uh citizen grieviance uh portal so AI ethics council which will decide uh that what are the like it will take care of the biases and it will

also decide what are dos and don'ts uh while we create AI for the larger good right for example when I have worked with one of the state government we get access to lot of healthcare data

&gt;&gt; 30 seconds anod okay &gt;&gt; 30 seconds thanks sir so I I'll summarize that u so in grievance redressal we should have an option for uh the public also to give their

feedback because then only uh these things will get improved and we should start with creating a sandbox kind of a structure where while we are experimenting the public also uh gets

option to uh give their feedback and it is a closed loop right and at the end I would also say that Deoid India has opened a new like has launched a new platform called Genwai uh which is also

being showcased here so please go and have a look there our COO Ninki has launched it thank you thank you very much now does you know like you were talking

about AI ethics council uh ethics, philosophy, academia, quantum theory like we have Sudep here. Sudep 5 minutes for you. AI philosophy. Um yeah. Hi. Uh thank you to the

organizers. Uh glad to be here since I almost missed it. I guess Google still can't predict the ways I can get late, you know. So there's still work to be done there. Uh I teach philosophy at

Hindu College. So my reflections are on the on AI and humanities specifically philosophy. Uh so I'll make four quick points. The first point which I want to make is uh a stronger coupling of

humanities and technology. The reason I'm saying this is that already in disciplines like uh mathematics there is increasing use of AI to you know like solve old old age very old questions.

And there is a suggestion that this thing is already happening in philosophy. For example, to the questions like what is consciousness and what is memory. Scientists and

philosophers alike are using AI tools. Uh the question of memory is specifically interesting because recently there are some paper which suggests that the way uh large language

models are trained based upon transformers model it generates insights on how human memory works not the other way around. So yeah, so the first so what what we need is uh training

humanity students on understanding technology of AI and not just using AI tools and simultaneously I mean there is a need to ethicize and humanize uh technology itself and I think as has

been suggested by other panelists that we need ethical considerations considerations for humans living organisms and you know like being in general should

at the level of programming and algorithmic design itself. U the second point I want to make is a bit philosophical. Um uh it can be argued that with the advent of generative and

agentic AI there is sort of a rupture in our relationship with past. One of my favorite philosophers Henry Burgistan he says that it's it is past or like like memory which makes human experience

possible. And now we have more and more avenues of storing the memory. But I mean it can be argued that our existential bond the with the lived past is loosening. So there is a need to

renegotiate and reconceptualize our relationship with the past. Another point is what I mean all faculty members uh sort of struggle with is how to assess students right we ask students

to write an assignment and they chat GDP I mean writing is a form of thinking it's not an extension of thinking it is thinking I mean organizing ideas is thinking so uh we really need to think

what are the alternative ways of assessment and evaluation that can be incorporated given that AI I is going to be there for now and the the uh the the the last point which I want to make is

regarding the care and ethics for AI. I just want to uh mention this in passing because it can seem farfetched but like already scientists are claiming that AI is conscious. Uh there are or some

people argue that it's not it's alternative intelligence. Don't call it artificial because it's intelligence of a different kind. If we grant that machines are conscious already or they

will be, what kind of rights are we willing to give it to them? Once you give them rights, you can't take it back. And I don't think humanity wants to be on the wrong side of at least

this, you know, like uh this one. So yeah, I mean it seems far-fetched, but the future can be near as well. So yeah, the last point is care and ethics for AI. what kind of rights are we willing

to give them? Yeah, these are the four point. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Uh we just have 6 to 7 minutes to go. Organizers are already alarming us. We have a father-son duo.

Uh going family. So I request come one by one take three to four minutes and choice please just uh I am I am just his uncle. &gt;&gt; Yeah I am

father. Yeah almost like a fatherly figure. Uh so uh so I think lot has been said. Uh I would just keep it simple. Uh I think uh what uh in my view India right

now needs is uh simple things like ABCD. I call it ABCD of AI for all. So what is that? First is for A is for agentic AI because see uh we have seen it evolving. Uh we have seen uh the generative AI

being there for quite some time. But now you need agents who can do work for you, who just uh uh don't give you output, who does manage your uh life, who does everything for you and who can

understand what you need and uh deliver it. So that's where the agents come and those are coming and in fact a lot of things we have seen uh agents are able to do whether it is uh make a call

understand your uh this thing uh send a uh order confirmation everything end to end agents are able to do whether it is to book a uh uh calendar book a Uber everything agents are able to do so

that's where uh we should be moving uh initially uh in terms of policy then what we need in India is a builder first approach when I say builder's first approach which means builders of agent

AI should be given incentive motivation and right kind of resources to build right things which can help the economy and help the public infrastructure. So whether it is in terms of the GPU

accesses that are there the right kind of government incentives that can be there. So that is where it is very important. Third I would say is more of a culture native. Uh India is uh you

everybody is aware is a country of multiple uh languages and we have a uh diversity of language. So it's very important that EI speaks the culture uh the language of

India not just simply English. So uh and it's al not even just Hindi. Why not Bengali? Why not Tamil? Why not tel? Why not Canada? Why not Asamis? So all those languages AI should be able to speak and

uh the real magic will be when a farmer is able to negotiate uh prices through use of AI uh in his own language rather than just getting a help from a uh chatbot. So it's able to understand and

negotiate uh uh on his behalf. So that's where the AS would be reaching in. Fourth is uh digital public infrastructure. So uh DPI has been there and we have been leading in DPI uh over

the years and it has enabled us use of uh Aadhaar UPI and uh what we call as uh Jam Trinity whether it is Jandhan. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So uh I will just finish uh the E part is the ecosystem. So uh we need the

right kind of ecosystem to have the development of uh the ent entire agentic as uh in uh the world. I will just finish it in a sort. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Okay to Udit. Uh thank you

everyone. I think I'm the last one and I'll probably try to wrap it up as soon as possible. I think a lot of things have already been covered up by most people. But I think the one of the most

important part is to understand that public AI doesn't uh demand being ethical. It demands being accountable. Uh that's very very very very important and I think that's where a lot of u

talks generally don't go by right that what is happening behind the scene. No one talks about it. Everyone is just going and using chat GPT typing. uh they're using all of these LLMs today as

their personal therapist but no one is really understanding what is happening behind the scene and how these LLMs can be extremely manipulative they can tell you what to do and there have been cases

of people committing suicides because Gemini and similar platforms have have openly told go and die commit suicide right so those situations have happened and what is happening behind the scene

is something that no one knows about and this is where accountability is extremely important what kind of logs are being saved behaved. We don't know that um what are being told to what

person we don't know that every single individual goes through its own challenges and problems we don't know that right and this is where the accountability is extremely important

where um AI needs to be completely biased but more importantly when such kind of situations happen AI also becomes a lot more empathetic because that's what is really missing out with

AI as of now few platforms are trying to solve for this but the kind of scale at which AI I right now is being used for personal as in personal assistant. That is something that needs to be addressed

before anything else because if that doesn't get solved, we'll probably see a lot more issues cases that we probably are unheard of because it takes one moment of making bad decisions in your

life, right? It's just that one moment if if that in one moment if someone can just stop you, you can save a lot of millions of life, right? So uh coming to India uh I think one of the most

important part is that we need a lot more builders than just users. Today I think if if we have about like 140 cr people about 100 cr people are already using some form of AI uh either in the

form of their mobile phone through the using Gemini charge jip or whatever LLMs that they want. We need more and more people to actually come and build because this is an opportunity for um

the our youth to come in. There are close to around 300 million youth. There are 30 cr youths right now in India. They're all consuming. We want all of them to turn into builder. That is where

again some great opportunity has has really emerged. But more than that, we need to implement something known as a try framework which I call as trust adaptability uh adaptability and

inclusion. So the moment we start implementing such kind of frameworks, what is going to happen is that we will not only build trust but we will also be able to see a lot of adaptability across

different regions. uh we also need more builders to start building locally. That is also very important. And as he was mentioning that why not Bengali? Why there are no models around uh south

Indian languages? Why there are no models around Marvari? There are so many more opportunities if you target and focus on tier 2, tier three and tier four cities of India. That's where the

opportunity comes in. Everyone wants to just capture and everyone wants to just build for Mumbai 30 seconds. &gt;&gt; So that's where the opportunity comes in, right? Um and uh but again as I

mentioned there needs to be these corporate governance but more importantly there are infrastructures today available there are platforms that are providing you with GPU today you can

go and use platforms like Olama download any open-source model or use transformers go and use Google collab on top of that and just build and train your own model do that right like

opportunities are with you there are models and weights available with you what you do with them and how you build for India that's completely completely up to you. Thank you so much.

&gt;&gt; Thank you very much. Uh this event has been held under the banner of department of political science, University of Delhi. To give that perspective, I would like to ask my

colleague co-convenir, Professor Tiari for just to speak for a minute. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much are all panelists for this afternoon. uh we thank you on behalf of

department of political science and most importantly what is important is that why department of political science today at from University of Delhi there are various departments in the

university and I we do not know who all are representing at AI why it is important is if you all fellow colleagues who are from University of Delhi would recall that every time when

our honorable vice chancellor speaks about Vixit Bharat he always mentions that it is also very important for the academic fraternity to uh pose as a challenge and do something at the level

of uh the country's growth. So if we are talking about AI for all and as part of inclusive growth, we cannot talk in the absence of any academic institution or any academic uh collaboration. So that's

how University of Delhi represents that aspect and tries to bring into that collaboration and tries to ensure that we are also part of this whole dream of Bharat which is Vixit Bharat and we all

must contribute to this growth. Thank you very much to all of you. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Okay Krishna let's wind up. Come on. Thank you so much all the esteemed speakers and in this conversation we

have talked about Bhashni initiative we have talked about non-exclutoary and non-rivalous data mandatory impact assessments DBT AI rights algorithmic manipulation and I think all these steps

are must for building an inclusive and an AI that can actually bring change that can actually serve public in the public interest. Now, thank you so much all the audience for joining us. A just

small reminder that whenever you're not invited into an event and if you attend that event out of your own choice and if a senior professor is speaking on inclusive AI only then you should be

more responsible and more respectable. Thank you so much people. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you so much for joining us. Now we'll be uh waiting for a group photo. I request all the experts to

please stand up for the group photo. I want to do a little Thank you. Thank you so much. Yes. Yes.
