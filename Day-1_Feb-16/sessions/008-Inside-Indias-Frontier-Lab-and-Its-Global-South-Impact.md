## 📝 Transcript

1 billion people and out of this 1 billion people are actually carrying a smartphone and those 1 billion people are connected to internet creating and consuming content every single minute.

Right now also I think every one of you is creating or consuming some content right the per capita data consumption of India is the highest in the world even higher than US and China. The other part

is I come from data center background now migrating to cloud and GPUs but in terms of data center capacity while India is creating and consuming 20% of the world's data 1/5th of the world's

data is actually created consumed by India but how much is hosted in India 3%. That shows the problem but that shows the opportunity. In the last seven years, India has built data center

capacity almost seven times compared to what it used to be in 2015 16. But even if we keep on building this infrastructure, the digital infrastructure for next 10 years, we

will not be reaching the scale which India deserves for serving its own market and also to serve as a hub for the global demand. uh you know which which I think prime minister uh uh

himself has spoken just two days back I think in an interview to PTI uh prime minister has spoken that while India has been a world leader always for last three decades in application layer right

in in application of technology and of course in as a consumer of technology but how do we create technology how do we create that infrastructure so that we not only serve the aspirations of the

countrymen but also we serve the aspirations of the world and India for sure can serve the aspirations of the global south. Now when we do are doing this

unless India has got a infrastructure of digital right which is in terms of compute India cannot do that. India cannot be just sitting on a imported technology which has happened in the

last 15 20 30 years. We all have consumers we have not created it. We it is the right time for India to create its own infrastructures. Once we do that, we will be defining what type of

model we create. Socket has taken an initiative in that. We will be knowing what type of data sets our model will take. We will be knowing which use cases Indians prefer. Is it in agriculture, in

healthcare, in education, in space, the problems which Indians face which can impact the masses and not just to fill the deep pockets of some rich people. I think that is what is India's moment.

And if we are able to work on all the price stack especially on infrastructure in the next seven years next 10 years I think this will be India's glory and India will be known as the real uh you

know the nation which has taken AI to the whole of global south and to the world. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you so much. So maybe my first question would be for Mr.

Rangar Rajan. Uh so I think this is a question which everyone is asking to all the people who are building these models in India &gt;&gt; and the question is very simple. There

are so many open source models small big large right why India should build its own language model is it just because we want to learn that training recipe or is it something that is there which people

don't understand so any comment on it &gt;&gt; yeah that's actually a great question and uh let me actually then give you of course in the context of uh being some &gt;&gt; someone from defense let me give you you

know example of uh something which is very relevant uh Now let's uh talk about our uh borders with uh uh the the eastern borders that we have right now. If you look at China, the language that

they have, Chinese is actually uh obviously not just one language, right? So you have Mandarin, you have Cantonese, you have various kinds of uh divisions within Chinese as well. And

you also have an incredibly varied number of dialects. So what is being spoken in the borders in Lelay and Ladak will become very different than the borders in let's say northeast Tawang or

Nachal Pradesh and so on so forth. Now these are all dialects. A person who is speaking supposedly Chinese in the areas of Tavan may not even understand properly what is being spoken in Lelay

and Ladak. Right now when we talk about uh you know defense applications for large language models, you cannot expect you know somebody sitting in the US to try and appreciate some of the nuances

that we need to understand as Indians to protect the security of our borders. So we need ability to understand various dialects, various kinds of implications of tones of language of structures of

sentences and you need people who can then translate that to the local uh local use cases. Okay, this is of course very relevant in a security context where you know your ability to intercept

or interpret what is being spoken across the borders is really really important. But uh let me also take another example where you know I come from the southern state of Tamil Nadu. There are so many

dialects even within Tamil Nadu and a person in the southernmost part of Tamil Nadu will not speak something which is super sensible for somebody in the northern part of Tamil Nadu. Of course

you can make out 80% of what is being said but never 100%. Therefore the question is if we are going to build something which is a model which is uh the westernized version of what India

needs versus the Indianized version of what India needs. You need to understand then who will be able to understand our own pain points better. will the local person sitting in uh let's say Tamili

district in Tamil Nadu be able to understand that better or somebody sitting in a in a in a research lab in the US be able to understand it better so that I think is really the core core

focus you need local models uh handled by local people in order to be truly relevant for the full population you can of course get to let's say 60 70% relevance with uh you know with the

these languages but once you are talking about transforming the remaining 30% and in this case remember that this 30% of India is more than the entire population of the US so when you talk about that

number of people being impacted then you need that local &gt;&gt; okay okay sure thank you so I think the message is very clear right so it is not just about uh dialects within the

boundary but it is also about cross boundary or cross border dynamics and the language and the diversity that we're talking about here. Okay. So this brings us to another uh so at least this

clears this thing that we need several models we need models to build within India. Okay. Now model building requires two major investment. So one is called oil and the other one is called

refinery. So when I say oil, oil is the data and when I say refinery it is the data center. So my next question is for so what do you think like do we have enough capacity in the refinery or we

need to build it and if that is the case then how early we can catch up with our western competitors. Um yeah uh professor M as I said that uh just 8 years back India used to be full

of 200 megawatt of data center capacity right which was more built for hosting enterprise applications e-commerce applications and you know the usual stuff gradually people were shifting

away from captive data center the centralized you know third party data centers thanks to the uh I would say a massive movement towards cloud right hyperscalers coming in India you know

the local players growing. We have seen data center capacity growing to around 1.4 GB like seven times in the last 7 years and based on the planned capacity announcements and what is getting built

on ground we all were very sure that India will become a 3 gawatt capacity which will still be like second or third largest in the AP pack and fourth or fifth largest in the world by 2030.

uh AI has just changed the equation completely right and as I said that while India is always late to start late to adopt any technology but once a tipping point comes when you have got

the best of the output to the user at the lowest of the price that is what India is the scale at which India adopted technology we have seen it in so many things whether it's desktop laptop

mobile 5G everything we have seen same thing is supposed to happen in AI right we just saw one UPI which was enabling digital payments and we know what it has impacted your life. Just imagine if you

have 1500 UPA moments coming because of AI because AI will affect every walk of life. When that moment come and billions of people do that the data capacity which as of now is 3 G projected whether

it will go to 6 G, 9 G, 10 G all of us are scared to even imagine that and again I'm saying that is the opportunity which India need to build up for for itself. Great part is government is

recognizing it. You must have realized you must have seen the tax holiday which government has given in the tax uh you know in the budget this year for 20 years and what India ising now that not

only India serves its AI to its own for its own use case to its own citizens but can we also start bringing the global demand right into India serve from India. So I would say the industry is

gearing up for this. We as a industry are building data center capacity. Uh you must have seen many announcements you know even by uh Y itself by Jio by Tata by global majors who are putting in

data center capacities. We ourselves in the last two years we have built almost 10,000 Nvidia you know GPUs in fact so happy that Abishek sockets model is getting

on GPU clusters. uh in the next 2 days you'll hear a big announcement from us and you will hear that announcement from Nvidia as well how we scaling our GPU capacity multiffold you know to make

sure that when India's use cases start getting into production right India is never short of the GPU supply the compute layer and the hidden layer is always available and I'm sure we will

hear similar announcement from multiple players because everybody has seen I would say tasted blood now right what we were visualizing two years back that India is scale to that. Thanks to India,

thanks to government initiative, thanks to government funding these GPUs and giving to startups, you know, brilliant startups like socket, we will see lots of model announcements in this event

itself. So, I think we are gearing up building data center layer and building GPU layer two years down the line, we will not even talking about that computation.

So, when this uh this race started right at the time there was very less licensing privacy concerns were lesser right lot of data was available which is on in public domain now if you see

people are trying to uh kind of putting these uh like doors behind and and then you need to have a very restricted access to the data and when I'm talking about this data this is data [snorts]

which was available three years back but now is not available right so this question goes to you like uh again if you talk about like if really want to build this big like a big big AI

ecosystem within Indian boundaries but the data scarcity is again becoming a major water right so do you think the kind of regulations which are coming up uh so there should be a a kind of a a

distinctive or a difference between the the entities which which are coming up from India or the entities and the entities which are coming outside from India and maybe they're serving the same

people India India Indians right so what is your view on that So, so um uh as a regulator &gt;&gt; we do a lot of analysis. uh we also know

how these models need so much of data and I'm told that all the standard models have kind of taken all possible data available there on internet to train their models billions trillions I

don't know what all the tokens are but then whenever we go to a discussion on a global level we have always seen that the question was How strong is your data protection?

&gt;&gt; Right? So there was a GDPR on one side crosser privacy rules uh on the other side of &gt;&gt; until we had our own DPDP act and the rulesp rules which got

we were at a disadvantage. countries or jurisdictions were a bit skeptical as to how will this jurisdiction or our country handle the data. Now with this out of our way

&gt;&gt; probably uh we see a good seat at the table and this can open up things like what we are discussing today called data corridors between different countries right so I'm not talking about the data

required to train the model that all of you know it uh and uh the kind of challenges the multimodel nature of it how we need to get the bias and model poisoning out all those things are known

but I'm thinking I'm talking about something more strategic when you have a bridge between two countries multiple jurisdictions crossber data how does it go that that's a very different

perspective and a ball game than just for our own country so when you're saying global south I want to be leading the global south we need to re-engineer some of these corridors or you know the

pathways which we're thinking and just think about the possibilities right uh For example, to give an example from the financial sector I represent, if your KYC is portable

across countries, what happens? So business here, an MSME here, right? or an individual here you have this passporting mechanism because of this data corridor to take your

business your identity your entity to a different country likewise the other way around. Now this is going to kind of create this leadership space which we need to be in and that in turn is going

to feed into all of your AI models here because now your AI is not just restricted to a narrow jurisdiction because of the data restriction. Now you're just talking about really being

the leader in that space and that is exactly what we need to aspire to because now that with the implementation timeline kind of put in for DPP I expect that to kind of be a good handshake with

the kind of development which is happening in the AI space together so that you know we kind of create that perfect environment or the perfect storm as they would call it so that we can

just cross over to the Rubik because the as they say data is oil very cliche but inherently that data is what needs to bring in a trusted ecosystem because in financial

world for us everything is in trust so if that data cannot be trusted let's say there is a lot of hallucination as we call in the AI space then how do we take decisions on that so forget about

cross border within our own jurisdiction we need to make sure it it can be reliable. So there are other possibilities probably I was just thinking a marriage of technologies

while AI hallucinates probably a distributed ledger or a blockchain kind of gives you immutability probably a marriage of those two will

help us not sure but that's something worth trying for us in the long run because that's when we get the best of all worlds to really be talk on the data.

Thanks. So Sahil uh last question for you actually. So again suppose we build this nice uh infrastructure to uh train these models right. So last thing which remains still unanswered is the

deployment aspect. Right. So do you think uh we have you have reached a state where cloud based deployment can the HP deployment or like there is still lot like a long way to reach that kind

of a thing. So the thing is more on the scalability. So how we can scale these departments? &gt;&gt; Yeah, I think that's a very good question. So I would just like to build

on what you said, right? You talked about refinery, you talked about, you know, the fuel and everything, right? Now it's talk, let's talk about the petrol pumps and the filling spaces,

right? That's where you need to deploy the whole infrastructure to get that to the you know end consumer and that's where the data will be consumed or the tech will be consumed in the consumer's

hand that is for the consumer. But B2B also comes into picture right. So today if you see as I mentioned earlier as well the compute is moving in people's hand as well. Today you can run a 7B 10p

model on device along with that ASR TDS model running on device because that's where immediiacy is required right and then I think we talked about how India has basically adopted the tech right not

just you know tech in terms of the services but say tech in terms of 4G 5G when 4G was you know uh in people's hand you know everybody started you know having the smartphones right similar

fashion if you see what will happen now that you know if AI has to be served has to be democratized. It has to go in people's hand. Now you cannot run a bigger model for sure but

as honorable you know minister also said in his remark at Davos that you know from 40 to 50 billion parameter is the sweet spot for a country like India where most of the work is done right you

don't have to be like thinking about a 500 million parameter model now the data consumption I was mentioning right so if you can run say small ASR TDS model on device those are the speech models right

uh you don't send everything to the cloud you just send the text to the cloud. It brings down the overall compute or the you know data connectivity requirements down and also

it basically takes your you know latency down. So I believe with new tech coming into devices with GPU NPU sitting in the devices uh and it is growing from different sort of devices when I say you

know from mobile to cars to even a sound box right that's where real deployment happens and I think if you see it is all about hybrid architecture which will you know in future be deployed and with open

claw and you know agents coming into picture Now you have all your apps sitting on the phone right you can take lot of decisions and just send the output to the cloud. So that deployment

if you can run it on device and then the final you can say confirmation or final uh you know uh engagement can happen to the cloud that's the real you know India scale deployment you know scenario could

be in my opinion important point uh that he's essentially talking about is local local absorption of various AI models right and various AI use cases. Let me also bring another

angle of data sovereignity as well as data security into the whole picture. So as an example there is something called the cloud act which is there in the US which essentially allows the uh

government of the US to tap into any data center that they deem important for national purposes and extract any data that they want. Imagine today that we are talking about sensitive data which

pertains to India's interests, India's positions. uh sitting in a data center in the US. Now that can be accessed by the US government at any point of time as an example. When we talk about

defense applications in this case, a very important part that complements what Sil is saying is about onremise AI compute and AI infrastructure because when it is onremise on our own soil, we

have better control over who accesses the data, under what conditions it is accessed and that is a very important part of how the growth we also expect to happen because uh in such a case Then

you have uh you have a lot of exciting use cases but also you have the control that you know tomorrow if we are building for the global south if we are building for the world

&gt;&gt; then it is truly ours it is not something that we are relying on someone else for &gt;&gt; okay so I think I've been signaled to stop because we are limited on time so

maybe uh just a quick one uh or quick question and maybe all panelists can answer that question. So what would be one more decision which government of India should make and so that India

becomes the leader not the in in terms of AI production. I think India should declare digital infrastructure as the most essential commodity just like India has been

building the physical infrastructure in terms of highways and railways and airports and everything and we know that is a directly directly proportional to economic growth. Digital highways which

are in terms of data centers, networks, compute capacities has to be treated as an essential commodity, most essential item for the country. Uh India AI mission has been a fantastic

fantastic initiative. uh 2 years back there were no GPUs in India and today we everything which you see in India the model being built and now being getting into production even

we will see some models getting to GTC use cases immediately after this event is all thanks to because government took information and funded this GPU you know capacity which was made available to

startups and researchers. So I would say government should keep on doing this GMs job allocate more funds to this till the time these use cases have their own revenue generating mechanism they become

self-sufficient at that time the government can take its rightful role of a good regulator which they are doing now but till that time government should take these models not only during the

training phase but also during the initial phases of inferencing as well so compute infrastructure for AI most essential commodity that is the decision India should Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Keep it short. Uh it should be atar inference or intelligence which should be there going forward. So if we can control all five layers in India from the you know use case to the power in

between the intra also comes in. If we can do that I think that's where you know you'll see the real Indian AI uh you know going forward. Well uh being a regulator I will look at

things from the lens of risk management. So for me uh what we need to do is uh not uh take the models which we see where either it is free for all or innovation or on the other side where

there is acts for AI and very strong regulation. uh we we need to ensure there's a lot of uh regulatory sandboxes among the regulators so that you know there are guardrails but before the

regulations itself come the startups and the innovators should have access to the rich volume of data with all the financial sector regulators and other sector regulators to build things in a

regulatory sandbox a controlled environment so that you know at the end of the day you don't stifle innovation but you try to kind of encourage it within the guard rail. So that is what I

think we should do right and uh as lending a term from what he just used. We we are all proud about our India stack and the digital public uh infrastructure. I think the DPI should

actually transcend to digital public intelligence going forward. uh in in the world of AI, I think many of you may have heard of MCPS, the model context protocols, which are currently,

you know, doing the rounds for uh more easy understanding of LLMs. I think what India will probably need to develop is its own ICD, India context protocol. Uh that will really help when it comes to

creating uh India specific answer in the world of care. And uh maybe there are certain aspects about Indian language, Indian culture, Indian science etc. which will definitely uh be factored as

part of that and uh hopefully that will help us advance our country in the days to come. &gt;&gt; Okay. I think u I think uh we have to end the panel here.

&gt;&gt; I think I I also see some hands which have been raised. So what I would request is our panel members will be here after this event. So maybe we can have more one onetoone conversations

after this panel. Uh so I'll now hand over this uh stage to our socket team and you can take it forward. Thank you. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; This is this mic's not working.

Uh hello sir uh I'm uh Dr. Jagish Shivari uh professor and ex distinguished scientist is sir my general question uh how is the AI impact different than global

in terms of strategic objectives and innovation challenges sir if you See uh two years back when this whole narrative got built in India that while India is a software service

leader for last three decades and uh you know ultimately it's math and science right and India has been champion in that uh startup ecosystem data sets everything is there in India what's not

there is a compute and that is how this whole India air mission came into picture government had got many objectives at that time many models at that time should we take a US model

which is completely private sector the tech companies investing billions and building a private sector capitalistdriven AI economy. There was a model which was completely government

driven and there was a model which was hybrid of the two. India rightfully so decided to make a hybrid model where government is acting as a regulator as a encourager as a funer also for some time

but allowing private sector to do the innovation right so it's also a balance between innovation and regulation also that's what the past government is still and as you can see multiple times from

prime minister and minister and India mission objective also all the models which are being built funded by India mission will actually be open sourced and all those models actually government

to citizen use cases. &gt;&gt; So what as the name of this event also suggests India is talking about impact instead of AI filling the pockets of deep tech companies India is talking

about AI actually serving the needs of billions of people across different verticals and that is how India is different and that's how India can take its use case to the whole of

&gt;&gt; Thank you so much sir. Thank you sir for such an engaging discussion. Uh we wish we had more time with you. You were very energetic. Uh but we we are short on time as always. Um I now call upon

Abisha Abraal the founder and CEO of Socket AI to felicitate our panelists as well as the moderator. Could you get on the side? Thank you so much.

Please hold on the audience. We have a socket showcase. You want to get inside the frontier lab? Thank you everyone. &gt;&gt; Thank you everyone. We truly appreciate

your time and effort to be with us today. I now call upon Abishek to take you inside the Frontier Lab. What we're actually here for today.

We can just sit five minutes at this point. &gt;&gt; Uh hi, good morning guys. So uh Abishek this side and uh I'm just going to very quickly discuss about the work that we

are doing at socket but I only have like five four minutes to emphasize and uh uh I'll just walk you through the video and maybe talk about the AI initiative and but we are in both uh hall five booth

number five.20 20 and you guys should definitely visit us to go in deeper discussions on how foundation mods are built and what effort we are doing around the AI initiative. So can you

quickly play the video? Yes. So project A is a frontier AI initiative which is supported by the India mission. Under the initiative we are building a foundation model which is a 120 billion

parameter large language model only model. As of now we'll add more modalities to it. uh the current state of the model is that it's in phase one where we are creating a mass and a code

model and to know uh the strength of the IT sector in India and we don't want to like lose out on the opportunity where these code models come in and disrupt the IT sector itself. So we have taken

an initiative in phase one to build out this model. The current state is that uh the 24 billion parameter model it's a fast mixture of expert is being trained as a fantastic cloud of Yoda has been

really helpful to us like in terms of scaling and we have scaled to almost like thousand GPUs. So when I was at IC we used to like take these models on 4090s and all and this is literally like

a dream come true to scale these efforts and literally do a supercomputing at a scale more more uh interactions. So back and code model as of now is a Python coding

model which can do visualizations which can summarize code it's only trained on two trillion tokens and as Sunnis was also saying that it's in the process of getting trained. So if you want to

digitally see how foundation model is built and it's trained what kind of graphs what kind of losses what kind of difficulties we face even on code infrastructure and other things you can

definitely visit us and we'll be more than happy to talk about it. Uh we have been very open in terms of sharing our knowledge, sharing our data sets, sharing what

happy to host you and love to discuss what we have. Thank you so much. [applause] &gt;&gt; Yes, thank you so much. And this ends our discussion and the panel. Thank you

so much. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. Thanks for inviting. &gt;&gt; How are you?
