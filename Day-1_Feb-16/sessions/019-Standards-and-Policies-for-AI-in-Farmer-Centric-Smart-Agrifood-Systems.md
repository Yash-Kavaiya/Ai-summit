finesse. Which one? We are just finished. Yeah, we are obvious.

We can stand here. stand. All right. laptop. Thank you.

One more. One more. One. &gt;&gt; So we can start. Okay. 9:30. &gt;&gt; Should we start? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I'll just introduce all of you and then

you can start it. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Okay. Good morning friends and uh again I would like to welcome you all to this important session which is organized

jointly by Indian council of agriculture research department of agriculture research and education ministry of agriculture and farmers welfare along with the far huffer hi institute that is

in Berlin Germany so all the panelist and moderators are on the dis I'll just introduce I am Dr. Ranil Ray I am looking after ICT in Indian Council of Agriculture Research. So all the ICT

activities I look after. So that is my brief introduction. Then uh we have a moderator Sebastian Bosch. Uh he is a head of the interactive cognitive system group at the Fronhoffer

Berlin Germany. His current research interest includes the modeling of perception, cognition, machine learning, computer vision, and human machine interaction over a wide field of

applications ranging from multimedia, augmented reality through medicines to agriculture and industrial production. So he's here just be behind me. So our next panelist is

uh Atsuko Okodu Okada sorry [snorts] uh and she is a regional director and uh prior to this new assignment uh she was the chief of the ICT and development section of the ICT and

disaster risk reduction division of United Nation economic and social commission for Asia and Pacific that is Cape in Bangkok. Thailand uh from 15 uh 2015 to 2020. At

this case, she promoted the development of regional broadband connectivity and inclusive broadband through the implementation of ACI Pacific information superighway initiative. So

she's here. Okay. Then uh next panelist is uh professor Su Chowri. Sno Chowri is a professor in department of electrical engineering IIT Delhi. Earlier he was a director IIIT Jodpur and director CSIR,

Central Electronic Research Institute. He has over 350 publications across different journals, national international. He developed a lot of technologies. Uh he has a 15 patent on

his credit and his area of interest are computer vision, artificial intelligence, digital heritage, AR, VR and multi-ensory media. So professor Chowri is there that side. Okay. So next

speaker is our Gopal Patra. Dr. Gopar Patra is currently director CSIR fourth paradigm institute Bangalore India. His major domain of research has been data science, artificial intelligence, cloud

computing, cyber and information security, high performance computing. He has been actively involved in many national programs of AI and data analytics. So Dr. Patra is that side.

He's sitting there. Then uh other speaker is Waler Klema. Uh he's a agricultural counselor at the German embassy, New Delhi, India. A position he held since September 2025.

He brings nearly two decades of experience in international agriculture policy development cooperation agree food system across Africa, Asia, Latin America, Europe. So he has a vast

experience in this area. And then next speaker is Dr. Rabian Sao. He is a principal scientist division of agriculture physics Indian council of agriculture research Indian agriculture

research institute and he has vast experience around 25 year experience in the area of teaching capacity building geospatial science and its application and uh his major research area is

hyperspectral remote sensing UV remote sensing big data analytics and precision farming he is sitting in in the middle then uh Dr. Dr. Ragu Dr. Ragu has joined the

interactive cognitive system group at Fonhaffer HHI as a scientist in digital agriculture in May 2022 and uh he is now chair IT working group on digital agriculture use cases and solutions and

he had lot of experience in the standards and policies of AI. So I would like to welcome all all of them on the dyers and you as you know that uh we have uh some input we need from

the audience also after 30 minutes around discussion we'll uh share a QR code where you can also give your opinions about this session. So thank you very much and I will now hand over

uh the system to the boss. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much Dr. Anil for the kind introduction. So um as you can see we have a highprofile panel here and I'm very much looking forward to this

session. So what we have in mind what we want to do also with you here in the room is to identify priority AI standards gaps policy levels responsible deployment and coordination mechanisms

across international national and sectoral actors for scaling AI farmer centric agri food systems. And we want to leave the session here with a tangible result in the form of a

synthesis of the key takeaways. For this we will follow Davos style discussion. So we have our distinguished panelists here and each of them will give us um five minute impulse or reflections on

their view of on agriculture. Then we will have a created discussion among the p panelists and then we will open the floor to the audience as well. And as Dr. um Raja just mentioned then you're

also invited to um provide your input and your opinion using um the uh the system behind the QR code. So these are ambitions that we have that are pretty challenging for 55 minutes. So forgive

me that I might appear very strict on maintaining the structure of the session and its timing. So say having said this without father ado I would like to ask you atuku son um from ITU to give us

your perception from the lens of global standards international alignment. So where do you see the potential of standards for digital agriculture? Where do we see um challenges and what is the

particular role of ITU in that regard? &gt;&gt; Thank you Sebastian and good morning to everyone. First of all, I would like to start thanking the organizers for inviting ITU to this very important

session and I'd like to to answer your question start with the introduction on our organization ITU and I hear that of course many of you are already involved in the ITU's work but I'm not sure if

the audience is aware of who we are. So let me ask you I do you know who ITU International Telecommunication is? Please raise your hand. Thank you. You are my heroes. [laughter]

But let me explain for the other audience who may not be aware. Uh ITU the International Telecommunication Union is the oldest UN agency. We just celebrated 160th anniversary last year

and we are the specialized agency for digital technology. So some of you may know that we have three distinctive areas of expertise. One is the radio communication. So we assign satellite

orbit and we do standardization that I will speak more and we have development to connect the unconnected and promote sustainable digital transformation. Now on this topic of uh digital uh

agriculture and standards, we have a very uh robust and the standardization work as uh you may have seen it has over 200 AI related standards which were already approved

and 200 more in the pipeline. So we have about 500 or so uh in our um book so to speak. Now what does it look like in specifically in the area of agriculture? I think is the question that you want to

ask. So we have a few study groups. They are the group of experts who go deep into the topic and questions and to come up with the standards which are the international best practices and these

are these are critical for the democratization of AI in digital agriculture because not all countries are equipped to start from the from zero right so when you have standards it's

easier for countries to kickstart from where the standard ends. So that 200 plus plus standards and some of them related to agriculture to me is a critical building blocks to really start

and build uh applications on top of that. So do you want me to uh give a few examples or I should come back later on. &gt;&gt; Please give some examples. I think that you help the audience and also me to um

to really understand what it is doing there. &gt;&gt; Thank you. So some of the work that we do with FAO in particular, we have a focus group on AI and IoT in digital

agriculture and that group is a global platform to share knowledge and to experiment the proof of concept so that the global best practices could be shared widely. We

also have uh very specific uh areas of uh agriculture uh working on specifically on the standards such as uh smart livestock farming based on IoT. These are some of the the standards

which are already approved as well as smart farming based on network technologies. And uh um I can also uh promote that there's a new study group 21 which is

working on machine vision based farm intelligence uh inspection mechanism. So these are some of the uh the standards which have already been approved or in the pipeline specific to the digital

agriculture and I'll be very very happy to discuss what that means uh to all of us as well as to me. But one more thing if I can add uh I was just talking with Sebastian a few minutes ago. We had a

similar but different standardization related conversation in 2024 here in this venue at this margin of IMC and some of the audience came back and asked but what does it mean to me you know

because we don't have connectivity we don't have capacity so what can I do with the standard that you are talking about so I have actually some updates I have an answer to that question in case

this audience is interested on how concretely we are applying the standards for the benefits of policy makers and farmers but I will wait for your next question.

&gt;&gt; Thank you so much that was a great summary. So in my understanding so what ITU is providing is a framework that leads to standardization for interoperability and democratization

with the regulatory potential basically and it's alo also providing the means and the methods to democratically um converge with different stakeholders towards these standards. So I I guess it

would be great to hear the opinion also a standards lens from Dr. Shalig Gandhi who is sharing who's raptor of the newly established stretch on digital agriculture at the ITU in studying group

20 I believe so I will just hand over the microphone then I'm very much looking forward to hear your perspective thank you Sebastian so very good morning before I go to to the standards but I

would like to highlight the previous session we're talking some of the panelist clearly mentioned that we don't need innovations more but we need more about scale how do we scale these

innovations and how to bring to the grassroot level that that is the major challenge so I was just looking and some literature and googling then I I realized and that more than

thousand governmentalled agriculture portals are exist in the global level if you come to very specific to India we have 75 portals already exist and A recent press bureau of India released

the 2018 startups very specific to agreech was registered in India. So the question is that the startups or portals or the platforms whatever how interact each other and how what kind of

interoperability standards they have whether they are duplicating the same thing again and again and again so that exactly that plays a role what it you be talking about standards to avoid this

duplication to have a more integrated approach and a common approach so that So and another major challenge come to the farm level. So we're talking about the

small scale farmers. We have 800 millions and come to India we have 130 million small scale farmers. 70 to 80% far from a small scale less than one hector. How to reach them? How to bring

the innovations and digital technology toward the doorsteps? That could be major challenge. And what is the logic of necessity for the farmers? Farmers they want less

input cost are to reduced and production increased and better price for their produce. These are the major three things they want. I guess I'm sure the technology they

might not think about that but these are the logic of necessity and the farmers think about that. So what we promising that AI could deliver and to minimize the input cost and maximize the

productivity this could be the most of the slogan what we're talking in the global level so and that exactly the focus group I don't like to go more deep you already

mentioned about the focus group aiming to address these small scale challenges and as always the sustainable development goals so being a working group chairperson use case and solutions

at the focus group level and I got an opportunity to assess more than 60 plus use cases at the global level and these use cases I believe most of them in a prototype

there there are very good results but to come to the practicality still not reach the farm level so that motivate us to to develop a project together from HHI and submit uh funded by the federal

minister of food and agriculture from Germany together with agriculture university in Telangana and Talangana government and Hagab incubation center there are any number of startups are

coming and dying but how do we integrate them so we made a very good experiment in the local level bringing the all the startups together and also to have a interoperable platform so they can

communicate they deliver the solutions in a more integrated manner I don't need to somebody app I need the weather app I need a thousand apps farmers have no time they have other things to do so

better more integrated approach so they better advisories to the local level. So we did very successfully and we are very proudly say that more than 30% of the pesticide usage redu pesticide use uh

chemical use was in reduced so this was sorry &gt;&gt; no it's okay &gt;&gt; okay so this one exactly because while we integrating all the startups and

knowledge sorry I take less too much okay &gt;&gt; okay so bringing the solution to to the more the farm level. So my question um my

understanding is that how we integrate our interoperable things and we have an other project with JZ together in Telangana we're doing the sil mapping. So what we promised in Telangana doing a

digital platform much more interoperable. So we also integrated the data from the GZ um other style mapping in the platform together with the Telangana digital public infrastructure

rather than duplicating things. So my opinion very important to that three aspects were interoperability and governance. So how we can govern? There are 117

I I institutions there in India and more than 700 KVKs and 17 agriculture universities. Apart from that their public departments and agriculture line

departments we called agro whatever animal husband fisheries all together just going to finish the so use potential that use data is lying in the silos. how we can use better use the

silos to bring them together to have a vent public platform so the the betterment of the agriculture decision support system. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much for um Dr. Shali

Ganti for this insight. I believe that two of the um startups that are incorporated in the in the you mentioned are here carbon mint and delta things. So thank you guys for being here as

well. Before we switch gears and take the um the research um perspective into into account, I would like to since you mentioned to German um funding already, I would like to um briefly turn our

perspective on the government um policy and the international um cooperation and we have here have Mr. Klema here from the German embassy in New Delhi. So maybe you could just share your

perspective on standardization on digital agriculture and the related aspects that we are discussing here today. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much also on behalf of

the German government a warm welcome and thank you for having me here on the on the panel. Actually I would like to start with also the slogan of the AI summit. People planet progress. So when

we talk about people, planet and progress, we definitely have to talk about agriculture. And now also talking about AI, we have to talk about AI in agriculture. That means also that we

from the government side we have to place agriculture back on the agenda highly on the political agenda because agriculture is done by the farmers up to our understanding right now

and there will be farmers also in the futures. But how will these farmers look like? Because I think also in this room there are almost none farmers or who's a farmer?

&gt;&gt; Okay. Okay. Okay. So at least there are some farmers but the majority still most likely comes from another uh institution. It's got a different um educational background but not farming.

So many new actors appear when we talk about AI in agriculture and as it was mentioned from one of my speakers before on the previous panel uh we have to think about uh a paradigm

shift. So how does agriculture look into the future and that's why government has to support this transformation of the food and agriculture systems and definitely has to put the real farmers

who own the land who work the land small scale medium farmers back in the center and also on the political agenda because outside this room there are plenty of other sessions about automotives about

urbanization energy whatsoever. But when we talk about governments, we talk about budgets, budget cuts, we talk about public funding, private funding, we talk about um farmers engagement. And here I

would like to dive also a little bit deeper when it comes to AI. We are well aware that AI is new. It's an innovation. But also farmers has been dealt with innovation since centuries.

It's nothing new. So many farmers they are already quite ahead of what the uh what we are talking about here right now and I think the government has to base its support to the farmers but also

to the science and research institute to the uh business um uh companies uh with the perspective of the farmers but also taking into account income for the farmers of food security for society. So

there are also two different layers we have to take um into our onto our balance sheet and also when it comes to um the recommendations I would definitely say AI is new government must

be involved government must push and let's say just talking from the experience in Germany we support about 14 experiment fields in Germany with different AI technologies we after doing

research, we have to scale it up. So we support 36 uh projects for scaling up AI in the food and agriculture sector. But then research is nothing for itself. So it must also serve a purpose and the

purpose is also businessdriven. So if you want to have a kind of sustainability and definitely an inclusion of farmers, you must make a business case out of it. ask farmers to

do their startups, ask universities, research institutes to uh start a business and think differently and definitely as it was mentioned before outside the box. So it must be farmer

centered. I already mentioned and interoperability is very very important because you are um getting data and you are developing data from different sources and it all

must be that brings me also to ITU standardization. So if you collect your data, you must standardize the data. But of course, internationally, but also nationally when I look at Germany, well,

it's sometimes also quite challenging to get the data to compare data and definitely when it comes to climate, climate change, different areas and it was also mentioned uh in uh the panel

before and I really really like the the word unpredictability. Agriculture remains unpredictable and I would like to close my session with a with a slogan of a very famous tire

brand but I want to change it. Power is nothing without control but actually I would uh rephrase it and say AI is nothing without farmers. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much Mr. Klema. you

mentioned research already. So I think this is a good good place now to um switch over to um our panelist covering with a research background. So I would like to start with you Dr. Zahoo from

ICI to take the lens of agricultural science and pharmaceentric deployment and building maybe also on the previous um panel contributions. So for which core agricultural sectors can we already

set credible and predictable task uh targets maybe for AI based technology and what institutional changes are needed to close the gap among different &gt;&gt; Uh thank you Dr. Sebastian and thanks to

the organizer giving this opportunity to be here uh in collaboration with uh German government HHI and IO and before I start I would like to tell to ma'am uh we had

a international I2 conference over here in the Aisha campus itself with more than 30 countries participation in uh March 2024 and we had a detailed discussion about

the data interpolability and standards and Dr. Sastan and many of them were here who are more of the here in the panelist. Coming back to the initiatives and challenges what uh uh Sastan was

asking is uh what are the AI targeted disciplines or the stories which can be low hanging right now with the success stories. I look at the agriculture in ICR has taken two big initiatives. one

on the smart agriculture looking at the uh crop health looking at the soil health looking at the post harvest livestock and also aquaculture uh having almost uh 100 uh 13 research

institute 70 universities and 731 KVKh so if you look at the some of those sectors which can be targeted immediately a success story is with respect to the crop health and the soil

health lot of databases available Irrespective of the institute the organations what we have we have Indian space riches organizations we have a directly monitoring system for the crops

crop classification acreage yield estimations for 13 plus crops looking at the soil we have a national level program on the soil health code and also we are looking at uh taking care of some

of those technologies uh AI and sensor technologies for digital soil mapping many states already we have been doing looking at Weather forecasting we has to some extent we are success and again

that has reached to a maturity level with respect to the forecasting with medium and short range weather forecasting and also based on the advisories which has been again uh put

on the big network program through the universities and also research institutes. uh but challenge remains is uh with respect to the infrastructure data infrastructure and computational

facility if you look at the soil crop and weather they're very complex interactions they have that's what where we look at the AI and the integration of them and the challenge again remains is

the drifting and the diversity what we have so it's not the same generic model we can create for for whatever you do for the soil or crop health we need to do uh per sight specific and uh making

it successful and operational and that's the reason why data standard is very very much important looking at some of the gray areas where yet to roll out to the field level using AI is like

previous uh session we have been talking is on the precision livestock we have not penetrated much because of the marginal holders you know you go back to the

countryside we don't have that kind of a holding what you have in Europe or advanced countries with respect to livestock populations and monitoring them to bring the precision. But we have

some technologies already taken up some initiative we have taken with the different research institutes. Same also looking at the aquaculture mapping digitizing those aquatic ponds their

environment looking at locus IoT senses for the health of the aquatic environment and also the fish and both in marine and riverine. It has been a challenge but there are many initiative

success stories what we have looking at the uh putting them together the technological commercial and institution level framework how we can take up is uh you know already the government of India

has taken some initiative on the uh DPI digital public infrastructure there's a big initiative what has been taken off and many um organizations have joined hand to make it uh interoperable data

infrastructure which can be use pan India that's what the standardized structure and the different layers is going to be created looking at the weather looking at the soil looking at

the crop and also digital data of each farmer is going to be available with respect to his uh his socioeconomic conditions also is a record and the kind of crop he's growing too again challenge

remains is the policy policy governance where the data data interpolability already those concerns has been shared I don't want to repeat the same thing over here standardizing them is very very

important and second part remains is encouraging the startups working together with the public private partners to be umbrella so that we can make whatever the research we do in the

four world labs it goes to the field and making it operable and make a business model and again the the the the last mile is the farmer we should look at the participatory approach approach how best

we can put them together integrate them together in confident taking into confidence the the the farmer into into picture and all around and there are some initiative what has been taken

government of India looking at uh look at the drone diagram there's one of the great initiative of government of India vision of honorable prime minister is how to empower the farmer that to lady

uh farmer so these are some of those initiatives examples which has been we have been trying but yet a lot to go before we sleep. Thank you very much. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much. Um thank you very

much for these insights. I have to admit that also I I I announce to be very strict on the time. I failed on that. So um I would like to ask the next speakers to be very brief because that would give

us the opportunity to get the audience in as well. I'm very sorry about that. That's on me. Um, nevertheless, so I'm I'm very happy to have you here, Dr. Shui from IIT. So from the lens of AI,

innovation and trusted development, so what is your perspective here on when it comes to when it comes to um to digital agriculture and the regulatory frameworks?

&gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. So okay, thank you. Uh, okay. Let me thank uh the organizers to making me part of these initiative. So what I wanted to talk about is

slightly different from agricultural innovation but looking into the ecosystem of the country today there are large number of startups in the agree space. There are initiatives from the

government in to have interventions in the agriculture space driven by AI and ICR also is having a number of projects in that area. But what is missing in the overall

scheme of things which is also an academic challenge the governance structure and I think that is something which is extremely important to address today

because whatever AI we bring in we need to bring that in with appropriate accountability mechanisms because if AI is driving the public decision making regarding agriculture and agricultural

advice who will be accountable able about the regarding the quality of the device and this is fundamentally important because it's it impacts livelihoods. It it therefore must be

clearly monitored should be traceable and should be challengeable. And this contestable advice is something very very critical because that only can guarantee the advice which is being

provided for is provided for the purpose it is intended and not for other kind of business interest or other interventions which are not ethical because these points in many cases when you look at

agriculture is not really addressed. The other very important point is that if we really have AI, AI today is coming in terms of models. Now therefore if we are there has to be a process of

registration of models. models cannot be applied and used irrespective of the registration and registration should have a process and protocol defined because without that protocol what is if

I say that I I ensure 99% accuracy 99% accuracy doesn't mean anything this is with respect to the data you have collected and how general is the performance across multiple stakeholders

multiple scenarios and particularly in the Indian context if you look card the farming lands are fragmented. The soil property is also dependent on the history with which the land has been

used. So therefore if we actually make an AI predictions on the base of land that may suffer the problem of drift from one plot to another plot and therefore this drift invariance or the

drift as a problem being addressed in the AI model is something fundamentally important in the country because there is a random variation of weather that we are seeing because of the uh weather

changes global warming and the impact act on the basis of the data that we have obtained in season one may not remain valid in season 2 and therefore how do you adopt that and that's an open

problem because without that governance or measure I think we cannot use AI to be to the application scenario the last point what I want to talk about is that there are multiple measures which are

today coming in in terms of looking assessing the reliability of AI it is not just accuracy We typically talk about in a research what is the accuracy of prediction but

accuracy of prediction is al also within a closed world assumption and if we have to take it outside in a real application level we need to relax that closed world assumption and bring in other factors

and noise to actually perturb the ecosystem the data possibility to see how stable the model is and the models have to be also pro managed by national commons because just like we are talking

in terms of data commons in terms of the data which is being in the public space the models when they graduate they should come to the level where it becomes a public property and once it's

a public property there has to be a protocol of management of commons I think these are some of the things which are not just administrative but these have got lots of challenge and challenge

related to AI technology and adoption and improvement and and innovation in the AI space. So I think some of these problems needs to be addressed if you really want to make this AI as something

really serving the needs of the nation and people. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much Dr. Shari. Yeah. Um for for your perspective with the focus of on models and models

properties. So if you change the persp um perspective and look at the data now I think then um you Dr. Patra you are the the the expert to talk about this. So in how far would you think that um

digital infrastructure and data um um architecture is um relevant here and what sort of properties should we um assign to the data and demand from the data.

&gt;&gt; Uh thank you good morning everybody and thank you for having me here. uh see there is a difference between uh people feel the national digital infrastructure means data platform

that's not true there is a much more than data platform there in the national uh when you could talk about a digital platform where do we talk about a foundational uh infrastructure which can

which are intero inter interoperable and also secure in that sense so uh India has been doing very well in such scenarios such as we have this Aadhaar and other infrastructures if you look at

the digat diatra dig lockers all those digital infrastructures which are doing very well. Looking at that when you come to agriculture agriculture is one of the major boosts or backbone of our economy.

So we have to look at applications that are based on the digital infrastructure. So uh I I come from a state of Karnataka and K&amp; DMT the Karnataka state disaster management center works very closely

with us. they provide farmers daily uh uh kind of advisories and other things on on mobile applications. Based on that I see that in even in at the central level there are lots of efforts which

are gone. There is something uh a new initiative or mission project on digital agree culture had started in 2024 by the government of India by the ministry of agriculture and there they have defined

something called agree. Agree stake is the infrastructure this which is supposed to provide the digital infrastructure for agree or form related studies. Uh the problem that we see in

the current agree stack is that it has two layers. One layer is the registry layer which provides the authentication and registration of farmers. Then registration of land records. The what

kind of crops these lands they do produce or what kind of facilities like irrigation machineries or the sensors that these farmers do that is being collected as a part of the registry

which is done by at the state level. At the central level they look at how to basically the transaction level where they actually talk about how to disseminate these information for

various purposes. The purposes could be many anything like the Kishan the PM Kishan uh schemes or giving credits credit Kishan credit cards or procurement of minimum sales price all

those things are derived out of that also the soil card and other things are done in as part of that. uh but the thing what is missing basically is a middle layer which has

supposed to be the intelligence layer which needs to provide more analytics or intelligence out of the data which is provided and professor Sanru Chri talked about the AI part of it how it can be

done but the moment you plug in this AI part that that's where comes the major challenge because we have the issues related to privacy we have the issues related to how to kind of take care of

the the various requirements of the farmers and who should have the facilities. For example, I can provide this data to banks for provide finding out the kind of credit scores and other

things. I can provide the data to insur insurance insurance companies who can look at the kind of the uh when they give give kind of insurance what should be their various ways to look into the

amount of insurance and other things and also v various other things that is being uh looked at. But then the issue comes whether we have taken the farmer's consent or not. So if we follow the DPDP

act and the methods properly I think we should be able to have a very good architecture for establishing a digital infrastructure and the moment we put that we should have the accountability

because any AI model we could should not be able to just blindly use it. We should look at a kind of a traceability so that if tomorrow there is a problem somebody should be able to find out

where the mistake has happened. Such systems are not yet available plugged into the while it is already there for example UPI payment is there there everything is already done so it's easy

for us to migrate from such techn such bring those kind of innovations to the agree sectors and uh put it and the certifications AI models like somebody said in the morning innovation doesn't

mean progress I think AI need to get into the governance not just as an advisory thing it should actually get into the decision-m process and that is where the middle layer which is right

now missing in the architecture of the governance should be actually included and uh we need to look at various regulation frameworks uh about the AI things that's something which I think

still a debatable thing how to how to find out rules and regulations to to handle the AI things and also when when it comes to agriculture I think AI models are specific to a region so we

need to even look at for various regions how it works the agro agro climate jones and all how it works that also is very very important and also the periodic recalibration of all these AI models and

all because like he talked about the drift over time the things change so we cannot use the same model again and again so we need to do a recalibration of those models so this is a typical

architecture I feel should be working well for the Indian context because we have small farmers not like big farms small farmers so these are something that I thought we should have thank

Thank you very much Dr. Gupal. So this is interesting um to see this panel was very interesting with all our contributions because this was a very wide and diverse set of perspectives

very compliment complimentary very very synerggetic so I found it very exciting. So what I would like to know from the audience is what sort of key takeaways do you get

from this session from this discussion and what sort of input and opinion do you have on the topic of standards and poly policy pathways for scaling AI enabled pharmaceentric agri food

systems. Time is running quite a bit so we have prepared a QR code so you are very much welcome to provide your input there. we will consider this and we will um come up with a report over the next

couple of days or weeks [clears throat] that is incorporating your perspective here as well. So please um just take a take a take a picture of this of this um QR code. It will lead you to a Google

form with prepared questions and then you can provide your input there. And um if you uh put also your email address and affiliation that's optional then we can can directly update you also about

the resulting document that we came up with. So we are very close 55 minutes is surprisingly challenging. So we are very close to the end now and um given all these um wonderful reflections that we

heard already, I would like to give the um the panelists another chance to um basically sum up their key takeaways that they get from this got from the session um today and um

&gt;&gt; no no we we are running we are running out of time. Please, please, please, please. &gt;&gt; Please, please. &gt;&gt; See, see, we

&gt;&gt; you are a farmer. You can &gt;&gt; your agenda. You &gt;&gt; No, that's not true. So, no, that's not that's not true. We are we we have and I'm very sorry about this, but we have

this limit of 55 minutes. We have to stick to the format to the format and you are very much so you can you can look at all the other sessions and then you can count how many QR codes you

find. You can count how how often you will be asked to provide your input and I assure you that it's less than 10%. So this is all that we can provide. I'm sorry about this given the framework.

&gt;&gt; Okay. So you can scan the barcode and provide your inputs and whatever feedback you will give will incorporate in the recommendations. So please do that before we wrap up.

&gt;&gt; Thank you so much. So I would just follow now just the linear order here that I find to my to my left to to get the final reflection of the panelists. We have um it's not really clear to me

five to 9 minutes left. So please be sure about it and um looking forward to what you take away from the inputs of of the distinguished colleagues of yours. &gt;&gt; Thank you Sebastian. I just want to

follow up to what I was saying and the discussions on policy and research which came up from uh the panelists and I also get asked very frequently. So how can I use the standards in my own work? So um

in response to that as well as the request from uh uh the the uh the beneficiaries we started uh conducting a series of capacity development for example do you know how to find the

standards that I was talking about right and how can you participate in the standard setting platforms like the working groups and focus groups that I discussed. So we have been conducting a

series of regional workshops to build the capacity so that you know what exists and what more you can contribute and use. So I hope that in a very future uh very near future all of you can join

our effort to develop more standards and to use the standards for uh farming as well as business and innovation. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much. I will just pass on

the mic. &gt;&gt; Thank you. So I just keep it short to content. So what I take away is that bottom line more interoperability and governance are the centerpiece and if

you align with standards and platform and policy. So digital application move from different pilot schemes silos to more integrated system approach and which is more standardized approach. So

thank you. Just quick keywords are uh reasonable data availability with the standards and second one is uh institutional framework uh infrastructure

and proven pilots seeing is living and clear commercial pathways with PPP public private partnership. My key takeaway would be capacity building and exchange especially as AI

with the new technologies. Uh it's kind of very new. I also had well I'm reading quite a number of papers. So governments, business companies, farmers, research and um

and science institutions uh we all have to learn and we have to learn together and that's why also Germany is engaged in India with several projects working in the AI um agriculture sector and I

think just together we can then also build for the young people also the new future with AI. Thank you. &gt;&gt; See I shall go back to these uh the point which was being maintained in

terms of agree stack that middle layer. I think that's a key requirement today and and also we need to build up the capability and research based approach in terms of measurable AI for

because the agriculture if AI has to be used we need to have confidence in that AI reliability and confidence in that AI is actually the key challenge I think that we need to have built a protocol in

parallel parallel to what the core research is happening even confidence in the data that itself is a question which needs to be addressed I think these are some of the issues if you don't address

them in parallel whatever initiative is happening in startup space in research institutions will not really get translated and adopted by the farmers on field thank you

&gt;&gt; yeah I think to add to his points authenticated data is essential if you want to really use AI in any space because until unless the AI the data is reliable uh there is what you you give a

garbage you will get a garbage out because AI doesn't understand the reality so that's very important so just to conclude my statement I'll say that AI in agriculture is in Indian context

if you want to scale it I think AI is the only way of using it otherwise you will not be able to scale the architecture but it is not only the models which needs to be scaled I think

the how it is being import like incorporated into the governance that is very important because uh you models are being developed improved those those things are going on as a researcher we

do that but then we don't really know when it is put into the governance how it will behave so that's very important aspect that we need to look into when we really talk about AI in um agriculture

thank you &gt;&gt; yeah thank you thank you very much so um this was a excellent session I find. So it was very interesting and once again thank you all for providing your

expertise and from what I take away from here this is something that um is my impression since quite a long time. So there is this famous quote by William Gibson a science science fiction author

that is the future is already here it's just not equally distributed and that seems to be the case when it comes to AI and digital in in agriculture as well. So there is quite a lot of solutions out

there. It's just that it's very difficult to bring them out or the challenging part. Maybe it's not really difficult. Maybe it's challenging and we have to figure out the right means to

how to bring this to the farmers to the field in a sustainable and viable way that is supporting the bene the needs of the farmers and also caters to um new business models for example. And um from

what I can see here from this uh panel, this was a very nice um nice discussion that was really taking a multi-dimensional 360 degree perspective where um all the different dimensions

like technologically data and machine learning and the interaction between between those two fields as well as the other dimensions of governance and regulatory aspects. So what are the

actual needs to put this into place on the regulatory framework including properties of machine learning like data uh quality sorry model um um quality and the the corresponding

um challenge of accountability when it comes to the to the to the to the data outputs the the data products of these models. And this directly in relation to the governance aspects when it comes to

how to store the data, how to assign the data with the corresponding um requirements that are set by the farmers. So um thank you all was great also to better understand what is the um

the solution that ITU is providing and has quite a successful history in this as well when it comes to providing the regulatory framework on the technological level um to these uh to

these systems with this before I close the session. So I would um once again encourage you to um provide your input here to um to to the session using the QR code and um I regret that we did not

have the opportunity to have an open discussion here. But what I can assure you is that I and I guess some of the panelists as well will be here around here and we would really love to get

into the discussion um after the session or maybe also over the course of the day or the week. Uh so please feel free to reach out to us and um that having said um thank you for your interest, thank

you for being here and I wish you a lot of insightful uh sessions for today and the the week and uh with this I would like to close the session. Thank you once again.

So on behalf of Indian Council of Agriculture Research and Fronhoffer Institute I would like to thank you everybody all the panelist all the participants and as I told all your

suggestions we'll try to incorporate into the proceedings. So again thank you very much and I'll request all the panelists to be here they will give some momentum. Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Uh thank you everyone for joining us and sharing your valuable insights today. Uh on behalf of India AI team, we are providing you a small token of appreciation. Thank you so much.

So much. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Ah, nice to meet you. No.
