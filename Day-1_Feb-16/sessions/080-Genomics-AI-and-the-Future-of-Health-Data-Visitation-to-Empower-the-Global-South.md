## 📝 Summary

Realizing global precision medicine requires infrastructure enabling countries to collaborate on AI-driven genomics. Yet data sovereignty rules prevent collective use of genomic datasets, widening the Global AI Divide. Data visitation—where algorithms travel securely to data rather than data moving to researchers—offers a path forward. This workshop convenes policymakers, technologists, and public health leaders to explore governance, standards, and technologies, showcasing how emerging tools translate policy into deployable infrastructure built with the Global South.
