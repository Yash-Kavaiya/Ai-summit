## 📝 Summary

Realizing global precision medicine requires infrastructure enabling countries to collaborate on AI-driven genomics. Yet data sovereignty rules prevent collective use of genomic datasets, widening the Global AI Divide. Data visitation—where algorithms travel securely to data rather than data moving to researchers—offers a path forward. This workshop convenes policymakers, technologists, and public health leaders to explore governance, standards, and technologies, showcasing how emerging tools translate policy into deployable infrastructure built with the Global South.

## 📝 Transcript

Global south. Okay. Any very few global south is everyone except those who live in global north. Now what is global north people in the western countries right?

Western Europe &gt;&gt; United States of America and some other countries. Only 15% of the people live in global north. 85% of the people live in the global south. Global south is

usually less developed economically. Okay. Have less technology in their daily life. But those are the people who actually need the solution. We in India are one of them. Now why it is important

that the solution has to reach the global south. How much time do I have? We have Thank you. So if you see here people in the global south are under or under represented in the large

databases, right? All the large companies of the world, the Google and the Amazon and the Facebook of the world actually likes to get the data from the large number of people but the models

that they have built is not nec I'm talking about the disease models not necessarily using the data from the global south and the best example is the human genome project one and I'll talk

to you a little bit about it too is the data which was actually using the Caucasian population. Now in addition to that we have a higher disease burden What does it mean? All of you in this

room Indians &gt;&gt; timer &gt;&gt; either know someone &gt;&gt; 45 years &gt;&gt; or have someone in the family who is

diabetic right &gt;&gt; every single one of them say &gt;&gt; wasting our money to the doctor absolutely no benefit from disease &gt;&gt; and this is going to go same with

coronary heart disease so we have a higher disease burden now you can see I'm not going to read all these things to you these are the absolute &gt;&gt; advantages or what we have today in

global But the databases that we use is not coming from the south. And therefore, these are the two examples I've given. Everybody knows the example on the

right. &gt;&gt; For the ones that are not from India, this is one of the very famous people's car. Unfortunately, it's not in production anymore. It's called Tata

Nano. It was introduced with $1,500 like one lakh rupees, but became slowly two two and a half lakhs. This is the most expensive car in the world. The Rolls-Royce, one of the

model of the Rolls-Royce, which is $30 million. Now, you can see here 200 crores. Now, this is the solution of the global north that gives not necessarily a bad solution, but can we afford it?

No. Do we need it? No. Do we want it? Yes. But this is what do we want? We want a solution that is affordable, tailor made for the people of the global south, easily accessible by the people

in the global south, and is actually available openly to everyone. So it's very important that we do it. Now that is the reason global south must lead not follow. Now one of the example is human

genome project 2 and webin is going to talk a lot about that during the panel discussion. So this is the second version of the human genome project. Some of you who are interested can

actually just go to the website and find out and why it is going to be important for the next revolution in human genomics. And then finally one slide about India. What is India or what can

India do to lead this particular process and work with others in the global south? Well, &gt;&gt; these are the different kinds of data in the healthcare.

Okay, this is the information where it comes from. This is the AI tools, the APIs, the frameworks. And to use these AI tools and APIs and framework, we can actually come up with multiple different

solutions in healthcare. Why we can do that? This side is actually no brainer for you. Those of you who are from India that we have a large population, we have a large

you know repare of digital public infrastructure not just the Aadhaar but all of those and we have a staff. So we can use all this information for healthcare data to build solution for

global south not just for India but also for global south but that will require a lot of collaboration and also a lot of talking with other people in the global south. So therefore I think the time of

India is now and if any of you who is interested we will be available after the session to talk to you and to discuss with you. Thank you. [applause]

I think this mic is not. &gt;&gt; Okay, our next speaker is going to be Mava J who is a principal engineer open mind foundation and he's going to tell us about bio a privacy first data

visitation platform for equitable global collaboration bio medicine. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Thank you everyone. Good afternoon. My name is Mara. Um I'm a rare disease

patient. Um I'm also physical engineer of mind where I've been working for the last five or six years on privacy technology. Um, and this talk is on Bios. But, uh, I'm actually from

Brisbane, Australia. Um, but a very long time ago before I was born, my parents lived in India, very close to here. Uh, and they loved your beautiful culture and country so much that they gave me

this name. And so, I wear it with a a badge of honor. So, thank you for inviting me. [music] Um, if there's one thing that I want you to take away from this talk, it's that

you can collaborate globally to discover insights without ever losing control of your private data. So, Bin was touching a little bit on uh, you know, the value of data in AI. This

is an AI conference. Um, and so the question is, you know, if AI has been trained on all the world's public data, what's the next uh, destination? It's going to be the private data that they

don't have. Um, a lot of the conversations at this conference are going to be about um, what businesses could be integrated into AI and what the value is. Um, but

there's a little bit of a concern that these state-of-the-art models could replace all of these different verticals. Um, but I would urge you to read this blog post which is a fantastic

resource which talks about one potential defense against this and that defense is to have a cornered resource. Read it. Sorry, [singing]

Hey, &gt;&gt; give him a second. I'm on the screen. Testing testing. Testing. &gt;&gt; Yeah, mic's back. &gt;&gt; Sorry, guys.

&gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; You think Blue apple. &gt;&gt; something. &gt;&gt; All right, I think we're good. We're

good. Everyone talks about that what is you know potentially defensible in a in a business environment and he

concludes that private data may be one of the only modes and such a resource must be truly exclusive not available for sale at any price and applied for operation

and so I think in the context of biomedical data I would say that meets many of those requirements. It's very private. It's very valuable. &gt;&gt; Um health data is probably among the

most sensitive and valuable categories of data. &gt;&gt; So B was asking if anyone here has in their family type diabetes. Um I think a lot of us here probably um no is unwell.

&gt;&gt; The I think the level rates of uh that are undiagnosed are quite high up to 10% of the population. And I'm one of those people. So many years ago I had a chronic illness that I didn't know I

had. Um, and it turns out that even a few small letters in your genome can mean the difference between life and death. So, uh, my great-grandfather or my grandfather who had this disease, um,

died at age 40. I'm 41. Uh, it's highly like I would have died, uh, last year probably if I hadn't had early intervention. Um, and so I should know about this, but these advances and

benefits, they're not really being shared equally. To's point earlier, I I live in a western country. Um, and I can get that that diagnosis quite easily now. Um, but uh, yeah, we need to make

that more globally equitable. So uh one of the challenges with dat sharing in healthcare is that there are a lot of very important data protection laws particularly around sovereignty um and

these restrict crossber transfer of human data. Um but as you can imagine you know AI operates the best when you add more data. So sharing with biomedical data sets is necessary really

to get to that next level of advancement. So the question is how can we collaborate and when I say we it's it's a collective we um the north south the whole world while preserving our

data sovereignty in each of our countries. [singing and music] Um to help illustrate this I have this diagram um and it's basically function and that's where you have an X and Y axis

with two variables that you're trying to optimize for &gt;&gt; and in this case um on the left hand side on the Y ais we have utility and so at maximum utility we're getting all the

value we want and down the bottom on the x axis we have privacy but what we want there is to have maximum privacy for utility &gt;&gt; and at the moment a lot of what's

happening is by conducting cutting edge research we can get max utility but we have to give up control of all of our data um and so the alternative to say well I don't really want to lose my data

because of all that value I don't want to give it up um importantly data once copied cannot be uncopied and so you should consider you know what does it mean to share and collaborate with data

but if I was to then uh keep it to myself I get zero benefit and so that's not not very good either &gt;&gt; and so really what we want to do is we want to try to occupy this space in the

middle um and actually potentially see if we can get to that top right of the corner and just shoot right off the chart. [clears throat] So let's talk a little bit about some of

these traditional uh data sharing models that people are currently using. Um so in this diagram we basically have uh three different institutions uh and you can see illustrated by their different

um colors and often what will happen is they will take their data and they will upload it or send it raw copies of the data to a data scientist who then brings it all together and does some analysis.

Um, one of the problems with this is that once you copy data, you can't uncopy it. And that means that while you might have a legal agreement with that data scientist, this can still lead to

data leakage. Um, but the most important thing actually here is not the trust. It's the fact that the original data owners may not benefit from that downstream result. You may not realize

this, but often the output, scientific output, the model training, the results are not always shared back to the people who own the data. And so they're being severed

allow them to access that and kind of do their queries and analysis. Um, still have to upload all that data and now you got to pay for it in a second location. If this is medical data, it's enormous.

Okay, some of these data sets are terabytes or pabytes and you got to pay for that as well. The other thing is that once you put it in the cloud, you have to protect it. So now you got

another thing where all your valuable data needs to be protected. Um and more importantly like Vin said this is really only for well- resourced institutions who can afford this. Um but finally it

does not solve the problem we talked about which is that data owners don't get visibility into the how the analysis is happening. They don't get like the granular control they need to be able to

decide on a per query basis or the outputs that are being produced whether they want to collaborate or participate in that and it also doesn't really scale to multiarty which we'll talk about in a

minute. So there is an alternative way a sort of potential third way here um which we uh you know has sort of been coined as data visitation and the idea in the name

there is that we're visiting the data the data is not visiting us &gt;&gt; uh but it allows collaboration without movement of data and so on the left we can see a data scientist or anybody

working with data um and importantly what they're doing is they're sending in code or a question or or a prompt uh and they have a question whether they want it answered

And on the right hand side we have a data owner um who we call these data sites and this is sort of like a website for data um and they retain governance over that data at all times and never

share a copy. All they return is the result of the question the data scientist wanted to ask and if you think about it that's all you shouldn't have to have all the data just have the

answer if that's possible and it is possible and so what we've been working on in this project and as I said earlier I work at open mind um and so you're probably thinking well that's one name

so what is biovolt biovolt is a um implementation of these concepts for the biomedical space and you can see on the right here we have a diagram of how you can sort of envisage what this is a

right of open source privacy first data visitation for equitable global collaboration &gt;&gt; way it works is um we sort of built like an open source peer network um

the technology and the science and the math behind the &gt;&gt; but what we're really focused on is bringing it the engineering problem of bringing it to the people who need it so

we spent a lot of time on developing things like a desktop utility that's really easy to use [music] that runs on Windows for example which a lot of people don't bother with. Um it has

endto-end encryption. Uh and it supports arbitrary analysis through a variety of different um you know extensions with technologies like Nexflow and Jupiter. Um but more importantly it keeps all

your data local right we don't ask you to upload data. There's no uploading data facility. You link the data and you make the data available via sort of a an interface a facade that allows people to

then send in their computations that you can choose to execute against them. Um and more importantly unlike a lot of the existing models we also support um federated encrypted computation and that

allows this peerto-peer network to work in a pointto-oint topology to allow more than two uh parties to basically collaborate together. &gt;&gt; So um we actually I'll talk about this a

little bit more at the end but we have a pre that we just launched on bio archive a few days ago. There's a lot of work from some people in the panel here and some of the people in the audience. Um

so thank you all and uh you can see on the right hand side we check out the papers some figures but some very specific use cases that we wanted to explore that we think are like relevant

and pertinent to real world use. Um and so one of them is the [music] analysis of single cell RNA set. Now this is I'm not a biologist and so it's beyond me but very advanced technology related to

um analyzing cancer cells looking at uh advanced genomics. We can also train machine learning models um which you know is pretty part of the course by now but it's important we demonstrate that

that's possible um and we've done remote inference on very large clinical uh data sets um and more importantly um there's also the option to do uh privacy preserving analysis and so actually we

did some on my own genome if you see in the bottom right hand corner there there's a little graph showing uh like a little count of some variants that I have um that basically to do with my

disease. So that's cool. Um, finally I want to talk a little bit about some real world uh data and real world use cases. So it's not enough to basically um talk about a theor

theoretical bit of technology and try to kind of tell people that they should use it. We need to actually demonstrate that it works in the real world. Um, and we want to build a product um and a and a

sort of experience that is useful by working with real people. And so here are two um pilot projects that we just completed before this preprint. Um, and we don't have time to go into both of

them today, but you will actually hear from Dr. Rana Jani later. um in that little second, but I'd like to focus on the first one here, which is with Dr. Ka Weldon. She's the founder and CEO of

Terogenetics and she's in Bermuda. Um and basically what happens is she has um a Oxford nanopore machine uses to do some sequencing. She also collects samples from a variety of participants

on different islands in the Caribbean. Um and that data that gets gathered is stored by her. And in that earlier um model that we discussed, there was the idea that traditionally to do outside

research, you would have to share that data. And so if Kar wanted to do some of the more cutting edge and research, she would need to upload that data for a researcher in America or something. Um

there's a lot of you know computational requirements. There's expertise. There's a lot of complexity to this. It's not as simple as just having the data. Um but when we u met Dr.

we understood that she had um problems with, you know, working with these data sets. And so what we did was we uh built specific workflows that would work against her data so that we could do

some uh very novel and exciting research. And so in this diagram you can see what we actually did was we had um the desktop application running in different islands and and we sent

through queries and we basically were able to um analyze the alle frequencies for uh different uh populations within um the Caribbean as well as some disease classification. So there's a

particularly um penicious disease that um called AP1 which creates like a chronic kidney disease and they have a very high prevalence in Britney and using our technology we were able to

sort of provide remote analysis in code so that Dr. Kura could um you know verify results that she already had and confirm new results without having to share that data with us. Um

so we were actually uh able to take those illegal frequencies and do something fairly cutting edge. So I believe this is bit of a world first in in a few ways and what we did was um

some of this data has never been analyzed before because of the sensitivity of it. Um but we compared it to uh a thing called Nomad which is a global um sort of uh ancestry and

variant database that shows breakdowns of different ethnicity groups and we're able to compare how it uh compares to those and you can see those plot charts at the bottom. Um and uh yeah, we all

did that all without uploading any data. So we think it's a bit of a world first. Anyway, um so look uh Bio Archive has our uh preprint. There's a QR code there if you want to scan that. Um come talk

to us later if you want to hear more. We'd love to partner with some new people, but also if you're interested in just getting involved in like open source or contributing or have questions

about policy or anything, we have people about it. So, thank you again for listening and uh yeah, &gt;&gt; and actually Dr. Rana was initially going to be here today, but

unfortunately she had a family emergency, so she actually recorded a video for us that I'm going to play for you. Peace upon you all. My name is Reena

Dejani. I'm a professor of molecular biology from the Hashimite University in Jordan. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to join you today in India at the AI summit because my mother passed away uh

recently. Uh and this was a reminder of how our research and science cannot be isolated from our humanity and serving humanity. Ultimately, as scientists, our goal uh is to serve humanity.

Uh I'm a molecular biologist and I work on genetics of ethnic populations in Jordan, the sarcasins and the chhatchins. Uh trying to uncover novel gene risk factors for complex diseases

such as diabetes. I'm also an expert on the epigenetics of trauma in vulnerable communities um such as refugees, Syrian refugees, Palestinian refugees as a result of the atrocities committed by

oppressive regimes and powers around the world. uh therefore I generate many databases that enrich biomedical research globally. Now biomedical databases and

data sets rep usually represent or should represent diverse populations and that diversity is essential for advancing precision medicine and for ensuring that AI systems in health are

accurate, fair and globally relevant. This is especially important for the global south where populations remain under reppresented in biomedical research and AI development without

equitable data sharing health innovations risk reinforcing global disparities rather than reducing them. And that's the reason we're all here today to try to reduce that. Yet much of

this data remains siloed due to registry, regulatory, sovereignty and privacy constraints, existing data sharing models uh all all require complex infrastructure, specialized

expertise and significant financial investments which as a country in from Jordan we do not have. These barriers therefore disproportionately impact institutions and resource constraint

settings limiting their our ability to participate fully in in global collaborations. That is why I was so excited to join the Biovolt [music] team.

Um, Biovault uh provides a practical do domain agnostic framework for privacy preserving biomedical collaboration supporting AI development and genomic research while advancing equity,

sovereignty and global participation in health innovation. Um, we worked with the creators of Bible vault and tested my data sets for the sarcasm and the chessions and were able to reproduce

authentically the results. Uh so this is very promising and I hope you will learn more uh as this panel unfolds. I look forward to such approaches becoming the norm in the future. Enjoy the conference

and the rest of your day and hopefully uh we will collaborate in the future to make this to uh do better science to serve humanity. Thank you and goodbye.

Okay, next we actually have Andrew Sultan who is from University of Oxford and he's going to tell us about fair, scalable and private AI using routinely collected hospital data.

&gt;&gt; Thank you Don and thank you all for coming to our session today. Um, one of my aims today is to talk through a scenario that we faced during the CO 19 pandemic at Oxford University

Hospitals, which is one of the constituent hospitals within the NHS, and talk through a machine learning approach we took to try and solve that problem using data that was already

routinely available to us. I'll then talk a little bit about an extension into how privacy preserving techniques in our case federated learning enabled us to achieve our objectives and talk

about one of the strategies we use for deploying that technology for [laughter] making it available across the NHS and therefore the relevance that that could have to

other settings including for example countries like India and elsewhere and I'd be delighted to have conversations afterwards and and take that forwards. Um so to to set the scene of one of the

core challenges in clinical artificial intelligence is that data is fundamentally siloed. It exists within individual hospitals and those hospitals are separate legal entities and because

of regulation within the European Union and the United Kingdom. That data can't be shared freely without for example the appropriate approvals, the appropriate ethical considerations and a full

understanding of the risk that is involved in that. And so the traditional process is to seek those approvals to relocate that data within either a university or a company or the

organization doing the development to then clean that data and you're already one step removed from the people who understand the nuance and the artifact in that data to develop models to

validate them and then to move towards deployment. And I'll start briefly with a case study um which is the um the work we did at the beginning of the co9 pandemic to build a model that can be

used to rule out CO 19 in emergency departments. Now the big challenge of course was access to testing and even within a relatively high resource setting like the United Kingdom at the

start of the pandemic it would take 3 days to get the result of the CO PCR test. Now that came down to two days and then one day and then 12 hours as on-site testing came on board. But there

were still significant challenges in being able to run a hospital operationally i.e. have patients blow through the hospital with a 12-hour time lap to know if they had COVID 19 or not.

Unfortunately that was implicated in the spread of virus involves patients and to talk through what happens comes in has a set of routine data that is pretty much standard across middle

inome countries and higher income countries made up of your vital signs your blood pressure your heart rate your temperature. So things that are very easy to me to measure, done very

quickly, done very routinely and also panels of blood tests that are routine and are standard of care across the developing as well as the developed world. So this is the real basics um of

of blood testing. Um so performed for almost every patient being admitted within 1 hour. Now patients afterwards are then transferred to the ward. Um but the selection of ward is was guided by

the result of their PCR test. And this is the challenge that we set out to face. Um and the the clinical challenge is that a test that rules out CO 19 within minutes is what is needed. That's

what's demanded in the hospital to make sure that you you have patients who have CO away from patients who don't. Um and so we set out to build the curial um the curial screening test for COVID 19 which

is um essentially working with that tabular data data that can be represented in the table and we went on to to validate the model that we built across four NHS sites. to this would be

Birmingham, Bedford, Portsmouth and then for the second CO 19 wave in Oxford across 72,000 patients and we showed that that model could perform quite well and we were fortunate enough to to then

go on and um pilot our test. We deployed it at the emergency department at the John Neckliff Hospital and for a study of 520 patients showed that you can have a result within 45 minutes of a patient

arriving in hospital. And we showed that we got those results faster than natural flow tests and faster than PCR tests by some hours actually considerably. And so I guess the question here is what does

this have to do with with data security? And this this is um it it gets to the core of one of the challenges of this work. Now &gt;&gt; a big challenge of working with data

from multiple NHS sites is that although every site was aligned in its incentives every site wanted to see a solution for co testing we had significant challenges getting access to data even within the

NHS even where people's incentives aligned and even in the pandemic situation and so we asked the question how can we deal with that data distribution problem how can we deal

with that core challenge that slows down medical research for understandable reasons and approach with a nice technological solution. And of course there are there have been several leaks

in the past several um instances where data has not been handled properly and so there is understanding concern around it and the the technology of federated learning proposes to take out that data

transfer step. So instead of you moving data from hospitals to your secure environment um you perform training by bringing the model to the data and not the other way around. And so in doing

so, you're sending the parameters or the weights within a model which are essentially mathematical numbers that you can't readily infer patient data from. And you can do that in a way

that's secure and encrypted. Um, and there are various technologies around it to to improve that. And so we wanted a platform that in in the early days of federated learning where no one had

heard of it, we needed a platform that anybody could use. We needed it to be user friendly. We needed it to be so that people who didn't have a background in federated learning could just get

this platform up and running. And we used this device called the Raspberry Pi, which is a cheap um small computer. It's the size of your credit card, just a little bit thicker. And it sold for

about £40 in Britain, so it's about 5,000 rupees. Um sorry, yes, 5,000 rupees or thereabouts. Um so it's relatively inexpensive. Um in the world of healthcare technology, it's a

relatively cheap device. And what's nice about these devices is they can run Linux. You can run a full operating system on it with a full user interface. Um, and so we were able to put all of

the software you need to take part in this study to develop a COVID 19 screening test onto these devices and we were able to install Ubuntu onto them, give them a nice user interface that

talked you through everything you had to do. So a hospital needed only plug it into power, plug it into a monitor, plug in a keyboard and a mouse and off you go. You follow the instructions on

screen and take it from there. And of course we had all the governance approvals around it. What's particularly nice about this device is it uses a removable micro SD card. And these cards

are very very cheap. They're about4 to5 at their cheapest in Britain. So that's around 600 rupees or so. Um and so the cards at the end of that work can be taken out and destroyed securely in the

same way as hard drives are destroyed at the end of life. So you can be certain the data within the hospital has been safely um controlled, fully controlled. Um, and we were able to show that if we

were to do that, so to send out devices to the hospitals and perform the training on these devices while they're physically within the hospitals, that we can produce a model,

produce a model that was the highest um that that had more consistency in its performance as it had seen a greater range of data. And we were very pleased with the results of that and

particularly that we were able to show that we could use this technology to deploy a test um on data from Bedford hospitals and it performed just as well as it did for data from hospitals who

didn't participate. Um and we see this approach as a way that hospitals in areas that for example do not have access to the resources that we might in the UK to take part um with a relatively

low budget they can join a federation like this, join a study like this, contribute to model training and model weights. Um, and the the value ad of this is making it as easy as possible um

to to use it. And we we were very fortunate to have have significant coverage at the time. And so I I suppose a thank you to to my collaborators for this work. David Clifton over in Oxford,

David Eron in Oxford and in the emergency department, Alex Novak. Um, and that's from me. [applause] Thank you Andrew for that wonderful talk.

And our last speaker is going to be Francis Cwley who is going to talk about piloting the global AI policy and data visitation for quality in healthcare data.

&gt;&gt; Uh thank you D. So essentially what uh we've been looking at with our distinguished panelist here today under the leadership of he's being quiet

and um but what we're really looking at is a new technology &gt;&gt; and how we can do something better with data and interrogate that better for the purposes of health. And we've seen the

slogans here for the conference here welfare for all and happiness for all. That's wonderful. That's a hard road ahead. And certainly one of the things that we'll have to achieve on that road

ahead is health for all as well. The WHO summit. So that's really what we're concerned with here. I think the entire AI summit here is really about the society we're moving into. So it's

not for some small reason that professor the president excuse me &gt;&gt; prime minister Modi is coming to um open up your session here and that the whole the whole of the congress and the whole

of the government governments and the states as well are behind this here too. It's very important for the future of India but also for the future of the world. So it's an important thing that

we have here too. And what I wanted to say is with these technologies, it's not just the technology. And that's what the entire conference is reminding us. It's not just the technology. It has to do

really with the whole of society. So what when we talk about this data visitation, we're bringing in new technology to interrogate the data. The data is the

basis of our science but is also the basis of the information that we exchange for all the other things in our lives as well. So this data is important to us. It has personal value. It has

societal value to us as well. So when we work on these technologies, we have to ensure now that we develop within the technologies the kinds of considerations that would lead to let's say welfare for

all, happiness for all or health for all things like this. So just a few thoughts for myself. I don't think slides matter too much um here but so data visitation is a method and as we

know in science method is the key. Uh it's not new method is what allows you to develop new knowledge. So when you develop a new method and that's what we're presenting here a really cutting

edge method as well. So congratulations for that. But with that method, we're able to interrogate data better and receive more information from it. And this is important here too. But health

related research is bounded by and determined by far more than simply method. Even far more than simply science. It's impregnated with society. So we have

rules for it. We have rules about how you have to do it. And those rules are not accidental and they're not just there because it's like tax rules or something. They're really there because

they want to protect people, protect the integrity of the people, protect what people think is important to them. And we know genetics is important to people because it tells a story about us that

we believe is a really important story. &gt;&gt; Right? So when we what we want to do with this technology is not only make it possible let's say to do the scientific part of it but also to ensure that

within that scientific part we have the considerations that we need to have for society. So we have to have things in that that have to do with not only um um the science but also we we're really

concerned in a certain sense with reliability with accept acceptability and I would say most important with veracity as well. In other words, our science has to be

reliable. So the conclusions that these fantastic scientists are drawing from this data visitation model, we have to be able to know that that those conclusions are

ones that we can work with that they actually give a picture of myself as a patient or ourselves in society. We have to know that that's correct. And we also have to know that the work that these

folks are doing is acceptable, right? It has to be something that society will accept. India is very sensitive about them too. You have very strong ethics regulations in place and so forth and

the ICMR and so forth as you know is a very strong organization and they really pres protect the idea of what's important for the populations within and that's the way it should be as well. So

we need to think about that too. So thus we need to be able to and going forward we can't have ethics just in paper. We can't have ethics in PDFs. We can't have ethics just in committees. It can't be

just an informed consent form. Going forward with AI, especially with AI, we have to put the ethics inside the techn inside the technology. It has to be built in. That's going to be hard

to do, but we have to do it because we we can't do it the way we've been doing. AI just goes too fast. So we have to make sure that the machines that we're building and the computational power

that we're using within those machines also are done with not only within let's say scientific parameters but also within parameters that are some of the people in the society where we live. So

I think that's important here for us here. So just this is propaganda. You don't have to ignore it, but we we um said propaganda, but uh we did some publications on this uh within our um

European Open Science Club and research data alliance working group to look at okay, what are the what kinds of considerations should an ethics committee take when they're looking at

health related research um that involves AI? That's one thing we looked at. And then we also looked at what kinds of informed consent should we be thinking about

going forward for patients when they're making their data available for the kind of research that they're doing here. So we just tried to think

about that and we wrote this propaganda there. We also um looked at um then some also quality issues as well. So that was that seemed to be important to us too. So, and I think this is the wonderful

thing about data visitation um because um I think what we can do, you've heard this already so I don't have to repeat it but I think what we can do with data

visitation is not just analysis. We can do the analysis but we can do much more than analysis with it. We can do quality control and this is really

important because we have to know what the value of that data is. In other words, we have to know the real world value if you want of that data because AI however wonderful it is the way it is

today anyway it has no access to the world. So if it doesn't have access to the world, it has no access to the truth, right? It has no access to know that that data actually represents this

person here. We don't know that that data actually represents you. We think it does, but we want to make sure it represents you or represents your genome or whatever it is carefully. So we need

to we need to be able to not only use this methodology to analyze the data to query the data with regard to let's say certain questions that we have but we also can use it to do quality control

and we did some of that um with another organization uh before I won't talk about that too much but I think that's um what we can do so our yes so our objective really one of

the objectives we have not just to do the scientific analysis but also to put this in place. So we've come up with and we're just developing this. It's not yet propaganda alternatively propaganda but

we have um these are vision principles that we're working out but more importantly and this gives us a kind of ethical background for what we're doing but we're also working on these pilot

principles and what we want to do with the pilot principles is more or less like know you have the fair principles for data you have the care principles for data and you have the um trust

principles for data repositories well we want to have principles like this for artificial intelligence and that's what we're trying to do with both the indigenous principles and the pilot

principles and that is to impregnate those with purpose integrity law openness whatever that means and test it that's what we thought there first here so we

want to move really from instruments from pure instrumentation in certain sense to working purposely but that means working purposely within society or if you like from moving from

technology to people and their health that's what way is actually trying to lead us on in on that path here and with that I'll just stop with what I think is one of the most important remarks for me

anyway in life is that morality is the basis of things of all things in fact and truth is the substance of all morality one thing that ethics and science have

in common and it's really important. It is paracity. It is truth. And we have to bring those things together within our AI technologies. Thank you very much. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Thank you so much, Francis. And

now we have a little bit of time for some panel discussion. I'm just going to put this up on the slide. Um, yeah. So I guess we don't really have a ton of time so perhaps we'll just start off with one

question which is you know like we have a lot of really amazing technologies that this panelists have already showed today and what do you think some are some of the challenges of translating

some of those technologies to real world implementations and also how can some of the people in this room who are sitting here help with that? Does anyone want to go ahead?

Um I think at this stage people probably realize that uh we're living in the post AI world. Techn is amazing. Uh and so I think we're in a sort of engineering bottleneck world. So bringing this

technology to where it needs to go requires boots on the ground, you know, sort of FD getting people there who have the expertise and capacity to integrate it with the people who have the problems

themselves. So technologists like me are not the main experts in problems but we can help bring the technology to the problem. &gt;&gt; Okay. Yeah. Um I think I think one of

the most important things that we should all think about especially when it's related to human health is we have to start from where it impacts everyone from in human terms. And that's not just

about technology or about policy principles and all those are important but ultimately we have to start from you know how does it affect each and every one of you? How does it affect your

families and your health? And when you technology is a critical enabler, but when you work backwards from there, you can also see all the additional support layers that must be in place to make it

implemented responsibly and sensitively including principles, including policy. Uh so I think I think if we work backwards from the bigger goal of disruption of making everyone's lives

better, I think that would give show us a path on how to implement it. What was the question again don look at it slightly differently. Um we talked about data visitation. I'll just

switch to Hindi. That is what she was asking. What should we do? What should we work on? I think that's not the right question. The right question is that what should you do is

what you are passionate about. I don't care about what's the problem is. The problem is we try to work on something that we are not good at and we are not passionate at then we ultimately

fail. So all of you in this room if you are passionate about data you will be good at it no matter what you do. So the important thing for you young audience particularly students here is there's a

lot of things to do with data. Data is floating around and why are we not using data? Because either we don't know how to do it or we are bad at it or we just don't enjoy doing it. So I think if you

enjoy working with data, find a problem and also at the end of the day all these problem must lead to a solution and make some value. The value for person one could be money. Value for person two

could be something else. So there must be a value attached to it. Without value you will never work on that. So find out what you're good at, what you are passionate about. There's a lot of data.

They're experts sitting there. Go and talk to them. find what you can do with the data to get a solution and in fact we are talking about healthcare. The other thing we are during the break

talking about India and the global south as a huge problem on agriculture water clean drinking water agriculture agriculture is one huge area which just waiting to be infused with datadriven

solutions. What should farmer do? What type of seeds should the farmer sew? What is the right season to sew the seeds? What is the right season to actually harvest the crops? These are

all datadriven solutions. These are local solutions. One solution which is in eastern UK may not be the right thing for Kerala. One which is good for Gujarat might not be good for

Netherland. So what you need to do is get the data, be passionate if you are and the solutions will be there. So that's what I would say just to turn things around.

&gt;&gt; I I really like G's answer. Now I think if I reflect on examples of projects that have been successful not just within the United Kingdom but wider in Europe and around the world, what they

all have in common is that there will always be a champion at the heart of it. There'll be one individual or two individuals who had a vision and had the passion and the now to pursue that

vision. And that's why I think passion is so important in seeing it through. Now I think there is a second aspect which is in around you know many of these technologies are well understood

by people in this room well understood by technologists well understood by people who are young and passionate about what they do um institutions that have been around a long time to them

these technologies might be new to them these technologies might conflict with existing organizational policy or with existing organizational direction of travel and a huge role for for people to

play is in saying I see an opportunity for this technology to really help with a problem and almost going out and selling that technology not not for money but selling it in in terms of the

benefits it can bring how it can align with what others want to do and then there's the execution work now I think being a a professional plus a data scientist I think is an excellent place

to be I think being an engineer as well as a lawyer or a doctor or an accountant or you know pick your [laughter] profession pick your field um I I think that's really important it allows you to

bring that deep domain expertise with the technology skills and that's recognizing the two are inseparable. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So I think um all great answers. Um

who who here has used chatb? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Does it feel magical? &gt;&gt; Does it feel does it feel magical? I'm telling you it feels magical. I think we need to realize we're in this post AI

world now. We we should no longer be restricted by what we used to think was possible. We should now be thinking about what we want as a society, right? As a group of people. What do we dream

of? Do we dream of having all of our family members be healthy? Do we want to cure all that disease? Let's do it. I mean, why are we waiting? Like, if we if we're restricted by the capacity and

capability to implement things, that's no longer the restriction it used to be. So, I I just I'm very passionate about this, you know, as you know, from what I said. And I think we should have action

to get things done, right? we should take action, get those principles and those moral um values that we can unite on and then get together and just do it with the passion that we have to do it.

&gt;&gt; I think actually we have uh we're running out of time for more questions. So please come up and talk to these like very enthusiastic and passionate panelists afterwards. Um and actually to

end off the panel and our session, we're actually going to have Wade in to give us some concluding remarks. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Um presentation. &gt;&gt; So in 2003

uh even though most of you aren't in the biology and genomics field but probably all of you have heard of the human genome project which brought humanity into the age of genomics into the

genomic era and why was that important? Because the genome as Benet had g given everyone explanation of is um it it it's a blueprint for who we are but all of us are very different even

among Indians there's huge variation so much variation that is unknown so if the original intent of the human genome project was that it's a public good that it's something that everyone in the

world can benefit from. Um, then how can that be true if there's still so much gap in access, in representation, in useful knowledge, in implementation at the national level.

What they did get right in the human genome project was that they ensured it was a public good so that researchers could take this initial draft in an open way and openly work together to explore

how to take that forward. This was 23 years ago 2003. But now in 2026 there's been so much progress. There's been incredible leaps in the technology de development. There's been incredible

breakthroughs in data generation, in the science. There's been incredible exploration into precision medicine and how to use it in things like cancer treatment and in a

lot of other things. But even though it's very impressive how the field of genomics and biology has developed in the last 20 years, but if you look at it in human terms, we have

to go back to human terms. If it's a public good, it's not a public good just for researchers. It's not a public good for people to write papers or for companies to just make a bunch of money.

For it to be a truly a public good, it has to be will touch each and every one of you and your families and your children. It has to be something that because of it, one day we can all say we

truly live longer and healthier because we fulfilled the promise of the human genome as a public good for everyone. So &gt;&gt; the only way that this is going to

happen is that we have to come together in a much bigger way and we have to do something much bolder. We have to do something where we remember the human impact as our measurement of success.

And this is precisely the reason why um a group of collaborators and scientists and leaders from 14 countries came together to write that editorial to ask for a human genome project too.

Because the goal of the human genome project 2, it's not just science. It's global precision health, precision public health. It's its success is only measured by whether it really enabled

whole populations around the world to live longer and healthier to enable countries to become more sustainable and prosperous. And guess what? If it's something for

humans, for humanity, who's most of humanity? What did Benet say in his talk? The global south represents the vast majority of humanity. Yet we have we we we have a big imbalance in terms

of our participation, our access and our ability to benefit in. But this is a challenge that um no no one country can solve alone. Which is why the scale of this project requires

everyone to come together and do it. So this is something for all of you. Think of it as it doesn't matter if you're from genomics or not. It is something that one day wants to benefit you, your

families, your children, your loved ones. And this is such a multistakeholder effort that it's not just about the scientists. It's not not just about the

companies trying to lower costs and make things available. We need to invent the future. This is why we need to build it. &gt;&gt; what you saw here today with the panelists here and what they share is an

example of an attempt to solve some of those realistic problems because there are certain problems that are red lines that we can't cross. We have to protect sensitive data. We have to respect

sovereignty and privacy. We cannot open that to risk. But there are innovative ways as you have seen today where you could actually use technology and innovation to

preserve privacy but at the same time still enable open science and benefit sharing. And so to conclude to all the software engineers and to all the entrepreneur

and software developers please be inspired by this and use this initial effort these initial efforts to try to come together and build the future and solve the problems. We need

your expertise. And also to all the clinicians and scientists, please find ways to support the software engineers to do cross domain collaboration.

And finally to the policy makers, please find innovative ways to support this and futureproof the implementation. Thank you very much. [applause] &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. And and so to

conclude um we hope you're inspired and also at the same time we have a tech meet up tomorrow. Um it's at India International Center if you want to come over. Um yeah so thank you so much for

listening and thank you so much for uh just like yeah &gt;&gt; do come to the meetup. Hi everyone. I'm Dave. I work with Mad at Open Mind and it's been a pleasure talking to you

guys. We're have a few people at the back. Show your hands. Put your hands up. Feel free to come and talk to us. Um I've taken the mic. uh because there is a momento for all of the speakers. Um so

I'll let you one by one. Uh we'll start at the end. Francis Cwley. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; And next we have Andrew Sa. And thirdly, BEN FERLY

and Maj. Okay. &gt;&gt; And last but not least, uh our moderator, Dawn Chen.
