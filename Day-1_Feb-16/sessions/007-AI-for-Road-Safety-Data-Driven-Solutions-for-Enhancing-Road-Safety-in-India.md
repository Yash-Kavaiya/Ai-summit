## 📝 Transcript

It's WHO therefore they are kind of writing a bad data on us. B is there somewhere by which the data is clear or not clear and what we can do that's where ministry of road transport next

slide please. Uh road transport kind of picked up a thought process from IIT Madras and they started laying the foundations of uh a good datadriven road safety initiative.

all your AI are on top of these as layers or stacks that you build. Uh so many uh congratulations for a pretty future looking decisions that were taken at Morth at that point of time. Uh they

decided that hey let's have a national database. Imagine go back please. Uh imagine uh uh like India you have how many people maybe 140 crores

how many police stations people may not know and how many crashes broadly we know all of it in a single umbrella we get as a data nowhere in the world it has been attempted. Go there

please. This database is called as IRAD and EDAR. One of the sister uh agencies of or daughter agencies of Matei. NIC was the implementation agency. It went very simple. You have

Uh this got kicked off where we are co-opting districts which is the lowest level of governance and government uh decision making uh using of Sanja for engineering interventions,

administrative interventions and trauma care has started uh a variety of tools which were all of them have an AI basis for making it but we don't want to call it as a of course

my student did put AI there I wish it was not there but the reality is there is all these things use a lot of analytics and data crunching and decision supports that are coming about

there is some amount of intelligence that gets built into the analytics that are there. These are datadriven governance. So governance is not by thought of one person or the person who

sits in the seat but governance now gets done as a process. It's moving from people centric to processentric. Now the next higher level is just not the government but people also included.

Anybody from Odisa here? Okay. So Odisa is the first state to uh go about uh taking the idea that we had that let's have a uh connected or people focused people centric government

decision making that happens that's the policy planning implementation and monitoring all under one umbrella called rut uh which awareness

about road safety with too much data and too little time. AI helps converge competitious. Therefore, it protection is our duty and responsibility.

Come home safe is the tag. Please go on. Uh so a variety of implementation, variety of tools, variety of things that are there everything in all the fores that are there but in there is a dark

hole that needs to be addressed. That is a dark hole that I would like to appeal to all of you uh which is an empathy. Please factor the human whichever role that you are in whether you're on a road

whether you're making a device whether you are going to apply it have an empathy towards everybody. Uh and there was also a purpose. So when we were asked to do one of the things uh

Shiaul Singh pointed out let's not look at many things let's just think about bringing young students uh as they call jenz's uh the idea was to focus and kindle the

thought with the genz so there'll be a couple of things that we will share we would want you to participate uh the cos will be happy to uh work with you uh the ideas are unlimited coming from kids it

gets filtered and trained minds usually start looking the other way for bright ideas. So uh next slide please. So uh the platform so we have uh sheep panker gi

from uh north who had been literally behind us uh about creating a platform that can be a very good learning environment. Remember I told when you make it idiot proof you make better

idiots. So how can we create a learning tool? So we created theoretically there should be three gates for licensing a knowledge gate, skill gate and a practice gate. The knowledge gate uh

requires a mechanism by which the knowledge is better understood and you can use it better from that perspective. We said that the etiquette that is also to come the other

things that are there if you knew what things were you will probably be more empathetic. It is just that we do not know how we end up doing whatever we want to do. Right? So to address this

what did we do in the traditional indic society at least in everywhere this was the sir uh same thing in the south India there used to be a small uh courtyard in the front of a house which used to be

called tini which is where the elders used to sit and teach the younger kids how it is to be in a society. I'm sure the same thing happened in the courtyards in everywhere whichever part

of the country. So but thin has AI in it. So uh we decided that we will label and do it as thin. Thini is at this point of time not launched but it is just being introduced. Please uh it's a

beta version. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Next slide. So, [clears throat] uh the QR code is there for a few seconds. Uh please do scan in and uh do

play around with it. Tell why all it fails, what should be done to make it better before we formally launch it sometime very soon. Uh next slide please. Anything else to be added to

that? &gt;&gt; No sir. Uh QR code if you can display once again. Yeah, I'd request all of you to please scan this QR code and join us in making Tennai the next big thing in

road safety. And uh thank you sir. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Next slide. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; I would this is I madras. I madras is for all. Please do come to IIT Madras

and I extend that and I end the talk. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much sir. Right. So that was professor Wenitesh Bala Subramanyan for you guys giving you

a brief glimpse of what center of excellence for road safety actually does in the road safety sector. And now we embark on the next big thing in road safety sector

uh not only in India but across the global south. For that I would like to invite Mr. Atul Singh COO CO RS IIT Madras on the stage. Uh the stage is yours sir.

&gt;&gt; Uh thanks a lot and uh we are running out of time so we'll keep it very concise. Uh can we start with the teaser p first? Uh thanks a lot team. So as professor

Wenites invited you to IIT Madras, right? Uh as a CEO my work is to you know find a way to get into you into IIT Madras and this is a hackathon that we have launched and we request you to

utilize it and be a part of it. Right. Before I go into it right I just want to hear from you know such a young and vibrant audience as she calls Janji. This is going to be for 30 seconds and I

want you to be real quick if you can have mic around and I'm 100% sure that Jenji does not need a mic do they right so let's see let's see let's have a scenario where you know there is a

road accident in front of your college and this is also Valentine's week so let's take it like that key your loved and dear ones have got into an accident can you think of one technology or you

know AI tool or digital app or something like that which will help you save that life. &gt;&gt; Okay. Any any more idea?

Gemini. What are you going to ask on Gemini? We'll send a picture and do what? Say what? Will you post it on Instagram or something?

&gt;&gt; Fall detection. Okay. Okay. Wonderful. Wonderful. So I just two more thoughts. Anyone? &gt;&gt; Nearest hospital. Brilliant idea. Right.

But how do I know that which is the nearest hospital? How do I locate it? &gt;&gt; Google maps. Okay. Wonderful. Now let me give you even let's say your loved one has a brain

injury. Now tell me how will you locate the nearest hospital the relevant hospital ambulance. Okay. So this is one of the problem statement that we have as a part

of this hackathon. Uh four days back I made an accident. I was going to from Chennai to Ramsaram right and when I got into accident it was not severe but someone came and hit me from

the back I could not find the nearest or my jurisdiction police station right I could not find let's say I had the head injury I don't know which hospital to take Google maps so hospital

it's very difficult to make that decision at that point of time hospital right so this is one of the problem statement that we have And can we have the QR code please the poster

and this is what we are announcing. We are inviting all of you to be a part of it. And the next 10 seconds or 20 seconds we also have one more offer for you. The

first 50 registrations we are going to mentor you right from IIT Madras to create a solution for it. The first 50 registrations. Can we have it now? Now only another 20

seconds. Wonderful. So first 50 registrations you'll get an invite from us and we'll be mentoring you to create a solution for it. Thanks a lot. So that's national

road safety hackathon 2026. We have already made it one of the biggest in India and we plan to make it the biggest in global south right. uh the very foundation of this AI summit and we

really hope to see you all at the campus which uh professor just invited you and we'll be very happy to have you as at the campus. So thanks a lot. That's all from my

&gt;&gt; Yeah. Thank you. Thank you at uh now without much further ado as we're running short of time we move on to the first panel discussion for this morning which is themed at policies enabling

innovation in road safety. And for that I'd like to request uh our panelists for the session to please come on the stage. Uh Shri RP Shukla sir director road safety cell ministry of road transport

and highways. A huge round of applause please. Uh Shri Panka Jagarwal sir chief engineer ministry of road transport and highways and the moderator for the session will

be our very own Atu Singh. Please stage is yours. How is the &gt;&gt; good? So

both of them uh are from ministry of road transport and highways and in the in terms of road safety like professor Wenites gave them a lot of credit and they truly deserve it but whatever we

have achieved in road safety like these are the people I think they deserve a round of applause from all of you and sir they really want to hear from you so we'll start with the questions

And the first thing right the MB act the motor vehicle act that we had recently it laid the foundation for electronic monitoring and enforcement and we also saw recently you know you also released

the data sharing policy. So so much proactive steps are being taken by ministry of road transport and highways but AI is catching much faster. There are so many emerging technologies coming

up. So any further policy being considered to support this evolution you would want to highlight sir. &gt;&gt; First of all I would like to say all of the people that road safety is not a

thing which is a social problem. It is a personal also. So government role is always as a facilitator but you are the driver and you yourself are the passenger.

So just like you have a need for water, mobility consumption is also a factor. If you compare yourself, what is the role of AI? We have lot of data available with us. But the problem is

how to act on that. Enforcement system is available. We are have lot of chalance issued but nobody is coming and paying it. We are unable to uh enforce the chalan through e- monitoring

systems. So AI is providing all information to us. lot of technologies are available. Government is providing the enabling environment to every states because it is more in the domain of the

policing is more in the domain of the state governments. So we are in touch with the stakeholders stakeholders like state governments and giving them all the support through technologies uh

grants and everything we are providing. So it is a first step the main uh data indicates that the main problem is the speeding and the traffic rules violation. So capturing it and providing

as an evidence before and without human intervention. Here the AI can definitely play a big role. Nowadays whatever data we have only a police person who records the data that is not the actual data.

There are many other offense offenses which contribute to the accidents and the real picture can only come we have all the cameras installed on the high speed highspeed corridors and which

happen to be the uh carrying happen to carry maximum uh transport need or fulfilling the maximum transport. So what is the problem? If we are not able to analyze the capture data the way your

uh legislation system work then it will be difficult to enforce the law and uh we and we will not be able to bring down the federal that is the first step first step. The second we want to integrate

with this a thin AI in the f future if we are able to whatever data about small accidents which are also cause of although I mean there is no fatality if I give

you an example of Bihar out of 100 accidents 96 death occurs but it is unrealistic the national average is 36 but in Bihar if you see number of accident number of accident register are

100 and death are 95. Is it possible? Answer is it means all where all other accidents have gone. So those are basically they have not been registered as an accident. So in that case how to

prevent those for which we do not have any data. So we have to do some vehicle engineing sort of a thing give some feedback to the driver. So for that V2V mandating V2D communication

we hope is a proper because we believe that nobody wants to commit the error to so so much so great that he should injure himself. So with that intention if V2 technology can provide some

feedback to him he can correct in I mean before it it can lead to any collision. So the vehicle-to- vehicle communic communication technology has been basically mandated and we have given

right now the domain frequency of 30 MHz. So there is a lot of scope for all the AI we want to work on the AI to how to come out with a software and sort of a thing AI based road safety projects

another part so which pre-licicensing system state government is mandated to give the license but driving is basically a life skill we are taught computers it has

been mandated what about the driving no school teaches driving uh I mean the normal school I'm not talking about the government licensing school. It is a need. So what

you do? You go to a different system. Why not? It should be integrated in the school itself at the age of 16. So that is another goal of AI thin AI which m this IIT Madras is working. It should be

mandated as a part of curriculum while teaching computer that and particularly the uh girls also everybody should learn driving. Once they will learn driving they will be able to judge the person

who is driving even as a passenger the how he's driving. So it will definitely lead some awareness what are the driving skills and most of the people which we do not know driving so they can't judge

how other person is driving. So that will create a consciousness among the people that the these are the things we need to learn and it certification sort of a thing it will generate and give you

the knowledge and give some practice. So that consciousness and awareness definitely we feel that we will able to reduce the accidents and help in capturing the base data

&gt;&gt; right sir. So the similarly further policy reforms uh connected connected mobility frameworks for line mobility and emission norms uh right sir

another point is the how to control the pollution. So in that also we we are basically trying to find a way out so that people should not cheat by having some context uh uh context environments

because they are issuing on their own without vele going to the center. So we are developing a AI tool for that also. Environment is a major concern in the R1 center not in the rural that much. And

another problem which is a very good area to work upon. We are we are all our industry is carentric not two wheeler centric. All safety features are for car. What about the two wheeler? It is a

very very big area because by 45% fatalities are of two wheelers 20% pedestrian. So all everything is about car but nobody thinks of scooter. So that is in a big area which ministry in

future planning how to go about the launch of invite the industry and invite the young people because it's simple strike to a two-heer because of his own or any anybody else it will it will get

destabilized and people fall and have had injury and uh 35,000 death occurred in a collision of a two-heer to two wheeler not by car out of 150,000 so It it is a that and those

are all low speed data. So how how is it possible? So they should be given some feedback. Somebody is coming or your behavior is something you have to come out of the box thinking to for the for

the purpose of two wheeler. So with that I will yes I I think sir uh you answered the next two three questions also. So made my life very easy sir and as sir rightly said under reporting of data is

a big problem. For example, many of you might be doing India around dead due to road accidents. The numbers can be much more higher because people don't report and that's why you know we are running a

program called datadriven hyperlocal intervention. We are doing field perception survey to capture those uncaptured data right so many of you would want to know

more about it and please I will request you to read about it. uh sir also mentioned one more point right see technology has some limitations and humans are very important right and uh

my next question is to uh RPLA sir and he's pioneering a program called Saraka Mitra which is very relevant to all of you the Jenji crowd which is sitting here

Thank you. This is the program is a program in collaboration with ministry of youth affairs and sports with the [clears throat] aim aim to have the youths involved on the volunteer basis

which are self-motivated and dedicated towards the road safety concerns. Basic concept behind involving the youth is that the so many problems in the road safety sectors are the area specific.

So making a policy from Delhi level or a central level or from a state level headquarters may not most of the times applicable at the district levels or the rural levels. Now the rural connectivity

is also very good and the the rural roads made under the prahan mantra grammat are also carrying a substantial [clears throat] amount of traffic which the users are very you can say that the

new to the uh road safety environments. So this is a bottom approach where the local youth of uh of your group of Janji group what the madam said that is [clears throat]

to be hired as an not hired as an recruited as an a volunteer you will be given at 15 days training 5 days training uh for the online training and then there is the offline training now

this program is running in the top 100 fatality districts not in pan India basis but it will be going to be launched launch soon on the pan India basis.

The second [clears throat] concept behind this is the concept of road safety auditor is a very new to our country. Normally we do not find the any

institution where the road safety auditors are being trained. So we are not just run this program to have a one program. We want to run it in there as an opportunity availability

also where you can learn the basics of the road safety auditing and [clears throat] helping the local authorities. You will work with the district road safety committees headed

by the the respective districts and commissioners. So you can assist them in helping them what the Geng thinks about the road safety. What can be the future challenges of the road safety with the

new vehicle design, new road designs. The second most important thing which we want from you volunteers and Jenji the empathy what the professor Balas Subraman was talking all about. What

happened when a road accident happened? A question was raised by the atul in during the your Valentine week. Which day is today? &gt;&gt; It is over.

&gt;&gt; Okay. So 16 was the last day. So so many people said so many things then he zeroed down key he has an head injury who has told them key first we will took him to the hospital

does anybody think of taking him to the hospital somebody's talking about the Gemini somebody's talking about something else somebody's talking about something else but nobody thinks of

saving his or her life kalidas has written a uh Mahakave Kumar Samhow which tells the story of how the Lord Kartik was born. In that he told the Parvati that is this your body is

the source of all all good things or all bad things. So first love your body first protect your body. So as a your janji you are least bothered about yourself. You are bothered about so many

other things but you are least bothered about yourself. How many girls sitting here are putting helmet when they are driving the two wheelers? Be honest to yourself.

And now how many girls are in the room who are not wearing &gt;&gt; who are not wearing? Huh? &gt;&gt; So, so this is this is the problem where we want to involve you as an a volunteer

to understand what is the need of the helmet. It is not just to prevent the chalan. It is to prevent you. Most common answer of you girls are that it clumses the hair but dear you need

the head for hair. So put it so we want to involve you at that basic grassroot level where you can understand why these legislations are made. They are not made for revenue

purposes to collect the chalance and enhance the government's pocket and a checker. They are here to make you safe. Roads are for you not for the chalance. use them judiciously

and use whatever whatever information you will be gaining through the this saddakamid program we are trying to escalate it is that it will become and at the completion of the program you

will get a certificate with co-branded with the IT Madras and any certificate of from any IT has its own value need not to say that so you will become a future our road safety

advocate You will be become our future road safety auditor. You will be become our future road safety AI influencer.

So many things you can do when you join this program. So it is I earnestly request all of you whoever is driving everybody is road user pedestrian to the one who is driving the Volvo bus.

Everybody is road user and everybody's at threat. So whenever you saw an accident, there are the four lines from the very noted shawazi.

So whenever you thank Thank So whenever you suffer or road accident don't think about anything else just think to take him to the nearest hospital be empathetic towards him don't

make real don't put it on Instagram nobody is watching Instagram except you peoples most of the time your real kept on swiping. &gt;&gt; I just met a dropper from the Nehans who

said that most of the youth have having partial paralysising of the thumbs. So this is all about the madam is knocking horns. So [laughter]

&gt;&gt; so because I'm all constantly getting the push &gt;&gt; really. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So one thing one thing I want to say

just ma'am privilege &gt;&gt; please sir. So most of you are involving in the AI. So I am why I want to give one or two concepts to you. So help the professor

Balas Subramanyam and our chief engineer Mr. Panka Jarwal in developing some digital road safety academy some digital road safety museum where the newcomers or the old people can come and see where

they committed the mistakes. develop a road safety diary for you people where you can daily make an entry where the mistakes you have committed what you not to repeat. Thank you ma'am. Sorry ma'am.

&gt;&gt; No sir no apology &gt;&gt; sir we wanted to continue it but because we're short on time right. Uh thank you so much for this panel discussion also we had panel two with

the industry leaders from Volvo and light metrics. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you so much sir. Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; So uh I'd like to request professor to

kindly come on stage and felicitate the guests from ministry and the speakers from Volvo. I'd like to request mr deepen Raja sir from Volvo group to kindly come on the stage and

Dr. Pushkar Patwaran co-founder lightmetrics technologies to kindly come on the stage. A big round of applause please. Go go go go.

Since we are running short of time, uh we are not able to continue with our next panel discussion and with this I really request all the youngsters out here to come up with better solutions uh

based on AI or not AI. Come up with better solutions for road safety. Join our road safety hackathon and I finally thank you all for being such a great audience. Thank you for the speakers for

joining us. Thank you everyone for coming and joining us early in the morning. With this we bring this session to a close. Uh I Himmani Suri thanking you all uh bottom of my heart on behalf

of center of excellence for road safety IT Madras. Thank you all. [applause] Yeah. [music] &gt;&gt; Somebody

get
