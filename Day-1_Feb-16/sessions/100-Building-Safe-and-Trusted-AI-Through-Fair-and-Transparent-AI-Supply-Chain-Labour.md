## 📝 Transcript

for the fairwork team. So failwork is an international action research which is led jointly by Oxford Internet Institute and Viz social science center at Berlin. Uh what we do is we basically work on

accountability in the fair and in the digital economy space on certain principles we have designed. So fair pay, fair working conditions, fair management, fair representation and uh

um and most importantly fair working conditions as well. So based on these principles we evaluate companies, we assess companies and try to come up with a score and using that score we try to

lobby or push the companies to make proworker challenges uh changes. So in the last uh 6 years favor has assessed more than 826 companies across 41 countries and all of these assessments

have eventually led to more than 427 document changes and these changes have impacted millions of workers across the world. So it's a pleasure to welcome you all here to the panel discussion titled

AI's labor problems standards for a planetary labor market. Now we have been talking about AI since last I would say almost 5 years more frequently than ever and we have often discussed about

innovation, productivity and geopolitical competition. However, much less attention is being paid on who are the people that are defining the AI, the invisible labor behind it. Uh data

laborers, data moderators, um data annotation workers and mostly AI works across borders. So these topics are very frequently very less frequently discussed. Um what we would also like to

understand is um while labor concerns are increasingly evoked by AI governance debates they are often framed around annotation and job displacement the labor embedded within AI supply

chain themselves who are moderating the content who are doing task of annotation they are less frequently talked so today's session we'll be focusing on few important topics what does it mean to

govern labor in the AI supply chain. Can standards and certification meaningfully allocate responsibility in a planetary labor market and most importantly how do we move from aspiration to consequence.

So the entire session is divided into two parts. The first part is about fairwork. We will be will be introducing the fairwork certification scheme and the second session is about uh is a

panel discussion where we have uh panelists from industry as well as academia. So before I start the presentation for fairwork, I'll quickly introduce Mark Grahham and Patrick. Mark

is the professor of internet geography at University of Oxford and also the director for the Fairwork project. Uh we also have Patrick who is a postdocctoral researcher in the Berlin social science

center and he leads the Fairwork certification schemes along with the Fairwork Germany team. I'll request Mark and Patrick to take over the stage now. Thank you.

Thank you very much. Thanks. Thanks, Manzer. I'm Mark and this is Patrick, uh, by the way. So, good afternoon. Um, now, you know, most most people when we're thinking about AI, most people who

use AI don't really have a sense of the enormous amount of human labor that went into making that thing, went into making that product or service. And so, what we're here to talk about are the jobs

and the huge number of workers, human workers, that make AI possible. Patrick's reminding me to move the slide and I'll do that. So, thanks Patrick. So, we're what we're here to talk about

is the fact that all of this human labor within the supply chain, it's it's it's traded within a global production network. We're here to talk about the fact that the workers who do these jobs

are mostly based in poorer countries. We're here to talk about the fact that these jobs are mostly extractive, exploitative jobs. But what we're also here to talk about is how we might move

towards a fairer, more equitable, more just future of work. So I've spent the last almost two decades studying the outsourcing of jobs. And so for anyone interested in this, I've I've published

a lot of that research in this book that you can see on the screen there. It's about all of the hidden human labor in AI supply chains. If anyone wants a copy, just email me. I'll send you a

copy. Happy to. Now, these these jobs, they're they're very simply not good jobs. And I've put some of the harms that workers experience uh uh on the screen here. I'm not there's no time to

talk about all of these things, but instead, let me just give you a quick story, a quick anecdote from uh what things are like from a data labeling center that I visited last year in

Southeast Asia. So the workers at the center, what they were doing is they're training uh an AI for a large online shopping platform and a large online marketplace. What the workers have to do

is they're given two images, image A and image B. And their job is to say whether it's the same product or a different product. Blue bucket, red bucket, different blue bucket, blue bucket,

same. So they have 15 seconds to do each one. And they do this all day, 8 hours a day. Strict time limit. Everything they do is monitored. Everything they do is tracked. Everything is logged. And

because of that, the slowest performers who are slower than their peers are dismissed. They're they cannot continue doing that work. Now, the problem is this interface that I'm describing where

the workers have to do this. It didn't display a timer. So, what do the workers do? Well, all of the workers, they get out their phones, they set a 15-second timer so that they know that they can

stay on track. Now imagine being in a room of 300 workers, all of whom have a timer on every 15 seconds. There's bells, there's alarms, there's sirens. For some reason, a lot of the workers

had a chicken squawk as their alarm. So there's chicken squawks everywhere. I'm in this room for like 10 minutes and my my head is throbbing. Imagine being in that room for 8 hours a day every day

with this this den of noise. Now, this is by no mean one of the worst issues that I've seen when it I've seen all kinds of places and this is not even close to the worst that I've seen. But I

think it encapsulates something very important about the sector that the the fix to this issue that I just mentioned is a very simple one, right? Doesn't cost a lot of money to implement a timer

on the interface, but the company has no incentive to implement that fix. And that's because these jobs are very deskskilled jobs. They're commodified jobs. They're highly surveiled jobs.

They're algorithmically managed jobs. And a result of all of this, they're traded in what you can think about as a as a planetary or a global labor market. And so in this global labor market, in

this planetary labor market, this pushes wages, this pushes working conditions constantly downwards because the workers are so replaceable because there's little or no incentive for companies to

actually improve anything. Now, I've spoken to to ministers. I've spoken to high level government figures in around the world in places like Kenya and the Philippines where a lot of these jobs

are done and they will just straight up tell you that uh their priority is the quantity rather than the quality of these jobs. They know that if they make life too difficult for the companies

that host these jobs, those jobs will just very quickly flow to another part of the world. So it's the classic bad job or no job problem. And even though the vast majority of workers doing these

jobs are unorganized, it has been inspiring seeing in different parts of the world ways in which workers who've had enough who want to improve their jobs, attempt to build

collective power, attempt to uh do that in whatever way they can. And so um I've sat down with these workers who are trying to organize um some some in Nairobi for instance and watched how

they uh tried to build a union. The problem is that whilst they're they're they're building this collective structure, the jobs that they were trying to improve, they moved to Ghana

the minute they created too much trouble for this company. So this is kind of a wicked problem, right? AI involves human labor. The production networks of AI exploit human labor in the global south.

But because of this global planetary labor market that these jobs are traded in, actors all around the world have very limited power to improve them. So where does that leave us? Well, for us,

the the the key takeaway is that attempts to improve working conditions and AI supply chains, they can't just begin at the point of production upstream in the the chain. They need to

also involve the lead firms in these supply chains who are predominantly located in the global north. So these lead firms, they have the leverage to enforce or push better labor standards

across their supply chains. They've got the power to govern their supply chains in a way that enable suppliers to raise employment standards. But how can we make those lead firms in

AI care about this? Well, we think there's currently three developments that should make AI companies care about labor labor standards in the supply chain because they pose risk to those

companies themselves. So, first of all, there's more and more regulations from governments and international organizations coming up that require companies exercising due diligence in

their supply chain. So for instance, the European Union's corporate sustainability due diligence directive as a very prominent example of this forcing companies to engage in this due

diligence process upstream in their chain. Second, uh driven by numerous studies uh and news pieces, the um public disclosure of these labor issues in AI supply chains, it's becoming a

risk to the company's uh reputation themselves. And then finally, bad working conditions that just poses a risk to companies as workforce dissatisfaction and conflict can disrupt

operations that can delay projects or decrease quality. So all of these developments, they put public and political pressure on AI companies to act and get involved in labor standards

in their supply chains in order to avoid these risks. So in light of the situation, what what we believe is to move forward AI any company developing AI uh and their supply chain partners,

they need robust benchmarks. They need trustworthy benchmarks and guidelines that can guide their efforts to exercise due diligence and improve working conditions in the whole AI supply chain.

And that's where we bring the Fairwork Project in. So I'll hand over to Patrick to tell you a bit more about that. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; All right. So, I think Monza already

mentioned that we are a global action research research network hosted by the Oxford Internet Institute of the University of Oxford and the Berlin Social Science Center. Is that loud

enough? Yeah. Okay. Not really. Okay. I really have to scream. [laughter] Okay. So over the last years we basically got funding from the Germany's federal ministry for uh economic

cooperation and development and the GAZ to develop a universal uh rating system for working conditions in the digital economy. And this is what we did basically. So the framework consists of

five universal principles is fair pay, fair conditions, fair contracts, fair management and fair representation. And each of these principles has two thresholds that we operationalize by a

set of key indicators. So we use this framework to actually rate and rank working conditions uh for digital companies or companies in the digital economy. And as a result, every company

gets a scorecard like that with a score from 0 to 10. uh on the one hand to assess their performance and the working conditions but also to encourage them to embed at least basic principles of

decent work into their operations. The scorecards do not only make differences in management visible. So if we compare them based on this benchmark they also serve as a benchmark for best practices

that we can highlight and we then we use these scorecards to engage with the companies and push for better working conditions. We have applied this uh framework over

the last eight years to more than 800 800 companies um uh in 41 countries and including some of the most important providers for data work and AI supply chains. Some of the scorecards that you

can see here on the slide. It's rather small but I hope you can at least see uh the scores the final scores maybe not each threshold but at least the final scores.

Um by engaging with the companies with these ratings, we have created more than 400 positive changes uh to these processes and business practices uh that benefited more than 16 million workers

uh in the digital economy. And one of the most important learnings when doing these ratings was actually when we talked to companies like SMA, Humans on the Loop or also Appen was that even the

companies that we scored that wanted to make improvements to working conditions, they said, "Well, there's relatively little that we can do. There are severe constraints that are pushed onto them by

the suppliers, the buyers in the chains that they cannot circumvent." So they have very little leverage to actually improve working conditions here and relatively little bargaining power visav

uh the bias in the supply chains. Um and because most of these data work providers aren't uh consumerf facing brands like the lead firms in the supply chains who are facing the customer

basically the suppliers are simply competing on price quality on speed and they aren't competing on decent work. For that reason, we basically decided when we thought about how can we improve

our impact, how can we move forward with the fairwork project, we thought that it's in order to bring about fair work in AI supply chains, we are thinking about more than just scoring the

suppliers that we did in the last years. So, it's the buyers who have the power to improve imp um impose decent standards in their chains and they can do this through uh the supply agreements

and their procurement processes processes. So we have developed what we call our certification scheme based on the evaluations and the scorecards that we have in our portfolio uh to work with

elite firms who develop AI and digital tools and services to certify them through a process in which we work with these companies to embed minimum standards into their supply chains and

to score their suppliers adherence to these principles that we developed. If we look at a pretty standard due diligence cycle, this is based on OECD recommendations for that purpose. We can

see how fairwork actually supports and contributes to each of these four phases that you can see here on the slide. So if it all starts with risk assessment. So lead firms need to be aware of the

risks prevalent in their supply chains. And what we hear from these companies very often is that they don't have a clear idea what their supply chain actually looks like. So they don't have

even have a clear map of who their suppliers actually are. There's different departments engaging with different companies. So this is pretty opaque. So the so scorecard can help you

by mapping the supply chains. We can map the suppliers in the chain and we can uh benchmark and assess the suppliers indicating the major risk in the supply chain. Then based on the uh industry

expertise that we have over the last years, we also happy to uh and able to provide uh a contribution to the risk mitigation plans after the initial risk assessment. So when we think about how

we can improve stuff, we can also uh provide recommendations to come up with these plans. Then the scorecards, if we do that over a certain amount of time, we do annual ratings, we can also

monitor the implementation of these mitigation plans and see if whether they effective or not. And since our work is basically done according to high academic standards, the resources that

we provide can also be used for the documentation and the reporting duties that are usually part of these uh due diligence obligations. Okay, to sum up, I'll hand back over to

Mark. &gt;&gt; Thanks, Patrick. Uh let me just sum up. So the point of what we're what we're really our main message here is that there's nothing immaterial about AI.

It's not abstract. It's not magic. It's built on real human labor. And right now, too much of that labor is hidden. It's replaceable. It's disposable. The structure of the the global supply

chains that all of this work is traded in, it pushes standards down. It creates a huge number of harms for workers. But supply chains are governed and they're governed by lead firms. So the question

is not whether conditions can improve. The question is whether the firms that profit from AI are willing or able to use their power to make that happen. [laughter]

Now, global labor standards and due diligence frameworks, they're setting the direction of travel, but translating these principles and translating these standards into real operational

decisions, it's still sort of a low priority for a lot of organizations. And so this is precisely the space where we see this sort of certification contributing by providing benchmarks, by

providing ratings, by providing engagement processes that make these standards measurable and comparable and implementable across supply chains. So if all of us are serious about

responsible AI, then we can't forget about labor standards. Labor standards can't just be an afterthought. They need to be built into the very system itself. So what I'd like to do is then invite

the panel in the following discussion to just reflect on this to reflect on what role standards global standards like the Fairwork framework can play in strengthening governance mechanisms and

what else is needed alongside them. So I'll stop here. I look forward to the discussion and thank you very much. [applause] Thank you Mark and Patrick. uh before we

start the panel discussion I'll briefly introduce our two panelists to begin with we have Dr. Professor Rrajan who is the founder of AP Institute working at the intersection of technology equity

and governance in India. We also have professor Balaji who is a professor at triple IT Bangalore and also the co-founder of institute center for information technology and public

policy. He is also the principal investigator for favor India whose work spans economic geography global productions and the political economy of technological change. Thank you so much

Sio and Bali for joining us today. So uh I will be trying to moderate it before time we have 20 minutes as I can see. Uh I can quickly start with a very foundational question on what do

standards actually govern and my first question will be towards uh the favor team Mark and Patrick based on your experience of building the certification can okay based on your experience of

building the certification scheme can you really talk about how could this realistically change our AI supply chain and what are the visible limits as per you over to you.

&gt;&gt; Thanks Manzor. Can everyone hear me okay with this mic? Great. Okay. So, I think you know that is the big question is what what role something like this can actually play? And I think what's really

important to stress is that [snorts] something like this some a certification should absolutely never in no circumstances be a substitute for real regulation with teeth. But some of the

problem that we're grappling with is what we tried to discuss in the presentation that when you have jobs that are traded that are highly commodified that are traded in this

planetary labor market where it's very easy for jobs to flow from one place to another. The hands of regulators are very significantly tied in the in the countries that host a lot of these jobs.

As as I said earlier, your choice is sort of bad jobs or no jobs really when you're when you're dealing with this highly commodified work. And so uh and like I said earlier too, you know, we've

there's there's examples of workers trying to organize, workers trying to create this sort of counterveailing collective power to improve the standards of their jobs. And same exact

problem, which is the minute you you make life too difficult for these companies, they've got no interest in keeping these jobs in one place versus another place. They can quickly flow to

the other side of the world. And so that's the space that we're trying to create this sort of pressure in this sort of certification scheme. Not in any way to try and say, well, we don't

absolutely don't need regulation. We do. And in a perfect world, there would um there would be minimum standards enshrined into law to protect workers from a lot of the harms that we see in

this sector. But in the absence of that, that's what we're that's where we see a need for this sort of certification to fill in the gaps in this uh in this absence.

Thank you Mark. Um Siru if I can come to you from your experience of working in the Indian policy and research perspective. Um which labor issues do you think becomes legible within

standards framework and most importantly which dimensions of labor risk remain invisible or depoliticized? &gt;&gt; Yeah thank you. That's a tough one. Um I think there's

you know &gt;&gt; we've been following the fair work and the certification work for many many years now. Um there are of course aspects of labor work that are captured.

I I suppose there are two ways to look at it. One is to think of the thematics or the domains of labor that can be captured through certification. This is health and safety. This could be wages,

pay, um working conditions in some senses etc. There's another way to think about what is legible to quantitative and measurement systems. And I think the caveat in linking to the second part of

the question around what cannot be measured or what sort of gets invisibleized, it is that certification systems only measure what can be measured. Um and it is data that is

quantifiable, data that is visible and data that is legible. So it is it is information material data that meets these standards that can then feed into certification. But Mark's

presentation pointed out and there's enormous literature including some that we've done on data annotation that talks to a variety of conditions uh that surround what are sometimes

symptomatized by uh working conditions and pay. Um these relate to lack of dignity, these relate to a lack of agency in the platforms that people are working on. Uh it relates to working

conditions. Um it require it also relates to certain tasks uh that are quite central um to um to the making of AI. So to think of certification systems and and I absolutely resonate that the

the argument that it cannot be the end point and it is a starting point but one must be cognizant that certification systems do not necessarily measure what cannot be quantified. What cannot be

seen as uh either a binary like uh or a categorical variable are things that do not necessarily make it to certification systems. So there's of course two ways to think about it. Um can we think about

more complicated compound ways to do certification which is one part of the question uh the other is to always be cognizant that certification is a huristic it's an indicator what is

really required is a deeper dive uh and more deep engagement with uh firms and organizations that are doing various elements of platform work so I'll pause here and hopefully there's more time

yeah &gt;&gt; no we have time um so you mentioned about deeper engagement ment with policy makers or firms here. So I'll now look towards biology. Um based on again your

experience of uh the policy advocacy work you have been doing for quite some time now. Uh if you can share what aspects of labor standards do you think are taken seriously by firms uh and even

policy makers. You can talk about your experience of working with the Karnataka state government as well. But yeah over to you. &gt;&gt; Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Yeah thank you. Uh yeah so you know as part of uh fairwork India I've led this project for six years spoken to all the sort of the biggest platforms in the country u I think couple of things

really stand out platforms will not accept uh standards unless they're mandated there's absolutely no two ways about that okay and to the extent that they're even willing to accept any

standards u it's going to be only if there standards sort of affect a sort of a broader uh public or a broader community for example to give you a very simple

example uh you know you know Mark talked about the invisibleization of labor these apply even to labor when it is very visible when things are being delivered at your doorstep you don't

understand the sort of the intangibles the kind of standards that are not at work that might change their lives in some way or the other so for instance the platforms might accept say some kind

of you know traffic regulations because that's more broadly mandated when it comes to delivery but over and above that on their own they're not going to do it. Now there are some platforms that

actually are willing to accept voluntary standards but our experience over the last few years has also shown that these standards are often gamed and operationalized in very specific ways.

Now let me give you a concrete example in this regard. So many or a few platforms actually give insurance and other benefits to their workers right but then this has turned

into a gaming scheme. how they say we'll give you higher benefits if you're a more efficient worker. Who defines efficiency? It's the platform. So essentially it turns into a rat race

within the own within the sort of the platform's own workforce. So you're saying I'm going to get more work insurance benefit for myself as opposed to her although we working for the same

platform and you're supposed to get these as a sort of a floor, right? There's nothing like that. So these things are operationalized on the basis of convenience. There's absolutely no

standard. Interestingly enough, many platforms actually uh blame technology, right? Despite their deployment, they'll say, "Oh, AI, you know, we we can't standardize that. If these decisions are

made, this is something like a blackbox technology, we don't quite understand, right? So, essentially, it becomes a sort of a merrygoround. You don't know, you know, everybody's pointing fingers,

the platforms are pointing fingers to the technology and the technology seems to work in its own mystical ways. So we don't and on top of that even within the sort of the the sort of the visible

platform economy there's a lot of subcontracting that goes on and platforms simply you know absolutely disown u sort of or take no responsibility for the companies that

actually deliver their parcels or food or or food parcels you know whom they subtract these sort of deliveries to. So this is in so far as the sort of the platforms are

concerned on a policy level. I think what's true is that I think this there's very little uh appetite as yet to enforce any kind of standards or you know ultimately if the state is going to

do it it has to be through regulation. There's not yet you know we we don't have anywhere close to the kind of appetite we need. Even the recently passed code on social security or the

ones that it was passed in 2020 but was formally accepted by the government two or three months ago or the legislation in Karnataka, Rajasthan etc. They only you know what I would say go after the

lowhanging fruit which is social security a whole bunch of hard questions working hours how they moderated how they attracted right all those things have been we we've been completely

silent on so and the state has not gone after that platforms are not going to accept it voluntarily so I think we have a lot of work to do let me stop here &gt;&gt; thank you all so I'll connect with the

last line we have a lot of work to do so That's next round which is about from scope to movement. Uh and also sir you talked about standards don't work in isolation. They move through procurement

processes, research networks, advocacy and policy frameworks. So Norman looking at Patrick now. If this question is for you Patrick so if you can talk more about

how do standards acquire influence. So if you can elaborate on that. &gt;&gt; I think you can hear me now. Okay. Yeah. Perfect. So I think what we've seen we said that we have created these 400

changes with the companies by just assigning the scores and just using the scorecards to create some transparency about the differences in working processes and I think the key point was

that the scores help uh on the one hand to to benchmark performance so we can give um um a clear like picture to these companies how they compare to their competitors but I think a second aspect

is much more important. We also gave them something like a guideline that they could work towards. So the changes that we saw were companies trying to make some changes in order to get

another point to distinct themselves or to set themselves apart from the competitors and they had a clear idea what they needed to do. So I think this is also something that standards are

very relevant and good for to showcase best practice and give a clear instruction to platforms. Okay, if you want to improve this is something that you can start with. So not saying that

10 out of 10 as as we said it's basic minimum labor standards not the the best place to work. So this is open-ended. So if the moment you have 10 out of 10 doesn't mean you can stop and

everything's done. It's more like it's the start to to to start that journey of continuous improvement of these working conditions. Think about what can we do together uh and what can we do to

improve and I think the standard is an important means here to guide the the efforts of these companies basically. I think you want to just press one. &gt;&gt; Yeah please go ahead. Thanks. If if I

could add something to that real quick. I I think another another very important way to think about standards is I I was thinking about the example from in the UK we have a foundation called the

living wage foundation and what they do is they certify companies that pay a living wage and they give them a a badge saying this is a living wage employer. Now

them doing that in no way means that everyone gets a living wage or that somehow it's enshrined into law. it. There's maybe 5% of of or less of companies that do this, but it shifts

the whole debate. It's sort of set a standard, a target that is is kind of certified. Companies can work to it, and it shifts even the debate about what the minimum wage should be. The minimum wage

in the UK just went up substantially because it changes the whole debate about what is possible. You see all of these companies that are certified that are doing something that a bit above and

beyond what they're legally required to do and then you see them be successful companies. It's not killed their business model. They're not uh they're not all going out of business. So I

think this kind of thing can really um just showing the actual existence of these things can really uh shift what's possible. &gt;&gt; Thank you Mark. Um siru I'm again

looking at you and you have talked about that standards cannot be silver bullets based on your experience again um how do you think we can effectively design um the standard and certification through

advocacy and most importantly how do they how are they how can they well recepted by the companies or policy makers so that it can be part of the institutional frameworks

&gt;&gt; uh I think there's two parts to the question one is sort of what are the inputs into standards and then how do you take standards into the policym discourse and hopefully into

conversations around regulation. I'll try and answer in both parts. The inputs into standards there are sort of two very clear pathways. is one is of course research

both theoretical and empirical uh that shines light problematizes work looks at what is distinctive what is similar to other forms of work and then is able to outline what normative

or value based conditions around this kind of work must be that is central it is a central input to the idea of standards and flowing into regulation potentially the second part of course is

the community of actors that think more seriously about I dare say well-being. I know it has a a little bit of a loose connotation but think about this as a

value system and not just as a as um as you know generating jobs or some of the more narrow narratives around work um and this advocacy ecosystem um that is diverse in by design uh is

also a central actor. So having conversations enabling sort of I suppose the give and take uh that is quite essential in the development and design of um standards with these two inputs

you have hopefully standards you have an understanding of what society values as good work um but then the institutionalization is a is a tough pathway. There are sort of three or four

things to think about. one is I think Mark alluded to it which is a tighter link between compliance with standards and actual market or user perception. Um I think the term is checkout line

activism. Uh which I like. Um but I I don't know if it's immediately transferable into the domain that we're speaking of but there is something there about a tighter link between the

conditions in which a certain product or a service is produced um and people's perceptions of it. I think there's a second one which I dare say must be considered quite seriously which is

around judicial pathways. what the courts are able to do in uh liberal democracy at least is translate traditional understandings into newer contexts. So the role of judicial actors

in you know moving the needle in a certain way um is uh to be recognized and engaged with quite seriously. I think the third is I keep coming back to this and there's sort of a broader

passion project around um the need for research um and the centrality of empirical understandings and theoretical conceptualizations around questions of standards. So um I I hope that tackled

at least some parts of your very complex question but uh maybe if we have time we can come back to some of these things. &gt;&gt; It indeed it did. So talking of complex question bal uh this next question might

be a bit complex and difficult for you on this. So looking at India's institutional landscape uh you talked about how a few organizations or even states look go for lowhanging fruits.

What pattern of resistance or uptake as well if at all it is do you you have observed or you think it might happen? So I think to answer this sort of you have to look at what the state's

priorities are right first and foremost that was what was alluded to earlier there's a desperate you know effort to create worker opportunities in an economy where we simply not creating

enough right so that's a top priority right the second thing at the national level and at the state level is this whole game of trying to attract more venture capital and investments

Right? We need to go up the global league and within the uh states of India, each state says I got more money this year than the than last or my neighbor. Right? So between the need to

sort of create work opportunities on one hand and this desperate race to attract investment, what we tend to forget are the quality of work opportunities that are being created in large measure

because the firms that are being most successful in in sort of attracting venture capital are these so-called unicorns that are glorified many of which is actually these platform

companies. Right? So you have this sort of the a state that is willing to actually turn a blind eye to this particular situation. Now that fits in very very nicely into

what platforms themselves are seeking in their effort to build these sort of large technological sort of infrastructures. All said and done, despite their

squeezing labor, and that's the only phrase I can use over the years, very few of them seem to have a business model that is able to make any money. Does this this seems to be this

continuous addiction to creating more and more venture capital. It's like froth on a nice cup of south Indian coffee or on beer and that's what many of them seem to be floating on, right?

So there's no sense that you're going to see light at the end of the day. So there's greater reliance on that. So if you don't want to upset the actual card, you're going to have to continue to rely

on venture capital. You're going to have the state saying, "Oh, we can't affect work generating opportunities." Now the the the other problem here is talking about the planetary dimension. A lot of

this venture capital comes from abroad, right? Here the local representatives of venture capital are simply taking very small chunks of these sort of people like Kalpers and all these giant venture

capital investment funds taking small portions of them and they simply are told this is the return on investment that we require you know ESG be damned although there's a lot of rhetoric and

what you might say ESG washing about how venture capital money is going to be deployed or needs to be deployed so all these normative arguments are made but none of that so One way of actually

thinking about this apart from judicial activism is actually think of how do we sort of you know who's going to build the venture capital cat which is largely keeping many of these companies afloat.

&gt;&gt; Thank you Alaji. Um &gt;&gt; on coffee and beer there's a Tamil phrase which is apt norm which is which means dance on foam. Uh so I just thought I'd jump in with that.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you so I know we have to be mindful of time as well. Uh last round of questions for all the panelists and this is more towards we we realize that standards exist but very few

transform systems. So either Patrick or Mark if you can answer this. What do you think are the leverage points on standards? How do they become consequential?

&gt;&gt; Yeah thanks. I I'd really like to take up something that Charles had said in your your first response about the limits of certification. I think the most important point is about division

of labor. So there are some things that certification schemes can do. There's something that governments can do very well. There's something that unions can do very well. And I think the the the

the challenge is to create a system where the linkages are done in a smart way. So uh for me like one of the uh better examples of the of the recent years was actually the the European

Union's uh corporate sustainability due diligence directive. It was just watered down a little bit. But the initial idea to have a system where basically the government requires companies to

exercise that due diligence if they want to put products or services on the European market. So it does not only cover European companies but all the companies who want to work in Europe

basically. And that required them to do these due diligence mechanisms. And then the standards came in to guide the the uh company's efforts and so on and so forth. And at the same time companies

need to be transparent about what they do. They need to publish reports on the risk they identified. they need to report on the uh measures they implemented to to fight these risks

actually and that gives civil society organizations, union worker representatives some leverage to hold these companies account accountable against these standards. So I think this

is pretty good example. It doesn't have to be exactly like that on state level. There might be other means but it's it's about linking the different mechanisms and see if they can work together uh to

make them the most powerful. Basically that's basically my main idea. &gt;&gt; Okay. Thank you Patrick. Uh quick question to you siru. Uh I know uh there's a lot to do on standards and

certification but if I can quickly ask you what are the what do you think is the realistic pathway for standards especially to move from voluntary frameworks to regulatory integrations.

Um I think some part of what I said in the last round which is thinking quite seriously about um generating realistic contemporary evidence and having those loops between what we learn

from research what we learn from the field uh into the policym conversation. The second is I I dare say this feels a little bit uh reductive. Uh but again working quite hard on

on drawing a tighter link between um drawing a tighter link between the production of AI itself, the conditions in which AI is produced uh and the decisions of consumers and users. Um

there is evidence in other domains uh where this has been quite significant uh in driving uh if not uh policy action or legislative action uh meaningful uh market for better certified and

better valued products including in domains like privacy governments coffee there's there's a whole range and of course with certain critiques of it um I think these two pathways to

institutionalize and thinking about the judiciary as an instrument of law making. Um I I'm a lawyer and so perhaps my uh it is my comfort zone but thinking quite seriously about how to create um

legal decisions that act as precedent particularly in liberal democratic context even otherwise um that can be quite uh meaningful. So yeah I'll pause. &gt;&gt; Thank you. And the last question goes to

Balaji. Um and I have seen you emphasize a lot about state capacity and the enforcement by the state but in context like India can standards in any way complement state regulation or do you

think they risk substituting it? No, the state shouldn't be, you know, the state should be mandating standards, right? That's the job of the state. And that will happen only when it becomes a

political priority. I'll show you what it means not to have a political priority. Recently, the labor minister called the platforms and says, "Don't do 10-minute deliveries." Everybody nodded

their heads and went home. There's absolutely no way of actually holding platforms responsible for giving workers a means to actually complain against them. No grievance literal of any kind.

This is travesty. This is not mandating regulations or standard. This is absolute travesty. So that is not political priority. A B platforms must also see this as a source of competitive

advantage. Right now it's a zero sum game. All these guys, the guys who run these platforms, I know many of them, they all go from one to the other. They all know how each one operates and it's

a race to the bottom. So they're not going to change their habits on their own without any push from the top. And this government has not yet shown seriousness on that front. Finally, a

lot of the responsibility lies with people like us in the room as customers. What kind of demands are we making on platforms to make sure that their workers are subject to certain kinds of

you know standards and that they will not you know we can preach till the cows come home but it's the buck that counts and that the buck stops with us ultimately. Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Thank you sir. Thank you so much. Um I've been asked to skip the Q&amp;A so unfortunately we won't be having any question answer. Maybe we can meet outside and we can ask question to the

panelists. So thank you so much to all our panelists here today who have joined and engaging so thoughtfully and we have heard again and again that standards and certifications are not silver bullets

but in a world where production is becoming more and more transnational but the regulation has to be national so more and more push from the state more empirical research to complement to that

and as most importantly as customers what exactly are we or what exactly are we driving for that's most important here thank you so much for being part of this conversation and we hope this

continues beyond this room and Again a warm thank you everyone to being part of the panel again. Thank you everyone. Um can I request panelists to be there? They want a group picture with you.

Yeah. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; That's okay. I cannot believe I never ran into review. I used to work at NASA

Foundation and then Ever Group. I've been researching impact sourcing for more than 25 minutes. Sorry. &gt;&gt; Yeah.
