## 📝 Transcript

Yeah. Thank you for joining us today and good evening ladies and gentlemen. On behalf of the International Solar Alliance and our partners, [music] it is my privilege

to welcome you to this session spotlighting the global mission on AI for energy. Today's session brings together global leadership to discuss what could become one of the most

consequential missions of this decade. To formally open the session, I invite Mr. Karan Mangotra, chief of strategy and new initiatives international solar alliance to deliver the welcome address.

Good evening everyone. You know will AI overwhelm our grids or will it optimize them? Will solar remain underutilized or will it be intelligently orchestrated

across rooftop substations and markets? Will this transition be centralized and exclusive or decentralized and citizen-driven? These were the questions of why we began

this journey. A few years ago, the conversation was simple. Deploy more solar and we did. The world added record levels of solar capacity uh roughly around 400 gawatt in a single year.

Costs fell, ambitions rose, and the solar revolution took hold. But as solar scaled, systems grew more complex, rooftop panels multiplied, distribution

networks became birectional. Electric vehicles and storage entered the grid. Now at the same time, AI surged powerful, energy intensive yet transformative. Now what we realized was

something very fundamental that AI needs energy but energy systems also need AI and if we shape this convergence well the future is extraordinarily promising. Now imagine grids that an anticipate

stress before it happens, distribution networks that self-optimize, and rooftop solar aggregated intelligently. Peer-to-peer markets empowering citizens, and cleaner power

driving smarter economies. Now, it's not just about technology for its own sake. It's about reliability, affordability, and resilience for people. Now at the international solar alliance a global

south anchored intergovernmental body we are committed to ensure that this transformation is inclusive. Uh AI enabled energy systems are deployed not only in advanced markets but where the

demand is rising the fastest and the impacts matter most. Through practical usedriven collaboration we are moving from ideas to implementation. Now on behalf of the ISA, I would like to

sincerely thank the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, Ministry of Power, Rural Electrification Corporation, and FSR Global for their leadership and partnership on this. I would also like

to acknowledge the ISA multid-donor trust fund partners, GAP, and our knowledge partner systemic for helping us shape this important initiative. Most importantly, I would like to thank and

welcome all our distinguished panelists and participants for being a part of this journey. So, we began all of this with solar deployment, but today we stand at the intersection of solar and

AI. And the future, if we design it well, is intelligent, inclusive, and deeply citizen. So, welcome you all and look forward to an engaging session. Thank you Mr. Mangotra for setting the

tone and reminding us why this movement demands collective leadership. As we move from vision to architecture, this next segment of our session highlights a key enabler, the India energy stack.

Let's begin by watching a short explainer video. India is on a journey toward a developed 2047 Vixit Bharat. an ambitious goal that needs not just more electricity,

but smarter electricity. For decades, the grid was simple. Big power plants sent energy one way to homes and businesses that paid for consumption. But today, [music] the grid

is alive with millions of moving parts. Solar panels on roofs, wind farms, electric vehicles, batteries, smart meters, and smart appliances. So as India grows, [music] the challenge

is not generating power. It's helping these parts coordinate in real time. This gets [music] complex. Let's break it down. Meet Rani. She runs a small catering business from her home kitchen.

Her family has rooftop solar and an EV scooter. Rani wants four simple things. Power she can afford. Power she can rely on. bills she can understand and options that let her benefit from the energy she

produces. Today, this experience is fragmented for everyone. Joining a new energy program means paperwork, manual checks, and long [music] waits. Data is locked in

different systems. Services struggle to connect to the grid. This is the coordination gap that we need to solve for. To bridge this gap, India is building India energy stack. IEES

[music] is digital public infrastructure for electricity. Think of it as a network of digital highways that allow all utilities, service providers, consumers, [music]

and even devices to communicate and work with each other securely. IEES is built using foundational building blocks that can be used to build energy services, identity and addressibility,

registries and directories, interaction protocols, energy credentials and policy as code. What [music] does this change for utilities and system operators? It

enables [music] faster problem solving, better planning, and lower costs because everyone [music] can finally talk to each other. For regulators,

stronger oversight with clear data, transparent reporting, better decision making. For innovators, a bigger opportunity. Startups [music] can build new energy

services without starting from scratch every time. And for Rani, [music] real empowerment. She's no longer just paying for power. She's earning [music] from it. She gets

paid fairly for her extra solar energy, charges her EV smoothly, understands [music] her bills, and gets help quickly when she needs it. IEES [music]

opens the door to this kind of energy agency and livelihoods at scale. Imagine women led groups in small villages and local entrepreneurs across the country delivering trusted energy

services to their communities. IEES is not just a piece of [music] technology. It is the foundation for coordination, trust and reliability on a national scale. It creates a cleaner,

more reliable power system where electricity becomes not just a cost but an avenue for livelihoods and empowerment. One nation, [music]

one frequency, now one digital grid. India energy stack, an initiative by the Ministry of Power built in India for the world. Uh to help deepen our understanding, I

now invite Miss Shua Ravi Kumar, executive director, FSR Global, to please make a presentation. Good afternoon everyone. Thank you so much for this opportunity. I'm Shrea. I

had FSR global and I'm going to unpack some elements of the video that you just saw. So it's an absolute privilege to be opening on the Indian energy stack at a global forum at this session.

So let's just rewind back. India in 2014 was at the same crossroads trying to uh transform the banking sector and today the energy sector is at same at the same cross crossroads. What does this mean?

Back in 2014 as well, India had banks, it had phones, it had a lot of money that was transacting, but it did not have a common digital rail to connect them all. Then UPI happened. It was not

a new bank that the government came up with. It was not a new app either. It was a simple protocol that unleashed the power of a two trillion digital payment economy today competing with the likes

of the Visas and the masters across the world. So this is the unlock that a simple digital public infrastructure approach can uh enable at the world level.

So coming to the power sector, we currently have all of these different moving parts. Beat it a rooftop solar owner in Jaipur or a EV startup or a CPO in Bangalore or an energy regulator who

wants to make sure it's a consumer ccentric plans are being made in Chennai or a cooperative in rural Maharashtra. All of them use different systems and interact with the different set of

stakeholders. We are now enabling through IIEES the common digital rails for them to communicate with each other in a seamless way. So the sector is now ready to connect.

So what does this mean from from for all of us who are in the sector? We know that there is a lot of deployment in terms of scattera systems, smart meters. India is planning to connect 300 million

households uh through smart meters. But all of these different systems have its own unique language that they interact with. Interoperability interoperability does exist but it is not in a seamless

way that we would be able to extract at the scale that we're talking in the case of India. So here how can we move from siloed to more shared information? How can you have interoperability at the

heart of design so that you make that seamless interactions possible and create an ecosystem that allows for innovation to hap uh to scale up all of these uh leaprogs that we are

envisioning for the sector. So that this is where IES comes in as a trust bridge. Let's look at some of the examples that are more closer to all of us in our day-to-day lives. Uh for

instance, how if every meter, a solar panel or a EV charger had a verified digital identity much like how all of us as citizens of this country have ADAR which was a DPI. Again if an any consu

if an app can discover transact or settle energy services across utilities say we move from one city to another that would be very similar to the UPI that we have today that we also

generously use on a day-to-day basis. I don't think so any of us carry cash anymore in our wallets. Uh if there are anyone you can raise your hand for regulators, how can they write and

make uh evidence-based decision making more easily much like how GST unified the country through uh or a more centralized and federated way of going about this. Likewise, if you want to

have proumers like we saw in the case of Rani in the video before wants to sell her surplus power and exchange it with another customer from within her city or beyond in another state, then you have

other DPS liked which will facilitate for this. So India energy stack is not either ADA, UPI, ONDC or GST. It's all of the above. Uh so it's nothing but a set of protocols and specifications that

enable for this interaction to happen in a trustworthy manner. What it essentially does is it gives us a common language, a taxonomy, a data model that machines and humans alike can understand

and to help us scale solutions from pilot to actual implementation across the country. So how is this being done? When we say a digital public infrastructure, it's not

a monolithic solution that is being developed to be deployed across the ecosystem. It's built on foundational building blocks. So think of this a bit like Lego bricks that you're trying to

put together to make whatever uh that is that you're building as that particular stakeholder. So for as of now it's it's work in progress for us as the team. It's about six months old that this

concept is uh in in various forms of iteration. But we have six uh five building blocks here. Identity and addressing so that we recognize each other be it a system or a person.

Registries and directories which is like a lookup table for information to exchange across multiple systems. Interaction protocols. The power system already has a lot of protocols that

that's being used. But if you want to bring in new services, how do you sort of make the old meet the new and how do you sort of bind them together? You have energy credentials as the video was also

mentioning. How can I make uh like something like EKYC? How do I make my onboarding as a consumer into the utility ecosystem more seamless? Be it a commercial consumer or a residential

consumer. And what if we can codify all of the policy that we all engage with on a daily basis. It could be for a utility to look at uh to understand what tariff applies to which consumer or it could be

for researchers to understand how do you bring in the next kind of policy intervention uh to work with the policy makers. So if you can codify a lot of the policy, it becomes easy for us to

scale and uh enable analytics over and above that. This is where the AI unlock happens. What I will do because of its standard data models and organizing information in a common way would allow

for the data that is needed for AI to be able to uh become that intelligence layer on top to give any of us whatever questions we may have. It could be a grid operator asking for what should be

the reliability or flexibility measures that they need to keep in mind or it could simply be me as a consumer trying to understand my own behavior or it could be for policy makers or businesses

to know where do I park my money and how do I make those investments. So basically I would add act as that bedrock over which AI can literally unlock AI agents for a billion and that

is what uh we intend to demonstrate uh in two days from now and continue to do so through the um many months and years and not just that uh we are we as a country are now moving away from the

conversation on energy access to energy agency because we are democratizing power here that means self-help groups can now invest into uh decentralized systems and participate as an active uh

participant in the ecosystem. College students uh can can become become part of the solution building because we're building or opening up uh the innovation ecosystem through accelerators or the

agrarian society the farmers can now participate uh in in in offering flexibility and in demand response by simply adjusting some of their consumption patterns. So I unlocks micro

entrepreneurs and livelihoods at at a scale of a billion and so consumers are now becoming participants passive becomes active and access becomes agency and that's the vision that we have at

the India energy stack. So with that uh this is the idea that we would love to give built in India for the world. Thank you. &gt;&gt; [applause]

&gt;&gt; Thank you Shwita for that very insightful overview of how digital public infrastructure can translate ambition into scalable systems. Now moving on to the core conversation of

this session a fireside chat titled from vision to a citizen centric AI mission. It is my pleasure to invite our distinguished speakers Mr. Himang Jani senior adviser to the executive director

for India Bhutan Bangladesh and Sri Lanka wulm bank Mr. Dr. Henry Berdier, Director General Inria Foundation. Please join us on stage. Sir, Mr. JBN Subramanyam, Joint Secretary, Ministry

of New and Renewable Energy Government of India. And the chair for this segment, Mr. Ashish Kana, Director General, International Solar Alliance. A big round of applause, please.

over to you sir. &gt;&gt; Thank you Arti. A very warm welcome to all of you and to this distinguished panel. Uh I will begin by saying uh three broad aspects

just to introduce. First a lot of you might be thinking why is international solar alliance talking about India energy stack and AI for

energy. The answer is very simple. The world did 1,000 gawatt of solar in just last two years. 45% of that was decentralized renewable

energy which means either on the rooftop or on the pumps and while India has achieved 150 gawatt of cumulative only 15% is currently decentralized

which means India will see a huge quantum leap in solar rooftops solar pumps PM kosum PM surar and of decentralized renewable energy Now a lot of distribution companies

believe it creates more problems for them if you have a lot of solar rooftop which actually may not be true as we will experience in the session today and therefore we believe in international

solar alliance having digitization and AI is absolutely foundational element for doing a lot more solar. Second, while a lot of you if you are in the sector would have seen the data center

demand and therefore what are the energy requirements for AI. Now that is true for a lot of countries especially in the west and it's not a trivial matter but for developing

countries the real gamecher might be AI for energy which means what are the AI applications that will fundamentally transform the way energy sector is dealt as you saw in India energy stack

presentation because what you saw is what Amazon did to retail would happen exactly the same way in energy energy in 5 years from now millions of people buying and selling

power. And finally, as intertwining of AI and energy is going to happen, it is very important to have a framework, which is what we are here today for in terms of a overall global AI mission.

Which kind of a utility, which kind of an organization should be aspiring for what? And therefore there should be a framework for you have to do this in step one this in step two. So all these

three elements is what ISAI is there for. And since I have a great set of panel I'm going to begin. I'll start with you Himang. Himang is uh not only a senior adviser in Indian ED's office. He

has worked very closely on capacity building commission prime minister's office government of Gujarat and World Bank as well. So Himang you have seen it from a Indian level and the global

angle. Tell us a little bit what do you think needs to be done to accelerate the adoption of AI especially it has lot of cross se sectoral element elements both digital and energy coming together but

also the way this interoperability and products of technical assistance and lending as you look at the world bank what will be your perspective? So thank you Ashish. Uh first of all thank you

very much for inviting me and gathering such a stellar set of people. It itself is an honor. But let us also begin by thanking honorable prime minister for bringing the AI summit here. After

France in maybe 3 months or 6 months we are sitting here with the AI summit. It's a big thing. when I sit in Washington DC and I tell people that I'm going to AI summit and it's in India and

they all get surprised because nobody had thought of it. So we have to thank him in and thanks to RC and ISA because you are sitting here on in this hall on the very first day when the honorable

prime minister is inaugurating the summit. So that's a big thing for this audience this hall. Let me begin to answer your question by answering SATA's question. And I still query cache but

only outside India not in India. So that is in nutshell needs to change for AI for energy for the globe. If we can stop carrying cash outside India we

have changed it. U let me begin by what we look at it from DC at the bank. We have around 700 million people to be connected by 2030 to electricity. We at the bank has a miss have a mission of

connecting 300 million only in Africa the continent Africa. But if we want to do that uh as I I saw in one of the presentation India is going to add 300 million uh new

customers with smart meters. Let me put it in a different way. India is going to add 300 million intelligent customers to the grid. So while the rest of the world will add 300 customers, we will add 300

intelligent customers and that is what AI can do. So unless we look at AI not as a technology particularly for energy sector but as a development infrastructure itself the way we look at

the grid the way we look at discons and the way we look at meters we have to look at AI that it is also one of the infrastructure layer that we need to create simultaneously

and uh that is where I think the game game will change. Another aspect to it is what AI cannot do is AI cannot bring the fiscal prudence. AI cannot bring the

governance reforms. AI cannot bring all those things. But AI can enable a lot of those things. So if you are worried about your losses and that is what is uh the biggest contributing factor to your

fiscal issues then AI can immediately come in and help you. So how do we look at AI as a problem solver for the problems which are nontechnical in nature that also is very important part

of it and the third and the important part is what I I I will borrow from our senior colleague from Jaipur. She said we don't think in terms of pilots. So you can't think of in terms of pilots

when you are talking about a technology like AI. You have to think big. You have to think at scale and that is what I is trying to do. And to end my uh intervention what Shaa mentioned

about is that it is going to become another banking kind of a technology. I think we should not think that small we should think even even bigger than that. We shouldn't just stop being a finical

we should become the Google of AI for energy for the world. And that is what AI for energy or AI or IE for energy for the world will would mean. So thanks again.

&gt;&gt; Oh thank thank you so much Himman. Indeed the global air mission for energy is in that indeed that level of ambition. Uh let me go to Henry. Henry thank you so much for joining. You are

not only been a French ambassador for digital affairs but also DG of a leading research agency. Uh tell us a little bit. You mentioned very uh clearly that you're much more of a AI person than

energy. when you hear this big push of trying to bring energy and AI together, what's your reaction on what will it take to create this ecosystem of interoperability

uh stack for payments and citizencentric approach. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Very [clears throat] happy to be in India again even if I'm not anymore an ambassador. um we need to to

work hard to build proper ecosystems but we must uh we need open standards ecosystems and good regulation if we want to to win this this thing but first I want to recall [clears throat] you

know this but I will say it from a sorry from an AI from a digital perspective the energy transition is accelerating everywhere as you said our power system are becoming more and more complex

with more renewable energy, more decentralization, higher expectation for resilience from citizen, from businesses, from governments. Uh I believe that artificial intelligence

might be the only way to shift toward prioritizing renewable energies. We cannot build a new system in the old organization. So we must use it. But we also must remember that innovation is

not always a progress and that sometimes especially in the field of digital it did turn bad. We have bad experience with social network for example the AI didn't play a good role of the

uncontrolled AI. Uh we did start with open and genuine and decentralized network but some people took control putting companies on on the top of those infrastructure. So we have to learn some

to learn some lesson from this. I want to add before answering briefly to your question. France comes to this conversation with a third objective. We want the digital revolution and the

environmental transition to move forward together and that's very important. So I don't know if you know but in France in 2021 we adopt we did adopt a law specifically aimed at reducing the

environmental footprint of the digital sector. Um because of course uh there is a growing issue regarding the cost the consumption of AI and we have to to

invest fiercely to you did see the IEA report noting that AI could represent a meaningful share of global electricity demand soon in 2030. So we should ensure that the AI for energy does not

unintentionally create a new stress on power system. So ju just to mention this that's why France helped to launch with India the international sustainable AI coalition during the Paris summit and we

expect to go further during this impressive summit. I did mention this because if we come back to your question I told you open standards ecosystems and regulation.

Open standards are the earth of the digital revolution itself. uh everything is based on TCP IP, HTML and other open standards and that's not a coincidence. uh with open standouts first you share

innovation everywhere you because you don't have to to spend time and money to to make money you you can decrease the the return on invest and you can encourage a lot of innovation and of

course people don't notice usually you give a strategic possibility to everyone to to cooperate and to discover much efficient much more efficient I don't go further further because I think that

sjit and the experience of the Indian digital grid will will go further to this. But when you have open standards, you need

big extensive ecosystems with a huge variety of factors. They will. If you pay attention to the history of humankind, you don't have any example of

anything important that was not within a very diverse and vibrant ecosystem with this important concept of co-opetition. For example, in Bangalore, they have they all want to to build the next DPI.

So this is they do cooperate, they do exchange, they do share views, but they also want to be the one. So this is an example of cooperation and competition a coopetition but art music science and

industry everything important was born in this kind of context and if you don't have an a strong ecosystem with you you can be like um Nokia for example they were the

universal leader of phone but they didn't find any ID to fight the smartphone and they basically quite died and now they come back because they didn't have enough energy, ideas,

diversity to surround them. And the last and the last point is about regulation and I want to say sovereignty because for us [clears throat] people from the history of internet and digital

revolution, we feel a bit cheated. We did work hard to propose a world of cooperation, [snorts] knowledge, citizen empowerment, diversity, decentralization

[snorts] and because of a failure of regulation because we did misregulate. uh it's currently turning into few big tech companies trying to control all the network including the submarine cables

because as you have seen the last three years 80% of the new submarine cables were were built by the five gaffam so [snorts] and that's probably because we did miss one point when social network

did appear we did consider them as a passive infrastructure And there were media media with curation and promotion and a very active content curation. And because of this mistake,

we have very strong actors that can oppose firmly to Europe. For example, as you can see easily with AI, it could be worse. It could be worse because um when an you can if you can take control of um

an ecosystem through AI you can take all the added value they can transform every industry into a kind of Uber driver. So you are still there but you are just a servant of the

of the of the system and the only answer to to fight this is to be sure and I think that here Europe, India and even on a certain perspective China are on the same line. We need enough opensource

AI model to be sure that everyone will be able to innovate without asking permission public private small companies innovator etc. And we need a strong policies to encourage

sectoral models for energy for lawyers for farmers etc. to have a huge diversity of solutions. We cannot afford a world with three AI giants controlling every aspect of the economy. So again

open standards that is the bottom of everything strong and diverse and vibrant ecosystem and serious regulation or we we are working for three sociopathic billionaires. Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Yeah thank you. So very clear messages. I like that concept of uh collaborate and compete at the same time. I think that's very good as part of ecosystem and also the issues of concentration and

interoperability. I think those are very clear messages. uh which you will see in a global AI mission. But let me come to Mr. Subramanyam. Uh Mr. Subramanyam, you look after the entire distributed

renewable energy program of India as part of Ministry of New and renewable energy. Tell us a little bit of your experience as India is now close to 3 million households with a target of 10

million. How are you seeing digitization and AI in terms of an essential piece? &gt;&gt; Thank you Ashish. Thanks uh for having me here. Uh in fact both of us have been together just a weeks 10 days back in

Davos and uh we have seen with our own eyes the scale and the speed at which India is implementing the distributed renewables has been uh amazing and uh that is what we have uh presented to the

globe as uh as you were rightly mentioning the overall picture on uh renewables. Let me put put things in context. We we are close to as a country we're close to

almost about uh 500 gawatt plus now 520 gawatt to be precise and out of which almost 52% comes from non the renewable sources or the non-fossil sources to be precise and out of which almost about uh

140 gawatt come from solar and within this entire piece we're talking close to about 35 gawatt of distributed renewables currently installed in the country. But the the

the the even more amazing part of it is that out of this what we have done in the last 10 years and what we have done in the last 15 months the last 15 months has added

almost close to 18 gawatt to the distributed renewable energy space both under the pradhan mantri suryagar mof bijliojana which is the rooftop solarization program one of the world's

largest and the pradhan mantri kusum program which is again the agriculture pump solarization program again one of the world's largest between both the programs we we spend close to 9 billion

USD on rooftop solarization and about $4 billion on the kusum uh agriculture solarization now what happened with this uh kind of a speed that is coming up on the distributed renewables of course

distributed renewables is something which uh we are going up in a big way but where AI would help and the and the technologies would help. We have seen that with our own eyes in the pradhan

mantri surar where the it's not that rooftops have not been installed in India in the last 10 years they have been but what has changed significantly why is that we could do almost

almost 50% of what we have done in the last 10 years uh in in the last one year is because of the technology solutions that we have incorporated and the technology solutions have benefited

the consumer, the people who are on the field, the vendors, the banks and the discoms alike. So when you when you build a single portal, national portal, have all the stakeholders come on to it.

So it adds that much of value and credence. Now having said that what AI is going to do in fact uh I'm uh I'm I'm sure what Shweta has presented in the India energy stack it's going to be a

gamecher especially for the DR one because it has it has got all the elements of uh what a energy stack should do it is not it is not providing softwares it is

providing governance now with our what what is what is that we are looking at from here to scale up DR. DR has scaled up and it is scaled up in a in a big way uh moving forward also. But where our

challenge lies is on the distribution systems where unidirectional flow of uh transformers are there where millions of proumers are now generating where demand response becomes becomes important where

the assets that are being uh developed across the country need to be maintained. Can we build in predictability into this? There are a lot of generators who require weather

forecasting, predictive analytics. Can we get this onto onto the AI tool? Lastly, as a consumer, as a proumer, whether I know is my rooftop system, is my solar pump generating enough when

compared to my peers, can I be able to sell my electricity uh to the other peers which the P2P uh is trying to enable. So these are these are enabling decisions. So if you ask me what the AI

is going to do in the future, it will it will not just make us act. It will it will not just make us react but we it will make us act. So that is the that that is the uh story that we are looking

forward as far as uh DR and the AI convergence is concerned. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Uh I before I hand over back to Arti, I'm actually going to ask a very quick

one-s sentence question to all three of you in the same order. There is incredible noise around AI, I feel and it's very important to lead it to specificity. So my oneline question is

what would success in next one or two years on AI for energy should mean? Start with you. See, I think uh this is a very fastmoving evolving technology. So, you

shouldn't look for uh very early successes up front. You should look for very long-term building of platforms, long-term building of infrastructure.

For example, let me give you one example. International Solar Alliance. Honorable Prime Minister conceived it in 2014. Now, it has 42 countries. it will have

80 countries in no time and that is the digital public infrastructure for deploying AI to the world &gt;&gt; right so we should think in that long-term sense so what is one layer

that we can create from India and give to the world that is how I I look at it &gt;&gt; okay so we have 125 countries but we need to go much bigger Henry what will success look like in next one or two

I think that we can we should prove that we are integrating uh as much renewable energies as possible in our grid thanks to much better gesture of the grid because I think you are the professional

but renewable energies are less predictable and you need much more prevision, anticipation, control of the network. You cannot just add more solar system. So that sounds to AI that we can

have a very significant proportion of okay very clear &gt;&gt; I think I think in the next two to three years time success in AI and uh the re

convergence would be where the overall cost of power to the consumers go down our industy ustrial competitiveness goes up and uh consumer empowerment becomes a proumer

empowerment and our grids become ready for energy transition. This is all what I would look like. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. So with that, thank you very much. Please give a round of applause to

this set of panel. We are going to have lots more people joining. Arty, over to &gt;&gt; Thank you sir. Thank you chair and thank you panelists for that very rich and forward-looking discussion and I request

that you continue to stay on stage with us. We now move to a significant milestone for the evening the launch of the report that lays the foundation for the global mission on AI for energy. To

mark this launch I request all our panelists to please join us on the stage. Miss Arti Dogra chairperson discoms and managing director Jaipur Vidyot Vitran Nigum Limited. Mr.

Abhishek Ranjan CEO BRPL Mr. Sujit Nyer CEO and co-founder Fiday and Mr. Jeremy Openenheim managing partner systemic while the panelists take their seats uh we'll begin the segment with a video

preview of the report. The world is undergoing the fastest energy transformation in history. Renewables are scaling. [music] Electricity demand is surging. Power

systems are becoming more complex than ever before. But clean [music] energy cannot scale without artificial intelligence. Without AI enabled grids, the transition will slow [music] and the

window to act is narrowing. Across the world, AI for energy efforts remain fragmented. pilots, proofs of concept, isolated breakthroughs, but no coordinated backbone. Utilities [music]

face data silos. Regulators lack modern tools. Capital hesitates. Innovation moves, but not at [music] the speed this decade demands. The latest ISA report makes a bold case. The world does not

need more pilots. It needs a global mission for AI for energy. A citizen-entric mission to institutionalize delivery to bring urgency and focus to scale what works to

move from experimentation to execution because no [music] single country and no single institution can do this alone. Under the leadership of the International [music] Solar Alliance

representing over 120 countries, this mission will turn AI potential into measurable outcomes. [music] faster renewables integration, lower system costs, greater [music]

reliability, stronger energy security. It will stand on [music] five pillars. Smarter policy, skilled people, secure data systems, innovation at scale and finance [music] that unlocks deployment.

But this mission is not just about technology. It is about people. Citizens who understand their energy use, optimize their bills, participate in electricity [music] markets, become

producers, not just consumers. A citizen-centric power system is more efficient, more resilient, and fairer. The coming decade will define the future of global energy. Collaboration today

will determine affordability, security, and sustainability for generations. The technology is ready. The opportunity is clear. This is the moment for a global mission for AI for energy and the time

to act is [music] now. [applause] I now invite Miss Arushi Chopra, senior director systemic to make her presentation on the report, please.

Hi everyone and really delighted to be launching this report here today with you all. Solar growth has been outstripping all projections made to date. Wind has been rising rapidly. So

as we know generation is no longer the bottleneck. The grid is. And this grid was built for a linear world. Right? There's concentrated power. There are unidirectional flows. But that world has

now changed and the system that we now live in is dynamic. So upstream you'll see that generation is now intermittent and decentralized and downstream you'll see that demand is being reshaped by

heat waves, electric vehicles, data centers, right? We're living in a new dynamic system now. But the grid is not dynamic, right? The grid is linear and therefore that's the mismatch of the

energy transition. The good news is that digitalization can turn the grid from passive infrastructure into something that's truly intelligent and autonomous. And

this report here really tries to set out what that intelligent energy system looks like and what does it take to build it. So we think of it as this digital ladder

if you like right at the very bottom of this digital ladder are if you like the ears and eyes of the energy system. This includes smart meters, sensors, they really help you build visibility.

Then as you move to the blue rung, the second rung if you like, these are almost like the arms and legs of your digital ladder, right? Of the intelligent energy system. This helps

you act on the data that has been collected in the bottommost layer. So take the example of for example, if you know it's 6 p.m. and all electric vehicles have been plugged in at the

same time. This will act on that data and smoothen the demand to ensure that the system doesn't fail. Then at the very top is effectively the brain of the energy system. This is not just reacting

to the data that you get but proactively anticipating what's going to happen in the future. So it almost helps you predict and look ahead. So based on let's say temperature readings today, it

might help you predict is same rung right not every country is actually operating at the same level. So what we've done is if we move to the next page we'll see

that there are there are effectively if we move to the next page we'll see that there are effectively four different archetypes of countries that we look at right and if you look at certain high

high income countries for example if you look at the United Kingdom right here they already have visibility in place now it's about optimization right their challenge is optimization so take a

winter evening in Britain demand surges as at home as everyone turns on their heating. Now in a traditional system that would mean that further grilled grid buildout is needed and that would

mean more cost but in an intelligent system that doesn't happen right the system is optimizing itself. So it's really you know going to turn on uh storage is going to ensure that demand

reshapes itself and there's forecasting built into the dynamic. So that's what it's going to do in the UK system level optimization. But if you look at low-income countries,

let's say um I mean there it's primarily about visibility, right? Where is it that energy is coming from? In what direction is it flowing? Is it being lost? Are people paying for it? Those

are the kind of questions that are being answered um that are being asked in low lower income countries. So we looked at the use case of Ghana really right and in Ghana what we saw was that you know

putting smart prepaid meters is what actually reduce theft and billing gaps and consumption rose by 13%. So that's the power of you know customized use cases depending on the country you find

yourself in. And if you look across all of these four different archetypes, the technological and investment pathways are different. And that's what this report documents in addition to of

course all the use cases. So in conclusion, what I would like to say is the technology is already here. The use cases are already proven and our report brings up several of these showing the

value that is also is going to be generated for the system and for the consumer. Now what will determine success is execution and that's what this report launches you know it'll be

talked about later as well the global mission to really make this a reality and execute seamlessly across the 125 ISAR countries so the linear grid is what effectively built the last 100

years but the next 100 will be built on an intelligent grid thank you very much &gt;&gt; thank you Arushi please will you stay on stage with And I'm going to invite Karan Mangotra,

Miss Sha Ravi Kumar and Miss Nidhi Sarin from Gab to please join us on the stage for the formal unveiling of the report. The panelists may I please request you to please come in front.

Let's go. [music] &gt;&gt; [music]
