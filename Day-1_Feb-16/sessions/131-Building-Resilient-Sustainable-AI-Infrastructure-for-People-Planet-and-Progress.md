## 📝 Summary

AI at scale requires infrastructure that converts promise into real impact. This session explores shared compute, efficient architectures, and hybrid cloud-to-edge strategies, comparing frontier model training with deployment of right-sized models for citizens, SMEs, and public systems. Anchored in People, Planet, and Progress, we examine access, affordability, sustainability, and optimization in India as core design constraints. The discussion addresses what should be built nationally, what collaboration can unlock, and where geopolitical frictions may arise globally.

## 📝 Transcript

runs in basically two directions. One is that we are trying to create infrastructure so that we can use AI for the good that we want and the second is that the same AI can help run our

infrastructure in a more resilient and sustainable way. So uh so there are these two sides to this which is very interesting which is probably not true for any other kind of a broad use case

if you think about it. So that is very interesting and the second was that the design choices when we think about our infrastructure uh are shaped by what we want that

infrastructure to deliver. So ultimately when we think about uh the uh the resilience and sustainability as the topics that we are discussing they are also shaped by uh our constraints and

the choices that we make. So with that kind of an overview and now to build on some of these uh discussions forward um we have a very interesting uh set of speakers. So I'm going to start with you

Shahhat and you happen to be sitting right next to me also and uh so Shahed runs CFI Infinite Space Limited. So those of you know CIFI and those of you who are in my generation CFI is a old

player in the Indian ecosystem. But but when we are thinking about AI infrastructure which is a new in thing uh CI represents the data and uh center layer in this uh this conversation and

in this infrastructure. So sh uh let's take a step back and let's have an assessment of this uh infrastructure. uh I think it was you who was telling me or u I think it was you only that our

entire uh data center u uh capacity is less than the uh size of the data center capacity of Chicago and I looked up Chicago and it's true and and and maybe it is mature and all of that but uh uh I

want you to tell us that when when we look at in the global context where we are what are the some of the things that define the ecosystem system as it stands. Uh the shape and size of this

ecosystem uh where do you think there are you know differences in terms of how this ecosystem is shaping up in India as to probably what you see outside and also what are the areas where there are

gaps in this uh ecosystem. So we'll go about in the future later but give us a good sense of the present today. Yeah, let's just start with the history then right uh in India the data centers

started taking a shape after the cloud transformation or the cloud movement started. So the hyperscalers and the cloud service providers uh they started entering into the country in 2015 16

before that many of these startups that in India came uh on the back of the cloud services they ended up using the infrastructure outside India. One of the large hyperscaler player earned more

than $200 million revenue from India in 2015 without having the data center presence in the country. From there when it started it is still has not reached to any stage where it

could be the kind of capacity that the United States have. So for example the United States at the end of 2024 uh my numbers could be wrong here and there but somewhere between 20 to 25 gawatt of

the data center capacity versus India's just 1.3 gawatt which is today probably 1.5 gawatt so a lot definitely needs to happen to get where we should be so talking about the future later but

what is happening today &gt;&gt; right uh out of that 1.5 5 gawatt capacity that we have today in the data center infrastructure close to 3 to 3.5 gawatt capacity is under development now

under development capacity could come live let's say in next two to three years and you would say that India will be three times the data center capacity of today in 2 to four years but it still

will not be enough what is required to be taken care of and there is a lot more need to happen and lot faster faster it needs to happen so that the time to market is shorter and shorter possible

so that we could bring 10 gawatt in next four years not just the 3 to 4 gawatt and how things are happening for towards that how is industry reacting to that how is the infrastructure reacting to

that and how the whole ecosystem is building around that &gt;&gt; so this it starts with the you could say the capital uh it feels like that there is no shortage of capital right

This is the capital intensive business and this is the business where the returns could be made in the assured way with a very high creditw worthy customers. Therefore the credit is not

such a the capital is not such a big issue. Second is uh the government support and the policy uh and the regulatory framework uh it does look like uh government is very very

supportive to the data center infrastructure. uh it's such a huge event being organized today in this week for AI that AI event will have make no sense if we didn't have the data center

infrastructure the layer below what will run the AI so government is supported recent times we would have seen Ashishu and I both have followed that how government had been consistently

organizing the consultations with the industry uh in fact government has heard the hyperscalers also and their demand has been met it seems in the latest union budget and that will

probably create lot more demand. One of the big uh tax hurdles that they were facing, one of the big policy hurdles they were facing, it is now removed. So that does create a demand

uh demand acceleration for to bring the hyperscaler support also. Infrastructure is coming up very nicely. uh unlike the US uh where uh the energy time to market for energy currently right now is 3 to 5

years and uh the hyperscalers or the data center service providers there cannot wait for utility to bring that energy so long and therefore they are doing lot of behind this behind the

meter infrastructure the power development that scene doesn't exist in India India has the surplus power capacity and the transmission infrastructure is in such a way uh that

it can bring power to whatever extent possible to the facility at the moment when it is required. So in a way the ecosystem is fully in place to really catapult us to the extent where we need

to be. Uh it's just that we all together need to execute it and uh there is enough number of us who are making sure that uh we get to that capacity level as uh as as quickly as possible. All right.

So, uh Shhat, we heard from you and it's very clear and loud in this room that uh as far as the uh data center layer is concerned, we are only dealing with the problem of plenty [snorts] and and and

and and really we have to for it is for us as an industry to capture the market. &gt;&gt; Exactly. And I also agree with you that uh from a government point of view from the policy lens because that's something

that we've been working closely with the industry that they have really tried to address you know whatever uh concerns that could be there in terms of making a lot of those commitments in investment

actually happen and and and and but before I move on and I'll come to Rushali just in a minute is that uh tell me um when you talk about the ecosystem today how would you rate the Indian data

center ecosystem when you think in terms of you know things like resilience or things like incident response. So just a quick answer you know what is your sense &gt;&gt; see we can measure it in terms of the

outcomes &gt;&gt; uh you can give me an example to explain yeah &gt;&gt; we measure it in terms of the outcomes and what is the expected outcome of an

infrastructure it should always be available uh it should be resilient in the sense that uh redundancies should not be lost there should be least amount of risk into the infrastructure uh it

should be secured physically ally and cy and the software layer and network layer in all layers. Uh it should be safe. Uh it's the electrons per square millimeter is very high uh in the data center. It's

not such a safe place if it's not well taken care of. U and then it should be working towards the uh uh the sustainability that is u net the renewable energy u consumption and then

also towards the 100 or net zero goals in all these aspects India had been a zero zero availability incidents uh we haven't seen any downtime of data centers in the country uh we haven't

seen any uh physical security incidents in the data safety during whether uh uh the uh construction, deployment or operation. Uh we don't have any recorded safety

incidents that have impacted the life. U obviously there will be good saves and near misses at times but not to the extent that there had been the losses. Uh and then generally it had been

resilient. In fact, our customers uh keep us on the toe when we lose the resiliency. So the example is that uh if there is a redundancy in the infrastructure and the

redundancy goes down then not just us but our customers also get nervous about that. uh and that's where we are mean uh the the the country is full of engineering talent uh who are designing

and deploying and then operating these very uh you could say mission critical setups uh and they are able to do it very nicely all right great so I'm going to come back to you later and uh uh I'm

going to shift track a little bit you know and Rashali you are the global director for climate operations at Google Um and uh we are so delighted to have you here and what I want to do is

to straight away jump into your role in terms of what you do uh and and and try and understand that you know uh and the topic is the sustainability aspect which also uh Shahhat alluded to and by the

way if any of the claims which he made if you as Google say no no no no we we think these are some of these things which are not really so true feel free to tell us but first on the

sustainability uh So um given uh the fact that you know uh in a lot of these things when we think about from a business lens uh you know cost, reliability, speed these drive uh uh the

uh the entire uh infra ecosystem and and [snorts] in some sense one could probably argue that some of these might uh be at cross purposes sometimes or at friction sometimes when you think of our

sustainability goals. uh uh for example we also think in terms of uh time to deploy and so and so forth. So uh so how do you how does those decisions sit within an organization and and what is

the journey that you have seen and also maybe technology comes to rescue at times but uh and and also help us understand in terms of geographies because you operate at a global level

that do the do these decisions and these uh these aspects you know materially change when you look at particular kind of geographies because in India south of equator we are there is a heat there is

all of those kind of issues So help us understand how does your role really uh you know define some of these things when you look at sustainability as a as a objective in itself.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. Um that's a lot of questions. So I'm going to try and remember as many as much as I can. Can everybody hear us? Yes. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Um I'm going to start with

first saying thank you. This is like it's you know it's an interesting event to be at right having an AI summit in in India at the time when you're talking about so much of infrastructure

expansion and it's so linked to clean energy and that that expansion. So it's a fascinating time and I'm super privileged to be here. Um I also appreciate the fact that the between the

you know the three main pillars and the seven chakras you have all of the elements of sustainability which is which is planet or whether it's resiliency or people and I I appreciate

that because I think that's the kind of philosophy we have internally within Google and I'm sure all the hyperscalers um have as to how do you look at how do you look at growth and um you know there

was a time where sustainability used to be more like a CSR more like a wrapper more like you know building on on And what I think has shifted in a good way is how do you build all of these things

into it versus bolting it on later on. And I'll walk you through a few examples. Um so my role at Google is to help Google decarbonize um across all its operations and its value chain.

That's sort of like you know um at the top of it. But what that includes is looking at every single aspect that we have in Google whether it's our uh you know your foundations from your mineral

your materials that you get in to your construction to how do you operate a data center to then how do you actually you know uh sort of generate anything on top of it whether it's green software or

the application. So how do we build sustainability or carbon or any of those metrics as we go along the process. Um and there are trade-offs. I don't think, you know, if anybody tells you it's a

win-win, it's a good idea. But in general in life, I think we always have trade-offs. And what I believe is more authentic is appreciating those trade-offs and then working through it

as you go through. Um, and so a good example is I think what you said is right now we're at an interesting point where we have the technologies, but the speed at which we need AI deployed, the

speed at which we need infrastructure built, um, and the speed at what it takes to normally deploy some of these technologies don't always go hand in hand. And you mentioned about um in the

US right the the the the time for interconnection the time to get you know grid energy is so much longer and you're trying to figure out new new models around it. So there is a trade-off

between speed technology um efficacy and how do you do that and and where does innovation come into play. Um you know in some other ways there are trade-off than trade-offs I would say there's more

like design considerations. So you talked about you know different geographies now some are hotter than the others some are more water um risk zones than the others and so when we look at

design for data centers um we look at some of those pieces as to like we'll use an aircooled system it's a water intensive region we'll use a water one where we don't we have enough access to

water so those are actually design considerations and I can tell you the hyperscalers have been doing this for quite a few years so from a design perspective I think we've have enough

knowledge the question is how fast and where you can customize it to that location and that I think is the next piece that we're trying to get to right so the India data centers will be

fantastic um we've got smaller pieces but like the scale at which we're looking at now means we look at these design considerations slightly differently um I'll address one other

thing you know we've sort of in general I feel there's a lot of discussion around en energy power and water are the bigger constraints that come out of um the data centers for the most part so

Google has so far done 22 gawatt of clean energy across and that's a huge thing. Um, you know, we started off with like initiating and inventing PPAs before everybody was on board. Um, and

why I say that because it's actually a good thing to have this growth and tech companies who are generally um have, you know, are good at capex and have have good capital foundations and who are

good at innovation and scaling at the cutting edge of energy transition because I think that momentum is helping everyone to move forward faster. you're seeing a lot more you know amongst all

the hyperscalers you're doing first of a kind projects you're doing things which then moves the innovation faster because you have someone taking the bet you have someone you know who's who's um

investing the early pilot phases into it and then you also have them as big offtakers remember in the energy market you need big offtakers you need commitments to do that I think those are

the pieces that we need into so from a sustainability perspective just [snorts] rounding it up it's it's in your design it's in your procurement it's in your how you're thinking about data center

siding access to clean energy and not what you take from the grid but what you can actually add and bring on as you preparation. &gt;&gt; All right. No, that's good to know uh

Rashali and I think uh it is amazing to also hear those numbers in terms of 22 gawatt of clean energy done. So um I'll come back to you because I'm going to talk to you about your some maybe about

your India plans and we'll put that in the context of sustainability when we'll come back. But Nicole I want to now focus on your work at AWS. Uh so Nicole Foster, she's the director of global AI

and ML policy at the AWS. So I want to shift focus on uh resilience because I think at the end of it when we think about AI infrastructure, the the the single most important thing would be

trust. So uh so when you think about uh uh um AWS journey in terms of building out that kind of an infrastructure which kind of relays that uh so uh where if you were to kind of you know

reflect and don't go too back in the past we want to keep it little more current in terms of maybe last couple of years or so that where do you think uh uh the uh the industry has really moved

forward in terms of genuine improvements to be able to deliver that kind of a trust trust uh for all the uh all all that sits on the on the other side of the infrastructure which is the client

and customers and users um are there some examples uh and what is your assessment on where we are in terms of uh resilience and trust as a industry. So in terms of I mean if we think about

trust we also uh think a lot about security and controls as well um not just um resiliency of the infrastructure and Amazon just to go [clears throat] back a little bit in terms of where

Amazon started on some of these topics it was really Amazon the book seller if you think about the early days of the internet and uh think about how weird it would seem to use your credit card

online and so that was sort of the the first initial hurdle that we had to overcome as a company to sort of start to kind of create that strong kind of e-commerce business was how do we make

people feel secure about using their credit cards online and then you build from there. So security is is definitely built into everything we do and to your point about not adding security on later

or sustainability on later. It's the same with security. Security is integrated into every part and that's a huge part of I think the of building the trust. Um and then the other aspect we

think about are also um the legal controls of all of that but also the technical controls. And so um you know that access both that govern access as well as security. And so not only are

our services now secure by design, but they're also sovereign by design. And when we think about that um you know the first thing that uh that customers decide when they open their AWS account

is where they want their data to be. So where do you want your account to reside and so whether you want that um in India or Canada where I live that you are choosing where where you are putting

your data as a first decision. Um and then the other thing in terms of access and control is um at AWS we can't see any of our customers data. So by design it we have no access to our customer

data and so that um uh and then why do customers choose AWS or choose hyperscalers? It's really because of that the access to security, the reliability, the availability, and the

resiliency of what they're able to access and build. And not just build um build sort of locally where they are, but also that uh ability to scale globally is a huge part of what our

customers are looking for and to be able to do that in a consistent and resilient way. &gt;&gt; So, if I can maybe quickly follow up on that a little bit. Right. So uh no I

completely get that and and and I think it's tremendous because this is a bedrock in terms of you know taking the industry forward in terms of the uh uh overall you know uh the growth that we

are uh hoping to see over the next few years. So uh but if you were to also highlight for us that what are these one or two areas where probably there is at a industry level uh scope for

improvement when we think about either security or resilience uh which which and given technology is also disrupting on the other side right we we we talk about quantum we talk about risk and

from a technology side itself so that kind of a lens and and also you talked about uh customer choices so given uh the fact that uh there are many any kind of use cases. So in terms of uh customer

choices, what has come in new which you know u which which a a a CSP like yourself as a market is probably now uh addressing or providing which wasn't a demand even maybe a couple of years back

if there is anything like that. Well, I I mean I think it's the one thing that is very true is that is the innovation never stops and that grow the sort of new issues that you're mitigating

against don't stop, but also the ability to address those challenges is constantly evolving. Um, and I I think one of the other things that we're seeing is is yes, there are new threats

arising because of AI or from quantum, but we're also deploying AI to um to address those threats as well. And so the more that you take people I mean this is a very sophisticated audience,

but the more that you take people out of security, the more secure it is. And so the ability to sort of automate um who has access when they have access but also being able to understand um you

know and address threats in real time through machine learning is is been has been one of the kind of I think main innovations but it it's it never stops. &gt;&gt; All right. So um on that note we we're

going to shift a bit of a gear. So I think people were familiar with data centers, people were also familiar with the cloud service providers. But uh does anybody know what does it mean when we

say voice infrastructure? Uh just a show of hands if anybody has a good understanding what do we mean when we say voice infrastructure. [snorts] Okay. All right. So I'll just

take it to mean that uh this is an interesting conversation. So I'll bring in Ritu Meotra. Uh Ritu is the founder of Shuna Labs and uh I met Ritu only a few months back at another meeting and

and was so uh impressed and uh you know to to hear their story uh that I I we decided at NASCOM that we must have her as part of this conversation. So Ritu will you tell us you know uh what

exactly does it mean uh u when you say voice infrastructure and why is it important and how important it is and what is it that you are actually doing. Yeah

&gt;&gt; thanks Ashish and first of all great to be here a privilege to be here today. Um so when I say voice infra what it means is uh at the upper end of the ecosystem when we say something is it can you

understand when I say understand it's and it's very nuanced by the way right so when we are speaking we don't realize but we have these multiple different dialects different languages we speak

with emotions sentiments all of it kind of comes together so as easy as it sounds it's extremely nuanced so that's a first layer to it. &gt;&gt; The second layer to it is where you

understand right. So context creation &gt;&gt; or feel free to give examples. We'll understand much better. Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. So after I explain I am going to give example. So that's the second piece

wherein you know you understand what is said and then the third piece is where you dish it out right which is called text to speech in our way. So picture this. I am um somewhere in Bihar uh and

I speak um uh you know uh Bhpuri as a language and uh I am trying to understand that what my ration card balance looks like that person may be uh they don't may not know how to uh read

or write but are they able to say this in bpuri man balance right now if you're looking at anybody who's doing it and I'm sure uh you know

he will concur with me as well. The way it works today is you speak in Bhjpuri. First of all, understanding Bhjpuri is not there today. Um, we launched the first model there, translating it to

English and then translating it back. Okay, the whole three layers of translation, the context is gone. Right? So that's where when we say that, you know, we're building voice infra, that's

what it means. But it's not just understanding the voice and dishing the voice out. The important piece here is also the context and one other piece that we work um Ashish here is um on

smaller models right that can actually sit on uh people's phone uh the the CPU level architecture that people would want to use rather than running kind of GPUs as well which is you know uh uh I

one thing I often say is that you know the kind of um resources uh wild west has um in terms of compute in terms of um resources, capital, data. Um sometimes you know it's like you know

solving telling people that you know okay I want to solve traffic problem but hey let's get everybody a helicopter um but that does not happen for 80% of the population globally which is where you

know um which is very Indiaike and when I say which is very Indiaike if you look at large part of Europe which is where GDPR is like so prevalent and sovereignity is uh you know one of the

key themes or if you look at Africa uh some parts of India and some parts of Asia where price is a is a big deal and you know people are looking at or the linguistic um uh you know diversity from

all of that standpoint you know we don't speak just in English or a few top languages so that's where I mean you know when I say voice that voice ability to be able to hear understand respond

that's what it means now &gt;&gt; so let me just quickly follow up so given Indian context and given that for us dialect and language changes every so many kilometers and but infrastructure

when we say we we always uh you know say it along with scale. So so when you talk about your uh work uh as in building these models which do this voice infra help us understand a little more in

terms of what are those use cases where this will be so valuable and beneficial at scale that they kind of solve a problem which nobody else will solve for us. So I'll give you example um of

Angunani worker right we have about 1.4 4 million Angbari centers and about uh 800,000 workers that are working there, right? So what this means is um if I have to launch AI at scale and if it has

to be purely done on GPUs, you can just imagine 870 million conversations, the kind of GPU consumption I'm going to have, it's going to be humongous, right? For something like that. And that's

where you know you pitch in wherein you say that okay number one can you make this at I don't know 12th of the cost can it actually understand the language of the person that a local angari worker

is speaking in marati and being it not translated to English and then translated back in marati but maratti being spoken fetching into the e system and giving the response back so that you

don't lose the context in translation. Um, and when you have three different villages actually looking at this data, they are triangulating if there is a disease that could early detection of a

disease or something. So this is just one example that I gave you in the healthcare context if you will. &gt;&gt; All right. All right. So we'll come back uh and we talk about the future also

with you. So from a founder we'll move to a professor. All right. So we have a professor here Mr. Ravi Kiran and uh so you are associate professor at the international institute of information

technology at Hyderabad and at Bat Jen uh you are the core team member and principal investigator for vision projects and as we know Bharat Jen is one of the startups the 12 startups that

uh has made that cut uh to be developing the uh uh language models to solve for India. So uh again professor K delighted to have you on this panel and uh and so I think the the first question

and I'm asking on behalf of maybe a larger audience is that uh that uh what is it that one thing or maybe two that uh an Indian model uh can solve better or can solve which we can't get from

whatever is available elsewhere. So uh so I know there is a capability question that even if it is available elsewhere we should do it we should but but that's not my question here my question is what

is it that we are trying to solve which probably cannot be solved by models elsewhere and and it's more in the barajin context because we already heard Ru thank you

&gt;&gt; yeah okay yeah so um I'm really enjoying listening to all the uh conversation here uh all the discussion here because uh well we operate mostly at the

software level and uh we sleep better at night knowing that the foundation is secure uh we kind of take it for granted but uh you know when foundations fall apart then we appreciate them so for one

I'm really happy uh to be in a learning environment I have picked up a lot of useful things right so uh Barat Jen's uh primary motive is to build sovereign models uh

and uh built applications based on that in India for India and uh as part of this it's uh important to understand that to answer your question technically there is nothing

that others cannot do in terms of what we are doing right so given the same kind of conditions right it's almost like a lab experiment right like can you if you are given x y and zed will the

you know will the outcome of that process be the same. So I think from uh technology point of view I don't think there is something fundamentally unique. Having said that I think there are

certain aspects that I I believe that we are uniquely positioned to solve and I'll give you an example of that. For example take uh public grieviances. Ordinarily citizens when they have

grieviances they take them to the law right like the law enforcement or the government and uh it's unlikely that u they would expect their problems to be solved by uh you know typing into charg

uh well I mean they might get some ideas about how to go about it but it's unlikely that they will be solved [laughter] &gt;&gt; or Gemini for that matter

on this panel. Gemini &gt;&gt; on this panel Gemini. Fair enough. So the government actually has a direate of public grieviances which is established for this purpose. And what you have over

there is a portal where citizens can upload their grieviances in different formats. And when I mean different formats, it is truly different formats. People can record their grievance.

People can upload documents related to their grievance. Now think about handling the diversity and the different modalities. You're talking about speech, you're talking about text, right?

Documents and so on. Now dealing with all of this as a manual process is going to be totally not scalable and that is where I think we can step in and in fact we have stepped

in right. So this is I think a good example of something that &gt;&gt; this is a real real use case you're talking about. &gt;&gt; Yeah.

&gt;&gt; This is I think it takes away the follow on question because I was going to ask you that uh whom are you building for? So I think uh and and and you're so right that while the underlying

technology doesn't change it is the context which really uh uh makes it very different and and given AI is all about data and the algo working together. So u um we'll come back to it because it's

very interesting. A lot of people will want to know how soon, how fast, how good will some of this come out. Uh and uh okay. All right. So with that we have kind of one round. Uh the intent of this

round was to get us up to speed to where we are mostly in the world. What is really happening? What are we doing? Now in this next round which is our last round maybe we are going to focus on the

future. We're going to look forward because this is a summit on AI impact and I think we have established that what is happening is highly impactful but what is that impact going to further

translate into next 12 odd months or further is something that we'll all be very interested in understanding. So uh what I'm going to do is that I'm going to uh switch gears a little bit in terms

of the format. I'm going to pull in my colleague Sudto Banerjee who is sitting in the audience with his nice pink tie. So Sudu has been working with us on lot on the data center work and he has a

question for Shah. So uh so I'll not run with my question. I'll ask Sudu to go ahead and ask what he wants to know. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Hi Shahhat. So we heard in the first round that the the reality check

of India's 1 gawatt and which is less than the total data center capacity of Chicago &gt;&gt; and yeah and and we also get to hear these projections of 10 gawatt by 2030.

So I mean as ash said that it's we are expecting this round to be a future forward looking how realistic is this estimate and also if we dig deeper into this if we bifurcate the demand right

now how much is the domestic demand how much is actually driven by the hyperskllers because we get to hear when we interact that that we are dependent on the demand that is created by the

hyperskllers so our demand market is actually being driven by mostly by the hyperskllers and please correct me if I'm wrong. So if you can give also a mix of how that demand would actually look

like and one last I mean I'm getting an opportunity so I'll ask one more question that if one wish were to be granted in terms of any policy change or any particular change in the Indian

ecosystem what would that be and hypothetically imagine that wish will get granted. So please be bold if one lever you had to pick up. So for data centers the demand may be

coming from the hyperscalers but hyperscalers are not serving the world. Hyperscalers in India are serving India. So their India deployment is for India. Whether the India deployment is for the

world or not that is we will watch right. I'm hoping that they will serve world also from India and then we will get benefited by that. So it is India demand. uh so let's get this out that we

are dependent on any kind of a foreign demand. If the foreign demand comes then my 10 gawatt could turn into 20 right so so let's not get there right let's focus on this second just the data pattern

since co India's data center infrastructure grew at a 28% caggr from 0.4 4 gawatt to 1.3 gawatt by end of 2024. I have these exact numbers that's why I'm counting end of 2024 not

guessing any 2025 number yet. Even if I keep the same growth rate and just put in a small acceleration to the fact that the cloud adaption in the country is still in high single digit or maybe very

low double digit no more than 10 or 11%. In comparison to the developed world where the cloud penetration is closer to 40%. Let's assume that only 40% of the it can be cloudified remaining code will

still have to be non-cloud then also there is a four times of the just the cloud demand to happen and if I count that same 28% caggr and let's get take it in 7% acceleration on that then 1.3

gawatt becomes 6 gawatt by the end of 2030 did not count anything to do with uh artificial intelligence did not count anything to do with uh what the data

protection acts could come into the picture and if you add to that then someone if says it's a 10 gawatt then it's entirely possible so the demand wise there is a solid foundation to that

number that's where we could say that it will be there and in recent time what we have seen [snorts] in uh uh there is a good amount amount of inferencing related workloads has started to come to

India And therefore that 10 gawatt is possible. That was the first question about the demand whether 10 is real or not. The second one was uh &gt;&gt; also I think I was also asking that okay

this is the domestic demand but how do you also see the demand coming from overseas the Indian data centers actually catering to the global &gt;&gt; that's where I am f I am fully relying

on the latest union budgets uh clarification on the uh tax avoidance uh that has come up earlier the what is called poem uh place of effective management was a big concern concerned

with the global hyperscalers or the global players. Now that being removed with that 20-y year tax holiday, I'm assuming that some of that will come to India and that should that should be

able to bring to India. There are all the ingredients in place uh in India to be able to attract at least the regional demand. Uh uh power is available immediately. Talent is available

immediately. Ecosystem is ready to build as much data center as possible. It's not just us but then at least three big conglomerates have also talked about gio capacity in the country right

and then with our experience obviously we will be the bigger one with them bigger [laughter] but so but but uh but so so that way there are all the tailwinds in place to

host at least the regional data the cable landing stations are getting ready in the eastern coast which will can easily serve uh at least the south Asian demand demand, Southeast Asian demand.

Uh so yes, the foreign demand also should be able to be hosted in India. One thing that I you [clears throat] wanted my wish, right? &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. Don't forget the wish. Yes.

The wish is very simple. True true true single window clearance. If today I have to go and if any new data center project starts in the country, it's minimum four years from

the operation. One year takes to to get your head around the right land with the power. Another one year takes uh to get the all the approvals in place and then you take two years to deploy it and

commission at least. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, so at least at least this two years can be made zero with this single window clearances and true single window clearance.

&gt;&gt; Okay. So, the government is listening and your wish is granted. But uh Vertikica and Snoopil you know this is an area that we are working for. So it'll be good to double click on that.

Okay. All right. So I know that power and connectivity is also the uh base layer for you and in that sense um uh from a India point of view I think the story is let's uh build it and there is

uh so much demand that uh that all effort will be uh well uh counted. So uh and I'll come back to Rishali again and then to Nicole. Uh so when you look at sustainability as something that uh we

discussed earlier and often in tech industry what happens is what is science fiction today becomes science tomorrow. So in the sustainability uh uh uh kind of a space uh what are the some of the

things that you are looking forward to in terms of you know uh uh in terms of breakthroughs whether they are processes or whether there are technologies or what are the new developments which you

hope to see in market or even experiment and and I'm going to also be a little more you know take a India lens because you announced this big investment which is coming up in Visag so probably that

will see some of those uh newer things in terms of sustainable ability uh play out uh so help us understand uh in terms of future and it's not just about Google I think you can take a broader industry

lens and give us a peak into what to expect &gt;&gt; yeah I like the analogy of like what we see in movies then becomes real which is good and bad both right can be a little

bit scary too um so I'll just let me start with you know there are I look at the physical infrastructure side first from a sustainability perspective um I think from that and and if you go to

especially for India So India's got tremendous solar capacity. We know that right now it almost you know produces more than it can use during um you know during the daytime. And so I think the

big thing for India from a sustainability point of view will be um sort of storage. So either it is best sort of you know battery storage or long duration hydro how do you figure out a

storage model that takes benefit of all the solar and wind. I don't think generation is a problem right now as much as then making sure that it is 24 hours and then you bring that into a

grid and and make sure the grid is reliable. I think that to me is a big piece and you know it's to me sustainability is right now if you think from an energy perspective is unlocking

clean energy at scale um and for everybody and then making it very affordable and to do those two things you have to have things such as I think batteries are very important one

longduration storage is important and grid infrastructure so the way one of the things I loved I was here last year in Vikan and I saw a not just the the miles and miles of solar panels but the

new um sort of you know the new station that they are being built and the new grid infrastructure and the high frequency grid which then becomes an interconnected grid across India which

is fascinating. So I think that as you know going to your point the faster you can scale that I think is a big unlock. Um so that's a physical infrastructure side. From a data construction point of

view I think there's a lot under green steel and green cement that we can do in India. Um a lot of the big players are in it and there many different ways. It could be from the innovation side of

materials. It could be from a curation side. Um and the reason these are specific because most of you know like a construction perspective cement is very local. you could have amazing technology

breakthrough somewhere else but you know you're not going to get the cement to local place and same with steel we've got in great steel plants uh you know in in India so how do you make that

construction as green as possible uh is the next big one and then the third is the application layer what I like about what you were saying is you know you don't want to run large language models

you don't want to do there's training there's inference and then how can you be hyper local with your inference and running those smaller models and I think we haven't tapped into that as much and

so the more efficiency we can bring into that and the more innovation we can bring into that and especially when you're looking at a billion consumers uh you know as much as I love

infrastructure and I'm responsible for it I would love to have more easy applications and and uh fine-tune deployment that you know sort of you know where the demand is you can have

real-time demand response you can figure out which models to use when and how to right size it &gt;&gt; and AI can come to rescue in that side also

&gt;&gt; yes I'm hoping and we are hoping we on the demand response side and load balancing we are Um there's there is and even on the grid infrastructure and optimization we are but you know it's uh

it's early stages so &gt;&gt; all right good luck to that uh so um vatika you had a question for Ritu as a follow on and vatika she's part of the team she's been working on uh a lot of

these works with startups along with so I'm going to uh request her to pose her question for you &gt;&gt; thank you Ashish uh ritu first of thank you for educating all of us on voice

infrastructure It was really interesting. Uh I just wanted to know you know looking ahead maybe say the next two years [snorts] what according to you would be the most tangible change

you know from actually this India built uh you know frugal accessible AI movement that we are all witnessing today you know from that perspective if you could just pick one sector where you

feel we'll see the impact fastest you know be it education banking healthcare I don't know you pick it and if you can tell us what what is it that the users will see as a difference you know and if

I can just extend the question a little more if from the same sector you could also tell us what is it today that is the most hard part where you know which is kind of holding you from seeing the

impact that you would want to see and what do you think will change you know in the next two years to make it accessible it could be you know from Sha Lab's perspective it could be from you

know other startups perspective But please feel free to answer. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Start with the industry lens. I'll start with the industry lens. um and then maybe I'll move towards you

know where do I see so the first thing I think as the industry we have to work on is trust and that's the most important thing right so when I'm talking to uh any of the answering engines Gemini or

you know any any any uh any other player I think the first thing that we're thinking that okay where is the data going what is it storing so on that's that's number one number two is um its

ability to contextualize me. Um, and I'll give you an example. Uh, as I said couple of minutes back as well that let's say I'm in a rural town. I'm a woman who has to deliver a baby or I'm

going to a local health uh, you know, uh, facility. Its ability to understand my language, my problem related to my ecosystem is available on my device uh, and is

kind of understanding that so that's my level of you know that in the next couple of years if we quarters if we can get there I think that is going to be great so I think the distance that we

have to cover is trust even in the companies today when we deploy our voice solutions right the first thing that we hear is that the first time when you go in and your AI system doesn't understand

what people are saying the trust level goes down by 22% and it happens one more time it goes so it goes dramatically and then people kind of lose interest and that's why you know we are seeing that

the abandonment of a large AI projects is kind of it's it's interesting to see what the numbers look like today right so that's point number one point number two is if we have to make it to scale it

has to be efficient I'm not saying it has to be cheap right there's a difference between making it cheap and making it frugal the the word that you use right it has to be um uh you know

efficient um I'll give an example right uh one of the large companies uh has spent 680,000 hours to train a model that will dish out results right u whereas a company in India and I know of

many companies in India and one of them as I said is sitting next to me and Shunia by the way does the same thing can you do this in let's say 40 GPU hours right or thousand voice samples so

efficiencies will have to kick in uh I think in different and sometimes you also say right that when you don't have enough resources then it becomes the mother of all invention. So I think

that's where it'll go uh in my mind. So that's the end state but the way to do it is going to be building efficient systems um you know that that is going to be able to give you u better

tomorrow. Do you think it's going to do that sector which &gt;&gt; well one of the biggest beneficiaries uh having said that obviously finance right it's another one banking how do you take

banking to every remote part of the of the country and I will not say illiterate I will say low literate right I well we have the largest number of

smartphones in in in the world right um and there are people who understand who can speak but they can't read English Can we actually build something for these people to be able to be a part of

the ecosystem? &gt;&gt; All right, thanks. Uh uh Nicole, I was holding a tough conversation for you for a for a gap because uh my conversation is going to shift back onto the uh uh

onto the larger discussion that is now so common as as against maybe even three years back is on sovereignity. uh um I mean uh now uh a lot of the conversation is around uh you know delivering that as

a as a feature of the infrastructure itself. So being a global uh corporation and and looking at that entire space I mean if you help us understand going forward uh what where do you think that

entire uh uh kind of a piece is headed in terms of uh in in a very simple terms you know where do you see for example uh this is going to be non-negotiable in terms of certain areas maybe and and and

in certain other areas where it might be a combination of factors where in some areas people will choose to through that and and what are those areas where one could uh still say that uh the uh end

to- end experience can be delivered uh without necessarily uh uh you know uh compromising in terms of the global nature of the entire delivery uh while ensuring that the experiences in terms

of control or access meets the sovereignty requirement but doesn't necessarily need to compromise in terms of the way the physical architecturing has to be done. So, uh can you give us

some sense of the future? So uh first I just want to say that this is not just h this conversation is not just happening in in oh sorry my jet lag brain is having trouble in India but it

it's certainly happening all over the world in many countries um and it's very understandable as to why I I live in Canada and we you know this is a very um very kind of active discussion where I

live as well. Um, I did I think it's worth I think it's worth thinking about what it is that cloud brings and why people are still going to end up um really having to make difficult

decisions just because of the opportunities of working uh with the cl it's it cloud is not a data center. It's a lot more than a data center. Um and cloud is so first I just want to say we

live in an extremely globally interconnected world. So the the idea of kind of unweaving the the interconnectedness is very difficult and probably not that desirable. But when we

think about what cloud has done for artificial intelligence, cloud has really enabled this technology to be so accessible um to people who are not PhDs in AI and machine learning. And so cloud

has really been an enabler of the accessibility of this technology. And and like I said, cloud is not just a data center. There's we can break it down into sort of three basic levels of

the technology stack and it's important to think about the different layers because how we mitigate how we mitigate um some of the the risks that we might see is going to change in how we think

about the different layers of the stack. So for example at the the foundational layer of the stack or the training level of the stack um that is really only I mean th that is probably a little bit

easier to to build technically would be the you know if you just want to have a training data center um but there's very few people who can use it. You have to be really clever like some of the people

on this panel, but not all organizations have really sophisticated developers of technology. And so that's that while that layer is maybe easy to build, it's not the most accessible

layer to use. And so the middle layer of the stack is the stack where cloud providers have created all kinds of different tools and basically the Lego blocks to build AI applications. And so

and and they also make lots of models available. You can bring your own model. Um it gives you all of the security protections, all the responsible AI innovations. And so this is the layer

for your economy that is really important. So if you're thinking about how organizations um and how companies are going to sort of be able to use AI and deploy AI with

without having a PhD u AI like somebody who's really super expert at it but someone who's got really strong IT skills that middle layer is super important you for your economy and

that's the innovation the real innovation of AI that you're that people are able to access in the cloud that is going to be the game changer for our economies. And so that's the part that's

hard to replicate um in just building a data center. And so that's why you're going to see different types of strategies or mitigations when you're thinking about what what is

important for me to have control over what is important for me to be able to govern both from a legal aspect or a technical control aspect. And it can be different things. It could be maybe you

want to use open- source models instead of first-party models because those give you more portability. Um, and there's a bunch of different ways that organizations are going to think about

that. But there are going to be [clears throat and cough] significant tradeoffs that we have to make in order to access the best innovation or the most resilient uh infrastructure or the

most secure um capacity uh in order to kind of also manage those other concerns. But it is it is complicated. Um, but I I do think that there's still a ton of value that CSPs offer in in a

in an environment where organizations are are very concerned about about having that control that they want to have. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I think uh that beep is for us

maybe. But I'm not going to end with the without getting professor Kiran for a last word on this and then we'll conclude. So um uh I just want to you know come straight to the future again

uh and we know about the India AI mission the fact that what the Indian startups are trying to do. So help us understand what will success really look like in next four five years and uh and

uh try to explain it to us. I know the beep is going on but we'll probably take uh 2 3 minutes for you to make us understand that and also if if we don't reach where uh we wish to I'm I'm sure

we will but what is that one factor that we would probably need to make sure that uh that doesn't give us that uh place for any any losses so help us understand &gt;&gt; so um I think that's that's really a

very nice question um this is a question that we ask ourselves all the time I think um all organizations do ask what what what would success look like? You visualize it, you plan for it. So I

think u success and when I say success not just for uh solely bachelin but for all the initiatives uh which are part of this cohort would be to have uh for uh AI what uh UPI did for the country. So

we want to have the UPI movement for uh India. So that would be what I call the first level of success. And then to have uh the Nokia level of success where there is a group of a very small group

of people sitting somewhere in a very small country but you have they are making a product which everybody seems to use, right? And at at some point that was certainly the case, right? Everybody

seemed to have a Nokia phone with them, right? And they were u you know they had a certain resilience to them, right? Everybody I think can attest to the resilience of those.

&gt;&gt; That's true. That's true. I remember. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. Like you know people claim to throw them from you know 10 stories and then pick them up and like Yeah. works.

&gt;&gt; Yeah. Too bad. [laughter] Right. So that would be I think the second level of success. So these are like what I call uh broad successes. I think the third would be u contextual

and u hyper focal level of success and what I mean by that is uh success which reaches the last mile right so you can put uh things in context and when that last mile is reached then I think we

have gotten there. Now for the failure I think uh data is more siloed than we would like it to be and if at all we fall short in uh reaching any of these levels I think it is going to be the

silos be it at governance level or any other level that is going to be a showstopper and the second is talent right because this is not a labor problem you cannot throw people at it

right so as an academic uh one of the core duties and responsibilities for me is skilling Right? I see teaching as a very important part of what I do and so this cannot be done like any other

teaching. Right? Like you are looking for a very small set of people who need to be able to do this. Right? So this I think are some things to think about. &gt;&gt; All right. Great. So we are so

completely out of time. I am Ashish Shagarwal, head of public policy at NASCOM. as NASCOM it has been a pleasure to be hosting this event and thank you so much for uh uh bringing so much

insight and value to this. I think it's the combination of you and each of you highlighting and so thank you Ravi, thank you Ritu, thank you Rashali, thank you Nicole and thank you Shhat for uh

this very insightful panel and all the very best to you from all of us at NASCOM and thank you audience for your patience and I'm sure there'll be time for questions after we are done with

this. Thank you.
