## 📝 Summary

AI at scale requires infrastructure that converts promise into real impact. This session explores shared compute, efficient architectures, and hybrid cloud-to-edge strategies, comparing frontier model training with deployment of right-sized models for citizens, SMEs, and public systems. Anchored in People, Planet, and Progress, we examine access, affordability, sustainability, and optimization in India as core design constraints. The discussion addresses what should be built nationally, what collaboration can unlock, and where geopolitical frictions may arise globally.
