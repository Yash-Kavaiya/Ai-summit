## 📝 Transcript

Liberty and equality are the promises of our coming in that order, justice, justice comes first. Everything is that is the commitment of India. Our

civilization our constitutional framework all of them give us the fundamentals of constitutionality. It is going beyond looking beyond

at at the fundamentals of all the constitutional values living not by text but by the texture of what is now the capability of discerning the texture of anything

that is unique to the human beings that is unique to the brains 1660 And there the requirement always is that we keep our while utilizing

for whatever purpose. It's not a time here to discuss about the following on the shortcomings of indiscriminate foreign.

others. &gt;&gt; What is needed is for all of us to learn from those kind of examples that the machine [clears throat] is capable of the machine is tunable and the

algorithms are meant for storing everything. Whatever goes in retain is retained there. It's different than the human mind. human mind is able to

differentiate between right and wrong correct or incorrect relevant. So the fault line with any overenthusiastic ji person who simply relied on the

artificial intelligence output and presented such and soal citations to his senior. It was the embarrassment of the senior presenting that in the court finding that none of them exist at the

top. &gt;&gt; But then the machine is &gt;&gt; the problem with the machine is the difficulty in unlearning but we as human beings are capable of unlearning that is

where we do. So friends when we are going to discuss today I'll be handing it over to them as thank you very much.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you sir. So we started with a very positive note that we pro technology ready to adopt and adapt to the technology and ensure that it becomes a part of the system provided

there is no unintelligent use of artificial intelligence that's a very correct thing you mentioned sir moving on to area so although we are ready to adopt this technology area but there are

going to be many practical implementation issues and concerns especially structural uh concerns are with respect to transparency, accountability, you know, preventing

algorithmic biases. So my question to you is that what are those key challenges in implementing AI based tools within the judicial system and the follow question that how can algorithmic

bias arise in judicial AI application and what safeguards are necessary to detect them? coordinating. I'm very happy to see

uh but um just to straight off uh I think when I I do two very one JPM which is judicial decision m and the other one is which is decision making. Uh so bear with me when I'm running fast and busy

and down to JDM. Uh first and foremost in any sort of K process which is automated decision making. How does automated decision making work is that there is a component

of artificial intelligence. There's a component of machine learning. There's a component of natural language processing commonly known as large language models. So all of these combined over a stack of

artificial neural methods uh collaboratively enable the system where a machine is in a position basis three things to be uh delivering automated decisions without human intelligence.

What are these three things? First is intelligent perception. Uh very basic what we are currently using in our literacy context is intelligent perception. You have large volumes of

data natural language which is being processed and then the machine interacts the normal and outputs and input. The second thing is called an intelligent cognition where there's a local

uh where there's something called as a feedback loop where there's something called a self which means that even if your children data was limited to a certain bucket in intelligent

cognition the machine is in a position to learn and adapt basis what has already been provided in the last call as intelligent decision which is automated

Now across the globe various jurisdictions have been debated on whether ADM can qualify as J. It is very encouraging the arrangement and we saw that the Supreme Court recognition

initiative which helps in research and translation overcoming language barriers. Similarly, Estonia as another country has adoped number one for transport

and then it anonymizes trials to prevent uh to preserve a variety a bunch of very far China something called as project 206 uh project 206 does a bunch

of judicial support activities starting from case management through evidence collection where it identifies what relevant facts are irrelevant facts are what evidence is

correct what evidence may not be appropriate all of that is being done by uh going to us and this is a little unpopular [clears throat] perhaps people may have

heard about what was happening with compass was an AI enablement tool uh which predicted uh offenses and was significantly influenced by uh racial biases And this was questioned in two

court judgments. One one was in Wisconsin uh where the typical problem of I will come to this problem the blackbox problem was highlighted and the court held that the blackbox problem is

not a problem when it comes to JD but at the same time the census code on the same software gave a completely different judgment saying that this is not in alignment with law. So first the

three concepts intelligent perception, cognition and recessionality followed by the very wide area of adoption of ADM into GPM processes. Now April as you rightly mentioned what are the problems

you think bias uh bias and juristic standard is one of the most uh singular significant problems. Why is that? So bias is basically a translation of human bias. uh so if you see go back to 2017

when India did not have a right to it if we're going to use JDM to decide whether Indians deser I don't think we will all be discussing about anymore why so because all the past before 197 did not

similarly recognize information and fun they're always attached with certain factual context so if a stadium what would be uh sitting there deciding not our honorable justices. I think you

would have landed at the same sort of an outcome where there would not have been a uniform presenting judgment saying that there's a right to uh why because they would have been trained on data

sets that would have exhibited theistics of judges as a so that's number one uh judges suffer from a variety of biases when they adopt artificial diabetes for example commonly considered as hindsight

bias which is very in so uh in lowrisk matters whether a trial happening if you're using an AI it could suffer from hindsight bias as to how discrimination has worked so on and so forth you might

end up saying that that neighborhood is largely populated by a certain kind of color and therefore the rate of crime is significantly higher this is one of the illustrations of what we call as there's

also recency bias so a frequent times a number of times a particular incident has occurred then the AI starts believing it as a fact. It will not go down to verify whether it is a fact or

not. So these are significant biases that can impair how judicial decision do the second piece is um blackbox problem. What is blackbox problem? Even technical experts grab this. Blackbox is the

undefinability. [snorts] You can't really explain how machine learning is working. And this is because of the various layers of neural networks within which the data is getting transmitted.

So as a result of which there's a significant degree of capacity which translates into lack of transparency. So applying an AI tool for JDM might significantly suffer from blackbox as

happening in the case of compass uh where the practitioner actually stated that I need to know what is the algorithmic logic that has been used by this particular tool and the code was

unable to explain mandate of group photograph because uh that's how we were supposed to begin it. So for 2 minutes quickly if you can come forward I request all our distinguished

panelist group photograph to come forward and then we can discuss forunately [snorts] chambers. So that will just

&gt;&gt; Yes. So we can continue with the session. Now we have started with the question of constitutional modality, constitutional values and how do we align them with AI. We have also looked

at some of the challenges, implementation challenges. Now I would like to move on to sharpen sir. I have a very important question here that while we've been discussing about integrating

AI into the judicial system, uh there's another important question here which is that it's all about reducing the burden from the court and can AI help resolve the disputes outside this traditional

adjudication system uh remains to be a very very important point to be deliberated upon. So on this I would like to ask you how can AI enhance efficiency, predictability, cost

effectiveness when it comes to other dispute resolution mechanisms and what are your insights from a practitioner perspective? What challenges do law firms face with respect to dispute

resolution structures by incorporating AI? I think in terms of the speed of the decision making, the ability to collect data, test data, the issues in relation

to bias questions, the issues in relation to the question of matter. issue. They have been addressed as relation

tools. The question of whether the judgment is really delivered by the mechanical means or is there a human being at the end of the process and it is the human being which has rendered

the decision. If the decision is passed over to the machine, it would be bad law because no one has delegated that power to the machine. Even in selection of an arbitrator or selection of a

mediator. The decision is such that the party has delegated. The decision is that do you have to has the delegation of authority been made to

the person individually and has not been made to the machine. So this is a typical characteristic or differentiation between the process as as it is uh the the uh it in fact it

could be a ground for setting aside an arbitral award under the New York convention the disclosure the transparency particip generated and the nonlegational decision

making process are keys. As far as the process of resolution is concerned when you take the law for there are multiple purposes effectively get resolved. The aspect of segregation

of evidence, the aspect in relation to collection, the aspect of you know dealing with the evidence, the question of preparing a list of dates, the question of a due diligence which is

conducted on the data available are all matters which are procedural matters where the machines have resort. The question of speed. So there is a there is a clear approach to the time that is

taken but it does you have to be careful that you do not get into the problem of bias or hallucination. There is a machine related hallucination which typically happens when you spread

your data and you allow external inputs into the data because the machine scrapes the data from the access to which it is. So the question is that do you get wrong

parties do you get wrong judgments into the process of decision making. This is a common complaint in relation to processes where the machine has been let in the manner in which it is

decided. So there are several judgments even of our courts where this question has arisen. Parties who are not parties to the original proceedings found themselves into the array of parties.

The question of whether there are false judgments in the sense that the name was familiar but the contents of the decision were just not correct and they had sort of manipulated the judgment.

&gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; In fact, lawyers were found to be resorting to this particular technique and therefore the human supervision over EI has to be ensured. It's not a it's

not a hands-free kind of situation. In two cases in the Gamma versus Chennai Metro Rail Corporation, the Chennai High Court actually developed a procedure whereby engineers worked with the court

and they prepared four principles. The system must be confined to the record. So no access to external stuff. It must not invent, infer or give legal opinions. Only present only reexpress

retrieve experts. Outputs must be traceable and removable under against the record and all interactions with the procedural or substantive must be logged and must be

available for transparency. Uh the the uh question of transparency was also discussed in the sense that if you put in more data, the parties are accessing stuff which is not in the case

and external material is resorted to. you have to advise the other side and these are matters which are decided when you really set down the principles which will be applied in the uh case or in the

mediation before you actually prepare your material. So the agreement between parties and the expanse that you really are going to cover is a matter of agreement especially when you

so in the case of versus heart and soul entertainment limited the question of fake generated cases came up and the court came down very heavily in US for example there are sanctions against the

lawyer where he does not supervise adequately and the case is left to be you know openended and the result [clears throat] the resource question has to be looked at uh in the problem of

wires private limited versus national assessment center the government was accused of you know fixing the process in a manner where it results in a particular outcome come and that was

punished for the reason that the outcomes were prefixed and therefore there was no freedom [snorts] uh in in uh decision making and uh the uh the process effectively therefore

proceeds on that. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you so much sir for your insights and all of us in the room here would agree that we need to share our hesitation in

AI when it comes to adopting this technology but while saying so it's also important that there has to be a responsible adoption of AI right it means calibrated deployment and coming

to that we need to learn more about how to exactly implement and deploy AI so we need to learn about use cases and I think she would be the best person to inform us and give his inputs on the use

cases and judiciary while it comes to adopting AI in a responsible manner. &gt;&gt; Thank you ma'am. Why are we listening to the insights as

said this is not human versus machine and professor said it's not automated but augmented and you know we govern

a lot of challenges in our own work also and I will touch on one aspect of the judges are not confident that whatever do is it going USA China where the server is located. So we

found a very different solution that for all fusion cases say last 50 years you want to put it in a server there device called NAS network storage you put it in a chamber you have it connected to the

MacBook Pro or a Mac or just server and then you have a data diode which means that it will only let you access data letting go. So one of the great challenges that any judge would face is

what about my drugs? So there has to be a complete data erasure where when the judge removes the machine from its place the machine should have absolutely no trace of what

was done by the judge. All this is possible and it's a subtract solution. The only challenge that comes is as madam had said how do we build a good tool which can assist each other. So

it's not human versus machine but one thing that has come is that there are mechanism for god &gt;&gt; that is the problem with it never stop it will never tell you I don't know

answer so that is the thing that lawyers technologist experts has to come back and sit and say please stop here and say this is all I know last year I checked this is a reference and the legal

assistant to the judge or to the educator can always &gt;&gt; ask what is the reference have you cross check it and the cross checking also can

be done by the so in a sense if you look at anal it is a network where one one part other part is a self

wherein you get the last as &gt;&gt; somewhat correct &gt;&gt; so one thing more that aspect of hallucination which is so so looks so

accurate that even the credit experts will just sample that some case was concocted by some some other places now for that you can

have another AI system income mechanism itself which keeps that outcome here so all I can say ma'am is and s If the technologist and the legal experts come together and we get a

sovereign in the country are doing it can be a real assistance to the close to 650 district courts high courts and every of

not just the judges the NCA NC tribunals in those cases it is not so difficult also because most of the arguments or cases are you know very fact based unlike a civil or a corporate

case. So I what my suggestion is let's start with the educators the tribunals we have a learning and then that can very easily come to civil and corporate cases our criminal cases are not very

short because we have studied that but as far and corporate cases are concerned there's a real case of a simple machine being a very

was safe and no one else in fact also prove all connections no Wi-Fi no land and still the question or that's all I thank you [applause]

finding here to all the audience here I think you would agree with me we've got some very very important key takeaways from the three three important conversations which we have already had

uh moving on to Vikas uh you have been very active in judicial automation tools and also towards dispute resolution. Uh the question still is AIdriven automation. How would that improve

generation efficiency case automation? So can we have quick input from you as well? &gt;&gt; Thank you very much. Let me start with what we already let. Let me start. Let

me tell you what is it that we are piloting right now and that was likely to be in place for a couple months and what is the future going to look like? We already as some people might know we

are using transcription to transcribe supreme court proceedings and constitution. We're doing that not just in India but Dubai international financial court the court supreme court.

So wanted to give that background to say what we bringing in India is not just for the Indian court. Obviously the Indian ports is one of the biggest consumers that we want to address. The

need is much much there but I think it's also about taking that step forward to say what is it that we can build where we're not copying or adopting what other countries have done. We're only setting

the standards to do what is possible. For instance, in the ADGM courts, one of the things that they're doing is live translation of court hearings where in special economic zones where the

language of proceedings is English, but the parties are not English speaking, parties often struggle to follow what's being said at court. What we have offered as a solution to convert that

into Arabic in real time with a significantly greater accuracy than even a human translator doing it in simult. are looking at building systems that are tuned specifically for judges to use AI

responsibly. AI that does not tell them what the decision is but gives them everything else that they need to do to make that decision much faster. It's everything that lawyers have already

been using already talked about the list of things the factual chronology but we go beyond. We look at how we can analyze cases in a manner that will surface the positions of the parties. the points of

agreement between the parties, the points of disagreement between the parties, the key legal principles are where the key legal principles are there. We're working directly with the

judges to identify the key 50, 100, 200 cases per roster because obviously you might have 17 million cases in India, but all of us know as lawyers that you don't need all of them to decide every

case. There are some key principles in each roster. working with the judges to identify them and surface them literally as the summit with the way we see it. The judges look at cases and the day

before the hearing when the list comes out to understand. So you have about 30 seconds to a minute to read each case. 5 seconds between when the lawyer is

walking from the seat to the podium to argue 5 seconds to literally try and understand what the case is. And then we probably have about half an hour or an hour to decide the case of draft

judgment. So we building tools which have all the guardians that are here to address each of those three elements and tell the judge what they need at each of those points. At none of those points

are telling them what to decide. All we're doing is distillate the position of the market and our aim is as we go forward that distalized position is actually given back to the parties. So

when you're talking about transparency, when you're talking about more hallucinations, when you're not talking about AI's limitation, what better way is there than to put it back to the

lawyers to say, "Hey, listen, this is what the AI has said, I will of course apply my mind. But if you feel that there are gaps, if you feel that there are issues that this hasn't picked up or

characterized it wrongly, it's your chance to then give your input on it." So imagine a hearing that is happening after all of this synthesis. Instead of the lawyers starting with saying this is

the fact this is when X was born you start with the judge already know what the agreed positions of fact let me get straight to the distributed position and economize on the time required for add

to that the doing so you're not just synthesizing digital data that is your electronic file you're not just synthesizing the evidence that is already on record that with our system

which are fine tuned to the traditional models are lit only the most relevant ones in a more limited datic document. You know you get a petition and then say okay this is what the

position was 10 years ago when you argue but lally how the position evolved from that day over maybe 10 years but until the time the judgment was delivered what is the evolution where the

immediately distill out and generate a decision which is your decision which is a human decision but so I think a lot of these are not being done in the rest of the world looking at

you know automated decision You're jumping the D. You're going from saying I'm going to give you all the data. You generate let's keep the but ensure that you use

all of the benefits of technology to aid the decision maker. And that's literally what we're doing today with arbitrators with judges and with arbitral institutions all of whom are looking at

making some very critical decisions on very high volume data without the use of technology. Because today technology is against access for all the reasons they said sovereignity reasons blackbox there

are also elements about where is the data getting stored where is the data getting process so when you build systems with the judge with the arbitrator the institution at the very

heart of the you will automatically program it and when you have these embedded it also makes it easier for parties to accept so when we build tools for arbitrators and the arbiters tell

them I'm going to use Microsoft 365 they're like Okay, ask Microsoft 36065 to tell them what to decide because Microsoft 365 will give you an answer. But on the other hand, if they use the

tool that we created for them, which will tell you that I cannot give you that answer, it is beyond the scope of what is the permissible use of my platform.

It is really that we start off with saying look at the key decision maker because they're the ones who are in their system who are the ones who need to do the most how can we help augment

their capabilities and also think about this in the context of we are working with the brightest judges across the country out the case to be analyzed and we are

building a system with that knowledge and logic &gt;&gt; and that is used by the district court judges in the digital of India. So they now suddenly are applying frameworks

that have been designed by the best of experts in the country to do their work for them in the language of that I think is the true power and that's why we're looking at you know looking at concept

we need to look beyond that to say how can India contribute not just to taking what's happening elsewhere but I have to interrupt you sorry thank you so much that was quite insightful and you

actually made a saj's entire courtroom uh exercise which will be a AI enabled courtroom so thank you so much for that vision Now as we are moving towards concluding

the session I would like to again come back to Shahul sir. So what are insights on the deployment of AI? Should it be restricted to decision support or assisting the decision making or the

real decision making which is done with the help of AI and where should that line be drawn? So if we can have insight from you As I mentioned in my opening statement,

one of the question of bias and the question of where is this precise question as to whether the judge made decision has to be really automated or is that something which can

be restricted as human being. So we can go some other &gt;&gt; we can go in any several of the

meet theirs and not to a machine and Not just the procedural element but the judicial element which has been decided

not authority entrustment of the matter which was based on who is the judge and how how the processes are effectively evolved. So that's the solution which has been found and that's what is likely

to happen in relation to future matter. &gt;&gt; Excellent. Thank you so much. And now I would request uh justice Manishari G if you can give your concluding remarks. We'll start from the same question here

for concluding remarks also. How to integrate AI into the judicial system by ensuring constitutional values at the same time. Yeah, thank you so very much. We keep on learning as we as we learn

today also we have the capacity as human we have to develop about the AI or any machine also we have to inject with that to unlearn or at least block what should

not be learned by that or what should not be used by rightly indicated that if there is a propensity to generate fake not only fake in the sense of images but

citations there would be well that AI would be countered by another AI where blocking anything of fake creation so so the possibilities are abound possibilities

[snorts] are plenty we keep on proceeding but one of the common features which we feel about the acture decision making process Because all said and done at the

end of the day itself on the top of the court justice delivery system but it is ultimately delivering of the justice as judges as we know we have all about there is always a difference between

disposal of the matter and delivering of justice in a court and the effort of the court system believe in justice in so so far as background or tendency etc. They are of

concern and regularly here machines to the extent they help us sifting through data data etc. We are having we are indeed using them and we are going to use them but then

helping the machine to will articulate a conclusion or using a machine help us or rather leading us to there has to be a difference. There is a

difference that we always make. Uh the other day we have been discussing the idea about sentencing policy and criminal justice [snorts] we

all sent we know that system in the end of the day after conviction the judge would be looking at all those aggravating and factors. for designing an appropriate

and there that particular decision making will be a human decision making only because that has to take into account the variety of factors around friends

I have an interest to share with you that in our Indian philosophy aesthetics we have concept for governance these Understand those nine emotions or sentiments

starting from love then like the first one then laughter sorrow anger energy fear wondering peace. Now these are human sentiments

and they are integral part of decision making when we are dealing with human being and these are the factors where where a human brain will capable of competing is at work. So

we take the help from machine for shifting across the things putting things in order but then in the end of at the end of the day the final decision making definitely remains with the

adjudicators and there we ensure we we all as the law professional what is required for us to ensure is that since we all are dedicated to the constitution of morality

this black box system whatever we use it remains a glass box for all of us transparent all together. Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you so much. And as we

conclude with this session today there are three important reflections which stand out very very clearly. The first reflection is that technology is no longer at the periphery of judicial

system. It's already becoming a part of the main architecture of this entire judicial ecosystem and all kinds of initiatives that Supreme Court has already taken, they very well

demonstrate that we are on the way towards institutional reforms for adopting and adapting to this technology. The second important reflection here is that no matter what

every development, every technological advancement, every framework which we create should be constitutionally anchored and humanentric in its approach because it's we human beings who are at

the end of it. And the third very important reflection which emerges today is that the future lies not in replacing the means which is one not in replacing the judicial system but in strengthening

the entire system when it comes to equipping courts and judges the tools technologies that enhance research streamline case management and reduce tendency and of course expand access to

justice. So with this uh the road map ahead which is a very important uh key takeaway from from this important panel discussion. The road map ahead requires clear ethical guardrails. It requires

transparent implementation. It requires institutional oversight capacity building within the judiciary and finally and very important one continuous public trust. So with that we

conclude the session. Thank you very much everyone. On behalf of National University Delhi, I extend my sincere gratitude to all the panelists here. Justice Mah Shah

Raji to each one of you for taking our time to join us for this panel discussion. I also extend my sincere gratitude to my team to India AI impact team Dr. Son Gupta and her team for

giving us this important platform for this deliberation today and to of course all of you all of you all the participants for your thoughtful attention and engagement today. So uh

with this I would request my colleague Dr. Nakshima Chandra to present a token of gratitude to the panelist here. &gt;&gt; This is the momentto from mighty as well as national university.

Hello. Yes. Thank you very much everyone. Thank you. for speech.
