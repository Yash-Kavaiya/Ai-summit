## 📝 Transcript

[snorts] I can I can I can welcome you. All right. &gt;&gt; Uh good evening everyone. Good evening once again. Uh I'd like to welcome you

all to the panel AI for power uh accelerating the clean energy transition. We'd especially like to thank the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, the organizers

of the India AI impact summit for giving us this opportunity to discuss the impact of AI on grid transformation. I'd like to start by inviting Dr. Mesh Patanka to present the work that MEN

systems is doing in the space. right in the sequence. Okay. So, good evening everyone and uh thank you again uh Rishi Nalin uh and other co-organizers including BRPL uh

new friends from other organizations and the audience here. Uh what we'll do is I'll just quickly run through what we have been doing uh as a part of systems activities. So primarily uh we have been

sort of focusing on multiple things including power sector green of rural value chains electrification on mobility and some of the things that we're going to discuss today uh span across

transmission distribution generation and also uh resource adequacy demand flexibility opportunities I'll focus a little bit more on demand flexibility in the next two to three minutes before I

hand it over to uh Rishi um primarily um there are several uh opportunities in which the power sector and the end use consumption techniques can be merged together. So one of the key things uh

that we have been focusing was focusing on is uh uh AI in the building management systems. So conventional wisdom of uh building management systems is about optimizing air conditioning.

But one of the key things that we have been watching is basically all the changes that we see because of the climate uh uh uh uh climate change uh and the ambience uh changing the

humidity levels wind directions and everything changing because of which the renewable energy generation onsite as well as offsite uh and the requirement for the specific uh uh comfort cooling

uh changes uh drastically. So one of the key applications that we have been watching out for is basically how do we really predict the weather and how do we predict the on-site generation offset

generation uh occupancy levels etc and how do we really optimize for uh the AI application in that specific zone. So buildings is a uh already start developing some

application areas uh through uh the uh AI applications and ML applications as well. Uh [snorts] moving beyond uh we have been uh talking about uh uh uh the load management and in this particular

case uh the use case that we have been exploring is uh electric vehicle charging infrastructure. So it can happen at a large de uh Delhi transport corporation bus depot at the same time

individual two-wheeler charging opportunities and here it's a sort of very interesting mix uh which is at the micro level which is at a home level charging and if you can manage that

predictively and if you can manage that predictively based on the power pricing as well I think there is a good uh inference that one can draw and then also optimize uh so that two things can

be achieved. First and foremost is electrons are available at cheapest rate and the cleanest opportunity that we see from the electrons um wherever uh the charging can ramp up. So uh the charging

uh the thermal cooling system thermal energy storage systems as well as uh uh electric vehicle charging infrastructure is basically nothing else but battery energy storage systems. So can we use

the end use itself to also uh provide that provide for that opportunity and in the recent past there's an experiment that we facilitated and evaluated on uh going from vehicle to load and vehicle

to grid or vehicle to home. Vehicle to load is absolutely sort of important and here and now opportunity for the AI uh itself. The third uh thing that we have been uh talking about is demand

flexibility and this is very important from the perspective of the load shift that we see in the power markets. So typically in the past we would have seen the load shifts which peak in the

morning time and then you also have a peak in the evening time and uh because of the again weather changes climate changes etc. uh several discom territories have started experiencing uh

peak demands at midnight. Uh and that's again the cooling load that we are seeing and how do we really optimize for that uh peaking of the demand at midnight and how do we really transfer

that to the afternoon peak power generation from the renewable energy sources and here we're talking about solarization. So that's a very important aspect and what we have been able to do

is uh to get this variable infirm renewable energy to be absorbed in end uses. So there are several examples such as say pre-cooling or thermal energy storage systems or even water pumping a

simple water pumping for a municipal corporation if you can predict what is going to be the consumption of water during the coming summer coming winter. So it's not only about the dal

consumption and the changes thereof. It's also the seasonal storage opportunities that one would sort of see in that space. So that's another very important aspect and uh also would like

to mention you know there is a lot of regulatory support which also is required by AI and AI is also required for a benign regulatory framework to be developed. So just to give reference

here if you're looking at subdistribution level uh investments new transformers new cables to be drawn and so on typically the regulatory space uh starts looking at uh is this investment

adequate. Now if you were to really look at the uh uh uh viability of the discom investments or you can even uh nullify that investment and all of that can be done again through predictions and then

that's where we clearly see an opportunity for the AI to come into play. So I'll pause here or happy to sort of take any sort of questions and reflections later uh during the session.

Handing it back to Rishi. Thanks Rishi. So sorry. So in addition to uh what what Mahesh had presented, we also wanted to highlight a very specific model or platform that is is focused on AI for

power, right? Uh so I want so I wanted to introduce this program called Electron Vibe, right? Uh and I wanted to start by stating a couple of things, right? One is that India has set very uh

key targets right 500 gawatt of non- fossil fuel power power capacity 1 cr rooftop solar households by March 2027 and that EVs should should be 30% of overall sales by 2030 right so what is

the real link here it is the need for a modern resilient grid right one that can handle more rooftop solar, distributed energy resources, new loads of EV charging, and more dayto-day

variability while still delivering reliable service. That's why utilities need practical tools that improve the grid and and how it is planned and operated. So just to

give a bit of background, my name is Rishi from Climate Collective and uh Climate Collective was actually started uh by renewable energy developers, people who've built projects on the

ground and built climate collective to support the next wave of climate solutions to be adopted and eventually scaled. Right? Today we're the largest early early stage climate tech startup

platform in the global south having supported all uh close to 1500 startups uh 59 of them being women led startups through almost 100 accelerator programs that we've run right so more

specifically our understanding of the power sector made us realize a specific need to incorporate innovative solutions especially at the power distribution

level. So the Electron V program was developed to focus on utilities deploying innovative solutions from startups that could accelerate the pathway to a modern resilient

distribution grid. I think you'll notice this this statement repeatedly a modern distri uh uh resilient grid. So since uh 2020, Electron Vibe has worked with 22 utilities and 63 startups leading to 20

pilots offered when we now that we're building on that experience uh having worked with a lot of these organizations uh we want to continue uh to work on an AI for power innovation platform. The

reason is simple. Even when a tool looks promising, it's hard for utilities to move from interest to real use. because of data gaps, legacy systems, uh safety requirements and procurement uh

challenges, right? So this this platform will actually compose of three parts. One, the electron vibe program which is our open innovation platform to uh ensure that pilots keep on uh getting

deployed. Second, a knowledge hub so that utilities and other partners and key players in the space can share what has really worked and maybe what has also not worked to ensure that the

ecosystem continues to be developed. Three, the solutions platform, a place where we can utilities can find ready tools right now and over time find a safe way to share anonymized aggregated

data so that startups can build on solutions that fit utilities needs. Right? This is what leads us to this panel actually. What opportunities present itselves with regards to AI that

will help us on the pathway to a modern resilient grid. So with that I would like to invite the panelists up on stage uh Abhishek Ranjan who will be joining shortly uh Sedat Singh from IIA Sujit

Nay who will be joining shortly Namita Mukharji from the international solar alliance um and I I'll welcome Dr. Mahesh Patanker as well to join uh and I'll hand over the mic to uh Nalin

Aarwal founding partner of climate collective foundation. Okay, good. Hi everyone. Um, so unfortunately Mr. Gandon from IFC fell ill. He came here but he decided to not

attend because he has you know pretty hectic week coming up. Um, great. So without too much you and Sujit and Mr. Ranjan will join us. I think they are in a panel is running late but we have

already so much experience and knowledge here that I don't want to um spend too much time not leveraging that. Um what we are here is to of course disco discover some new things about what AI

can do in the power sector. AI is obviously kind of flavor of the day but in power sector it's already been very active. Um all of us here have been part of the digitization of the power sector

in very different ways. Um I'll I'll I'll I'll ask each of you to kind of just spend a minute to introduce yourselves and your and your work especially around the digitalization and

AI for the power sector before I move into specific questions. So Mah, I think you've already spoken about MPN systems. Sudat if I can request you. &gt;&gt; Okay. Uh thank you Nalin. Uh so it's a

pleasure to be here and uh this is my first time walking in uh today for uh you know the AI summit and uh I'm glad it went smoothly after uh the entry &gt;&gt; after you got in.

&gt;&gt; Uh so I'm of course I'm Sadhhat Singh. I work at the International Energy Agency. Um I lead the energy and AI uh work program at the agency along with the colleague and uh we have a big team.

team. We have team of around 50 people from uh drawn from across the agency who deal with you know all aspects of the system. This goes well beyond electricity but of course electricity as

you rightly said is integral and core to uh the work we do right. &gt;&gt; Uh so I work in uh broadly in the team of the chief energy economist of the IIA. So I'm an economist by training. So

my my lens usually is uh is is economics as opposed to core engineering. But of course &gt;&gt; uh you know uh AI being a a a technology uh it's important to understand the

various facets of it which include technology which include the technical aspects but also legislation [clears throat] regulation you know commercialization

and so on. &gt;&gt; Got it. Thank you Namita question. &gt;&gt; Hi thank you so much um Nalin and climate collective team for having me here. Um I'm Namita Mukharji. I am a

strategic planning specialist at the international solar alliance. Um I joined the alliance only last year in June and before that was working with the USA South Asia regional energy

partnership program where we partnered with the climate collective in the electron vibe program. So great work by the team there. uh at the international solar alliance um what we're doing on

the digitalization space at least I don't know if it is AI so much but I would like to comment that uh we have something called a multi-donor trust fund where we have donors like GA apps

eoa capital and others uh you know pooling in their funds uh the objective is very clear that the solar deployment story is incomplete without the grids being able to you know sort of offtake

uh the complex power which comes in the form of u solar and other variable renewable energy sources. So through the multi-donor trust fund we are trying to do um you know scalable pilots in Japur

distribution utility where we're looking at uh you know de developing a digital utility twin of the existing uh utility and then looking at how we bring in efficiency from a loss reduction

standpoint. So that's the current piece of work that we are doing with um you know international solar alliance in partnership with uh different funding partners. So thank you Namita and thank

you uh Namita mentioned our work together as well in the Maldives that was quite uh was quite a pioneering uh program. Thanks for support there. All right, we'll jump into the the the

discussion now. The way we're going to structure this is in three parts. One is to understand what AI is really doing for the grid today, right? Um and this is not what's happening in theory but

really what's happening in in real life. Second is how are pilots getting to become large scale deployments in India and across the global south. So we have international perspective here of course

and then how do we ensure that the grid becomes truly digitalized and AI powered. So that covers data compute trust and flexibility right. So so that maybe I'll start with you. So from

global evidence and and the kind of work that you do which AI applications in power are delivering the strongest system level benefits today and from that what do you see the key

opportunities for India? &gt;&gt; Uh sure thank you. So maybe I can start by taking a step back and uh just contextualizing and understanding why is it that we are talking about this in the

first place. uh what is it about the energy system about the electricity electricity system and about AI that make all of this work? &gt;&gt; Sure.

&gt;&gt; Right. Uh so we have been noticing um you know at the agency we collect data we collect all sorts of data and uh we we the the data goes back for uh several decades and we are seeing a very strong

trend of increasing complexity of the energy sector at large but specifically the electricity systems right so what why is it becoming more complex one is that um in general the the

electrification is rising so when I say electrification It means the end use of energy is more and more electricity compared to other fuels. &gt;&gt; In other words, that there are more

types of demand and more types of loads that previously never existed that are now increasingly a part of the load. So, one is that there's greater electrification. The second is that um

there is greater of course this is not news to anyone but there's greater variable renewable electricity going into the system. So, that was never the case in the past. In the past the

variability maybe came in the form of hydro power but that was also seasonal in nature. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Uh most of the other sources of

electricity were stable. That's no longer the case. Now in uh you know with with solar and wind uh the share of variable renewables has gone from as low as 2 or 3% you know just over a decade

ago. This is a global level right to uh and it's uh on track to hit 30% by the end of this decade. This is a massive jump of variable electricity in the system. There's of course in addition to

that there's you know increasing batteries to manage that uh that flex the variability uh and uh there are new types of markets you know back in the day everything was contracted for you

know years at end now it's like you know there are derivatives of things and you know it's it's a financialization of the sectors happened. So &gt;&gt; first trend is electrification. The

second is more recent which is that there is an affordability issue that is becoming more and more central to policy makers and regulators around the world. Um you know gone are the days when

electricity was you know heavily subsidized around the world. That still exists in many parts maybe even in India to some extent but uh that's less and less the case at a global level. So

affordability is an issue. um you know especially with all the conflict and all of that happening it is a the it's a priority for governments to ensure that electricity is cheap right

&gt;&gt; um and and of course the third major trend is that now we have long-term goals that never existed in the past that we have you know a 2070 or a 2050 or a 2013 net zero target you know be it

at a company level or a country level or you know and so on and um and that those long-term targets have short-term implications so these three trends I think you know are the driver to why

human intervention &gt;&gt; is not enough. You need &gt;&gt; uh you need something bigger than that. You need something that is more automated. And this is where it comes

in. Again I don't want to take too much time but one final point on because and I want to address the question that you actually asked &gt;&gt; uh which is that um because of because

the inherent nature of electricity and and electrified systems makes uh you know AI applications the the most appropriate kind of technology layer that can manage that

complexity &gt;&gt; and uh you know just naming one or two things that are especially critical for India. One is uh improved forecasting of variable electricity generation. And

when I say it's not just about you know okay the weather models are becoming more accurate fine but that's not enough for solar and wind you need minuteby minute hour by hour understanding of you

know cloud cover in the specific location where that panel is is uh you know situated which is different from just having more accuracy you know around the world. So that's just one

example. So that and then you know the managing the you know a system that has batteries and you know on solar generation. So those are the types of solutions that will be more relevant for

India uh moving forward. &gt;&gt; Very nice. I think you so it's a very nice framework. So complex loads variable generation and then the imperative of affordability. I think

this is really some of the driving factors and for everyone this is the right framing variable renewables versus you'll often hear intermittent renewables in fact variability is a far

better way of describing what we see on the grid. Um great thank you so that um um Namita if I can come to you um and this is of course your your broad experience this is this is you know it's

your broad experience at RTI now at ISA um what are the real world applications that you're seeing going from pilots and obviously the duet you can talk about duet as well going from pilots to

deployment and what has kind of pleasantly surprised you in that &gt;&gt; okay thanks uh thanks for that question Nalin um look I think um &gt;&gt; from what's working well let's start

from there and I think I echo what Sidhhat was saying the uh renewable energy phenomena now is more than a decade old right I mean we started with the solar uh mission initial phases then

we saw a lot of wind uh coming on board because of the uh you know policy reforms around accelerated depreciation generation based incentive and others &gt;&gt; so the ingress of renewable energy in

our grid is not a very recent story. It's been there for close to a decade &gt;&gt; and if we start looking at how the story has spanned over time right we are actually talking about a very large

capacity now in our grid more than 50% of uh you know renewable energy capacity including you know hydro if you take how did that all come together right there I would think one of the key things which

has been happening over the last you know five six years very well is the uh uptake of the forecasting in variable renewable energy sources and that's one of the key drivers for that is again

generation is a dlicensed activity right it's all private sector driven you know that for renewable energy you don't uh it's not a regulated business &gt;&gt; which means uh the more accurate I am in

my forecasting the more upside I have from a you know commercial gains perspective &gt;&gt; so if you look at the private sector uh so far in the wind and solar sector they

have picked up very strongly on the forecasting uh you know accurate forecasting of renewables and one key polic policy enabler over there has been our deviation settlement mechanism and

the 15-minute interval you know basis participation of renewables in the markets. So that has all come together to somewhere now link that story as to why greater accuracy of renewables is

even more critical because we'll be moving towards more tighter grids right 5 minutes a minute you know uh frequency linked uh [clears throat] grids &gt;&gt; so I think that is something which has

started off well for us in India and is only moving towards getting more strengthened [clears throat] but that also means that that has to connect to the larger story of us

building the India energy stack having more open source data available so that more innovation can come in in that forecasting. So that's the phase two of innovation if I look at from a

forecasting standpoint. &gt;&gt; The other good thing that I would think that's happening [clears throat] at least in the Indian grid is really the you know base layer of having data

together. So if you look at the whole RDSS scheme and the fact of having 250 million smart meter rollout program announced by the government of India right that's very ambitious to be honest

that is really the backbone of anything that is digital digitalized and AI ultimately right &gt;&gt; so for me I think that is again a very core layer that we are moving towards a

lot of the smart meter installations are really starting to give the you know data that we would like to see from households and business level &gt;&gt; so I think that is again a very good uh

move in the right direction. It is now about how do you connect those again to the larger piece about making that data talk to each other interact with each other connecting it to the distributed

uh you know energy renewable energy sources be rooftop EV and others so that I would think is the next you know phase around where we are already starting to make some moves but that's where the

real focus needs to &gt;&gt; very nice I I like that framework um mah uh I want to bring you in as well um whether in DR maybe DR is a nice one to focus on from

uh specific applications you've seen and even the ones you've seen scale &gt;&gt; right so uh a demand response uh is a very interesting articulation of uh the transition that we are seeing uh firstly

uh the entire grid uh has moved from generation following load to load following generation &gt;&gt; and that's where the entire variability and the opportunities to optimize the

grid itself comes into the picture and demand response is a a very interesting democ ization &gt;&gt; of decision making in the energy space if u uh a particular consumer base let's

assume say all the uh air conditioner users in the state of Delhi if they are ready to participate uh in some kind of a demand response initiative uh it's very important for us to acknowledge

that they are actually not only consumers but they're also proumers of one sort so I think demand response to me it's not only about giving a trigger uh whenever the grid

requires that trigger &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; uh to ramp down but more importantly the entire articulation uh Nolin in my opinion is now changing and needs to

change from demand response to demand flexibility &gt;&gt; wherein if you have more seasonal variation or I would say dial variations in generation coming up uh and

experience in the grid it's also important for not us to ramp down but also ramp up selectively and I think that goes back to the uh uh what what was mentioned by Sidat in sort of

increased electrification and that's where some of the end uses including for example foundry industry which conventionally use biomass &gt;&gt; uh he's now moving towards electric car

furnace and that's where again demand response comes into picture so uh so the status currently is demand response there are several programs I'm sure obvious when he comes here we'll talk

about specific examples from BRPL but I think the entire narrative is now changing towards the demand flexibility I'll just mention one very interesting uh solutioning that we came up with

which was uh which is being currently piloted by uh World Bank in the state of Uttarakand wherein there is a lot of water pumping load that exists in that state because it's a hilly state so

there is something close to 40% of the uh entire consumption of that state comes from water pumping it's a big surprise isn't it we would imagine there's abundance of water but all of

that ground water which gets pumped into the gel scheme which is the water for all and uh uh has some kind of a storage. &gt;&gt; So what is currently being leveraged is

basically demand flexibility wherein one can actually bring up the water from underground water tables to the overhead water tanks and that has that has inherent storage

capacity. So that's basically something which is being being planned and and we will actually be exploring the AI applications also there because at this state level you are looking at something

close to 1 billion uh sorry one uh uh one gawatt load which is available for ramping up and ramping down at least I would say 20% of that. So I'll just pause here that's probably the new way

to sort of think at a larger scale. &gt;&gt; Very nice. Um in fact this I would like to bring Sedat in because you've done some very interesting research um on data centers and perhaps how they can

actually be we hear a lot of like uh you know perhaps apprehension around what will happen with demand but in reality they can be very friendly uh loads for a grid operator because they can be firm

and flexible increasingly we seeing in fact we we spoke with Nvidia and Google at COP and they were mentioning how they become incred increasingly able to shift critical and non-critical loads. Right?

So just a few insights from the research that you did on data centers and how a little bit of flexibility can improve uh grid resilience and avoid added capacity as well.

&gt;&gt; Yeah, for sure. So uh first let's talk about the global picture of how much electricity is consumed by data centers and then we can talk about how they consume it.

&gt;&gt; Sure. Um so firstly at a global level uh our estimate was that for last year about 1.5% of electricity generation goes into data centers. &gt;&gt; This is expected to rise to about 3% by

2030. Right? &gt;&gt; So it's a it's a doubling taking place. &gt;&gt; But what's uh what's increasing rapidly is actually the AI portion of it. So data centers do all types of loads. They

do not only AI, they also do traditional loads like if you're you know watching a Netflix movie for example. Um currently that AI load is a very small fraction of it. I would say like probably less than

20% like well less than 20% of the total load of data centers today &gt;&gt; is uh uh is AI. &gt;&gt; This grows fivefold. So the portion that is actually AI is growing fivefold.

Everything else doubles but that grows fivefold. That that shows that where the growth is really coming from and AI has a different profile compared to uh nonI loads. So there's

greater flexibility potential especially when big tech companies are able to use data centers that are located in different places and shift loads according to the signals that are given.

&gt;&gt; But the big challenge there is that uh currently there is not enough regulatory I mean there's not enough information being passed down as to when and how that should happen.

&gt;&gt; Okay. So the there there needs to be you know a layer between data centers and the electric electrical system that actually enables that kind of uh you know trade or flexibility or shaving off

the demand. In fact some solutions have come in that space. There are a few companies a few startups including one that Nvidia works with since you mentioned them that is working on

exactly this problem. So they're able to shift as much as 20% of or shave 20% of the peak demand &gt;&gt; when needed without compromising on the actual uh competition uh capability of

the data center. And the other issue is that um you know there have been some questions on what impact will this have on electricity prices and so on. Uh there are different takes to it. One is

of course that data centers require infrastructure. uh they require electrical you know upgrades maybe in you know new capacity and so on and that can have an implication on costs but at

the same time as you rightly mentioned they also have uh higher utilization rates right &gt;&gt; so because they have higher utilization rates they can uh you know the the costs

on the system are more absorbed so they're high utilization rate then the rest of the grid you know put together in other words you're able to distribute the costs a little better so with

appropriate regulation &gt;&gt; you can ensure that data centers are more flexible Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; But then they're also playing a

conducive part in the grid and not actually imposing costs. &gt;&gt; No. Imposing costs. Got it. Very nice. Um Nita any any anything here especially given your view

of of the world basically as ISA right and and and especially data centers being uh uh something that can drive real economic demand in in in many emerging markets. So

&gt;&gt; yeah know I totally echo what Sadhhat was talking about. they are actually data centers will become the critical uh demand flexible load for us supporting the grid as we move forward right and

that's exactly &gt;&gt; when you start looking at the larger picture of um consumer centric grids right where every every industry every consumer is able to contribute you know

at the right time I think data centers will play a very very critical role in the times to come so I'll just sort of &gt;&gt; yeah yeah and of course you may know ISA works in in how many countries

&gt;&gt; 26 126 countries, right? So many of them emerging markets, many of them &gt;&gt; are seeing data centers as as as something that's positive for the

economies, not just the load on the grid, right? &gt;&gt; Correct. Correct. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Please, I can actually come in on this. This triggered a thought,

you know, as you were speaking uh you know data center uh companies and big tech companies especially have been pursuing renewable electricity for data centers,

&gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But there are some very interesting angles to this, right? So you know one question that people largely have is why can't we power data centers entirely by

renewables right &gt;&gt; uh now you'll be surprised to know or maybe you won't be surprised to know but some of the biggest data center operators in the world so the top 10

biggest for example already claim that on paper 100% of the electricity in any given year is being met by renewables in other words they have as companies purchased you know paper they've made

paper contracts acts with generators of solar and wind and so on which is taking place in a third location. So it could be somewhere very far away. &gt;&gt; Now the big challenge is this may happen

at a yearly uh you know level but it's not happening on an actual basis because that electricity may be generated at a different time of the day but the consumption load is different it is

flattened through the year. So how do you match that right? &gt;&gt; So for this matching this hourly matching is the new trend that we are beginning to see. So some companies have

taken a lead on it. It's not a global practice just yet. But what they're trying to do is ensuring that on an RTOR basis 100% of the electricity is met by renewables. And many tech companies have

that target for 2030 and 35 and so on. I see. &gt;&gt; So they have met already the 100% yearly target. &gt;&gt; But they're now moving towards a 100%

hourly target. And that is when uh you know but having said that currently most data centers are grid connected. So they do consume whatever the grid provides which includes generation from other

sources. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Got it. Okay. Very interesting. Um so we may move to the second section. I was hoping uh two other panelists would be here but

clearly it's running over. Um NA I'm going to start with you and specifically on the policy side. So to get from pilots to large scale deployments right or platforms what policy tools did do

you see or have you seen matter most across across various countries you can choose India uh that would be fine so are we talking about regulatory sandboxes concessional finance pool

procurement public data platforms or any others &gt;&gt; yeah thanks thanks for that uh Nalin um you know it's interesting because what we're talking about is a transformation

which is happening so fast right now I mean I've been here in the sector for 22 years now but these last you know couple of years have just sort of changed the whole dynamics of the pace at which

things are changing right &gt;&gt; right right &gt;&gt; which means that if you look at our discussion here today about digitalization about AI when we come

back next year it would have taken a different form and shape altogether which means that it has an even more um sort of criticality to bring the regulations policies regulatory policy

makers you know up to speed with all the changes which are happening because Yeah, of course. &gt;&gt; Because to be very honest, distribution and the consumer side is regulated. That

part of the business is regulated, which means the regulator plays a very critical role in defining certain standards, rules and that's that's fair also, right?

&gt;&gt; A lot of the policym also that we do is actually governs what is going to happen ultimately at the consumer level, right? So, uh what I see is that there are five or six layers to this and they are not

sequential. They have to go in parallel, right? If you're looking at scaling up the digitization story, &gt;&gt; one is definitely looking at the data and AI governance for renewable energy

&gt;&gt; which is essentially meaning that we have to now increasingly start making uh rules for the sector &gt;&gt; which allows our distributed renewable energy sources, distribution system

operators. We don't have something called DSOs but we have more like the transmission system operators and the distribution utilities &gt;&gt; so that these entities can start talking

to each other in in the form of data but with the right uh privacy security standards that we build and also the need for us to move more towards open AI tools which will literally then

&gt;&gt; add to the story of the India energy stack that we're trying to build in the form of the digital public infrastructure right so that is one key thing that which is the governance

framework and rules which has to get created. The second thing is um a renewable energy forecasting you know compliance framework because like I told you a lot of the generation is private

sector driven so it makes sense for them to do forecasting right as a business case &gt;&gt; but I think it's a it's a need for regulators to start specifying this that

you know if you don't have this forecasting then you know your tariffs get will get impacted and so on and so forth so &gt;&gt; for me it's very important that there is

now a explicit mandate for a regulatory requirement of forecasting ing for variable renewable energy. &gt;&gt; And just to understand, are you talking the signals that a regulator can send

would be like the UI charges, right? &gt;&gt; Yes. The the DSM charges which we now call the deviation settlement mechanism, right? Also the second thing around this is updating the grid codes because we

have grid we have built grid codes over years and with the way in which the grid is changing there's a need for really constantly updating the grid codes which is then talking with these kind of

disruptions which are taking place. So I think that's another key uh aspect which we have to be mindful about. Uh the third thing um on the regulatory side I would think is a very important aspect

about digitalization of utilities and grids which means that um how do you incentivize digital twins advanced analytics you know as sujit please come

&gt;&gt; come. How do you basically um bring advanced analytics that utilities are doing as a part of the regulated grid enhancing investments? Because one has to

understand when a utility goes to a regulator for its annual revenue requirement and tariff approvals if the regulator is not approving a digital twin related application or advanced

analytics then where will a utility look at these advanced mechanisms. So I think from a regulatory standpoint that's another key key aspect &gt;&gt; right [snorts]

&gt;&gt; then we have consumer centric distributed renewable energy sources which will now increasingly start coming on the grid. So how do you develop flexible market mechanisms so that these

you know start talking uh to each other which would mean that uh you know what we talked about we spoke about the demand uh the data centers right how do these contribute now to your peak

shaving congestion relief you know and voltage support mechanism. So moving towards those kind of advanced market mechanisms in parallel to these regulatory reforms.

&gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And then two other things which are very very important is firstly planning because you know if you have to incentivize utilities to plan for

digital and AI options when they are doing their resource and network planning requirements to the regulator, right? And somewhere the regulator needs to nudge and tell them that where are

those plans, right? So that and then we could also look at something called a performance-based uh incentive for utilities who are um adopting digital solutions which are leading to

improvements say in a rec curtailment reduction. &gt;&gt; Yeah. or um forecasting accuracy or outage reduction right so something along those lines

&gt;&gt; it's thinking out of the box I don't know if that's possible but this is a way of incentivizing &gt;&gt; and finally I would say um regulatory sandboxes play a great role in promoting

innovation by the regulator you'll see DERC has announced the um regulations which are now talking about P2P trading for uh you know electricity using blockchain up has already done that the

UPRC So things like this I think uh are very important just so that you test and see whether what you're applying is possible to scale at a much larger. &gt;&gt; So I'll just stop there. Oh sorry and

then one small last thing is &gt;&gt; um I think the capacity building of regulators is extremely important because while we have a CRC in the center but we all know at the state

level &gt;&gt; I mean if you go and talk to regulators about digital and AI there there's a long shot so it has to be capacity building which is a constant you know.

&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No great I think you brought up so many points but yeah I mean the planning and the performance-based incentives they they they seem to have we've seen them

working in other sectors for sure. &gt;&gt; Great. I'd like to welcome Sujit as well. Um thanks Sujit. Um what what we request is just 30 seconds so that people know specifically what it is

you're doing in relation to digitalization of the grid and of course that includes a lot of what you're doing at I &gt;&gt; yeah no thank you so much. Firstly, I

must apologize. Um, looks like I'm not the last one to walk in. I see Abishek joining me, so I'll probably, you know, probably get him thrown under the bus in some sense, but so sorry.

&gt;&gt; But yeah, no, no, really honored to be here and I was just listening to some of the conversations. Um, so my work seems to ask questions in those areas, but I ask questions more as a as a

technologist. I see myself more as a infrastructure plumber, a dist plumber of sorts where the work we have done in DPI and most of my work with DPI with Becken as such particularly. Um so I

think the work I do is essentially ask what does it take when things change pretty dramatically &gt;&gt; and and AI energy are very interesting because on one side AI is taking off. Um

definitely the models are getting better and of course there is there is a re realistic cost decline that's happening in usage of that that's one part of it of course and I was saying that in the

other panel it's still a lot of supply side hysteria we need to see demand side value of it and also demand side pricing of risk of AI that's that's one of the challenges

&gt;&gt; but energy is peculiar because about two years ago somebody reached out and said &gt;&gt; aren't you not thinking about energy I said no probably as a trained electronics engineer I know a little bit

but I can understand kit's law But not more than that. But the larger point about the massive decentralization that's happening &gt;&gt; and the fact that increasingly more and

more useful energy assets will be outside of the control of the grid &gt;&gt; geometrically scaling up and we people are going to be part of the grid because we are the ones with solar rooftop

generating energy. So we are the grid in some sense as as a society at large. &gt;&gt; Probably it calls for an opportunity to have a little bit of a systems level thinking without of course upsetting the

grid systems. We are not literally trying to do an open art surgery of how the grid works but see how do we manage and in and bring them together. So how do we make create open rails that makes

this coordination happen and little learnings from what we have done with all the DPI work in the past &gt;&gt; seems to be finding relevance here and that's that's the space I'm operating in

right now. &gt;&gt; Very nice. I mean this is all pathbreaking work uh not just in India but globally. I think DPI has brought us a model that is very unique. Uh is the

only alternative to big tech I think. uh anywhere. Um so thanks Sujit for being here. Mr. Ranjan I mean I for many of you he may not need an introduction. He's probably the leading uh energy

innovation uh uh person in India especially in grids. I I definitely consider him. Uh Mr. If I can just request you to take 30 seconds just to talk about your view of grid uh

digitization and digitalization and I'll come to a specific question um especially because we have just 10 minutes actually. So where have you seen in Delhi's grid or even otherwise but

since Delhi is very close to you where AI has created most operational value &gt;&gt; of course uh apologies for 30 minutes delay but then uh we're talking about exactly the same thing in the last

session &gt;&gt; uh grids have evolved what uh Sujit is saying democratization has happened even if we are not aware it is already happening

&gt;&gt; a grid is no longer a monolith or a unidirectional thing. It's already a birectional multi-direction thing already happening. So without our knowledge certainly the

changes in the last mile maybe the production systems maybe the distribution transformer infrastructure those things are taking shape technology is seeping in unknowingly knowingly it

is seeping in it's not like on one fine day we going to move there which already we are already moving there &gt;&gt; sure &gt;&gt; what I always say is we are already in

some kind of DSO we are moving towards that a deer interconnection giver and a deer kind of oper operator right now it is a must run &gt;&gt; right but then as as soon as smart grids

uh sorry smart inverters and the digital twin that we're talking about comes in we also have now to you know run that symphony orchestrate that symphony that's what it is going to be when you

manage all the deers together &gt;&gt; now one specific point where it has make a lot of difference is 9 years ago in 2017 we started with AI powered machine learning not machine learning powered

models for demand forecasting that was spot day ahead and uh that is an intraday that is two hour ahead and then it scaled up to forecasting the spot market prices which is realtime prices

and dayhead market prices and uh it it makes up to 70 to 80% of the cost of a utility in India for example so it it made a lot of improvement the last 9 years we have been able to save and

quantify a lot of Power purchase cost optimize is nice especially if you can see uh about 20 25% is short-term and about 10 to 15% is about on the spot market share in our annual energy uh

purchase that we do that is uh hands down. Second now we are uh deriving a lot of mileage is from because the scenario has changed the people are saying even a flicker is an issue. The

government is saying give me a vix daily plan in the next 3 years. So sidi and ci so close to Singapore if maybe few minutes it can't be done without investing a lot in technology and that

to last mile technology. &gt;&gt; Right. Right. Right. &gt;&gt; So we started with pilots again in 2018 2019 pre-COVID that was on uh uh AI based platform for predictive and

prescriptive asset health monitoring and maintenance. Now it [clears throat] is inbuilt. So we are putting in all those 23 KV 11 KV feeders on the block &gt;&gt; uh baselining and then using drones or

satellite imagery to capture and uh then trigger based entity of meantime to failure and the complete workflow is getting operationalized. So that is again yielding numbers on the Excel

sheet. These are the two uh important things which we are already seeing the value. There are multiple other things which is in the customer space yet to be quantified. Like for example before you

apply for a new connection you can actually check it online like Eon does Eon does allow you we want to have a customized version of the same here till until now it was there in our internal

so we hadn't made it public so now with the smart meters on on the DTS &gt;&gt; we have real live view so you can get to know in few minutes as to whether your techn this uh connection of this much

quantum at this location is possible or not so this is going to be revolution because people say that you are a monopoly and therefore we are suffering. Okay. So this is going to be other way

around saying that yeah you decide your own place where you want to in the current shape. &gt;&gt; Very nice. I mean that is for anyone who lives in Delhi that will be a big uh

help I guess right. Um okay I'm going to come back to you. Um we're all curious about u of course u you did mention what it's about in a very uh you know uh yeah in a very fundamentally broken down way

which is great right um I want to understand from you is what would success in in India's tax style look like for the power sector if you were to include AI take a fiveyear view you know

&gt;&gt; yeah I think um one of the things we were debating ones and AI is by the way still a work in progress. We're discovering a lot more serendipitiously and that's a good thing about how you

design things at population scale because you're not curating sometimes this emerges &gt;&gt; uh from diverse set of use cases we looking at but if I were to take a

five-year view and ask this question of course grid resilience and flexibility being at the core and center reliability being at the core of the center is there an opportunity for us to to solve for

energy agency you know bring put people at the center of their energy lives people and businesses and give them that agency and how do you solve for that? Most of the time I think the the the

idea that energy is something that is an obligatory burden for a discom to offer &gt;&gt; and fulfill puts a lot of pressure on the discom. &gt;&gt; Now the the equation has flipped with

people having more and more energy. So is it possible for them to be a participant? &gt;&gt; Not just a beneficiary. and and and is there therefore a way of coordination

that makes them participant and derive benefits but overall makes it a more self-organizing self-reliant system and if that is that could be one of the visions of the energy stack and I'm not

a sole you know speaker opinion maker on that part there are others but I think that could be one way to look at it and what it means is that net the marginal coordination cost on getting energy

accessible affordable to billion people should come down to zero If if India is in the solar belt, if we have the ad kind of assets, &gt;&gt; maybe that's one of the visions to talk

about and through that and and as as we speak probably there is a prime minister looking at one of the early implementations of Indian stack the peer-to-peer interstate trading uh

thanks to the work Abishek and all have been done in the just in literally in one month's time &gt;&gt; is to talk about how does it creates new livelihoods you know telecom revolution

created STD booths as a way of livelihoods and banking they had business correspondents I wouldn't be surprised if you then homemade ers are actually having another you know

livelihood. I mean maybe there's a point maybe somebody in the village will start thinking should I buy a cow for livelihood or probably get non-selfus energy solar rooftop and battery to

generate some income and making that possibility and and and making that possibility and making people part of that story would be one of the big things about IS and I is not by itself a

solution. It's very very important we understand this. It's just the coordination layer. the solutions will have to be designed brought up but we think that if more and more such

solutions have to come it is absolutely necessary to have that coordination fabric otherwise we will have as I was saying in the other panel &gt;&gt; uh we in digital the tendency is that we

literally build a road for every car that's how digital has been we didn't do that with energy we did not build one grid for toasters another grid for washing machine we build one grid for

all but dig we tend to make that mistake and that is why the cost becomes coordination cost becomes so high with this digital coordination fabric which essentially nothing but a bunch of

standards and specifications we should be able to achieve that sorry it was not supposed to be supposed to be a short answer but &gt;&gt; no no it's probably what

&gt;&gt; I think your analogy of the grid as potentially a complex adaptive system is is very nice for the future and uh yeah I mean there's so much potential of it being a an economic driver for

individuals so that's great um I know I I think we have a hard stop I hope we don't because we have so much to go through but u I'm going to come back to Namita once I I'll move to the last

section is is um just talk about given ISA's role and your own experience south learning how can this be leveraged to to to leaprog traditional grid planning and dispatch

uh models right and in the context of AI please &gt;&gt; okay thanks um Nalin I'll keep it brief look I think for ISA south south is a little overrated but I think most

important is the fact that we we have uh members across the sunb belt uh across the globe and with the type of disruption you know it was interesting to listen to the joint secretary MNR

saying that in the last 18 months 15 gawatt of decentralized solar you know has got added to the grid &gt;&gt; which you can imagine in terms of the you know impact on the grid that you'll

have if you don't have the backbone layer of flexibility that we're talking about right at a distribution level so &gt;&gt; I think um the way the story of the global south is building is very

different from the way in which the north has developed its stories. Right? All our stories across the African subcontinent, Latin America or other regions have a very similar historical

legacy grid that you've built. Right? So I think from that perspective it's very crucial that these learnings are more south south to say so and it's customized more because so that

&gt;&gt; um we don't leave the rest of the global south on their old journey but bring them up where you know countries like India are moving &gt;&gt; just a little bit of an issue I have

with the leaprogging again uh terminology because look I think grids are very different across countries uh you can't think &gt;&gt; uh you know African subsaharan countries

move towards where we have moved India there has to be a basic you know building block of data digital layer that get built before we move towards that journey so I would say keeping that

in mind but there's lot to offer from a south corporation &gt;&gt; perfect um so that in your view globally u what are the biggest bottlenecks um for

&gt;&gt; powering an AI powered grid is it data access compute cyber security skills or regulatory in &gt;&gt; so of course all of the above but uh I'll let the data speak for itself. So

we did a survey and we you know with energy companies and so on. &gt;&gt; Uh the the one that kind of popped up more than any other was skills &gt;&gt; skills.

&gt;&gt; So just I mean the the the talent usually gravitates to the tech sector. There's no surprises there. Uh we did another you know bit of desk research to find that

&gt;&gt; for the similar role you get paid 2x of what you would in uh the energy sector. So the the going rate uh the going wage in the energy sector is half of what it would be in in tech for the same role.

Yeah. &gt;&gt; So that gives you an illustration of of how difficult it is to attract the right talent. I know the I see the clock ticking otherwise I would have

&gt;&gt; I think the best minds of our generation have gone to sell ads. Huh. Unfortunately &gt;&gt; um u sit if I can bring you in. Um governance principles essential for

utilities to trust uh shared digital platforms. Just a few words on that. Yeah, it goes back to the point that we may be probably the the biggest most powerful AI agent take outage management

for all you can. Um but but if it's not working with the ecosystem and it's working in silos just going to take off. &gt;&gt; I mean if you want to so I keep saying this it's very very important that one

of the lessons we have learned from India's transformation story has been &gt;&gt; to rethink how we think about scale. I mean one is to think about scaling what works. Yeah.

&gt;&gt; Because that's what all engineers love doing including myself. Uh but it's a completely another thing to think about what works at scale. The point example about the context are very different not

I mean there are 84 discoms at different stages of evolution different styles of doing what they're doing uh different motivations at some point uh different demographics they deal with. For example

what we seeing in Delhi versus what we're seeing in a rural district of Jaipur could be very different. So it is therefore you important to think about how we make them all agree on a common

set of building blocks as a principle and if you give them probably that's all that it takes just give these building blocks &gt;&gt; for them to contextualize it to create

what is the solution for in there &gt;&gt; but having those common building blocks across all &gt;&gt; is the part that is is the is is what is necessary and that's where these

principles u will will become important the fundamental principles of interoperability India stack is just doing that. India stack is saying there are these building blocks. It's

fascinating to see out of 55 use cases that we went through mostly on the discom. The number of building blocks to solve for all of them are probably not more

than five. &gt;&gt; Wow. Nice. &gt;&gt; And but each of them works at population scale. &gt;&gt; Wow. So it also reduces the whole burden

on discoms to saying oh one I have this electrification burden of the new load then we have this whole renewables on top of that you're going to make me write another 15 RFPs on distriations I

just finished getting my billing system done &gt;&gt; but that's not the idea that's not how we should think about it so that's where some of these very very clear design

principles make a big difference and that's what India energy stack intends to do &gt;&gt; very nice I mean I know some of the work you're talking about is encapsulated in

societal platforms I guess so it's It's a good one for everyone to read about later. Um &gt;&gt; yeah, I think societal platform is a body of knowledge that has come out of

all the work of design thinking we have done in India. I think India has probably its own design thinking which we have managed to come together and call it as societal platform.

&gt;&gt; I think it's it's more societal thinking because platform is so ancient now. You're more talking protocols but societal thinking and societal platform is a body of knowledge which sort of

embodies these principles and says probably this is how you should think about scale. Yeah, I would recommend everybody to you know give it a look. Yeah,

&gt;&gt; very nice. Thank you Mr. Ranjan. I guess if if we are on a if we are on a time I'll give you the last word. Um so how should utilities governments think about AI data centers and you we we did have a

comment from Sedat positive comment um as risks or system balancing assets. &gt;&gt; So uh it depends where you are. So in India we are just starting for example even in US for example we are just

starting. So if properly planned it is an asset and this is going to be a amplifier in terms of how do you balance the grid. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.

&gt;&gt; And uh if not then then you're creating another burden on the grid. &gt;&gt; So I'll be just as brief as possible. So recently uh there was an Hitachi event where we discussed the same topic.

&gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Uh where we said that if you're sighting and sizing of the data centers is very very important. &gt;&gt; And so that you're not burdening the

existing infrastructure. Yes. Yes. &gt;&gt; While also ensuring that it is green. So the data centers can also flex. &gt;&gt; It's birectional both ways. &gt;&gt; Correct.

&gt;&gt; Even the base load demand will be somewhat fixed. But then they can peaks and spikes when you fire those lot of text heavy or voice heavy or some you know visual queries chat GPD kind of

when the it spikes like this. No. So those things can be taken care of by on-site and dedicated nuclear stations or battery storage or a mix of both. So yes, it is an asset. You can you can

plan if you plan it properly, it is an asset. &gt;&gt; It's an asset. &gt;&gt; Well, thank you. I there's many more questions and this is an extremely

interesting conversation, but unfortunately &gt;&gt; by the powers that be, I think we have to stop now. Thank you all for being here and it's been lovely for me. I hope

it's been lovely for you as well. [applause] Is that good?
