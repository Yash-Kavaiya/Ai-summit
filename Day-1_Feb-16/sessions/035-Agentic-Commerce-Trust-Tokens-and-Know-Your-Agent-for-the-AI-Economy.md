## 📝 Transcript

agent to execute your findings. So what you are doing when you look at 10 different things in your mind you have an idea of what you like and what you like is not so easy to transfer to data

directly. The point I want to make it there is something called tacet knowledge. Tacet knowledge is knowledge that is not necessarily captured in the data. Okay. It is this tacet knowledge

that we will eventually need to transfer to our models. And during these conversations now, we will repeatedly come back to the data as the make orb break charact. We don't know what you

like unless you write it out or you somehow have it and this is going to be an issue in the long term. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; And I will say we actually know a little

bit of what you like through the loyalty programs, right? And through your transaction records, we kind of know where you are at and so that's a starting point, but agents can

understand your preferences, your constraints and build from there. So let me just summarize this particular point. It seems to me I suppose most of you are in this that for us for those

portions where we as humans spend a lot of time and I don't think agents doing the final grunt work is a really big ad value for me the time when I'm take spending for decision evaluating this

versus this versus this it's not just requires data until those things get captured in data agentic commerces will have limitations in what it can do Okay. She's saying that we know a little bit.

He's saying that some other models will emerge. But therefore, while this is a good thing, I think um we will still I I think there are ways to go if I may say so because till this portion gets uh

&gt;&gt; we shouldn't leave it at that though. I think you're making a point. I think we should we shouldn't leave it that that agent commerce can't won't be able to do XY Z. I think we know a lot about you.

&gt;&gt; Not right now. &gt;&gt; In fact, no. Even right now we know a lot about a lot of people. By we I mean there is so much data. Every time you touch your phone you are generating

data. Every time you browse and not click you are generating data. And today that data can make or break. So my point is we're not you know the way you're ending this this part is that you know

we know little. It's going to take a long and to your point Janet we know a lot. We need to know more but we know a lot. Okay, &gt;&gt; I can give an actual example of how I

personally used agentic technology. This is funny because uh you know I'm a computer science grad, spent decades in this field and I was very nervous starting out with agents. But here comes

December 29th and by December 30th I have to fund my 401k otherwise I lack retirement for the year because IRS taxes you have to fund your retirement. So I realize on 29th of December I

haven't funded my own 401k which is my retirement plan and I'm panicked. I call my custodian which is Fidelity and Fidelity says me tells me I have to use an agent and I'm nervous as hell. I've

never used an agent especially to transact money move money from my bank to my IRS. But here's where it the tipping point came. One, the agent was trusted. The custodian, it was a

custodian telling me to to use the agent. Two, the agent asked me three times, requested my consent three times for the exact amount of money to the dollar digits, right? To the points,

right, to the cents. What money needs to be moved from what account to what account. It saved me a trip, 1 hour to the bank, standing in line, no appointment. Last day, I was terribly in

danger risk of missing my 401k contributions. Agentic was able to do it fine and the agent did not go any further with that. The agent was deinstantiated after that transaction

was a very trustworthy transaction and I would love the convenience of such agents to help out in the future in a trusted environment and this is just one application. It could extend.

&gt;&gt; Okay, good, good point. Um, okay. Uh, let me uh just one question which uh maybe Per can answer or someone else can. What kind of traction are you seeing from merchants and users as of

now about this? &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; For the uh uh &gt;&gt; you first uh Pur because it's addressed to him and then then somebody else can

&gt;&gt; I think for um so merchants uh are directly asking us that we need agents. So in in Janet's example of Fidelity like Fidelity wants to build this agent, right? And so uh uh this is probably the

first time in technology that that at least I have seen over a decade here that look the the merchant is saying I want this generally you build technology and then you try to sell it. It's the

other way around, right? Like I mean if if if if you were to do a TLDDR of your first round, one can argue that look agentic commerce is brittle. It's narrow. Like it's not fully scalable

yet. The data is not there. The models are too generalized, right? Like the protocols are not. You can you can you can list down million use cases as to why aentic commerce is not ready. they

he would drive &gt;&gt; but but here merchant comes and says that look I think I can at least drive productivity &gt;&gt; or you know what I'm willing to put a

merchant agent on my website and and I want consumer to interact you know you know why in my our hypothesis is that why they want to do this is because this is probably the first time when you when

you when you interact with an agent you are creating something called as unstructured data and that has never been created before like because all The data that has been created so far in in

technology was click data was like structured data right like here is what you're doing right like natural language processing was limited but and and with chat GPT came out like yes open AI has a

lot of data or unstructured data right so now fidelity wants to know this agent right like a coffee seller needs to know okay do people actually like cappuccino do do do do do do do do do do do do do

do do do do do things things which of the kava actually sell which of the necklace does actually have a demand because I might get it wrong on the first shot but then on the second shot I

might fix my supply chain and that is unprecedented and so what at PayPal what we are trying to do is we're trying to say okay good awesome merchants want it we are going to support it and to

Jennet's point what are the three tenets for agentic commerce to work right like uh uh the first is trust literally trust if there is no trust this game is over right like so you need some some sort of

a adhar equivalent for agentic commerce right like that's first right second is the money flow like how does money flow between two agents like so you need an UPI equivalent of agent commerce right

like uh the third thing what you need is is some sort of a DC equivalent right like you you need some interoperable platform of how this will work right and and so at PayPal we are trying to uh uh

build all this infrastructure right to make this happen &gt;&gt; and so uh we've sort of seen you know seven to nine times of a difference of doing

commerce the agentic way versus without agentic. So what happens is a consumer comes let's say it's a piece of apparel. Traditionally you just look at the apparel here we come back and say hey do

you want us to try this on you? Yes. Do you want to now try this in a specific setting let's say I'm going to a cocktail party? Yes. Right. So that's conversation happening between the

consumer and the agent. And maybe the consumer says yes I like. No I don't like. Give me something else. Right? And then there comes a point where the consumer says okay I think this is good.

I'm convinced this makes sense for me and then you sort of hand it over to the merchant right the merchant e-commerce platform and the difference we are seeing is you just send a user the

oldfashioned way and this way right that conversion is seeing a 7 to nine times difference right so the merchants are getting users that are a lot more interested than they got in the past

that's happening because the indecision you spoke of right that's something I'm iterating with the agent works doesn't work modify and So that's how we got there

&gt;&gt; and I can add um I can add to this conversation. I was in Dubai last week and we were in a round table with the merchants and one of the things the merchants are finding out that AI is dis

AI is disrupting everybody at a very very large scale. So before the merchants were places where we went to transact we did the transaction fundamentally and now transaction is

happening worldwide. So people are buying things from the internet, Amazon, everywhere that they can. So we no longer go to the merchants to transact. So what is the role of merchants when

the transaction can happen anywhere in the world and through many different versions rather than through a storefront. So now merchants are starting to think about what is the role

of a storefront really the role of a storefront then becomes about intent community. Why do people come there? To make make network with other people similar similarities, things they like

my community. If I'm a golf player, I go to the golf uh storefront to find other golf players. What does that community look like? How do I have an intent around that? So those experience, what

is the experience of going to a storefront? These things now matter far more than really going to a merchant for transaction. what the merchant sells you can find out through so many different

ways. &gt;&gt; Great. All right. Great. So, let's move on. Since so it seems not only agents will help us all the merchants want it, agents are

helping and what was clarified. Even in the area where humans need to make decisions, you can have an agent helping you make decision and a lot of data is already there. Good. Now let's move on

to the next point which she referred to and also trust and safety. So um uh so that of course seems to be the key point. So there's a question for uh Parag about what evidence of identity

author authorization should be made mandatory so the trust is built in. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Eric, you can hear me?

&gt;&gt; Yeah. I think everyone's right to point out look we are not going to be transacting with any money unless we have trust in these systems. Okay, that it's as simple as that and today

generative AI models very much need to uh act on our behalf with that kind of trust. So there's three there's three things that we point out and I have some notes here. You know today's chat tools

um are becoming our digital proxy. That's a big ask. We are moving from just them chatting to us to them being a proxy of us in the digital world. So that's a different ballgame from

passwords. We are moving on to machine grade trust frameworks like you're mentioning you know uh you no longer can have a password to login and you have many agents running on your behalf. The

agents need to have their own identity and like you point out there are three things you know there's identity itself and we need to ensure that each agent has a cryptographically proven identity

that stays with that agent for a for the period of time that it transacts in that agent's identity should in no way be able to be compromised by by other agents or in fact by other users. So the

key piece is uh building up identity for agents and there are already frameworks like that. The SPI FFE spiff for example is an interesting framework. You could use X509erts in this space to again go

down the path of identifying agents. That's one thing in addition to um identity authorization is key. And where we're heading with authorization is granular authorization. Gone are the

days where you gave you know access to your database to do whatever you can. As an example, if you give your agent read access to your emails and now you needed to write or or send an email, this

should be done dynamically within agents for the use case or the task at hand and that is the kind of frameworks that are being developed now. So think granular access that is dynamic in nature. This

is no easy task. This has to be done quickly. And finally, the third part is provenence. You need to be able to have a chain of custody. As you know, uh blockchain is a really good example of

that. But more generally, agents will need a chain of custody. They will need a way to prove that the agents are who they are and they continue to be who they are. If you can do these three

things, you then have an accountability layer. You know, you have a layered responsibility, which is interesting. Um you also need redress mechanisms. This is why uh the world of um transactions,

the online world works because you have strong redress mechanisms. In fact, Mastercard is an excellent example of how um how that works. We can use Mastercards cards anywhere for example.

So we need agents to have if an agent does something on your behalf, we need those redress mechanisms pointing not just to you. So in the future it is not me Prague Sharma interacting it's Prague

Sharma and his agent Y interacting and my my personality online is going to become me and my agents doing I'm hopefully some nice things on my behalf and not wasting my money or spending my

money inappropriately. If I if I may add one thing uh uh which is which is very sure. Yeah. I think is if you believe the modality of the conversation of agentic commerce will it

be voice or will it be chat? &gt;&gt; Because if it is voice then you need to somehow figure out how to identify it is genuine and not fake. And then even if somebody is inadverently passing

sensitive information like my Aadhaar card number or social security number how do I not allow it to hit LLM like like and so that so so apart from R&amp;D there is a security layer that that is

that is highly dependent on the mode of how you're operating I think that needs to be solved. &gt;&gt; Uh okay and just one question to uh Arvind in this section of trust and

safety uh where do you think governance needs to be kicked in? So one is the technology solutions of identity security trail etc. Where do you think governance kicks in?

&gt;&gt; Um look as people building consumer products and technologies it's very easy to keep reducing frictions. Oh I know how to do an API integration B2B partnerships everything happens without

the human ever being in the foreground. That's very tempting. Now when you do that someday you're going to have an unhappy user saying I did not want this to happen right and so it's

counterintuitive but it's actually valuable to by design have elements where we want to have friction right have friction or require the end user to participate to be in the loop like how

Janet had when she was trying to do her tax returns to come back and say this decision seems like a high stakes decision you may be very unhappy if you are not in the loop. Not that I can't

automate it, it's just that I want you to actively participate. So that really is a very big element which is don't get carried away by I can write code to rem remove friction. Stop and ask will the

consumer in 1% or.1% of the situations be very unhappy saying no I did not want that. If so, intentionally have friction. That's a very layband version. I'm sure there is a you know framework

version of doing governance. But this is how I understand it. &gt;&gt; Okay, good point. I think this is a nice way to there is technology solutions happening for ensuring that the agents

are can genuinely be your proxy and security solutions and his point is really really very good that you human in the loop or user in the loop is essential to avoid the uh the user who's

unhappy but in general to make sure there's a certain amount of visibility that is always needed and that's best done by user in the loop. Okay, great. Let's move on to this the the next uh

section which is about platform and architectures that can enable it. Uh some of you must be uh technical people as well. So we'll try to have uh the questions are technical. Let's see

if we can keep it that it is accessible to most of us. So for Janet if uh your question is minimal architecture for secure and explainable agents what are two or three

non-negotiables that must be there in the architecture. &gt;&gt; Okay so to explain how what architecture foundations we need it is very important to understand the technology we are

using behind these foundations. So when we go into agentic architectures, we're talking about high potency in AI. And what do I mean by high potency? These can learn just like humans can learn. So

it's very nondeterministic type of learning which means you can't control what the agent has learned. And so when you can't control what the agent has learned, how do you use agents very

effectively? This is where the architectural foundations come into play. So you have to build foundations which the with non-negotiables. For example, you authenticate the uh the

identity of the agent. You understand the agent on what data it trained. So the transparency in its training models. Uh you understand its toxicity level. You understand whether the data is

biased from which the agent has learned. You understand what jailbreaks you need to put around the agent. Uh again part of the part of the architecture that you build. uh you understand um toxicity,

you understand jailbreaks, you understand whether there's data leakage, is the agent actually leaking any data. So you're monitoring the agent from birth to almost depth, if you will.

There's a lot of observability built into it. Now I will say where the complexity exists, right? Because agents work with memory just like human beings. So we have working memory, long-term,

short-term, persistent memory. And now Amazon introduced um something called uh episodic memory. Now these are long-term memories that these agents can have. And so it's very important to monitor the

foundations so you know how to flush the memory of the agent. How do you deinstantiate the agent just as much as you have created these agent? So these architectural foundations are

non-negotiable when you actually build out agents. &gt;&gt; Okay. Uh so question for Prague. How do you see tokenlike constructs uh to with to facilitate agentic

commerce without going into too much details of this thing but please? &gt;&gt; Yeah. So the idea of a token is that it's a digital representation of something right and in fact we have been

digitizing our lives and our world the whole time. The paperless office was about digitizing. The what token is bringing is digitization with traceability or identity. Okay. The idea

is that the token now represents something specific in some cases or something more generic like currency in terms of stable coins for example. But the whole idea of of a token is to make

something specific that represents something in the real world. Now if you make something digital in in the real world digital there are so many benefits from it. Specifically if you digitize

money um for example so stable coins are a way to digitize money and the idea is that if you can digitize it and you can safely and securely use it then you have opened up whole world of commerce that

can be actioned through agents. So now you're combining the world of money, you're combining the world of payments, you're combining the world of technology into action and that is amazing and very

important. So uh just to give you an example, you can have programmable um agents that say suppose you're buying something from your local groceryer and you say look if you don't deliver this

before 6 p.m. you will not get paid x you will get paid a much lesser amount and that can be programmed. And the way it's possible that you can program is maybe through smart contracts or through

other pieces of code. But the way you would pay that person is through tokens. The tokens could represent payments in the real world. doesn't have to be on the blockchain. It could represent the

real world payments and you could still use traditional rails that are repeatedly used to to complete these transactions. So that's I think what it is and one of the use cases around this

is exactly that use tokens for anything to manage your financial health all the way to make little purchases. But with tokenization you can now look at the uh agents as unique entities. You can look

at your payment rails as unique entities. You can even have your tokens of yourself if you like in the future. You know, the possibilities are endless. &gt;&gt; If you can quickly explain to us all, we

already have digital things whether it's my card number and so on and so forth where I don't really transact with real money. How is token going to add to that aspect? Just quickly.

&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a good question. And I mean already in many countries um if you're um if you're traveling you may not need to take any money out. I'm trying to do that with the rupee here. I haven't

taken any rupees out yet. So I'm I'm hoping I can you know pass the couple of weeks without doing that. I think tokeniz tokenization brings another layer of independence beyond

digitization because when you're looking at your crown you still have you know all the traditional rails behind that bank account that you're looking at works exactly like that. With

tokenization, there's a little more freedom to maneuver uh maybe go beyond your traditional assets and look in different ways. &gt;&gt; And with with tokenization, the agents

never touch your credentials. They touch the tokens. &gt;&gt; So your credentials are &gt;&gt; safe &gt;&gt; safe. They are embedded within the

tokens. So the question for Praer follow up on this is there are already existing trusted payment systems artifacts authentication all that is there would

they be useful in the agentic world and how do you think tokens are going to eat up on that? Yeah, I I think tokens are foundational to agent e-commerce as Janet said because for agents to if

agent is doing a transaction like if you take a step back and say like what is an agent? Agent and the building lowest atomic unit of an agent is a large language model which is a probabilistic

instrument. It's not deterministic instrument. So you actually want to make it as deterministic as possible. That's the first rule like if you're designing your answer architecture question that's

what you do at the first. You do that through protocols. Protocols are like highways like go at the speed of 65 kilometer per hour. Don't go beyond that. So that protocols give

determinism. Tokens add security. So if I am basically trying to buy a purchase ticket and that transaction is basically taking two hours now. So that token has been issued. Agents already have been

authenticated for those two hours to do that. So it could be asynchronous, could be synchronous. Right. So now now coming to your question you asked will the current payment infrastructure sim yeah

yeah at the lowest atomic level yes but a lot of work needs to happen on top of it just because because because your large language models are proistic so you need protocols you you need you need

somehow protocol to interact with tokens right you need to issue short-term tokens long-term tokens and you need to just keep going there so that's how that's how I see it

&gt;&gt; okay so this uh section we end so basically it seems like the exist existing infrastructure will help move forward with this but in future if you want to do more it's probably better to

have token kind of systems which will provide security plus you just add a time aspect of it which my credit card information doesn't and so on okay great uh so thanks so

general and after that we still will have time for the um so inclusion and growth I I think at the end of the day while we are all very excited about agentic commerce um we know finally it

should benefit by economic growth as well as inclusion that not just growth for some but uh exclusion of others. So, so this topic is about inclusion um and growth and my question for Arvin first

is to ensure small merchants, rural users and firsttime digital participants will they benefit from agentic commerce or how will they benefit whichever way you want to address [clears throat] it.

&gt;&gt; Sure. Um you're right eventually it has to benefit everyone at population scale. I think the decision making complexity exists for different transactions at

different strata of the society. For example, someone has a lower strata, maybe buying detergent is a hard decision because a 100 g packet if you think about it unit costwise per gram is

cheaper or more expensive. It's more expensive than buying 1 kg, right? Per gram. But they may not have the absolute cash liquidity to go buy the 1 kg packet. The money they have today only

allows them to buy 100 grams. Right? So even though they're trying to optimize for cost, it is not unit cost. It is the actual absolute affordability they have. Someone else might be space constraint.

They may not have storage space to buy everything in large quantity and have them. So the assistance needed for decision making in transaction I think is universal and present everywhere. The

challenge is the underlying technology cost for answering this. Is that cheap enough to also support a lowv value transaction? That's what is going to determine will it reach them or not. And

I think that's where we need to invest time to make sure that the agentic AI is also cheap enough to be able to support all of this. On the merchant side, I think something analogous to DC will

help them participate. So the consumer story, it's going to be a consumer-led story ultimately bottleneck on how cheap can you run agentic AI. If we crack that, there is an opportunity even for

those small transactions for every stat of society. I &gt;&gt; I'll add to this like if you see agentic commerce makes literally any merchant global, right? Like and so you you you

are now selling to earth, right? like and that is that is dramatic because LLM's can understand any language. So language is not a barrier. A agents can understand any language. Uh you can

create website overnight. You can move money if you get tokens right and protocols right. Uh right you can move money universally like across the globe. So yeah, I mean a merchant uh uh in

Japur can now sell to a globe and that was unprecedented. That was not possible and which is why agentic commerce is is not an incremental shift to e-commerce. It's a different paradigm. A lot of

plumbing needs to happen but that's the promise right like and so so that's that's my hope. &gt;&gt; Okay. Um and last question to Janet in the same inclusion and growth. Uh so

going forward which standard of public good would accelerate safe global agentic commerce. &gt;&gt; So we need global governance right. Uh the way I think about it uh if you think

about AI AI knows no color. AI knows no country. AI knows no borders. So in a way it brings a lot of equality. Equality to the large merchant, equality to the small merchant. Equality to all.

And if we have global standards, if we have global governance, then we can make transaction and other aspects of agentic technology very very safe. So we need the governance and I would say inclusion

is super important but responsibility is equally important. So we have to figure out how to create responsible agentic AI. &gt;&gt; Okay, great. So this ends our side of

it. You heard it. We still have 15 minutes. uh though we started five minutes late. If please make sure that the um whoever is circulating the mic goes there. If you have a question

please be very sharp and if you want to make a statement less than one minute please just so people can now whoever is moving the uh my microphone around I don't know who has that are there

volunteers who are moving the microphone &gt;&gt; has a question &gt;&gt; how okay please go ahead question or comment &gt;&gt; question okay sh

&gt;&gt; uh so my uh end goal is that uh when you bring these agents right uh they learn behavior patterns of how people are buying things and uh what their intent is essentially to buy also let's say if

I am buying a particular type of furniture and that becomes a general uh uh understanding of the agents that most of the people are buying this furniture so the merchant also knows that only

this type of furniture is selling so I'll make this type of furniture now there might be some other person who is in a very small niche who needs a different type of furniture Now due to

having these kind of streamlined intent recognition systems in place will end up reinforcing those uh biases as well right which people of majority uh using those agents will uh incorporate and

inculcate into the uh demand and supply pipeline itself. &gt;&gt; I think we got it there one answer so we can I know many of you would have answers but let's just take one whoever

you want to go ahead. &gt;&gt; Right. U look we already live in an information bubble to some degree. Okay. um many algorithms feed what you want to watch and if you click on it you watch

again. Having said that, you know what will evolve here is what makes sense both for the merchant to sell and for the consumer to buy. And the idea is that your niche products and services

algorithms have to be attuned to that. They have to follow it. You have to generate that data and eventually those algorithms may cater to you. Um um depending on the kind of data you feed

them. &gt;&gt; I don't know if you have different &gt;&gt; Next question or comment. Whoever gets the microphone, I'm sorry I'm not controlling the microphone. So whoever

gets it. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Uh I'm Shashud. I am the &gt;&gt; question or comment. &gt;&gt; Uh question. Uh I'm the founder of karada.ai.

Uh the question I have one thing that we are solving for is uh discoverability of MCPS and uh all that we do autogeneration, creation and deployment of MCP, ACP2 agents. And in the

discovery phase what we want is microtransactions. Um for example, let's say uh I love PDF creates an MCP using our platform uh and some user uh types into their AI that uh

convert this PDF to JPG. Uh I want I love PDF to uh make a small transaction that I could uh take from the user and uh give to um I love PDF. Uh there are solutions in the crypto space like X402

that uh uh is there but uh are like we have all uh major transaction uh companies here. So are there any traditional solutions that are &gt;&gt; okay one answer whoever who wants

&gt;&gt; I mean this is a classical case like like agent to agent payments right like and and uh there's lot of work going on on agent to agent payments right like like literally you need protocols tokens

right like my bet is it will get solved in 6 months &gt;&gt; yeah okay can we also have one microphone on this side otherwise all are going that side is there a

microphone this side &gt;&gt; yes I have &gt;&gt; after this can you please take it this side and then we still have another 10 minutes. Yeah.

&gt;&gt; Yeah. Uh my name is Push. I have a very short &gt;&gt; I have a very short question. &gt;&gt; Uh how do you see the role of biometrics in the world of agentic payments?

&gt;&gt; Role of biometrics. Who wants to take it up? &gt;&gt; I mean I can try. It's it's it it ties back to the identity of it. Like so if you if I can and and and and also

authorization, right? Like I mean if if I if I can exactly know who you are and I try to authenticate you life much becomes much much easier. So it goes back to our

&gt;&gt; yeah a agents don't have biometrics &gt;&gt; so it's not a thing we have biometrics but they need an equivalent and I agree with you on that. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Okay. Who's next?

&gt;&gt; Hi this n quick question. So in today's world uh a customer can call up for a dispute. In tomorrow's world how would a customer having a a city bank card on running on Mastercard and a merchant is

on PayPal. How would the agents dispute in the agent? &gt;&gt; They'll work it out like we did. But I think get used to uh calling agents and get used to agents answering you or in

the near future get used to, you know, your agent calling other agents and other agents calling your agents. It's all coming to a cinema near you. So wait for it.

All right. Okay. There's a lady here. Can &gt;&gt; we also have her uh this thing and get some ladies questions from after this? Can we have some ladies or some elder

people maybe ask give give after this? Yeah. Go ahead. &gt;&gt; Question. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I have a follow-up question on the dispute management process.

&gt;&gt; Let's say an agent does a transaction which the customer right so what kind of record keeping will you do which will aid in the dispute management process? &gt;&gt; Okay. So that

&gt;&gt; what are thoughts on dispute management evaluation? Yeah, &gt;&gt; good point. that goes to the earlier discussion of keeping track and traces and blockchain but please do answer

&gt;&gt; I mean yeah the dispute uh so the merchant of who is the merchant of record is very important so if human did not authorize it then then somebody has to underwrite that risk right like and

so and so back in e-commerce days literally that's why PayPal was formed because we could underwrite that risk right like and so in agentic commerce world somebody has to underwrite that

risk because bad actors will happen right like and so so that's that's the Actually more generally for everyone liability and where it sits becomes a key component. So that question probably

could be differently said that you know where is the liability in this transaction and this is kind of an emerging this is an emerging field to some degree. If you buy a car and you

drive out with the car and then you crash the car, that's your problem. Okay? But if there's a mechanical failure in a car, that's the problem of the owner and you can still go back to

them. With Agentic AI or with generative AI, this is becoming a bit more complicated to separate out. If I if you provide a foundation model and and you at the end user are using it or giving

it to your clients, uh then you are responsible for some aspect of it. But if you fine-tune the model, then you have now suddenly become more responsible for the outcome of the

model. And those of you who have been following this, you know, there have been some really really interesting cases. There was um um bank in sorry, there was a airlines company in Canada.

I won't name the company, but the point was they had a you know chatbot on their website that gave wrong advice to somebody to buy a train a plane ticket now and we'll reimburse you later.

Actually, that was not the policy. The policy was you have to reach out to them first for this emergency ticket and then you can buy it. So they took him to court. The the company said this is

nothing to do with us. It's a chatbot from a third party, you know, not our chatbot. We didn't train it with the model. And the judge said it's your chatbot, sir. It's on your website. So

liability is interesting. &gt;&gt; So as of now, it seems to me you may have agents working for you, but you still liable. &gt;&gt; You need just like in commerce you had

liability. You will you'll have a third party in between. &gt;&gt; Yeah, you can do that. All right. I no I we still have five minutes. &gt;&gt; Quick question on cyber security and

risk. Uh I think we can discuss that a little bit more. I can't think of a major company whose uh data was not breached and did not have cyber security issue in the recent past. So we talk

about AI agents but there are also rogue AI agents which have better incentives to game the system. So how do you deal with that? We're seeing that even biometrics are being compromised to a

certain extent. Somebody asked that wonderful question. So how do you make those authentication layers and trust layers uh more and more secure and how do you deal with cyber security?

&gt;&gt; Excellent question. We if you can answer I'm told we have to leave agents. We are thinking they're all doing good stuff for us, but she's saying, "Hey, look, there could be rogue

agents and there could be &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, the top security cyber security consortium has found the top 10 security breaches. Of the top 10 security breaches, number one was misuse

of credentials. Number two was publishing on behalf of you without your consent on a public website like a social website. And then number three was going out there and crawling

websites and getting infected and bringing the in infection back home. So that's the trifactor that they talked about in the security councils. Um the fourth most important one is this

concept of uh persistent memory. So in addition to all of these things that you would have in the software world, you bring additional risks into the AI world. This is why it is super important

to understand the birth and depth of the agent. How was the agent born? How is the agent transacting? What data are we keeping? At what point of time did it turn toxic? And because of the earlier

gentleman's question uh with disputes with everything, the world we lived in before agents was fragmented data. Now we have data and it's living on a foundation. So from the minute that data

is born like you can promote and demote the datas, you know all the details and so it's more controllable when you know the data. organizer is here. We have to

&gt;&gt; we have to end. Thank you very much for attending. Thank you very much for participating. [applause] &gt;&gt; We started in the morning. We finished in the afternoon. But a lot has changed

since then. Your knowledge about agentic commerce. You want to show some enthusiasm and give for more to the people outside. Clap louder. They won't know what's happening here. [applause]

And the organizers are awesome. They took that photo in the beginning and now they've created a momento out of that photograph. So, another clap for all the people behind the scenes from the

security guards to the people out here and so on.
