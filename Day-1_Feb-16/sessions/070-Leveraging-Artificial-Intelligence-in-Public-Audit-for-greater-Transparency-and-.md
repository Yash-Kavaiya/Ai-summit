## 📝 Transcript

Thank you sir for the comprehensive and forward looking at this. You have clearly set the institutional context for today's deliberations highlighting both the opportunities and

responsibilities that AI brings to the public world. We now move to the technical presentation on the technology and AI initiatives of the CG of India. This segment will provide insights into

the evolution of information systems audit within IND and its expanding scope. The institutional safeguards that underpin digital transformation. The enabling infrastructure supporting AI

adoption and capacity building initiatives AI strategy frameworks and roadmap for embedding AI responsibility within the audit process. I invite Sri K Sujit, director office of the CH of

India who will present the institutional perspective on AI enabled public assurance. I also invite professor Madus I met Madras who will share insights on the enabling infrastructure supporting a

adoption for sovereign LM initiative. May I request both the speakers kindly take the stage. Good afternoon distinguished guest senior management office

&gt;&gt; and my so we are here to give a technical presentation it's kind of a precursor to the upcoming panel discussion basic &gt;&gt; idea behind this presentation is to uh

inform you all as to what vision and where we are heading in extensively incorporating AI and ML in our processes processes. So we'd like to tell you all on as to what are the

present projects that are going on using AML and also on the NBC projects the vision that we are planning to do and uh nothing uh you know uh best like this platform has to call all the academia

industry partners other governmental departmental officers where we can uh tell give an assurance as to how uh securely we deal with the data and uh how we intend to use technology for the

betterment. ment of this I commence my presentation our approach to ember AI. So last year in April we had come out with an AI strategy framework document. So this

lays the groundwork the vision the strategy framework as to how to incorporate AI in our business process. Uh across the world there are many supreme institutions as we call in

international community offices across the world. So very few have got the strategy framework up published in their respective countries. S India is one of them where we lay our

uh we lay our trust on four foundational pillars. One [clears throat and snorts] is using technology AI in our audit processes and other business operations. The second would be to audit the AI

systems applications which are being used by various government partners. The third is on the capacity building aspect without which we wouldn't be able to do one and two and the fourth would be to

uh would be to uh do an extensive R&amp;D in the area of AML and then on to create an enabling infrastructure to support all the other. So this foundational framework is going to help us and guide

us our uh vision of embedding AI into our business processes. I'll be talking in detail on the tech based audit that we presently do and

then we plan to do as well. The highest security this is going to showcase on what are the security measures that are in place by the organization of CAG in order to handle the data in a safe and

secure manner. the capacity building initiatives. We are a strong workforce of 45,000 employees across 140 plus offices across the country and in order to incorporate

AI into our business process. It wouldn't be possible if not for the staff to incorporate the accumment of their enabling infrastructure how we are going

to deal with this massive change and on the information systems audit where they are heading. So Sai India the CG of India has been doing information systems audit. So

these are the various IT applications being operated by the government in order to give an assurance on the governance control system controls and the validation controls. So this audit

is to ensure that the IT application created and being operated by any government department is a proper fullest correct application which can be used by the public for effective service

delivery. We have been doing this particular audit since the 2000. So more than 500 plus reports have been laid in the parliament very important and huge IT applications like IT business

applications, impact business applications, GST and IRCBC. Right now we doing the gem application. So all these applications have been audited and given an assurance by the compressor and

auditor journals of India and we felt the need that we must go beyond the scope of IT audit into the area of cyber security audit as well. Given the scenario of uh lot of cyber attacks the

threat actors who are acting in the cyber defense cyber &gt;&gt; we felt that over and above the certain empanled auditors were going to do an annual audit on the identification and

give an assurance on the cyber security of an application. &gt;&gt; C must also be giving an independent assurance on the cyber readiness of any department. So this year we started to

pilot cyber security audits in two major applications. Uh as long as the report is uh published uh we'll be going We realize that more than enough until now we are dealing with more than 800.

We have not the unstructured more than so and then we have now moved towards cloud infrastructure wherein we are going to get the data from the

ministries do analytics create secure ETL pipelines come up with insights having said this we also have come up with artificial intelligence it's a AI enabled tool audit toolkit

wherein we have created an order toolkit which is going to get the input as the images of the beneficiaries. Even a non techch person will be able to use this particular order tool and the output

that is going to show me is going to show me whether there are duplicate beneficiaries those beneficiaries etc. Now one scheme alone. So this intends to give

this particular scheme on any register has to capture and how to verify this.

So coming out of the traditional method of audit the big data analytics is the intend to get the entire data set from the government store it in a secure manner and do a comprehensive analysis.

The OCR and NLP have been used extensively right now in order to automate our uh regular uh day-to-day process. We also developing a sovereign large language model exclusively for the

purpose of audit uh which will be explained in brief by my colleague professor here. We have also audited the procurement data set using a machine learning

algorithm and graph analysis. Usually the traditional way of doing an audit is to select the units based on some this parameter mostly is based on the expenditure unit has input.

Right now what we do is we give the entire procurement data set do an analysis on that. We select the units based on the red flags raised upon the late

and then the drones and computer mission we have started utilizing a much more defined satellite image where we can where we can uh use the high resisting images for audit analysis. We have done

the volumetric analysis of mining mining releases and right now as a part of the seven databases we have also uh drones to cancel the

actually as per the compliant guidelines. Make sure that all this is not infrastructure.

I would say that we are intending to have data set analysis. We also have a center for excellence on financial a

It has come only from the C office and couple of other places which has been follow and so on and so forth. The third component, the third component

is the human capital. The capital has been students from IIT professionals from India, data scientists from India, artificial

intelligence experts from India. Thank you. So when we talk about human capital about current 800 officers [clears throat] 7800 officers of the CNG are taking up a

course in data science machine learning artificial intelligence cyber security and the idea is to train about 5,000 officers

the first model whatever we are talking of sovereign mall of CAD was [clears throat] built in I met and I the second model &gt;&gt; we are focusing on will be built using

50% students who have graduated the officers who have graduated from CAG that means the model is going to be built by officers of CAG 50% of then this is

within 3 years this will become 90% why because Coding is not technical. Machines generate code. So the question is

artificial intelligence is what is the problem that you're trying to solve? That becomes very important. What is it you're trying to solve? And I'm not an auditor.

I'm a computer scientist. So I cannot understand your problem. Today you tell me the problem and I try to solve it. &gt;&gt; This is the data trying to solve the problem. You have the data. You have the

tribal knowledge. You have the [snorts] tribal knowledge. &gt;&gt; The third is what is the metric? How do you say the model is true? How is how is the model

helping? I cannot give some accuracy metric or I cannot do some metric. These three components become extremely critical and we are trying to see that

maybe in three years 90% of the applications that knowledge is important right and we talking about right today what are the challenges because

challenge is the volume of data that we And that is the biggest advantage and the disadvantage. Every country is trying to &gt;&gt; get our knowledge to get the data that

we have which is which is in a bounded box. If you are able to build it off the battle one [clears throat] right and more importantly

&gt;&gt; when we talk about audit today how is LLM going to help me? Yes. It is not about magic which is going to solve that problem.

One is the exploitation that I look at previous try to understand what is it I should then take go for but more importantly whats are capable is exploration. Today

I do not cover it and that is where I feel can really help other than the hype of this is what we trying to do Thank you. We have been acknledging the fact that

and so we have an entire depend on technology process and in order to successfully do it we will not be able to do it alone and so this platform through this platform we request

extensive cooperation from the academia industry partners and other government officers to successfully uh uh take CA uh in terms of good governance.

In order to know what we are right now, And to know what we are doing. Hence for you may please like follow us. This is our social media. Thank you all for coming.

Thank you Mr. and Professor Madan for those insightful presentations. We now move to the panel discussion on use of AI in public audit. While the technical presentation outline the institutional

road map, this discussion will examine the broader dimensions of a adoption and public audit including data readiness, government safeguards, infrastructure requirements, skill transformation and

responsible scale. I'm pleased to introduce our distinguished panel members. Dr. Sanjit, Chief AI and digital officer, Vadwani Foundation Singh, Principal Director, Officer of

the Cri Srn Chakraati, Senior Vice President, National Institute of Smart Governance and Professor Aupta, IIT. The discussion will be moderated by Miss Priyanka

Sharma, partner public finance and digital government, KPMG. May I request the panel to kindly take their seats and start photograph

Master Everyone in public the two conversations before this panel have actually set the tone for this

panel discussion. We have heard about the key initiatives that CG is undertaking in the areas of you know AI in their own internal functions. I think through this panel

discussion we will try and get a more global perspective on how AI could be more effectively uh integrated into the functions of CG. So just very quickly because we have very little time left

right into the panel discussion I'll quickly introduce the panelist starting with uh Dr. Sanjie Kumar chief AI and digital officer at Wani Foundation. Dr. Kumar is a technologist researcher and

entrepreneur with extensive experience in building gen AI and analytics solutions. We have Sri Navin Singhi who is an officer of CG. He's a principal director in commercial and CAG. He has

experience in audit across many organizations and also global ones like UN board auditors at New York also coordinating audit of United Nations, UNICEF and other such organizations.

We have professor Aam Gupta. He's an associate professor at IIT Delhi and he's a key researcher in the areas of technology and you know interfacing technology interfacing the you know

societal problems. We have Mr. Shrinat Chakraati who is working as a senior VP with national institute of smart government with more than 30 years of experience in technology advisory. So uh

let's start the panel discussion. Dr. Sanj my question to you is that we've seen in the earlier presentation all the initiatives that CG started to undertake and since you are also now engaging

extensively with CAG I wanted to get your views on their uh you know overall preparedness with respect to you know widespread institutional adoption especially in the context of you know

data quality and the completeness especially as we know that CG interfaces with other departments and ministries. So what's your view around that? &gt;&gt; Thank you. So [clears throat]

India given CA and given how vast and varied India is the problem of data &gt;&gt; for CG systems is in fact a a very uh important big data problem

because both in terms of volume, vality, veracity and uh uh velocity the three the three pillars on which big data lies. CG has to you know it is probably at the

most complex ladder of being a problems. So uh apart from what Sujit said about structured data, there is so much of

unstructured information which is uh going to be processed uh whether it be uh you know vouchers and PDF files and images and given the language where you know differences between states

&gt;&gt; etc. the the problem is pretty complex and it's increasingly getting more complex because maybe new types of data will get added like speech and and GIS and uh videos. So it's going to

get more and more complex. Now the idea of creating a data lake and uh then uh getting information out of unstructured information which comes into the the data lake uh is uh is

important and we'll have to gain structured information from all the all these large volumes of unstructured information and create the relevant data marks for uh our to support our AI

initiatives. Now the good thing is that you know there is a lot of government initiatives for example GSTN the centers of excellence and they have in fact uh done a lot of work in this to actually

process this kind of this kind of information. So I don't think it is a very difficult problem. It might be a problem of reusing a lot of components which are already tested in different

parts of the different projects. Uh but it should be doable. I don't think &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. So what we heard is Okay.
