## 📝 Transcript

challenges. Uh spent many years at the World Bank, IMF, then IFC, and helped to create the Stanford AI index. And I'm currently the CEO of Taio AI, a vertical AI platform for the infrastructure and

construction industry. Um to set the stage, I want to share a couple of um ideas and what it is we're going to talk about. You know we are uniquely for the AI summit discussing the intersection of

AI and urban infrastructure. Um just to as a lay of the land infrastructure construction uh shapes all our lives. It's how we take our children to school where we go to university how we got

here or we were delayed to come here at the summit. um uh climate outcomes to really the new world order of geopolitics is being shaped by infrastructure. Um so real question is

not just who builds these ports and bridges and metros and data centers but really whose standards data and AI decision systems are guiding those investments.

Point one, you know, this is a multi-disiplinary field of urban infrastructure. So is AI. Um, this is the world's largest industry around 12 trillion globally, 12% of global GDP,

employs about 7% of the global workforce. Yet, it remains one of the least digitized industries on the planet. Operating margins are much slimmer. So

if you looked at global construction companies, their margins are about 4.7% compared to 17.5% for the S&amp;P 500. And uniquely the productivity has been declining in this sector over the last

half century. In similar vein uh for increasing urban infrastructure, um there's a paradox with AI capabilities as well, right? because AI increasingly is the new um

infrastructure. Um AI capabilities are accelerating, becoming cheaper. So for example, if you looked at training GPT or other things, uh some say it costed over $und00 million. But in 2025, within

a couple of weeks [snorts] in February, the cost went down from release of Deep Seek, V1, V2, V1, and others from over $100 million to $42 million to $12 million to within um uh $14 something of

that nature. Um but uniquely the infrastructure industry still operates with very old school information, right? So information is trapped in PDFs, fragmented records and in the brains of

experts and people. So while AI costs and AI inference has collaps collapsed um this industry to build intelligent autonomous systems, you need the right grounded data for this industry. So

today we'll be asking this very simple question, right? What does it take to build cognitive infrastructure? what I'm calling the intelligence layer, right? To operationalize AI, it's not just a

general purpose AI that's going to cut it. You need appropriate data. You need the right institutional memory and and the domain knowledge of the industry to really convert this into workflows that

help transform the largest industry on our planet that impacts all our lives. So, how do we plan and deliver resilient infrastructure in an increasingly uncertain global market? So, with that,

I will move to our panelists. I'll try to keep this very structured and fast and I'll start to tee up each speaker with one fact, ask a core question, and we'll go through uh a discussion

subsequently. So, thank you all for that background. Let me Oh, Stuart. &gt;&gt; I must admit Stuart is a hero of mine. Uh, I wouldn't have got like many others

into the field of AI if Stuart had not written his um, uh, legendary book. Uh, Professor Stuart Russell is at UC Berkeley and leads work on human compatible AI. the idea that advanced

systems [snorts] should be designed around uncertainty about human preferences, not just a rigid fix fixed objectives. He's been publicly warning that as AI moves into real world

systems, new failure modes emerge that can become catastrophic. Much like how Sugarville or um Green Mile, if you're familiar with these

nuclear power plant disasters, these are not existentialist risks, but a real ground reality. So Stuart, in infrastructure and construction industry, we don't get to beta test. We

don't get to move fast and break things. If a great failure cascades or transport water permitting network, you know, um, fails, these are irreversible consequences. So, in your

mind, Stuart, what does AI safety actually mean when AI touches physical systems? And who is going to bear the cost of these errors? society, the government or just the digital

infrastructure. &gt;&gt; Uh thank you sir. This is uh this is a very interesting question. Um to move from the very general concerns uh as you mentioned

uh I've been working on the question of existential risk uh which basically boils down to one simple question. How do you retain power forever over entities more powerful than human

beings? Um and the answer is until you answer that question, you don't go there. But we are going there anyway. Um

and I would say fortunately in a nonsense the physical world [clears throat] is um much less forgiving. So the physical world is not fooled by

glib fluency of the kind displayed by large language models. Um you know gravity remains gravity 9.8 48 m/s squared. And if the robot doesn't understand that, the robot will fall

over or drop whatever it's holding and so on. Um, and I think we're also uh as a society much less forgiving about failure in the physical world. So for example, uh Uber

uh while testing its autonomous driving capabilities killed a pedestrian that closed down Uber's self-driving uh program. Open AAI recently caused or they at

least allegedly caused the suicide of a child. Has that closed down GPT? Actually, no, not at all. uh they just carry on collateral damage. So watch

um so I think in the in the physical world the the first thing you might think of is well okay we'll build an AI system

that is going to control the electrical grid. Um we're already building AI systems that control our financial uh world. Most of the trades that happen in the world are carried out by algorithms.

Um, and they have had catastrophes. Uh, and so markets have built into circuit breakers precisely to uh to short circuit the catastrophes that could be caused by algorithms that we

don't understand interacting with each other in ways we don't understand. Um, so you could have failures of the grid, of the financial system, of our communication systems. Uh arguably AI is

also causing our democratic systems to fail uh and our social cohesion to break down. But I think a far greater risk is uh what we might call collective

descaling. So this has been observed with uh human pilots uh with airlines as the planes uh depend more and more on autopilots to carry out

takeoff uh level flight landing uh and so on uh the pilots lose the ability to do those things and when they're asked to take over when something weird happens they can no longer fly the plane

properly. So the airlines discovered this &gt;&gt; uh and now they subject the pilots to regular reskilling uh so that they can actually cope with

uh the the demands of flying. But in the collective sense, it's much harder because there won't be any one person in charge and and the the deskkilling is happening in small

amounts uh across many thousands of people uh and in the ways those people interact with each other. Uh and I would recommend to everyone a book called uh the machine stops.

So the machine stocks is written by EM Forester who also wrote a passage to India among other books. Um and it was written in 1909. Uh and in the world that he describes uh

almost everyone communicates by email and video conference with each other. Um they spend most of their time taking online courses. uh they don't like face-toface contact with each other. Uh

if they ever leave their rooms, they come back to a huge email backlog. Uh they become obese because they never get any exercise. Does any of this sound familiar? Right. This is from 1909. Um

and they have outsourced the management of their physical infrastructure to the machine. Uh and of course then they no longer know how it works. Yeah, &gt;&gt; they lose the ability to manage their

own civilization. And this could only happen with machines. Think about it. If you add it up over the course of human history, we've spent

about 1 trillion person years teaching and learning so that our civilization continues to the next generation. And even in the prehuman times, the knowledge of how to make stone tools was

passed on over 40,000 generations consecutively in parts of Africa. 40,000 generations without being lost. And then we develop paper so we can put our knowledge on paper. But the paper

doesn't run civilizations. &gt;&gt; And so it has to get back into the minds of humans in order for our civilization to continue. But with AI, we then break that chain because we put the knowledge

in the AI. The AI can run our civilization and then we lose the ability. So if you've seen Wally, &gt;&gt; uh, one of the most subversive movies

that Disney ever produced, &gt;&gt; uh, in Walle, the human race has lost the ability to run its own civilization because AI is doing everything for us. &gt;&gt; So I think this is the biggest risk uh,

in outsourcing the management of our infrastructure. So there's a huge difference [clears throat] between outsourcing to AI and being supported by AI.

And we should think very hard about how to make sure it's AI supporting the human management uh of our infrastructure and the construction of it uh rather than outsourcing it to

&gt;&gt; management team. Excuse me. &gt;&gt; Thank you for that, Stuart. It was funny. I um I was speaking to a a teenager yesterday and he was like,

you know, I I rely on AI so much that I can't live without it. And something that, you know, comes to mind is the erosion of critical thinking, especially in the younger generation, right? as you

was talking about descaling um AI very likely could be itself a risk um Berthan I'm going to go skip over the nicest days but another big risk that you have pioneered for a long time is uh

climate leadership and how do we deal with climate change in a changing uh planet um so in a world with uh uncertain geopolitical environment um where multilateral fields themselves

and geopolitical and infrastructure, right? The lines are being intertwined more than ever. Who really sets the rules for sustainable infrastructure in your mind? And um what is the

geopolitical leadership of sustainability, sustainable infrastructure look in your view in the coming years? &gt;&gt; Thank you, Sav. And uh I'm very happy to

be here being French and in a way carrying the baton from the AI summit in Paris last February to to India this year. And I don't want to overemphasize that point but it's important that it

moves from France to India and not from the US to China only. And and uh saying that I want I want to highlight what you said. I mean I'm glad you highlighted the existential questions that are being

raised by everything we discussed today. I'm going to be more prosaic even if the existential questions are of course of the utmost interest for all of us. Uh but AI is also the geopolitical and

financial question. Uh it's a geopolitical question for sure. uh because I mentioned two big countries which basically says I mean describe all of this as a race and some of the actors

describe this as a race dominate the world and when you read some of the paper written by some of the actors it's quite scary actually the vision of the world and I don't think that that's

probably a critical question for this panel but in general &gt;&gt; nice &gt;&gt; is that if you follow the money and fortunately capitalism follows the money

is a pretty good compass If you follow the money, you have some money going to making AI more sustainable. Basically address the issues in part because people are

nervous that AI will suck all the energy efficient energy produced in the coming years. That's okay. But there is not that much money and I hope this room is witnessing the contrary. There is not

that much money that goes to AI, I would say AI for climate or AI for green etc. And that's for me an important question. Uh I I had a a year ago actually uh I was a little somber and somebody in a

room like this told me why are you so somber? It's amazing AI and the technological and scientific boom happening. I mean it's it's going to be a great great golden period of say true

like in 1930. In 1930 you had nuclear, you had fontics, you had antibiotics, you had the fertilizers, everything. And it's true that 20 years later, we started a glorious period. But in the

meantime, we did some mistakes. So my my point today is I don't want to to take this as a parable or whatever might not happen. But it's important to realize that it will not happen naturally. The

money will not naturally go where we think it should go. Let's let's face it. And for me it's absolutely crucial. I mean the old people I mean I remember when I arrived the first time I came to

India was in 2013. I was at that time managing director of the World Bank and I came here to discuss infrastructure. The objective was to position infrastructure as we say at that time as

an asset class. It was part of the of the journey to the sustainable development goals adopted in 2015. Let's face it what happened between 2013 and 2015 has not been a

success. I mean we agreed to significant number of objectives including through the Paris cycle reducing the rising temperature

10 years later I mean we celebrated I participated the celebration of the 10 year anniversary in Paris I mean we are off track we're off track not only on climate but on almost all the objectives

we had agreed and even if we keep writing and like with Sab and I have been writing some paper on AI will help solve the problem. Yes, if we make the decision that AI

will help solve the problem &gt;&gt; because if not I mean the the the money will not go in that direction. People are going to drones for instance or many other things being discussed here

&gt;&gt; and so what why I like the panel you put together. I think it's our responsibility to address the real needs of our planet. That's that's really for me the the the

important message. uh again if if you look back at the 1930s forunately or unfortunately we started with a manatan project before going to the civil use of nuclear

&gt;&gt; I hope we avoid the mistake this time so for me it's a geopolitical question because the issue and you you rais the question of multilateralism and maybe I should finish with that not to be too

long the problem as I often say today we have two issues first the engine of our economy is not heading us into the right direction so we have to adjust the engine that was the objective of

understand the standard development goal. That was the objective of the Paris cycle. That's what we've been discussing for ages since. So we have a prime of the engine but the big problem

is that when you want to repair your engine, you go to a garage and the problem is that today the garage is also broken. I mean the the UN is not working that well. I mean I know the world bank

mentioned IMF and others. It's it's not doing very well. So the question is how can we basically find a garage which help us address engine issues.

I'm convinced that AI is a fantastic tool like the way finance is a fantastic tool but the common wisdom say a tool is governed by the end not the other way around and that's our challenge we have

and I I concur with you what do we want to do with it if not I mean money we just follow the money and then I think we have a problem thank you &gt;&gt; thank you bre um don't mean to be a

downer but I think this uh panel as we begin this we should just you to stop taking of all the risks our society and the physical world faces from Stuart about AI as a risk to uh capital flows

right and and uh who will really lead the article we wrote there Berthram was really about the AI we need to build to help us uh build sustainable infrastructure um going further on those

lines superno to you leading uh special projects at one of the largest construction companies here in India and globally something we have discussed offline challenge very unique to the

infrastructure industry right I think people scare about AI taking over jobs and and all of this buzz but something unique about our industry suba is that 41% of the workforce not true in India

but true in the US in the construction industry will retire in the next four to 5 years. So the problem is on upside on its head. We don't have enough labor to build the trillions of dollars of

infrastructure we're planning to spend and um young kids find it uh if I may sexier to go to big tech then come into the heavy civil in in you know engineering industry. How do you see the

workforce transformation unique to our infrastructure and construction industry and what are possible solutions for that as well? &gt;&gt; Thanks.

&gt;&gt; Um first of all let me just spend a little bit of time on the infrastructure industry and the EPC the engineering procurement or construction industry per se. It's this industry is informal

industry. Uh the workers 95% of them are informal and floating. uh this is also a industry which is you know considered as 3D that is it's dirty is dangerous and it's also distant and

some some people say empty meaning so it's not attracting a lot of young uh talent or young people into its fold add to that the fact that uh the technological or the educational uh you

know curriculum does not embrace the need for AI into uh is you know when they're teaching the students and therefore there's a gap that is coming up and there's no incentive for them to

fill up the gap. Uh the older workforce that is there are not very keen or rather resistant to accepting any technological advancement and the younger workforce are not very keen to

learn the traditional ways of working with the hands and tools. uh the dimension of uh human you know the human element is if I may look at us where which is a replacement crisis

because the average age of the workmen is around uh 42 years due to retire and they have to import labor to do the uh infrastructure work that they have uh as a blueprint. China average median age is

around 43 and there is a productivity crisis that they unless they automate they cannot survive. India is a unique position the median age it's a quality crisis because there's a

skill gap to what they know and what is required on the field. Add to that the dimension that the labor cheap labor rather the labors the labor is cheaper than a technological investment into

this market. So what do you do? So in this pot boiler of things, we have this creeping digital transformation which is led more and which should be rather led more by corporates uh and government

policies which see how it enables productivity, how it enables safety, how it enables a better working environment and how it uh brings in more and more young people into the fold because the

infrastructure of tomorrow has to be built by the youth of and therefore the everything that we do has to be packed around this. So I can take further questions.

&gt;&gt; Thank you super and we'll come back to this topic shortly. It's uh it's a very unique challenge right because I think uniquely for our industry in construction productivity has been

declining unlike any other industry. I'll be inquisitive on your thoughts when you think robots will start doing on-site construction. Um but uh that's for a separate discussion. Um but

similar to what we're discussing with Subara Mir like to come to you at a more macro picture about development. I I myself grew up in the state of Bihar. Um and I was um and here is the development

commissioner for the state of Bihar currently. Um I mean I was very inspired right to look at the development challenges in the state of Bihar to join the World Bank and help make a

difference. Um I think things have changed a lot thanks to your leadership in the state. Um something we were discussing shortly earlier was that India's growth is hyper concentrated

right 13 districts alone nearly generate half of the GDP with hundreds of districts you know which where the demographic dividend exists in India are in the eastern part of India. So maybe

just diving deeper into this. How do you what actions right have been taken and how do you view the vision for not just Bihar but a lot of the I may call lagging states and the workforce

transformation interacting with the spatial diversions that exist in India's growth and development. &gt;&gt; Thanks S. Well, having worked in the

infrastructure sector and other sectors like uh industry and even agriculture, I've seen one thing the right policies, the right mixture of policies makes a difference. It takes

some time to catch up with the rest of the world especially when you are lacking in capital. If you look at any of the traditional forces that you say in economics, so land is there in Bihar

available slightly in scarcity because of land acquisition. But then when the government is there, land acquisition can be done very easily as it is being done these days. Labor is available.

Skills yes, technology yes has to be transport. But capital, how to attract capital becomes a difficult challenge. And for that you need the right kind of policies. The government of Bihar has in

the recent years especially the looked at all the infrastructure very constructively and along with the best of the roads now in the country we are now having we are now building

expressway space the airports. So some functional functional airports and node coming up and waterways. So the infrastructure even power is there in abundance. So especially for our needs

but of course for needs like IT services and AI we and semiconductor for which we have addressed we have made a new policy and also for GCC we will have places where you need much more power and

therefore we are working on those things. other things one very important part we said how to attract the how to get into the highspeed ladder I think one

important thing is look at the current circumstance and then make a policy towards how you are going to achieve so depends at this point of time we are working on industry as a manufacturing

sector and in say for example textiles or or industries which are there food processing this lower rung of things where which is there in labor uh labor intensive we

work towards that and also in IC sector so we have the policies in order to attract the GCC's uh the uh semiconductor policy has also come which because we are abundant in power and uh

contrary to the general perception and and also and also in water so along with that we are working on this. Overall the picture is in order to catch up with the rest of

India for all the lagging uh districts and lagging states you have to have a tailor made policy dependent upon whatever whatever are your uh important factors whatever whatever are

your growth factors and depend decide on that. So from street to state &gt;&gt; thank you mayor. Um let's and we'll come back to this topic as as we go further in the discussion.

Um, say you spent your career on uh building more open-source approaches to technological advancement. Given these opportunities and threats posed by AI as well as involving climate conditions,

the unique challenges of uh the largest industry and what Mir talked about here, right, about the spatial divergence and how regions not just in India but same goes in the US, right? If you looked at

uh AI investments, they're hyper concentrated. No other city catches up with Silicon Valley, not even New York. Like it's it's uh more than 10fold difference in investment. What role does

opensource uh approaches and what have you seen worked to address these divergence and inequalities? um and maybe you can shed some color and

your ideas for emerging markets and specifically an Indian context if you have talked about it. &gt;&gt; Yeah, thank you Sarah. Um so a lot of what I will describe comes from the work

I'm doing uh trying to develop something called the open forum for AI which is a multi-institutional university academic nonprofitled partnership trying to bend the art to

human center AI uh and openness is a key design principle for that. So I I've spent a good deal of time looking at the development of digital infrastructure in particular the internet and the web and

a few key points that I want to make is they're actually sociotechnical developments. So we talk a lot about the technology but even workforce is a is a move in that direction or social

dimensions and for both of those development efforts around a triad of government industry and academia in balance was really important. So that aspect of building

that community is really key. That triad of those communities is really key at a global scale and openness helps foster that. So open data and open standards in many way lower the barriers to entry,

lower the friction for communities to work together. So we just had a conversation recently you with an academic group called the open construction group. Uh and we had to put

them in touch with SAR to talk about TAIO which I think has more connections in the government and private sector. so far. But if we don't have open standards or open data between those three

sectors, which is hard enough to get them to work together, then it becomes even harder. When you think about something like open source, it is a powerful mechanism for broadening

participation, right? So you start to see people be involved when otherwise the systems are closed. And this has profound implications not only at the individual level. You literally have

individuals making contributions to projects or even maintaining projects that are used by Fortune 500 companies. Uh it's terms of economic outputs. Frank Bagel who's a faculty member of the

Harvard Business School has conducted a study where he he has analyzed that open source software has contributed nearly $9 trillion to the worldwide economy and reduce the

production costs by a factor of 3.5. So it's this is not just some it's often cast as altruistic and it's sort of you know you you do it because you believe in it because of your values and

principles. there is real economic value uh to working in this way. And I think one of the very interesting questions is can being more open help address some of the issues we heard about today, right?

In terms of transparency, does it help us think more about safety? Does it help with knowledge transfer? We talked about generations of hiring. You know, can it help with those types of

issues? Uh, one point of comparison I make is that there was this outage that was caused some time ago, crowd strike outage and it caused cascading failures throughout airports throughout various

types of systems. You've had Amazon, web services failures and so on. You never know what actually happens. The company then remediates it and says everything's fine. There's a very famous case of an

open source software or which had a vulnerability called the XZ vulnerability which could have been a very serious issue. But one of the committers actually looked at it and

said something's not right. This is taking most long to run because he was able to look at the code. He was able to see something done and address it. So can that type of transparency actually

help us as well in terms of building this kind of global community. So we have that soio part of the socio technical. We don't want multiple AI infrastructures. Imagine if we had

multiple internets, multiple worldwide webs. You're right. It's not just US, China. It's not only just France, India. There's things happening in Africa, things happening in Asia, throughout

beyond India. So, we're hoping that by thinking about open-source AI, we can bring some of those same benefits of building communities, interoperability, transparency, the participation, uh, and

economic impacts. Thank you for that. U say, um, and again, we'll come back to some of these discussions, but Susant, I think you have an opportunity here to help us

bring this all together. Um Susant is the CEO of Info Parks U Kerala and uh he has built phase one and phase two um and you can shed us a little bit more light on phase three um which is the first uh

AI city in the world. Of course I'm very inquisitive to know what does that mean Susant? What is a first AI city? But help us position as you think to answer this from exactly what say's talking

about right what is the role of transparency open standards open data right in this AI city but if you could kindly also bring it back to where Stuart started the conversation

how do you view if if these are autonomous systems and agents right um we have no standards no regulations how do you envision uh risk risk management in such circumstances as well and we'll

of course follow up more on on as you answer. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Uh there are far too many questions. So so so let me let me just start with uh this first statement. Um

so we are building what is called an AI madeup city. So so when we talk about an AI madeup city AI will be or rather technology will be foundational. So every see see typically in India

cities do happen you know somebody puts one one building somewhere and somebody else will put another building right next to it and then you know this just grows like that and then you know you

don't necessarily have too much of it in the country &gt;&gt; so &gt;&gt; when we are building the next phase of park is

&gt;&gt; we we have two faces and then the 50 something at present we are looking at 565 &gt;&gt; imagine &gt;&gt; and that is going to be a what is AI

every aspect of the city will have technology built in so the data data is is pulled from every every single thing whether it's roads whether it's buildings

And whether it's our pipelines and all of those communities and then these data [clears throat] flow within the system sequence and then you know we are envisaged in creating what we call a

city brain which is going to ingest all these you know so take all these data into our data and then so we are going to do we going to build a system that is adaptive [laughter] protective and all

of these things will be so every single thing will ideally work with each other and that is when we when we retrofit these kind of things into an existing city we can call it an AI city

but when we are building it from the ground up that is where we call it an AI native city. So even before we create a master plan for the city, we will create a technical master plan and then that is

how that thing work. And when it comes to we talked about risks, anything can go you know if something can go wrong it will definitely but in addition to all the physical risk that

we're talking about there'll be a lot of algorithmic risk also in this particular case you know so you can you can have model threats you know something that worked last year may not work this year

and then you know so there are you know there are this you know fatigue when it comes to If things are running running fine then you know human oversight might go away and then that can create another

risk and then so so then there are there are many issues of like the objective misalignment. So we have very high very high sustainability and then the compute requirements will

be you know very high on the other side too. So how do we so when we try to balance these kind of things one can go off. So There are plenty of things that can go

wrong. But at this point, we are at a stage where we are only anticipating this if if I know how to solve it. Probably not yet. But we are getting there. We are in the very initial stages

of putting it all together. And when it comes to you know so you asked about open source and stuff like this we want the entire ecosystem in the state and the country to contribute in there and

then the more open it is the better because we don't necessarily want to have another risk of vendor dependence there you know so the more open it happens the better

thank you susant it's funny you know someone the early days of when open AI for the long you know for a decade was a um was a research lap and and they were the marketing efforts were really about

how do we move from the sci-fi concept to really make this a household name and they were quite successful in that. Um and what you're talking about Susan right might sound like sci-fi today but

it's very reasonable to think that in the coming years this is a reality that you're leading. I'd like to come back to you Stuart uh because I I'm sure you got a lot of

thoughts on this. Um if we embed AI into a city's brain as Susans mentions right what's going through your head right what's going in your mind right about new risk classes that we're creating not

just model drift cascading failures again who's responsible and the government's capture right what are human interventions required um and you can step back more broadly right because

regulations and policy right is always reactive to the pace of AI and technological advancement. So what's on top of your mind as Sashan's talking about the first AI city?

&gt;&gt; Uh thanks. Yeah, I I was uh all ears as you were describing this and uh you mentioned actually this example of uh you know how do you trade off the sustainability goals with other

interests and you know this is an example that uh we use when we're talking about existential risk right if you if you had an AI system that was managing the global climate and you ask

it to uh you know to stop climate change The obvious solution is just to get rid of all the people because we're the ones who are, &gt;&gt; you know, producing all the carbon

dioxide. So get rid of the people, you solve the climate problem. Uh and obviously you wouldn't want your your AIdriven city to to come up with that solution. Um and so you know the the

answer would be actually what you know what is the way you think about the objectives that your you know your city manager AI uh is actually supposed to be pursuing. Um

and when you start to try to write it down uh you're probably going to make a mistake. invariably, you know, and we've seen

this even with something as simple as a self-driving car, right? What's the objective of a self-driving car? Well, it's to get to the destination. No, because you can get to the

destination by driving through a crowd of pedestrians. That's not a good idea, right? You can get to the destination by breaking the speed limit, by breaking and accelerating so fast that your

passengers throw up, uh by cutting off all the other drivers on the road so that they get really annoyed. Uh and so on and so on and so on. There are dozens of subobjectives to driving uh and any

attempt to try to write them all down. Uh, and I know I know this from a fact because uh, Whimo tried to do this for for a while and every week they'd have to update the objectives because

optimizing those objectives produced weird behaviors uh, in the vehicle. It's still going on today. The the Whimo cars every so often do really weird things uh because they're uh, in some sense

pursuing misspecified objectives. We call this the King Midas problem. uh that you you're pursuing an objective that sounds great until you realize that it's actually catastrophic. So the

solution that uh we've been pursuing in my research group actually is not to specify the objective and have the AI system pursue it because that's the wrong way to think about it. The right

way to think about it is to say that the uh the inhabitants of the city and to some extent the rest of the world as well because there are externalities if the city is pumping out tons of

carbon dioxide uh that has more aggregate effect on the rest of the world than on the inhabitants. So so you should consider that as well. Um but the the interests of the inhabitants are

what matter but we don't know exactly what they are. So the city should know that it doesn't know what the interests of the inhabitants are. It should be explicitly uncertain

uh about the objective that it should be pursuing. And what does that mean? Well, that means that the AI system, just like an ordinary human city government, should be consulting on a regular basis

with the inhabitants to find out what they like, what they don't like, asking them questions, uh maybe running small experiments to see how things go, and what uh what the attitude is of the

inhabitants to those things. Uh you could think of democracy as exactly this process of trying to transfer information about the interests of the people you're supposed to be serving uh

to the government that's supposed to be serving those interests. Uh it's a very very imperfect channel. Uh it's really sort of you know one.1 bits of information every four years. uh

which is not a lot, right? But um but if you formulate things this way, then you avoid exactly this pitfall of pursuing an objective that's really misaligned with the interests uh of the humans. Uh

and economists have observed this with GDP, right? If you pursue GDP as the objective, you can end up with an extremely unhappy country. Uh and uh you can also have huge inequalities.

uh in standard living and so on. So so there's uh there's a lot to think about and the the AI city really brings this into focus uh in a really nice way. &gt;&gt; Fascinating. Um I'd like to maybe

quickly get a round of comments from Brethran Saparname here um and then from say and um Susant um to the three of you my colleagues here and as Stuart's talking about this I'm going in my head

about it's it's about the governance architecture what are the objectives but like talk to us from today's point of view where AI sits where infrastructure decision-m sits where does the our lie.

Is it the asset owner, the financeier or the entity that controls the data or the organizational system? Does the ownership of infrastructure increasingly mean ownership of the intelligence layer

today? So, Mir Subara and Bertran from your point of view and to say and susant more from a futuristic point of view who's to blame but who is in charge. Um, so me first round and pass it on.

&gt;&gt; If I had to give a direct answer, I would say all of the above. And that's precisely the issue we're facing today. Uh, I perfectly agree with with what had been said. And coming back to my point

on AI is a tool. It's an amazing tool. It's it's I mean it's it's fascinating to a certain extent if I if I may say it's similar to finance. finance we we can stay in this room and

just with the support of a phone we can invest for 20 years 10,000 kilometers away doing nothing else that's very easy so these are very powerful tools what do we do with that how would you organize

the governance what are the objectives etc that's precisely a question that is being addressed and what is fascinating is that we're in a world where things are going very fast and again as you

know I'm responsible for project syndicate so trying to have people writing on AI and people say no we write later we have to go fast because we have to dominate the race once we have

dominated the race we can write about it that's that's an issue the second issue is that people say I don't want to sign anything because I don't want to be blamed for saying things that whatever

so we at a point where precisely we need to address very forcefully the new governance system that we need to put in place for all these questions and it's about consulting the citizens It's about

making sure that money goes the right way. It's about making sure that datas don't go crazy etc. And we have not started even to think about this. Everybody is swimming in his lane.

Everybody says this is it. And we have really and it's difficult because I coming back to my analogy of the garage. There are not that many places where people talk to each other. That's why

this summit is important. That's why it's it's extremely important. It's happening in India. Actually, I don't say that to flatter the people in this room, but I think it's extremely

important that we discuss all of this. I don't want to be dictated by somebody who say this is it full stop and in particular with infrastructure we know I mean historically every infrastructure

needed to take into account the population so it's true that I mean we have plenty of examples in all countries many times we tend to not conserve the population say we will do good things

for you I mean you thank us later but please go away from this barrage on this dam go away from this road go away you will be happy later I think we really have with the powerful tool that we have

together. We have to redisuss all of this and to rediscuss it extremely fast. That's for me important. If not, this will run out of control for obvious reasons because there is a lot of money

and a lot of vision behind this. Coming back and I finish with that, we at a moment where geopolitics has become a little troubling where you have people which have become extremely powerful

technology wise, moneywise etc. And these people don't have a neutral way of the world and I just don't want them to discuss to decide for me what they're going to do. So it's urgent that we

address the these fault lines in the system. It's not shocking. I mean because it's very beginning and it's very complex but we have to address this up front now.

&gt;&gt; Yeah. uh you know this is a very uh interesting point of view from the infrastructure and I come to Stuart's point about the coexistence where the enablement of the man and the machine

together creates something greater than each uh in infrastructure segment as I mentioned it's a uh it's a migrant workforce informal sector co was the catalyst in this when the

workers migrated to the villages and there was the huge vacuum so to say at the sides and then when people realize the importance of digitalization the other aspect is which I was talking

about is quality now today L&amp;T has a order book of around um $80 billion we need workers apart from we have around uh three lakh of uh labor population working for us uh more than

that actually three and a half to four lakh uh we need around 50 60,000 more workers. Now there are hands but where are the heads? You know we have

the hands but where are the heads? So if you have to bring the heads to the hand, you have to enable them digitally and that is what is happening today uh through the means of globalization where

unsafe work like you know sewage pipeline uh inspection drone inspection at heights uh safety uh you know gear weather you know every in for example in LNT every worker the you know three and

a half lakhs plus all of them there's a face recognition and a PPE recognition device that every anyone is deviating from there they'll immediately be called on. So all of these have enabled many

repetitive work like you know with paint mixing with slab laying uh you know concrete mixing much of this work is also carried out by robots. So we are actually at a point where the um

automation, the AI and the digitalization is aiding humans to improve infrastructure to improve the quality uh to improve the health to reduce perhaps the number of working

hours while uh not sacrificing the overall timeline and uh the content of the project. So we are at a very interesting inflection and also if I may just add one last point is that this

comes at the right time because as the older workforce is going away their knowledge which was earlier not getting uh you know concentrated into a vault is happening and which will be passed on in

a manner to the younger generation which is taking over who will be more digitally uh you know inclined and uh more digitally uh you know um educated. through the centers of excellence and

skill sets that we all have uh generating. Well, I'd just like to say since time is very short, I'd just like to say that there is a lot of information asymmetry in this whole

thing that at this point of time data in the construction industry is totally fragmented even at the level of the government or whether in the finances or whether whether with the utility

managers or the people the uh contractors like Lassen and Churro all all of these are working on different kinds of data and AI would enable definitely would try to build should try

to build a system which is supportive and good. Of course, it cannot it compensate for accountability and general governance things. So AI AI would have to check on that.

&gt;&gt; Uh just very quickly I think one way of thinking about all these questions is who do you trust all those decisions that Stuart talked about who do you trust to make those decisions? And I

think openness is a way of fostering that kind of trust. I would say the the information has to be uh with everybody depending upon uh you know what their you know what their

relevance in that particular thing is. So that's it check. Yeah. Um, I think we we can keep going on and on about this, but let me get a quick round of one sentence

takeaways. Uh, starting maybe and back to Stuart here. Uh, we discussed power, geopolitics. I'm inquisitive. Who builds the tech owns infrastructure? Uh, I don't know.

Um, uncertainty is uh out uh like crazy today. But what happens to our human values? So a question as your all takeaways are one sentence each and we close this up. How do we remain

resilient to chaos and uncertainty? &gt;&gt; So be human first. &gt;&gt; Restore the balance between academia and industry government. &gt;&gt; Public private partnership. this sense

that the government and the people come together and overall in the context of democratic values &gt;&gt; transparency and skilling. &gt;&gt; Well, I think as you said uh remember

that there is nothing more precious and more important than we the people on this planet and this is the fight of the next century. We are spending $3 trillion to build weapons.

We are homosap which means we're supposed to be wise. This three trillions would be better used to go in the direction we discussed today. But I know why we build this. I'm not naive.

I think the human systems that have evolved over millennia are very complex, very capable. uh but also they are very uh subject to

disruption and um I think if we want to make sure that the human race continues to be in charge of its own development and the evolution of our own civilization, we

actually need to get a better handle on how our civilization actually works. a gigantic social sociote technical system with billions of components. How does it

actually work? What happens when you profit in this way or that way or you remove that component or add this other component? We don't know the answer to those questions. Uh and we're kind of

doing a giant and possibly irreversible experiment with our civilization right now. &gt;&gt; Please give a big round of applause to all our panelists. Thank you all

[applause] and you got one. Siobhan.
