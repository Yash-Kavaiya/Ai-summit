## 📝 Transcript

overall entire cattle to consumer value chain we have integrated properly. Now the main thing is these things are there in place but farmer level see we have already shared that we have 3.6 6

million farmers who are giving milk twice in a day to us. They are small marginal farmers from rural areas. Their average milk is around say you can say 5 liter, 6 liter, 10 10 lit per day. And

their cow strength is also from two cow up to,000 cows. So that kind of farmer range we have now. They are most of them they have mobile phone but most of more than 50% they don't have smartphone.

laptop. &gt;&gt; So we have mobile apps and all more than 1 million farmers are using and they are getting getting data but the farmers who are who have feature phone they were not

getting all this data information. So now with the help of foundation with the help of guidance of G one month it

is a intelligence platform that that it is working on the top of our current digital database and it is giving cattle level personalized guidance to farmers. The beauty of this

system is it is in the local language Gujarati. Another beauty it is giving uh guidance on phone anybody can call we have given name sur that get a assistance so it is 24 by7 phone line

anybody can call suran and surab bank will recognize that farmer out of 3.6 From its four number from four number will check in the database how much milk that woman has given. Most of the

farmers are women by the way. Most of the them are women and they are very very hardworking. See milk business they have to work 365 days. There is no holiday. They have to wake up at 4:00.

They have to do milking in the morning evening. So they are very very hardworking people. So this suravan is now started giving wonders because now our farmers

have started calling and they are giving getting all kind of guidance like I'll give you example day before yesterday sir one of my colleague was in the village and one uh woman it's cow had a

dog bite so she was not aware whether now this cow I can give this meal to my kids to cal and I can give it to Amu or not she was not aware she contacted that Doctor doctor doctor gave treatment but

that clearly clearly was not there. So my colleague advised her to call Sarah and you won't believe Sarah gave her in the proper guidance. So for next 10 to 12 days don't give milk to your kids you

can give it to C but observe the the implication and all. So suran is working like anything. It has all transactional data. Transaction data means bill collection data. Plus we have more than

10 million cattle registered in our system. Each and every cattle profile, its milking details, its vaccination detail, it's all better treatment details of last two years. All these

things we have integrated with this AMU AI and whenever farmer will call it will give all the advice like now next is now you have to do AI in our it is artificial insemination actually. So far

now it is it is so on AI also it is giving guidance what kind of order what kind of nutrition what kind of care can be taken other than that it is also giving other guidance like all financial

transactions or AI is aware then government schemes and many other insurance related all things what we have done in last 80 years Amul we have lot of document lot of video lot of

audio so with the help of Jag we have uploaded we have &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; ingested all the knowledge in this abai plus transaction. So it is working very

well very well every day we are getting lot of thousands call we are getting every day and uh other than phone calling we also given chat option to them because we already have have app 1

million farmers are using so in that we have given chat option chat option is available in Gujarati local language so that is the story I'll come to asking back the next

question how are you protecting the privacy of all the farmers and their data but the most exciting part is this and I call look my cow is not well

sure I know about that now what's the latest story tell because I know what medicine has been taking which veterinary doctor has been treating you treating your car what has been the

schedule one when was the last dosage every so fast and so easy and I have questions many of them get many of them don't read because they

can't read and second it is too technical think about it how do I improve the fat percent they know but that's not improving the fat percenting

what is the next% Third I will ask remember this question right now. &gt;&gt; How are you learning from this system and what has been your experience

listening to so many farmers at the same question. Now let's move to so sir you recently launched what was lacking before you had very sophisticated systems. You're also

embarking on a very ambitious journey to give identity to farmers in the name of farmer registries and so on and also in the future you're going towards livestock registries. Can you tell me

your journey of developing these technology systems which itself is like a big deal in a country of that scale and what has been your journey to AI? Why did you come and what has been your

experience so far? &gt;&gt; Thank you. [clears throat] Uh so what has been learning As you as many of you might understand whenever this thing of digitalization or

something of that sort is coming we are making progress or we are making development in a siloed approach. Meaning we're planning to address a specific issue that's targeted or

designed to address a specific problem. While it is important in the way it is designed, it also of its own limitations. Uh just to give you a very simple example where I have experienced

it uh in light of where I'm working. Uh we have two different applications. These are separate applications. One is about informing the market status to the small holder farmers. That's the core of

my organization at the API and the other is providing advisory systems. If you think of these two different system being built differently, you know, you put a significant amount in [cough]

technology investing, you know, in resources but producing two different application. What if you bring these two different application into a one application that service that cers

to serve the different solution that you're planning? All right. So if you bring this together It gives you there are some other need to be addressed.

What was lucky? There was no [clears throat] we were not this application together by doing so we have spent a lot of investment on that which could be utilized for multiple problems

at the same time. So I just want to build on that. Okay. Bengant lack of synergy. I would think that every department is well intentioned to serve the best. So

market prices division is doing their best to produce the best prices and give to the farmer not produce the best prices report the best prices and and and and reach it to the farmers. So is

the advisory systems they're doing their best. So &gt;&gt; when you say synergy can you talk about what has been your experience of bringing them together because if you

see in the space of government every department does their best &gt;&gt; but gaps appear in the coordination. So I just simplified it in the first

one organization but like I said there are multiple actors that are working in the atex space. So if you bring them together you can uh do a solution at a scale addressing you know probably I was

very much impressed with the previous uh speaker talking about a mood that's addressing a specific segment of your problem what if you follow a value chain approach in addressing the independent

problems I understand we have a multitude of problems or a multitude of challenges we need to address when it comes to farmers specifically that if you if you are able to address a

significant chunk of it that will be a significant that will bring a significant impact in the livelihood of &gt;&gt; the [music] recent experience of launching a whole Ethiopia openet

initiations recently how many sources have you brought together and what has been your experience &gt;&gt; so that's uh an ambitious uh strategy that we have launched uh recently and

most importantly we have brought together the different actors within the agricultural sector. So we brought them together and everyone was excited because like I said earlier within an

organization we had to run two different application that if you bring multiple organization it could be hundreds if not thousands. So when you bring it together when you act uh there's not a single

database to make a decision and when you empower with empower it with AI then there is a reason so your journey has been hundreds of applications to a common interface that

takes care of all of their case &gt;&gt; absolutely &gt;&gt; they're not letting go of their applications they continue to serve the farmers with their own workflows but

there is a one level level above you're not bringing all the data together. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; they exist doing what they do. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. We maintain data software

at a department level as well and at a level we'll come back to that topic. coming back to your question of in your journey you also focus on multiple

strategies and what has been the effectiveness of various strategies especially in the area of advisory. Why did you choose to focus on weather as a keystone topic to go after as a

organization? [clears throat] We've been doing like you &gt;&gt; and a brief introduction to PhD as well. &gt;&gt; So at PhD we care about cost effective

interventions reaching farmers at scale working with governments to make sure the scale is unlocked. So a large part of our work had been working in Odisha where we built Kishi Samr which was a

two-way advisory platform. Um this was before AI. So this was you know just simple messages going out to farmers in local [snorts] language and voice. uh we studied the impact you know through

randomized evaluations. What we found there was the largest impact comes when farmers face weather shocks. So advisory can help farmers manage risk when unpredictable weather events hit which

in a world of changing climate anybody in agriculture knows this it's about minimizing risk not always maximizing profit and so that's why we were thinking about you know there's a lot

happening on the delivery side in AI but AI has also revolutional revolution reolutionized how weather models uh are being generated so there's a lot of open

access AI models that are able to predict better, faster, cheaper long range weather information. Um, you know, the critical question for farmers is when is the monster going to uh what

should they plan? And often these decisions are not made 5 days before or 10 days. They need a month before, two months. That's very exciting because I can now tell you [clears throat] pretty

good quality when that's going to happen. And so that's why in addition to advisory prioritizing these types of interventions all of these are different buckets that can feed into uh platforms

and get better advice for farmers but thinking about what each of content or registry is. Um I think that was really important. &gt;&gt; Talk to us about how did you get to you

chose weather because that's the timing decision happens on weather. What has been your journey of developing information sources on weather itself. So I always say this, you can find the

best weather forecast in the world if you don't design it in the message in a way that the farmer can actually understand or use. It's a useless forecast.

&gt;&gt; Oh, so say again. &gt;&gt; So you can have an AI forecast model that is very accurate. It's telling you 3 weeks later here's when the rain is going to come. Then you translate that

into a message and if a farmer misunderstands that message or doesn't understand that message, &gt;&gt; so you have the best system in the world.

&gt;&gt; Yeah. Then you're feeling right. So one good example of this is when we were sending farmers forecast messages we would say there's a 70% probability um and all farmers say that you know you

they value uncertainty they want to understand &gt;&gt; so they understand 70% &gt;&gt; no but when you say 70% probability half the farmers think that means volume of

&gt;&gt; right so you have to really think intentionally about what the message involves and you have to measure impact not just on increase in incomes but where does it actually break the farmers

understand the message do they act on the message um do they recall the message &gt;&gt; and how how has been your experience of I seen this right okay there is a chance

of rain tomorrow so what do I do with it right uh tomorrow temperature is going to be so many degrees what do you do with it right so what's been your experience packaging that information

&gt;&gt; so we've tried both versions Um, and I think it varies by context. So this is why designing in each context is quite important. So I think a lot of farmers just want to know the weather.

They know they know what farming needs to be done. They're making decisions like we need to adjust the timing of planting or we need to switch crops. There are lots of other farmers that ask

the same question which is like so what? And I think this is another way AI is exciting. You can learn from farmers preferences and design advisory targeted to them. How many messages have you

delivered? &gt;&gt; We've reached 38 million farmers in India. Uh and in Ethiopia, we are hoping to reach at least another 7 million farmers with

&gt;&gt; Wow. Wonderful. Congratulations. Thank you. [applause] So when I come back to you, so with AI coming in, will you be jobless? I I I'll prepare your answer. I'll come back to

it. [laughter] [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Okay, good. So this man sees he's like electrician of this area. He knows everything inside and also see the way

we all position technologies from outside the hunch in the way you have seen systems evolve in the last 5 years let's say uh leading up to AI you have seen individual systems get

developed put to use for farmers and and are misused you have seen a hall of fate where do you see the big bright spot for what's a big theme &gt;&gt; yeah uh chars And uh as part of our

Biharishi work actually our entire design philosophy is based on this aspect how we can simplify and bring in that impact and as MSC our measure of success is based on the impact that we

have created for that last mile. So that is how we measure it. Now our journey of past 2 and a half years with uh implementing this Biharishi platform and with the bag stack work that we have

done earlier. [snorts] So how we have seen these systems evolving is uh all of these started with maybe small silo systems wherein you create one system for farmers to apply

for a benefit for a given scheme and likewise you have 50 different ones. Uh you have so many farmer databases one created at a federal level one created at a state level and then you have

different for different kinds of farmer. So now fisheries farmer are different than livestock farmers are different than agri farmers. So that these are the so many silos which are created. Now to

layer it up, government has created their own decision making system which are again accumulating data. So now government is gathering the data related to prices uh related to other things for

their own purpose so that they run the state more efficiently and so on. Now with this kind of information we can say the digitization work was largely done with this approach. Now how do you make

it useful for farmers? So I just want to say &gt;&gt; that when you said there are so many data sources it's a feature and not a bug.

&gt;&gt; Yes feature this is a feature &gt;&gt; a feature of the system that we all create our own data and that's not a problem. &gt;&gt; Exactly. It's not a problem.

&gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. That that that is how the things have evolved and that is how it is going to be and and these have to be recognized as those source of truths which will exist. And then uh when we

started designing Bihar Pashi we wanted to keep these intact as a source of clothes. So we applied all of great DPI principles when we were designing it. So how we can keep it minimal, how we can

leverage these sorts of roads and ensuring all the basic safeguards and everything around it. Now how we layered it up was we we created those what you can say if not national highways but

state highways right to to bridge these systems wherein the information flow we make it seamless for the farmers. So uh let's say for example farmer want to apply explore the schemes. So the

previous uh status was they have to go to 40 different portals you can say or websites you can say or different pages to apply for those 40 schemes. Now they have one single place to come and they

can still apply for everything. So this is how the simplification comes. &gt;&gt; Unification. &gt;&gt; Unification. Exactly. So unification has been our core mantra that how we bring

everything at a single place for the farmers so that they can leverage all services. Now we also have to recognize that government cannot solve all problems in the agriculture. So there

has to be participation of the private sector as well in a big way. And how do you solve for that? How do you bring that trust that farmers have in government the similar level of trust

that they can have in the private sector and that is where we are trying to bring these services together to bring the choice to the farmer. So let's say farmer want to take a seed then whether

I take it from government or from private sector they have a choice over there. they can compare, they can you know have the historical data also available to make a choice. So that is

the next thing that we are solving. Now heaven said that this approach still brings in the elements of the manual menudriven and you know form filling kind of an approach. So when I say that

when you design a menu for a population scale application essentially you are saying the way we all came through a gates set of gates you are designing that you go left take right there is a

security guard then there is a scanning going on that's what a menu is for population scale you are writing the Q system right yeah &gt;&gt; and what has changed now

&gt;&gt; exactly so now where we this is the next phase of evolution that we are into what we are trying to do is you able to serve the system or you know the people should be able to interact in the system

whatever way they want they understand let's say bjuri they should be able to talk it out in bjpuri and get the things done so as a as a version one that we have launched that is there the purpose

specific you know actions they can do the example that gave right weather advisory in a generic manner doesn't make any sense can it can we can we read out to farmer what does that mean in

terms of the action. So that is what we have started doing. The next phase of it is basically you know with with power of baratista whatever comes in and you know the other things around we want to go to

a place where farmer with the voice based command should be able to action. I want to apply for a scheme and you have a system running engine running which will let the farmer submit for a

scheme just with the voice commands. farmer want to explore the market prices they would be able to explore that just with the voice command and that is how we can bring the true power of

technology with simplification and not complicating the system so I'll when I come back maybe I'll start with the second round with you only see in the previous panel when I walked in I heard

yeah we all done voice technologies we have integrated and so on so forth it's all seen as a component you plug and play a voice into your system what's been your experience of

taking [clears throat] AI voice technologies and AI actually LLM and so on SLMs and LLMs into your core site what has been your experience &gt;&gt; yeah so so in fact in fact we you can

say that okay we we took a while to ensure that you know we we don't bring in a wrong thing because the platform was already at scale we were already you know kind of being adopted by 850k

farmers in Bihar so we wanted to bring in something which works at scale and there have been validation of multiple solutions in terms of the uh you know the the based on the voice commands in

different local dialects and languages there have been a bit of validation happens in terms of who gives the better output and that has been our you know what do you say selection criteria for

choosing the right solution and that's how we have plugged in in terms of choosing the right element &gt;&gt; talk to me about farmer productivity and far more employment opportunities

&gt;&gt; how has it been you focused on it see technology is there like a screwdriver nut bolts we carry around so what &gt;&gt; yeah so so In terms of farmer productivity what again like so with

that unification thing we have brought in all the basic ingredients for the farmer for them to be able to take a better decision for example let's say a farmer's having a soil health card it is

more like a path lab report which we get done for ourself and take it to doctor and doctor explains us right what is the problem maybe with help of charge GPD we can upload still it can give you some

advice but we still can't trust right you have to trust a registered doctor so for that also we have simplified in a way where let's say things like soil health card can be uploaded and that

gives you an actionable [snorts] insight and which helps farmer choose the right kind of you know actions to be taken to improve productivity and from the perspective of the you know

employability of farmer and that is where we are looking at it from the holistic as I said right a 360° perspective for the farmer where let's say agri farmer essentially will not be

only agree it will be maybe livestock plus fisheries as well so how we can bring all of these together so that You know we we bring that potential &gt;&gt; also farmer has a family.

&gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And then child welfare and then child future and then health of the family adults in the house &gt;&gt; the whole thing comes together. Exactly.

&gt;&gt; Exactly. Right. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much. &gt;&gt; So let's move to the question I asked &gt;&gt; whether you are seeing SMSS in the past

now it's a core ingredient. So how are you morphing yourself in the coming age? &gt;&gt; I I think like you said technology is not the answer. it is uh [clears throat]

one of the vehicles or pathways to get employment. &gt;&gt; Also talk to me about how what what evidences have you seen firsthand of the impact of the productivity and and

&gt;&gt; so to your first question it doesn't matter if we're sending SMS or voice or chatbot I think the idea is you try to reach people at scale in whatever way you want. I think our role is

increasingly shifting to think about what is evidence-based. How do you build capacity to get it to scale? So how do you you know establish the institutional ownership the buy and the mandate to get

to scale? In terms of impact I think back to the to the point I was making the the big place we've seen real time advice digital advice make differences is in reducing crop loss for farmers. So

in Odisha for example we saw uh 25% decreases in crop loss due to extreme weather shocks and this is not even from sending preemptive advice. It is just from helping manage risks once the

weather shock is hit. Uh so you can imagine as the forecast get better as the advice gets earlier on. There are huge windows of opportunity to to help farmers protect from entire crops

getting wiped out. Again the key for that is making sure the advice is actionable and the other advantage of digital technologies is the cost effectiveness. These services cost like

40 pes per hour to run a field or you know about that. So when you're talking about return on investment, you're talking about, you know, if I I shouldn't say this in dollars, but I

will. You're talking about, you know, like $20 in farmer [clears throat] returns for every dollar invested in the service, &gt;&gt; which you know, at the scale of like

population scale, those gains are huge. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I can I can relate to this in my personal right. I part of my farming is in agree uh sorry Patty. December first week is when if you are ready for

harvest in where I grow Tamil Nad you get cyro much of the time the challenge is will it rain will it not rain will it rain will it not rain that few days is good

enough either to lose the entire grass because once it water loss grass becomes very difficult you cannot even harvest it becomes water lo and that you have one or two days only actually or you

have to start early or only end crop may not be fully mature, right? It's been a very significant challenge for 10, 15 years. Now I see forecasting is very very good. Clouds is not the only way to

predict. You can actually see data. Thank you very much. By the way, one question for you. So now are you putting weather data on rails as a TPI constuent so that others can use it?

&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's all open source all our content advisory everything. &gt;&gt; So you integrate with Barat Vista? &gt;&gt; Yes, of course. [laughter] &gt;&gt; And with OA and Ethiopia.

&gt;&gt; Absolutely. Great. Nice sir. Coming to you. So you have integrated and launched an AI service. Talk to me about the inclusion sources as well as where do you see farmer productivity and

employment generation opportunities come? Because information is now coming together. As I notice information is hidden, productive information, profitable information is hidden between

the silos. I don't mean silos in a negative sense. I just call it as a matter of [snorts] fact as a feature not a bug. Right. Can you please talk about that? Uh thank you. So I mean uh one

thing that will be benefiting from this approach is that like uh let's take an example of a farmer having financial access in the context of a siloed approach in the positive sense that you

have said and when it comes together now that uh we brought all the different uh applications together and we have a great little source of information on how to identify a farmer. So the

bankability of the farmer will increase. So if the bankability of the farmer increases, there is a high likelihood the farmer will be able to access finance and produce more. So in a way uh

by virtue of bringing into uh the kind of modality that we introduced through the open agreement very much likely the productivity of the small holder farmers will go up.

&gt;&gt; Wow that's phenomenal. It's a significant ray of hope. &gt;&gt; It is. &gt;&gt; Talk to me about sovereignty of data and sovereignty of models. You talked about

it briefly &gt;&gt; but why do you care? uh so traditionally or conventionally everybody used to think data as a significant resource. I'm not trying to

underestimate the value of data but it's by hoarding data you can make the best out of that data but by exposing it to whosoever will be making the best out of it you can generate more profit to that

data. But you know with this approach you can still maintain the privacy of your data by providing only what is required or you can use a consentbased approach so that whenever your data is

being accessed for a specific purpose there is a way to verify and provide that specific data so that you can generate you know what is required or for what purpose is it's required and

that way you can make your data usable and uh be of use to the farmers or whosoever is using it in the sector. &gt;&gt; So am I right in summarizing that the farmer is not at the mercy of the LLM

companies who have taken your data and provide advice that may or may not be accountable. Here the data stays with those creator who the former the data owner and the institution that is

holding it up. You only provide it in a transactional basis anonymizing it. Is that approach? &gt;&gt; That's absolutely the case. So you are using LLM in a very constructive way

without actually letting all your data get in. Fantastic. Thank you for that because I see that there are four five instances in India Mahavistar Batistar and then Bihar Krishi Amul the same

approach where you are not needing to actually pump in all the data into the LLM for you to make use of it. Very contextual use of AI for the benefit of the farmers. Very safe very accountable.

Sir coming to you. &gt;&gt; Talk to me about the employability. How is this helping? &gt;&gt; Yeah see generally sir we believe that with AI coming in employment

opportunities will reduce but in our case it is opposite because see as I explained earlier this daily farming is a very very difficult it &gt;&gt; employment opportunities come down for

those working in AI for daily flows. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. It is going to increase. I I just I'm explaining see dairy business is very it requires a lot of physical work and it is uh very very uh difficult

but with now AI coming in our all small dairy farmers will get all kind of help support everything online real time in their own language and we'll also help them to improve their profitability to

improve their productivity and ultimately now we can see clearly that going forward the employment will increase like anything because see this Here we are planning to cross one lakh

crude but we have made a plan to become two lakh cr companies in next 3 to four years time. We have lot of demand in the market but the issue is milk scarcity but with this AI tool we can see that we

can con farmer to have more cattle and take bigger risk &gt;&gt; take bigger risk. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. And other people will also be attracted because this I see I can

see personally that this business will become easier than earlier because all guidance see we have a small village only 500 people are there in the village and that woman lady if she wants some

help some guidance to whom she will ask now this sur is giving all kind of support to her &gt;&gt; she doesn't have to go out of the village

&gt;&gt; no nothing many time in her own language see we have 10 to 15 local accent but this AI to is able to understand each and everything all extent. Yeah. Another thing you were

asking like how this knowledge is helping us. So see in our case all farmers they are our actually owner. Amul see main philosophy of mool is to value for many value for money. That

means see for consumers we want to offer product quality products at a reasonable most reasonable rate and at the same time value for many means to all our farmers we want to give maximum returns.

They are like a vendor but they are also our owner. They are our shareholder. All our entire board our chairman they are farmers. So every year we try to increase the remation by 10%. Rate wise

that is our target. So and we also want to help them. We want to support them. So with this AI tool now we are getting thousands of call every day. So as suggested by you only we have created a

sale. They are listening each and every call and we are now getting all kind of insights what kind of help they need, what kind of issues they are facing and we are trying to now we will create a

platform to help them. Fantastic. So I'll go back to David. How has been the local language inclusion story for you? It's not an English system that you have launched. You have so many dialects

going on in your country. Can you please talk about that? Yeah. So that's a work in progress but uh from the examples that we have seen here and there there is a very much

likelihood that this this thing will take up and will take momentum in a couple of days or weeks time. But the examples that we have seen while launching specifically our first digital

initiative with regards to the open agreeet we have seen a number of uh examples where we can leverage the existing databases that we already have. Not only that one, we have also these

private sector actors that are working on that and they are trying to integrate to the local language and we have seen significant strides in that context as well. So it will take momentum very

shortly. &gt;&gt; Fantastic. Thank you very much. So I'll open up for a few questions. Um the questions related to market access, market linkages, etc. are all working in

progress among all of them. Amul being the most prominent one because they are inherently market linked. So as market players come together and they connect to the networks that we are talking

about that linkages will happen and farmers can actually access market forces in a very responsible way that's being work in progress. So hold your marketcentric questions to later.

Uh so first question to sir why don't you ask? I think the room is small enough. Yeah, I'll move this &gt;&gt; mic around, please.

&gt;&gt; Let's do one thing. Ask three, four questions. I'll I'll mix it up. Okay. &gt;&gt; Is that okay? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Go, go for it. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, we know about the crishi call

center that the government runs, but it's but it faces all the problems that any humanentric uh advisory service faces. So, what are your opinions about straight replacing the precious call

center with a with an AI as soon as possible? will still do better than what's what's going on right now. &gt;&gt; So that is my question. &gt;&gt; Thank you for the question.

&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. I I'll get them to answer it. Next question. &gt;&gt; Why don't you speak it up anyway? Small room. I'll repeat the questions. We can quickly get all the questions.

&gt;&gt; Sure. Thanks. So uh one question for Mr. S and for Nikkita uh yeah Nikita sorry uh Mr. S. So how are you leveraging the uh your existing framework for providing financial inclusion because I know that

a lot of work is happening on the front. So if you can throw some light in terms of how what kind of there was a whole thing about milk ATM right where money would be a lot of work has happened. So

if you can throw in some idea in terms of what's been going on there that will be great and nicha for you is that how different are you from what say IMD is providing right because you're doing a

pushbased services so we have worked in pushbased services back in 2007 with a tech and we priced it at 30 bucks a month kind of a thing but how different is that because I'm not seeing some

progress happening on that front so I'm really keen to understand how today are you leveraging that thank you &gt;&gt; I'll take three more questions and then we'll get into quickly answering. Okay.

Uh I don't know. I'm not counting up. Uh Dr. Ga please. &gt;&gt; Okay. Thank you. Uh my question is to Amul. So you you have a significant number of small older farmers involved

in this program. What were the the challenges you faced and uh what are the solutions you? &gt;&gt; Yeah, there are two questions to all. Yeah.

&gt;&gt; Okay. So 1 2 3 4. Okay. Please I have only five minutes to answer. So please prepare your answers. We're going to rapid fire answers. &gt;&gt; Namaste. Good afternoon to respected SA

madams from India and from foreign countries. This is Dr. Anakaran basically faculty industry consultant and researcher. My question is relating to what is the role of artificial

intelligence and need of artificial intelligence and status of artificial intelligence with respect to past, present and future relating to agriculture science. It is.

Let me complete sir. Agriculture science relating to socially, morally, ethically, philosophically, legally, mythologically, philosophically, locally, globally, environmentally and

technologically in A2J 360 perspective relating to who are having pioneers like countries like Israel and United States and compared to a more than 65 percentage of GDP country like India. In

that perspective, what is the role of artificial intelligence with respect to the respected panel members? Thank you for giving me this opportunity. &gt;&gt; Sir, I'll take three more questions

here. I after that I will lose my memory. Okay. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Quickly one one line please question should not be an answer. Okay.

&gt;&gt; I have question to all panelists. I want to know that when we want to create impact for farmers or growers in our country or globally. So when we do such exercise what is the scope for

co-creation when we want to create a solution for their pain points. So what is your strategy from government perspective from private perspective and to that matter from you Nisha let's say

when we want accuracy on the scalable point data you know to be very parcel specific I'd like to understand your perspective. Thanks &gt;&gt; sir. Yeah, please three of them here,

four of them only. Okay, please don't raise any more hands. Okay. &gt;&gt; So, I'm Dali Basin. Uh I run a consulting firm and I've been working in Northeast. Currently, sustainability is

a missing point actually being used in Northeast as far as the despite the fact that they have very rich sustainable culture as well as sustainability. uh how can we really adopt AI

technologies to really bring in uh retain some of the traditional knowledges and uh try to really uh integrate [laughter] it with the opportunities that are opening up after

the northeast being opened from the airport as well as the distinct the neighboring countries I don't know what we'll do sir one last question I'll come back to I'll answer

it myself okay &gt;&gt; uh my name is such I just wanted to understand why they are becoming very important Nowadays what is your experience in

terms of how many dialects uh you are able to crack and what are the challenges you're going to face or currently facing and how you're going to probably overcoming that.

&gt;&gt; Yes. Last question to you sir. &gt;&gt; How the organizations like organization and mentors like us who are helping students to pick up the initi they can collaborate with any of the

organizations. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So I'll do one thing. I'll frame it to the panel. Please give it to them. So first coming back to the couple of important

questions raised when farmers current practices become established knowledge that leads to sustainability. It's just not universities that produce knowledge. We

all know we've been doing it in our hands. We know it. All right. But then where is it? If you're not in the family, you don't know it. Basically, right? If you're not in the family, you

don't know it. And you have to go to see somebody else doing it. And farming is not a one day process. It's not a transaction. It's like a life cycle through the whole thing. So there's been

efforts to actually bring that and consolidate in language so that farmers knowledge is usable by AI as well and that spreads and is preserved and is sustainable. Now sir one minute to each

one of you. Yes sir. Quickly like one question related to language. So our experience is amazing. This AI tool is seriously sir it is understanding all kind of

question all kind of accent and it is also replying properly. So it is very very powerful and see we have created local glossery all local words versus English words because of that it is very

effective but we are monitoring if some places it is not answering then immediately we are adding those knowledge. Yeah. Yeah. Another thing sir related to collaboration see Amul is

open organization we are always ready to help people. So anytime uh yeah yeah yeah regarding financial transactions also so uh we are paying making payment to farmers in their bank account

regularly it is completely transparent system and this bank account payments transactions everything are now available in AI intelligence also and &gt;&gt; so with regards to AI uh I appreciate

the question like uh philosophical, social, all those aspects. One thing very critical when it comes to AI is it has to be ethical and responsible. Unless ethics and responsibility is

integrated at the core of AI, you know the negative consequence are far outweighing the positive consequences. So the ethics in AI should be at the core of it and we need to observe it

whenever we implementing solution direct &gt;&gt; I'll maybe answer your question we don't produce weather forecast just to clarify there exist open access AI based forecasts and the idea is to work with

the Ethiopian Met and the Indian Met agencies to integrate them into into their planning and the idea is you know we tested a very specific use case. We tested monsoon onset which is a longer

range forecast um and the models do better but then there's a whole piece around how do you actually generate useful advice from that early enough in a way that farmers can understand. So

we're not trying to displace institutions we're trying to sort of work with institutions to leverage the promise of AI. At the end of the day our goal is to get useful information in

farmers hands with enough time in a way that they can understand. So that's the promise. It's not necessarily here's a slightly better weather forecast than what might exist. And I think there was

another question there about co-designing. And to the to the gentleman's point, it's the it's the same point that when you when you think about where to prioritize as a as a

ecosystem, which interventions matter or how to design the advice, those have to be co-designed with farmers. They have to address farmers actual constraints. messages have to you know if if it's an

intervention about seed markets or messages they have to actually address contextual problems of farmers um and farmers are different there isn't one average farmer uh a female farmer male

farmer smartphone access simple phone access that all varies and so just design with them not &gt;&gt; okay so uh maybe I guess majority of the questions are already answered by the

co-panelist maybe I'll just &gt;&gt; unanswered questions Yeah. So maybe I I I'll take two out of that. So one was on that language bit, right? So again, yes, that is that is a critical aspect

because in India the language diversity is very high. Uh within within the within the specific languages also there are dialects, right? So it takes a bit of time for training and making or

pruning it to the specific purpose. So that's a task in progress and it is it will be ever evolving because you know that that's a change every 50 kilometer there's a change in the dialect. So that

is happening and it will evolve. The second aspect of that trust and sustainability uh our viewpoint is see when the ecosystems come together right so from the supplier side and from the

consumer side right if there are safeguards right in place and the supplier services are with the farmercentric approach right the trust will automatically build in and when the

trust is there in the system the sustainability actually becomes part of it because when farmers start trusting it they will start using it and when they start using it definitely the

system is on and it will keep on And from the long-term perspective, of course, governments are thinking on the uh you know the investment in the right direction in terms of the the the AI

capacities, the AI solutions and everything. So yeah, so you will you will see these things more sustainable in terms of these AI solutions taking the mainstream.

&gt;&gt; So entrepreneurs in the room, please [clears throat] come in with your systems, develop systems that connects ecosystem members who work with

communities, participate. It's beginning for us to make it responsible, ethical and sustainable. It's all for us to do. AI is not going to do it by itself. Right? And inclusion is a perpetual

challenge. We speak so many languages. It's not the sol problem and it will not be solved. You have to just walk 100 kilometers to see the difference. Right? So across countries but significant

opportunity still. It's a beginning. We have just seen trial. Mahavistar has had two 2 million questions, 2 and a half million downloads in 45 days. But I still call it trial only. This is

starting up. We have 100 million 200 million to go. Right. First of all, thank you very much. Very patient audience. I want to request a small gift to be given as a token of our

appreciation to to me. Thank you. Oh, I can give it. [applause] Please give a big round of applause. Massive achievement.

Pleasure. Thank you for showing up. Thank you very much all of you.
