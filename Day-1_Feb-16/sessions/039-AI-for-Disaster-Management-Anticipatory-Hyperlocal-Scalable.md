## 📝 Transcript

Can a system running on a computer make difference on ground in places like Puri and Klo? That's the food for thought as we begin because what we are really talking about is not about AI and

isolation. We talking about a systemsdriven AI enabled hyper local resilience approach. One that brings together social economic and climate risk data centers, community agencies

and equips local government to act faster and at scale. So to set the context, we begin with a short keynote presentation. It's my privilege to invite Mr.

Das reg who will be sharing an opening perspective and setting the tone for today's session. May I have you on stage?

Thanks sis. Thank you. Hello everyone. Looks like a everyone wants to have that AI pie, right? It's so good to see you all here and uh I I extend my uh warm welcome to all of you to this brilliant

day that we have started uh incepted by our respected prime minister and I think uh it's a opportunity for all of us to collaborate reflect and move our

direction of building the inclusive AI that India is looking forward to. U thank you distinguished guests uh delegates ladies and gentlemen. We would start by thanking and congratulating the

India AI mission ministry of electronics information technology and government government of India on incepting and in bringing together an ecosystem of players to write the inclusive AI

playbook for India. Inclusiveness at its core makes it a powerful force for combining diverse strength and maximizing positive outcomes.

As I mentioned, everyone wants a slice of it, but very few are asking for whom and for what. At seeds, we stepped into AI long before it became fashionable. Long before

anyone thought about embedding public voices and vocabulary, we went ahead not because it was trending but because the climate crisis demanded it. We were not sure,

you know, to be very honest, we were not sure. We started with asking some uncomfortable questions to ourselves. Can AI identify which household, which family will fail first before the next

cyclone? Can AI help invest one rupee today to prevent 10 rupees of loss tomorrow? Can AI climate migration for for a district

AI transform this Why we and data labs we are trying to inclusively which becomes the greatest equalizer in production.

Moving on this path we are about to showcase a few example we are and community at the for us AI is not about it is augmentation of human resilience

bring up and those field of distress in different video please.

Should I play for them? Wait, sorry. Sorry guys. Thank you. Actually trying to do what we are trying to do is

on uh we are moving from a phenomenon anymore. It's a it's a regular enment right. So we need modernive

approach to disaster anymore. So for which trying to lookative anticipatory approach which we are trying to through AI right we are primar howevers

do not function in isol they rely India India is home to 1 of world's population [music] natural hazards here are not they follow records

a way apply festivals different climate risks cycles high heat stress [music] typically peaks between May flooding

and cold waves affect the northern [music] regions from China it's anticipated action possible The scale disaster to work across all districts not only

relies on or information that artificial intelligence changes this. It enables earlier analysis higher resolution and the ability

more than 800 districts. These systems do not function in isolation. They rely on with communers on the ground data and translate analysis action.

Thank you for that. I think it gives you insight about what we exactly. So here you know communities to look at how can we rewire this

of anticipatory action at at risk. So also trying to enable you know of households because unique disasters effect uniquely to each household trying

how can it be driven through probably it doesn't it shadows everything all biases it space which we can't match right for which we are taking help of AI

that functioning machine to put to support us bring in efficiency monitoring and right as that there are basic approach that we

first is over reaction over reaction. Second is hyper intelligence over area. Second is hyper intelligence over systems that governments can trust and

scale scale. Right. Right. about 18 states across India where we have enabled AI technology

add to the workflows the rigor to the bringing in efficiency and effectiveness and we have been looked at we have been looking at risk majorly misunderstood

with you know misunderstood at majorly misunderstood with you know misunderstood at a level biases which gets you know over you know basically oversighted for uh during

second video please. There when we cyclones in every 10 years in every 5 years we got we got in in 2 years [music] and likewise due to

in 2 years [music] and likewise due to two of so it really gives very less time for affected. [music]

on that for the people. The habitations which are drones. These are like

[music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; that that is something I would say that thank you. So we have been working um on AI

need assessment combining satellite imagery data and community to damage and need real time. What earlier now done in days or hours.

This support this supports faster recovery released based on verified back thresholds. Third video please.

Fore it takes some time. This solution was built bying the coastal communism with AI. Focus group discussions uncovered that the real

damage [music] begins below the proposed insurance trigger. So the threshold was adjusted from 75 to 65 [music] km/ hour. The same consultations showed that women manage the home and managed livelihoods.

Thus the policy [music] was registered women's names with full community support. very transparency transction. Thank you. Just to give you a brief

about u the last of the AI helped us enable parametric insurance based on trigger matrix uh for a an official community in the district of Federalore in Tamil Nadu right which we implemented

last year uh where we onboarded about it was a where we onboarded 2500 families looking at uh you know matrix of unique you know thresholds for household uh for that be identified, recorded, monitored

in the in the in the measurement of transational journey for each households uh you know in the the journey of resilience right seeds has worked on AI models continuing temperature humidity

housing conditions work patterns and healthy vulnerability to identify hyperlocal heat risk this beyondages to identify which lanes houses and most exposed enabling targeted cooling spaces

and schedule changes. Fourth video gradually, usually [music] without a defined moment of failure. In the Himalayas, a disaster is shaped long

before flood appears downreamly through melting, unstable slopes, disappearing spring. This is slow with AI supported risk profiling seeds

maps household [music] level exposure, which homes sit below or on unstable terrain, which water sources allow. The AI assesses how families [music] struggles can originate from how

interact with eological economic. AI helps reveal these layer risks early before flash floods, landslides or glacial lake outburst flood strikes.

This intelligence does not state. It is refined by the communities with local [music] knowledge and experience applied to preparedness and early action. Disasters may appear sudden but

vulnerability is built over time. Across country sea levels rising incrementally, farms are getting salinated slowly. Desertification [music] advances. The question not whether AI can help it is

how each community [music] chooses to use it to prepare coming next. Thank you. We've been trying different models where we are tracking heat waves, cold waves, cyclones,

primarily urban floods. Right? So this modeling has been only I I definitely extend this success not only to us but to the partners with to the community the local visity

for which I definitely you all to the trust panel that we have today knowledge that they will thank you so &gt;&gt; [applause]

&gt;&gt; Thank you framing of what's possible when technology is grounded at needs and real world scale. Thanks for showing work done by se moving

we are building on it move on today is scaling risk reduction for India and the worldization forward now invite to

the we are amazing group of leaders across system of AI we have SDMA

chief of branch have Mr. Zadar AI Sharma and Sumit Chan from Vods. Uh I would

first and then we move to the discussion. [laughter] Thank you. Thank you. Sahit. Thanks also to all the people behind the work that you just shared both on the

text people on the ground. underscore the fact we are supposed to be talking about scaling of AI that I do also had used which is the Indian inclusive

and application in our sector more inclusive of the tech side which is why also inclusive in how inclusivity

as you know we are short of time this is a very exciting day I have a room full we have half the room already full with standing people thank you so much all of you for being here you're the ones who

make this discuss
