## 📝 Transcript

May I request the audience to come in and settle down? I see that uh the the front row seem to be full. We will just see if any additional scenes can be put in.

Happy birthday. Another Are you okay? May I request May I request everyone on my right hand side to please clear a

path? We have an audience member who needs to come in through an accessibility route. Please There's a I'm doing

Welcome to Italy. Ladies and gentlemen, we request you to settle down. We're just getting started. &gt;&gt; Hello. Good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining us for this important

session titled Women and AI a South Asia outlook on representation, equity and empowerment. I would like to start the session with opening remarks from Tim Curtis, director and representative for

UNESCO regional office for South Asia. Tim, I invite you to the podium. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Uh good afternoon everyone. Um It's a pleasure really an honor for

me to be here to welcome you to this women in AI the South Asia outlook on representations equity and empowerment uh which is being convened for the first time sorry being convened here on the

first day of the India AI impact summit 2026 and I'd like to also extend sincere do we need to ah is that better can you hear me now so I'd like to also of course give my sincere appreciation to

our partners UN women, the South Asia chapter of the Women for Ethical AI network, LinkedIn, the Quantum Hub, and of course, Amriti University for coming together to advance what is both a

timely but absolutely necessary regional dialogue. I think we're very aware now, doesn't need to be repeated, but I'll repeat it, that AI is no longer a distant

technological frontier, but a structuring force in our economies, in our institutions, and now in our everyday lives. Across South Asia, AI is shaping how we learn, work, how we

access services, and how we participate in public life. And yet, as we embrace this opportunity, we have to confront a more difficult reality, which is that women remain

unevenly represented across the AI life cycle, from data and design to development and redeployment. And without deliberate and informed interventions and efforts, the systems

we build today risk embedding and amplifying longstanding gender inequalities. The findings from the forthcoming gender and AI outlook study illustrate this

imbalance. Women, for example, constitute only about just under 30% of AI engineering talent among LinkedIn users in India. And the number drops to 20% in Nepal and

just 15% in Bangladesh. The research landscape reflects a similar pattern. Although 71% of AI publications across the six countries studied include at least one female

author, only 26% are actually led by women as corresponding or primary authors. And this again underscores a persistent leadership gap in the in the knowledge production of AI.

So for today's sension, UNESCO will be presenting selected insights from our forthcoming gender and AI outlook study for the South Asia report which maps where women are situ situated across in

education, research, workforce participation and digital access in the six countries we cover here from our office, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal and Sri Lanka.

Our partners from UN women and LinkedIn will also present an analysis of women and the future of jobs which offers critical perspectives on how digital transformation is reshaping skills

demand and economic opportunity across the region. So as we begin, let's recognize that the choices we make today will shape who participates in, who benefits from, and who leads the AI

transformation across the region. Our responsibility is quite clear to ensure that women, girls and minorities are not positioned at the margins of this technological shift but at its center as

researchers, as engineers, as entrepreneurs, as policy makers and innovators. The region has the talent, the demographic strength and the digital momentum to shape a distinctive AI

future. Let's ensure that it becomes a story of strong institutional leadership, meaningful representation and inclusive innovation. So again in closing, I'd like to reiterate my

deepest thanks to the government of India for hosting us at this summit. My gratitude also goes to our esteemed partners who I mentioned earlier. This partnership is what has turned

statistics into strategies and dialogue into change. I look forward to the insights from the upcoming presentations and thank you once all again. [applause] Thank you for setting the context to

this important conversation. Next we have Yuson Kim, Chief of Social and Human Sciences Sector, UNESCO Regional Office for South Asia, presenting findings from an important report,

gender in AI outlook study for South Asia. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Hi everyone. Thank you so much for coming to listen to our presentation and

panel. It's a packed room. very excited to share some of the results emerging results we have from the gender and AI um outlook study for South Asia. So just to give you some context on how this

emerged um we have something called the woman for ethical AI network um chaired by UNESCO at headquarters and here in the South Asia regional office we decided to make a South Asia chapter and

basically what this is is women working in the field of a engineering skills. We have a lot more data there that dates back to 2016. But again, um, horrendously we can see that

the women Indian women average is increasing. We're co following up to the global women average, but still it's at 30% barely. Whereas the Indian men of statistics you can see it starts with

74% and it's still much much greater than women. This same pattern is um repeated for AI literacy skills where we only have not enough data yet but we will continue to track but across 2023

and again it is repeated that there are huge gender disparities. Next slide please. Now this is repeated across all industries that LinkedIn tracks. So if you look at the side we have five

industries education, professional services, financial services, technology and media, manufacturing. Over and over again the same story repeats. Women out of all of the people in India who are

registered saying that they work in the education sector only 30% of women say they have AI um engineering skills. So the the same pattern continues. Um, I know I'm running out of time, but I have

another really interesting research that we in terms of um the South Asia. was definitely much more in public universities.

out in the report and uh the fact that in other countries other than India where we we didn't have the LinkedIn data it's still very difficult to understand the actual situation of how

many women are being represented in the AI workforce. So I'll stop here and please look for um follow us so that we can we'll publish and have a report launch event in June this year. Thank

[applause] &gt;&gt; Can we please request the room officers to shut the doors? Can we have the doors closed, please? Thank you. Um thank you Yan. Next we

have Emad Karim, advocacy and in innovation coordinator UN women regional office Asia and Pacific. He'd be h presenting findings from a report titled Women and Future Jobs. Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. Hello everyone. &gt;&gt; Oh come on. It's midday. You can do this. [laughter] Once upon a time back in the 90s, something miraculous were invented and

promised to democratize information, access to opportunities, access to growth, and access to all services without discrimination. That with the internet,

it didn't. It was a false promise. And we see this, we've seen this before. Back when the cars were invented, when every industrial revolution, when it doesn't take into consideration women

and girls, their stories, their background, and all the inherited inequality in the world. Once upon a time in 2023, generative AI boomed. Everyone got a

chat chatbot. Everyone got a tool. Now everyone is promised an agent that will transform businesses, services, education and even well-being. We seen the same stories. It is

happening again. And from young women, we thought that we should not let this happen and it should not it this vicious cycle should stop right now by looking into the data,

learn from that history, learning from our mistakes in development and we are counting on all of you to lead this work because gender equality should not the job of just women and girls to do it in

their own should not the be the job of women or just nonprofit. It should be the job of everyone, every man and women, every gender, every policy makers. And today we're going to look

into some of the data that we were uh happy partners with LinkedIn uh that kind of a sample from more than 300 million users across Asia and the Pacific to give us an indication of how

the data how generative AI will be impacting women's and future jobs. So we're going to start with some of the skills related. So uh right now before generative AI if you were in 2020 2016

to 2023 you see that even if you didn't change your job the skill set that is needed for that job have changed by more than 40%. By 2023 we have two indicators here.

Without generative AI, those skills will be changing by more than 50%. With the acceleration of AI, it will change by 71%. Next, please.

So, LinkedIn kind of made three different categories of jobs based on competencies and skills. The first one is insulated by AI. tools are not going to be the jobs that would be highly

impacted, a little bit safe. Uh and you see uh that would require skills, human interaction skills like a farmer, a nurse, a doctor. AI is not going to replace their job yet.

The second and third categories, those are the jobs that will be disrupted. Those are going to be highly impacted by AI. AI is already replacing some of those jobs. Surprise, surprise. One of

those are the creators of AI, software engineers. And it's not going to stop there. It's going to move into other jobs. And once that industry start automating, then

they're going to look into the other industry that will come up soon. And then there's going to be the third category of augmented, which we now see a little bit of a mix between AI working

with the people. So what we discover from this data that is impacting women. Next please. So women are typically are in highly considerated in the jobs that will be

disrupted and augmented. Historically women have been concentrated on low paid jobs, low secured jobs and men have been in the concentration of highly paid more secure and getting those privileges. But

the data is massive and some countries here like India, Bangladesh, uh Pakistan, you will see a high concentration that some of those jobs, some of the women's job will be affected

up to 80%. Uh when it comes to the skills, we're seeing also women are less likely to switch to a more insulated or secure

job. They switch from one disrupted job to another disrupted job. So that's also a dangerous part when that transition is not safe for women when the system are not helping them adapt and prepare for

those better jobs that would come. Next please. Um I'm not going to spend too much time. We're seeing like that historical with historical um you know gap between men

and women and the skills. Uh we still see women are less likely to be in the AI engineering and the skills. Next please. I'm going to run. Now, the good thing is that this brief is already

published. We're going to give you a link to it. You can read through it. Um, but what is really important to know is that there is a massive need now to support women and girls to upscale to

adapt to make system offer those kind of concentration to uh not just the the skills and we're giving AI to women everywhere. It's mostly about policies, supporting startups, supporting uh

founders, women founders, supporting businesses and that not going to happen without the support from governments to issue policies from the bank to give security of the services and loans to

women to adapt to this kind of work. Um, next please you can scroll through the the uh the [clears throat] last session where we have the QR code. I highly recommend that you read this report.

There's a lot of information but also recommendation. If you're working in policy, if you're working in program, if you are in the financial services, um please consider it. Keep working on

this. Put women and girls in your uh heart and mind. And even here in this conference, please raise the gender flag everywhere you go. Thank you. [applause] IT IS OKAY. Thank you Ahmad. Now we move

on to our panel session titled gender sorry gendered lens to AI discourses on equity and empowerment. I request the audience in welcoming the panelist we have an Anita Guru Morti executive

director IT for change [applause] Aditi Namo independent data and AI policy expert Leaky Chan CEO Dragon coders from Bhutan we have Adati Ja board member and head

of legal and government affairs at LinkedIn We have Dr. Menan, professor school of computing from Amrita University and this panel is moderated by Arajata

Bharti, founding partner from TQatch. Over to you Arajata. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Hi, thank you. And you know what a great room we have. I'm feeling bad for a lot of people who are not being able to

enter the room. I hope they can watch this on YouTube. But you know when it comes to tech policy discussions often gender is considered a side issue. Clearly this room doesn't think that and

I think in the last week we have also seen in India you know we've had IT rules have been revised and a lot of it is actually driven by gendered issues around non-consensual intimate imagery.

So clearly gender is not a side issue when it comes to AI governance and that's what we are discussing today. Anita I want to come to you first. I think in your work you have consistently

argued that you know AI governance must be rooted in feminist political economy of data and from a south Asian perspective how do you think that the existing AI governance if there is one

um you know falls short in addressing structural differences in how gender is perceive perceived in different parts of the world and especially this part of the

Thank you very much and it's a pleasure to be here and congratulations on this wonderful research study. Um I just wanted to say that uh the question of data or numbers or representation in

whatever form even in the pre-algorithmic age is exceptionally important because it somehow defines the reality even if it doesn't define the truth and that's

really the struggle right I mean constantly to um visibleize and bring to the surface uh the reality and truth of women and the reality and truth of gender. So without ado, I just have a

few points really to talk about what uh what is so significant about data and what is this approach to a feminist lens. So first the critique or the challenges which is that

unrepresentative data as we all know leads to reproduction of gender inequalities and we've seen that time and again and this uh and kudos to the team that really decided to unearth the

data at UNESCO because really um it is valuable to have even that much but what we find really in various governmental efforts you know all of us know about data stacks.

So when traditional statistical systems enter these data stacks and you really have um uh a lack of parity in terms of uh you know these traditional data sets for example land records or RTC records

which become part of digital data stacks uh at the national level you might actually invisibleize cultivators wage labor women who record themselves as peasants and farmers

because they may not actually have land titles. So the RTC records may not be a good proxy really to show how women participate in agriculture. And this of course will lead to gender blindness in

downstream innovation and therefore you actually think of women who are innovators in agriculture really not as 1 minute and 30 seconds. Is that what it is?

&gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; No. No. Yeah. But I think adding to that is the new challenge of uh bond digital data where algorithms really make several inferences about identity

characteristics and this is really a serious problem because the way in which an ad uh comes to you or if you're denied a bank loan all of this is really because of the way in which algorithmic

uh architectures are organized in the platform economy. The third I want to say is that mostly in South Asia the data protection act does not really provide for very very good protections

particularly from a gendered perspective and this is really evident in the definitions or the lack of definitions of sensitive personal data in in the health domain etc. I would also like to

uh point you know just to wrap up um that we have to look at women in all their roles. Women are citizen subjects first and foremost. They're also economic agents and they are

participants in the public sphere. And in each of these respects, we have to really think about the data systems. And I would uh strongly point to the emergence of the lack of data on gig

work. And I would like to point to a very important aspect of the data of women workers that are invisibleized in global value chains. These are data workers who these are content moderators

and just as what we visibleize uh women um as economic agents we really have to also look at the class of women from an intersectional perspective you know where where are they actually located in

these international AI value chains because I think for women the costs of organizing are very very high they don't have trade unions they cannot really visibilize themselves of course I'm

making a sweeping generalization so to really conclude I would like to say that the situation in the data and AI economy is aiding a new kind of compact, a new kind of contract between capitalism and

patriarchy. Of course, the state is complicit, but I think we really need to do something to dismantle this. Thank you very much. Thank you, Anita. And I think you've

opened a Pandora's box uh with your last uh sentence. Adi, I want to come to you. You have had extensive experience with the World Economic Forum and you know JPAL and you have also been looking at

how AI can you know how AI is transforming our governance systems and it is more likely to happen in global south because our existing governance systems are in want of a lot of uh you

know improvement. So what do you think are the gendered consequences of what's happening if you Okay. &gt;&gt; Am I audible? Yeah. Great. No, I think

Anita has given us a very good setting of of what the problem u uh what the problems are and what's the landscape here. But um just before I answer this question, I my uh my own uh you know

dabbling into innovation started. I'm a computer science engineer. I was one of the six girls in a class of 36 uh people um and um and and I started dabbling into innovation and tech by coding. So

my own journey as girl in STEM really started from developing products, developing it to looking at how these uh big transformation projects were being handled by big teams which were

disproportionately managed by and represented by men over women. So I've seen the space and then uh dabbling with my own uh policy and uh you know research background a little bit less

less research more policy uh with the world economic forum where we did the first experiments on um actually uh looking at medicine from the sky or looking at how innovation and tech

policy was playing a role. um to going on to uh my stint at the Reserve Bank where we were looking at how financial inclusion in the country um is is uh you know opaque because of lack of data

because uh you had u you know women more women accounts but you didn't know whether they were being actively used or there was money and whether the accounts were actually primarily hold by women

and how much control they had on those accounts to uh the point where uh working with uh jal very more recently where jAL themselves undergo a lot of evaluation they take a lot of

evaluations of work of how some of these schemes work so whether it's the bradhan mantri jandhan yoja or public dispersal systems innovation has played a key role from the time and my own personal

experience where you have seen the UPI the India stack but what has happened is that while the governments are now picking up on AI governance as an effic efficiency tool. Um, efficiency also

comes with a lot of accountability. So I think the the with the whole AI and governance what big looming problem we have is it will improve inclusion by the nature of it but it will intensify

stratification and that will happen because the data which is feeding these systems may not represent not only gender but various other elements of stratification whether that's cast

whether that's disability whether that's women all of it included. So I think there's a lot for us to mull over in terms of how do we audit these systems, what data is going in training these

systems. Very recently while the South Asia outlook report was being created and I spent some time uh past month with uh with with the team developing this report. uh we we I went back to the

drawing wheel to say how do you actually look at women representation from girls who are you know taking up STEM courses to them going into jobs which are using these skills to develop those products

to then going into assignments where you govern these projects and who is monitoring these projects. So I think there is an inadequate and disproportionate deployment or you will

see the data surface with this report that women actually are there in STEM but as you grow up the chain of uh you know jobs you'll find less and less women governing these projects uh the

these big uh uh transformational projects these big monetary uh monitoring projects and that is where we need more women representation to uh to be able to uh you know fend through

these harms that we are seeing. I have more to offer but I'm sure our panelists can add but thanks. &gt;&gt; Thanks Aditi. Uh Lei I want to come to you. You have traveled from Bhutan and

you know you have had a very interesting experience of building like an IT services company in Bhutan. So you know India has a thriving tech ecosystem and of course we are a large population but

for a smaller country like Bhutan what kind of challenges do you see especially in a in the text ecosystem but from a gender perspective as well? Thank you. Thank you Aparita. First of

all, thank you uh for having me here. It's lovely to connect with all of you here in uh India. Uh speaking from uh my experience leading dragon coders, my company is called Dragon Coders. So we

do software development all the tech systems. Um the what I experienced what I found is that with gender uh inclusivity uh it starts from schools uh you know uh

so in Bhutan's Bhutan's case is very interesting like it's small but it is very like mountainous the we have 20 districts uh districts are distributed and separated by mountains and rivers so

girls uh do not get exposure to AI programs early enough and uh it's not enough to build uh interests and uh you know the inspiration is not there. So that's one challenge. Our schools and

our universities, colleges are still um uh still um adjusting like incorporating uh the programs, robotics, AI programs into the uh curriculara and it's taking time. So it takes times to build

infrastructure to upskill the resource person and all that. Another um challenge I see uh in Bhutan's context is the uh lack of uh visible uh role models you can say. Yeah. I can be one

but I'm not so popular and all that. Yeah. [laughter] Yeah. Yeah. So uh that's there. So when there is no uh someone to mirror yourself in that role, it's a program.

So it's difficult uh for you know young girls to take up such things. And also um in Bhutan still our uh internet ISP uh internet speed uh is uh is not good enough and uh it's quite expensive.

Yeah. And then uh so in rural areas it becomes more like less robust internet our ISB providers are working uh in improving that one but u it's it's taking time. So we are having several

other issues like maybe it's also the the girls coming from financial uh financial uh vulnerable families their uh immediate uh uh attention or investment is uh on something that will

come back fast and AI and learning AI and all that request time and you know investment from personal point of view. Uh other thing is um you can say socio or cultural related cultural related

issues. It in Bhutan although our development progress is progressing fast and then our development philosophy is based on happiness like gross national happiness um girls are still seen as the

uh primary homemakers. So we still need a shift in all that area. Thank you. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Thank you Aditi. I want to come to you. I think a lot of data has already been

shared from LinkedIn economic graph. Um but I know that you sit on even more data than what has been shared. So I think uh it'll be great to understand that you know what are the gender

patterns that are emerging in AIdriven job market and how quickly is everything going to change around us. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Uh so first I I want to call out the amazing work that UN women and

UNICE uh and UNESCO have done with uh with our data. Um it it gives me great pride that the data that we have is contributing to uh effective policym uh you said we have a lot of data. We do. I

agree. I'm not going to deny that. Uh uh so a little bit context about what what this LinkedIn data is, what LinkedIn economic graph is, which you've heard about. So it's it's basically all the

member signals that we get from our 1.3 billion members about 170 million in India. We have about 40,000 skills millions of companies every every uh every job is listed there with its with

the skills that's required. So what that does give us is a unique worldview in and a real time nuanced worldview into what's happening in the world of work. And for last couple of years, what we've

done is we've looked at this LinkedIn economic graph and what's happening to the to the world of women when it comes to uh comes to work. So, and a lot you've seen a lot of our our charts

already. So, I'm not going to double click uh on on any of them, but just leave you with a couple of points. So, first is there is a top-of-the-funnel problem when it comes to AI. We heard

that whichever country you look at, not more than 30% of the current AI talent is female. Uh so there is a top-of- the funnel problem. If you look at outside of AI even in professions where women

form say 50% or close to 50% of the entry level workforce by the time we get to seuite in those jobs uh leaderships have leadership level has fallen to 12%. So I shudder to think when we look years

on with a starting level of 30% in AI talent female when you get to leadership levels what that number is going to look like. Today we're at sort of the first floor or ground floor of this of this

transition right said in the 90s the internet came nobody thought about gender but at least today we're on the first floor ground floor we're discussing this as an issue so what can

we do to fix the top of the funnel that we're not sitting in a room five years later and saying that oh there are no AI talent uh talent leaders that's one the second you heard about uh uh that there

are these hard skills when it comes to AI everyone talks about um LLMs and and etc the very interesting piece that we've seen is that where um where tasks become automated, right? Think of your

job and think of all the component tasks and how you spend your day. If all those tasks can get automated, then what is important? What do we bring as humans to to to work? We bring our soft skills, we

bring our humanity. Things that will become important in an AI world are things like can you communicate effectively? Are you a good leader? Do you have empathy? Can you do critical

thinking? Can you do creativity? These are the skills that is going to be super important in in uh in an AI forward world. Interestingly, what we've seen is that women are good at this stuff. If

you look at if you look at LinkedIn data and skills listed, women list a lot more soft skills than than men do, right? So, here is an opportunity. Uh but it's a little bit Dickinson and it's a best of

it's a good times bad times. Uh so I I I led with the good times. The bad time is that uh Emma you alluded to it. If you also look at jobs that are going to get disrupted versus those that are

insulated and and augmented. Women I one one second women tend to hold a lot more of those jobs which are going to be disrupted. Just just think of us a lot of the work that we do as uh you know

customer service representatives parallegals in in law firms. A bulk of those jobs are held by women and those are the jobs that are very easily automated and those are are going to are

going to get disrupted. So how do we ensure that we that that that this transition is is equitable? We get more women on the ground floor. We get more women to uh to leverage the the soft

skills that are going to be the currency in in in the world to come. And how do we ensure that jobs that are going to get disproportionately affected or disrupted because of AI? How do we

ensure that we do transitions to the ones that are augmented and and insulated? I'm going to stop. Great. Thank you so much. Thanks Aditi for adding a positive note to all of this

saying that we are better at some of the soft skills and maybe that may help. Vive sorry this is not meant to be discriminatory as the only man in the panel coming to you in the last but it

just so happened. Sorry but I think uh one of the I mean you are at a university so I think the question is that you know we've already heard about the fact that data systems determine

what AI finally comes out with and our data systems inherently have a problem because there's more data about men than women. So what do academic institutes like what role can they play in uh you

know solving for this and for example any examples that you have from your own work or projects that you've seen from around the world. &gt;&gt; Yeah, thank you for having me here. It's

a really a privilege and honor to be part of this important conversation. uh so uh universities are actually at a central theme as far as this particular situation is concerned because they

nurture talent and also the value system. So since we are now talking about a situation where where we are experiencing this kind of gender inequalities and a lot of this is

actually a data and representation bias which is built in over the period of time and as even in the UN report that Yong was mentioning which she was mentioning about Scopus data being

accessed and the global API failed to capture u the Indian context or the south Asian context. So what has happened is primarily a lot of these systems have been trained on data that

were from a particular context and a model is only as good as the data it sees. And so thereby what is really happening is uh the talent pool has to be sensitized right from design time

that you need to have a diverse pool of data if your model needs to really uh perform well across populations. And this is something that uh we need to kind of embed right from the university

level where they get trained on all the software engineering talent that they get exposed. So as far as our university at Amrita University uh headed by our chancellor Rama Srimat Dvi uh our

renowned humanitarian leader we not only emphasize the education for living which is a regular focus of uh all universities we also focus on education for life

&gt;&gt; where how do you become a better human being and all this value systems and the ethics that we talk of actually get embedded into this. So one of the interesting aspects that I would like to

highlight here is our trademark living labs program where we have teams of multi-disiplinary students and faculty who actually go to villages where we have actually identified some of the

villages and we they embed themselves in the in the context in the village for at least a few weeks to months and this interdisiplinary team actually tries to actually identify a problem. So this is

actually students and faculty from different departments and schools and they try to now solve this problem in a manner where you try to factor data diversity. You also try to ensure that

all these constraints are also brought in because every different context and even we can see that even within states from state to state the sensitivities uh change. So this is something that we

often try to uh inculcate right from the beginning of our program and also like we are fortunate uh in the sense that we have a lot of women leaders in our university at different schools and

centers who actually are at the helm of uh driving or spearheading a lot of cutting edge initiatives in interdisiplinary AI program. So this actually uh begins from them in the

sense like they ensure that the students and faculty also uh take part in something and are s sensitized to this early on. So basically uh to sum up it is not an afterthought something that

needs to be brought in right in the beginning. &gt;&gt; Absolutely and I think educational institutions have such a big role to play in that. Fortunately we have time

for two audience questions. Thank you Survi for keeping everybody on time. Does anybody have any question? No, we don't have Oh, damn. Okay. Sorry. I tried my best. [laughter]

But &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; uh we have a LinkedIn booth in 4.7 with a lot more data. So if anyone wants to come and play around

&gt;&gt; Okay, great. Great. Uh so then can I invite K to please um cap this discussion and hopefully we can continue our conversations outside this room after this.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. Suri, how many minutes do I have? [laughter] three minutes. Okay. Wonderful. Thank you. And I'm so very pleased to see so many young women here in the room. I

wish these many engineers are there in the designing rooms where we are designing solutions. Um some of those &gt;&gt; Can you hear me now? &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you. I'm saying I'm very

pleased to see you all particularly the young women and I'm hoping and I wish that the these many women are there in the designing rooms where solutions are designed. However, just to give you

brief context about today's uh discussion um all of them and I was really listening very very um intently because you talked about uh problems to um solutions to also hope. three things

that I wanted to talk about. One is there's no difference between the aspirations of rural women and urban women. So we need to stop talking about now women and women women in you know

women in rural areas, women in urban areas. You talk to any girl in rural areas and they also want to do what Aditi is doing or they also want to do what this Aditi is doing. So um because

there is access to information now. So we need to start skilling them and bringing them into right jobs and jobs that are not going to be disrupted by AI in in fact we should be putting them

there. Second is the language that we use in the AI and also who is putting that language there who's going to benefit from it who's going to be disadvantaged because of those things

and the study shows that if women don't put their skills as I mean all of us know AI but we don't put it in our CV we don't put it in our LinkedIn profile so we are less likely to be picked up for

those jobs which are also meant for us so we need to be aware about what gets what who gets hired and because of what. So be a little more smart about those things. The third thing is of course

about leadership and governance of AI and I think we are at a very critical junction when we start moving from side events to the main events like this since morning. This is my third session

on gender and I'm extremely pleased that we have come center stage. Don't leave the rooms now. enter every room and talk about these issues like what Amad was saying don't miss a single opportunity

and I'll just give you one 30 secondond example recently we had a discussion with 20 MPs tech companies government of India to say how non-consensual images are still you know going on on on

in the on the internet who is responsible for removing them who is going to regulate that kind of content which is not non-consensual and two days back we saw the government order. I'm

not saying it is because of our effort but all of us are saying the same things unless all of us talk about these issues that impact our lives particularly um uh not in the right sense we I'm I'm sure

government will take note of that and government did take note of those discussions I think some MPs also took up these issues so please speak up please be there please get counted if

you are not part of the data that is being generated now you are going to be out of the data which is going to impact our lives and and the generations ahead. So thank you and thank you thanks to Tim
