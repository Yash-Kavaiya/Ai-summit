## 📝 Transcript

Lights up. foreign study Christian. Yes.

Another to host a session on empowering policy makers and diplomats for tech inform international digital policy. My name is Bloom. I work with

the data innovation lab initiative by the German federal forign office as a program manager and um just shortly about the data in innovation lab. We try to advance tech foreign policy. might

talk a little bit about what we actually understand with that creative data and we understand techlomacy as a structured approach to navigate

geopolitical implications of new technologies by building coalitions and enabling informed strategic diplomatic responses. Why is this crucial? I think we can all agree that we're witnessing

how the rapid technology development we're witnessing right now such artificial intellig intelligence but also different technology are reshaping global power dynamics and

&gt;&gt; sometimes perceive also in our work that the technological change or cases the political consensus so digital government has become a core pillar of bilateral multilateral and international

engagement. Yet we also think since many policy makers and diplomats are quite aware of the state, they sometimes do not only lacking the tools or lack the knowledge of how to use the roots to

anticipate the specific challenge we're talking about and check policies specifically digital policy, international policy proactively. So to bridge this

gap there's a bunch of methodology futures literacy method methodology about what we're going to talk a little bit more today and we think that these methods can actually help to navigate a

little bit through this complexity and into identify more governance options or we call like policy spaces that's specifically what we want to talk about today. Um how we actually thought about

doing this is that we have some uh perspectives from the German administration and uh two perspectives from two leading Indian think tanks that will also

participate in the uh discussion that focus also a little bit more on social empowerment and tune and authenticity in in their approaches. So our participants will discuss why future literacy is not

only uh nice to have soft skill but also mandatory skill that has to be more implemented in the training in the everyday world by policy makers to implement. So this is what we're trying

to discuss today a little bit more that we think about how we come from a more reactive stance in making international digital policy to more corrective approaches. And this is specifically

what we want to talk a little bit about today. So to set the stage, I would like to invite my colleague Nat um to look to look a little bit more on how to anticipate these global shifts we were

talking a little bit uh about today from today's perspective and how the ideas of future literacy and how you can affect the future influenced by decisions today. a little bit more how they manage

in practice and um if you start the session now l will give a short short introduction showcasing four scenarios um he works at the secretariat of the inderman digital dialogue where he

supports the dialogue in its stakeholder engagement the inderman dialogue is the multistakeholder platform to advance joint efforts of India and Germany in its digital transformation journeys it

has been set up by the German federal Ministry for digital um transformation and government modernization implemented by the GST in partnership with India's ministry of electronics and information

technology. Shortly on large biography we have worked on multilateral processes in digital governance and supported the growth of IT based startups and established IT companies. And now I'm

happy to invite you to provide a short introduction to future literacy and uh showcasing four scenarios how to implify the impact of today's policy making Thank you, Sebastian. Um, and thank you

also for our co-panelists. Um, I will take just a bit of time now to emphasize why we need to think about futures and what future literacy can be. Um, and I think Sebastian already mentioned it.

the world has changed a little bit in recent years and um what I feel personally is that everything has become more urgent and everything is a priority and we dealt often with crisis rather

than thinking about what our vision is or what futures can be. So I think future frequency and looking at scenarios can be quite important because we should not forget about our futures

and with that we should also not forget about the realm of digital and the influence digital has on everyday lives now and to do so many organizations apply foresight methods.

side is really a set of methods to construct a future to reduce uncertainties and ultimately become more resilient and while thinking about future we

obviously cannot fully avoid surprises. The world is complex and uncertain but we can try to anticipate trends and disruptions and also leverage our capacity for change. And it's also not

about thinking okay what precisely will the future be but to be prepared for alternative futures. This is why we also think about futures in plural and not a singular one. And to visualize that I

have brought along for readym made scenarios for the digital governance of 20 30 roughly 10 years. And maybe one word on them they are quite extreme. They are quite a but they are plausible

and they enable us to think about okay what policy spaces are there in place that can already mention um but the real future will be somewhere in between it will be a mix of all four of them or or

completely other ones because the ones I prepared um they may provide um a basis for discussion but they are just an example so also they don't hold any of the views but rather at least a couple

of external sources from the economist, the OECD and some other platforms. Yeah. And with that I would say let's just jump right in into the first scenario on computing box. It's really a

continuation of recent developments and by 2035 tech will be woven into daily routines. We regulated AI models are everywhere and bureaucracy, health, finance, communication and learning.

services work because AI works and access to public services however requires a state like digital identity. I think uh here in India we are quite aware of that. In other parts of the

world we are working on that. Um it speeds transactions but it's also a bit challenging for people who cannot or choose not to enroll. The market really favors large firms as

large firms concentrate control. They begin to set roads. high barriers to entry sideline smaller players somemes and also emerging economies capabilities

only advance incremental when it comes to AI there are still persistent errors in complex tasks and investor enthusiasm push after repeated over promise access to digital technology widens but

unevenly so digital divides that we already see today become deeper Um and activists and NOS's might build parallel networks like document harm advocate for those who are excluded but

have only limited reach &gt;&gt; and digital governance is still negot negotiate globally but the enforcement can be rather weak and practice diverges from rhetoric. So summing up with the

first scenario, everyday life runs on weekly regulated AI access widens unevenly. Innovation plateaus and public opinion stays unpolar described the erosion of the status quo.

Um so bear with me on that. So by 2035, digital stack powers daily life. Productivity rises, but so does unemployment. &gt;&gt; Reliability has slipped and confidence

in technologies in AI erodess due to cyber attacks and disinformation. &gt;&gt; So this also leads to transactions being done analog again and in person. PayPal receipts, face to face validation,

physical fees. It's not about nostalgia but it's really about risk management and then geopolitical tensions also identify global cooperation fates crossber data flows are limited that

also limit the use of AI and while digital solutions solve problems they also create new ones. So for example, we have satellite collisions that threaten the

infrastructure and the extraction of minerals accelerates biodiversity loss. Privacy, free expression and access to information steadily decay. Civic space erodess. NOS's and activists only have

minimal reach. Grassroots movements attempt to provide more digital rights, but communitydriven alternatives like regional and global reach or stability. So again summing up

digital tech is everywhere but unreliable automation cuts job uh online spaces are flooded with hs and fakes and people use analog methods for sensitive items.

Scenario three this is really about discipline and about quite a lot of regulation. So we have very very strict um guard rates by governments in place in 2025.

The civil society rebalances power curving dominant platform and the aim is to be really pragmatic to protect society and keep innovation purposeful. Something is not working anymore.

Um yeah so we have stable reliable digital services but access is gated and only few government aligned firm dominate data compute and talent

and we have very highly capable AI models with narrow focus that boost productivity and reduce human oversight. Unemployment is still rising and it leads to a public backlash.

With all this inclusion, all the regulation also gray markets are bred where cheaper, less safe AI spread and cyber crime actually rises. The digital governance shifts to

treaties and alliances where security as a glue, transparency, accountability and safety are decisive for any kind of regulation. And then again summing up by 2035 a

security first state regulated physical order runs on certified platforms and strict licensing. Narrow but powerful AI boosts productivity. ID state paral is a shame and traceability are global norms.

Rights are retrained collectively and privacy is traded against state security. Coming to the fourth scenario, this might be the most different one and it's

all about reclaiming the common. So there we emerge from crisis into civic momentum. Communities actually leave digital developments as well as digital uh policy. Digital tech becomes

a tool for sustainability. Participation deepens and productivity rises. Poverty falls. Here they provide again clear guard rates but the norms and all of the rules and regulations are really

co-shaped by companies, communities and the civil society. We also have strong competition authorities to keep markets open so innovation and healthy digital ecosystems can strivememes

also are part of the digital economy. So these centralized monopolies give way for decentralized communityowned networks, co-ops and digital comments flourish. Big tech shifts from pure

profit to partnership and then technological entry barriers also fall. We have a lot of open open digital infrastructure based on open source. This leads to lowcost

highquality opensource AI solutions that empower again individuals as well as governance institutions. Digital governance is really co-created. We have companies, civil society, academia and

engineers design rules anchored in human rights. So summing up by 2035, civic power really reshapes digital life. government supply guard railways while multistakeholder bodies enforce digital

rights. Decentralized communityowned networks and open digital infrastructure empowermemes services and public institutions. Sectoral AI lifts productivity and quality of life with

human- centered oversight preventing harms and sustaining trust. All right. And I really hope this again all of these different scenarios highlighted that there are different futures that we

can think differently but that really decisions we make today already decide where we will go which which of these futures we may favor or may not. And so that to you

So sorry for the short break. Um thank you so much for sharing this scenario a lot. I think it visualized very very well what is at stake and uh again I saw a variety of reactions on it in the

panel. So it is provocative in a way but like L said I think it's it's really a good way to start how to anticipate better and uh what we're doing right now is um going over to our other panelists

sharing their perspectives on how they anticipate the the discussed challenges already. Um I'm starting with my colleague from the German federal brain office Rafael Lena who works at the data

and AI lab of the ministry. Uh Rafael is a data scientist and senior AI expert at the German FFO where he is responsible for leveraging in AI in support of international administration as well as

multilateral cooperation and negotiation. Your portfolio spends from developing great prototypes to rolling out the applications to the ministry and its users and you're also advising on

current trends in AI development. Um yes, your team is really one of the engine of digital transformation within the administration that bridges the gap somehow between technology and in our

case diplomatic work. Um my first question to you would be from your experience working from the lab, what are the most critical literacy gaps you perceive um you encounter um with our

colleagues when you introduce them to data and AIdriven tools and do you think that your or our work empowers them a little bit how to move beyond rather reactive um approach? What would you

say? Uh thanks Sebastian. Um yeah so I think when we talk about digital literacy, data literacy, AI, AI literacy um we usually have two ideas in mind of why we want to do this with our

colleagues. One is um of course we want them to use these technologies and to leverage them because we think they're really transformational in the way that we work that all of us work.

&gt;&gt; But also of course they are an important topic that our colleagues all around the world are are talking about and it comes up in in basically every discussion they are

having. So we want them to have an understanding about the technology about their capabilities and I think for some time those two have been viewed as as rather separate from

each other. one more an IT topic, right? Just roll out the tools that they need and then make them use them. And the other one more is a I don't know more um political topic maybe. But I think or

from our experience those two are going very close together or they need to go very closely together because I think um just using tools without understanding the wider uh repercussions they may have

the the kind of um even history or or or um stories that are associated with the technology um can lead to some risk. on the other side just talking about technology um without having used them

and uh you know our colleagues having made their own experiences um I think also doesn't work and what we I think the most important thing especially when it comes to AI right now

is um we try to make our colleagues curious about it and about trying it out trying it out in a safe and responsible way but really um you know trying to get some creativity out of

them of of what they can do with it because again going back to the past I think the way they were introduced to tools was usually they had a very very detailed

instruction manual that told them where to click for each step where to click that's what you have to do um and I think we all know that doesn't work with AI requires us to u to really explore

and to um to try things out ourselves see it work but also see it fail a of times to get um to get an experience of what's possible and what's not possible. And I think both of that is important

and um the way we do that is not by telling them in in extensive presentations but by making them curious and and trying uh to get them to explore it.

&gt;&gt; Yeah, thank you so much. And I think what you also very well described is like this is some like huge organizational change that we're perceiving. I mean

there of course you talk a lot about how organizations change but you can see how directly affected even our colleagues inside organization like a ministry are affected by the change. You really have

to explain in some kind of broader narrative that &gt;&gt; on a broader perspective. This also brings me to our next point that which

is interesting regarding also the scenarios at large described a little bit has to be reallyed in some kind of diversity as effect of societal impact as well to a certain degree they're also

reflected in what's going on in industry in a way even though of course sometimes it's rather like um more frame anyway um this also brings me to my next guest from the institute Nice to have you here

as well. The API institute is a leading research institution that is dedicated to bridge the gap between technology and society and you have done intensive work of specifically data stewardship and

reimagining how data can be gathered in the public interest particularly in global majority countries. So after is the co-founder of the ABI institute and you have 15 years of public policy and

strategy consulting experience with a focus on use of technology for welfare. You work um on participative governance of data digital public infrastructure and you are a member of the world

economic forum on data equity. So from from your perspective, how can we ensure that the more societal aspects of future literacy really get into these kind of decision making process from like

institutions that are rather close so that it doesn't remain a tool for sleep decision making but actually incorporating different economic and social realities to build more equitable

AI &gt;&gt; policies. Thank you so much for having me and thank you for that question. Um I think for from the perspective of our work,

what we've been doing as um an organization is trying to work with um policy makers to help them understand the value of data because I think that what a lot of governments uh

particularly outside the capitals like as we go away from that don't necessarily understand is you know what how can how do governments extract value from this data to make better policy

decisions. there's a lot of like um you know questions around uh the government data is siloed uh it is not usable sometimes there's like over correction sometimes there's undercorrection and I

think that for even reasonable uh future thinking um the data sets which exist in government in abundance are not necessarily being um being useful for those

Um and anybody in the context of India has been to a government office realize that you know there a dashboard and that dashboard has like you know gaps there's quality issues sometimes like you know

I've heard of stories the data collected in the field so how do we I think pipeline has been a core of what we do and not just from like the function of

the government in the offices that we see but also all the frontline workers which I think should I know this is about policy makers and diplomats but given the way that the quote unquote

like digital policy systems are evolving I think we need to broaden that uh much more to include people like you know frontline workers who are are you know health workers um nutrition workers

teachers they have all become data uh generators and data enablers and you know they we do a lot of work because so much of the government is now being digitalized. So how do we also get them

to be part of these like literacy ecosystem to understand that there is value in the work that they're doing. So because we get a lot of questions like I have to register then I have to

application what is there for me? So how do we sort of get them to be aligned to the fact that there is there's an incentive to collect the data to help them see all the different features and

I really obviously enjoy your scenario four which is that that core design needs to be embedded right now so that we can get to scenario four right which is obviously seeming utopic right now

but if we do the future literacy if we align incentives if we communicate value from the bottom all the way up then I think that there is something to be said about that coin common approach which I

think is a is a state that we should all strive towards even if we sort of like meander off in the middle but I think that's where we should be heading um and I think code design is a really really

critical part of that &gt;&gt; thank you so much um and now we will hand over to um Dr. Roasha who's the founder and director of the digital future lab to running out our panel for

the first round of interventions. You're a political scientist and policy leader focused on building accountable and inclusive AI governance. She's also like I already said the founder and director

of the digital futures lab um a research and foresight studio that builds empirical evidence shapes political narratives and designs governance and policy frameworks to ensure emerging

technology serves the public interest. Marsh, your work also serves at a as a critical reminder since technology is never neutral and we already touched a little bit upon that and so as I

understood like preparing a little bit that the future step is really dedicated to redirect these innovation priorities to more equitable and uh sustainable digital future. So something that LA has

also already mentioned in his scenarios. So my question for you would be well a lot of like many national AI strategies for example focus exclusively more economic models like GDP growth and

compute power is all the talk right now especially on the AI summit. How does your literacy help us anticipate social friction and impact on human agency that these kind of approaches sometimes miss?

Thanks Sebastian and thanks for having me on this panel. uh we've been doing this foresight work for nearly a decade now and I feel like we've been kind of shouting at the margin saying like hey

it's really important to build foresight into policy making practice and uh often with this cause on death years was a bit of a turning point in that regard where I think it became much more widely

acknowledged that foresight is important and the policy making so all that to say I really appreciate and welcome the work that you all are doing in this space and and you know thank you for um having

having a discussion at the summit on the importance of foresight. Um I think maybe try and outline maybe three or four key ways in which I think teachers uh literacy can help unpack or identify

the social frictions that you you talked about. One of the things that foresight work does really well I think is help shows us the early signs of change which are not yet quantifiable which are not

yet metricizable and so therefore may not make its way into an economic model right because you can't count it um so to give you an example some of the impacts that we now see that the AI

industry is having on climate right this conversation is not new it's been happening for nearly a decade but it was really at the margin Right? The kind of periphery we saw these early signs of

change. Had we paid attention to these early signs of change then we may not have been where we are today where we're now like oh we built these massive infrastructure but we're on this you

know this uh on this on this course of building bigger and bigger infrastructure. So what do we do about this kind of question? Um I think the second thing that futures future does

very well is that it helps us systematically think about the second and third order consequences of actions that we might take today including some of the unintended consequences. So you

know we can assume that everyone has the same intentions and assume that for a second like hold that thought that everyone has the best inventions and you know we are designing technology in the

public interest etc etc but very often that will have a second order implication in terms of a structural impact or a second order implication in in a sector that is completely different

or a whole set of unintended consequences. And so futures future allows us to kind of anticipate that early on and to avoid the kind of harmful policy and technology lock in um

that where we find ourselves today. I think when you look at a lot of what is happening in the in the AI space um I think the third third thing that can do in terms of unpacking the social fiction

opens up the conversation about policy to a non-expert audience. Um very often I think folks who don't work in the space of policy you I cannot enter this space there's too much jargon the u

there's there's a lot of technical language I'm just not qualified to talk talk in this space um but actually what digital literacy does is that it puts real value on people lived experience

people's lived experience of technology lived experience of what the infrastructure around them mean for them and allows them to participate in this I think By doing that, by giving the space

for people's lived experience to uh be elevated to a public policy conversation, we again find those spaces. We we get insight into where that social fiction, right? Which we may

not otherwise to use kind of only top down or very economist model. And maybe a fourth one and I'll stop there is that you know zooming out a little bit when you look at the way economists approach

the world. Uh there's action that we're all rational beings that we are uh we are all uh you know that we make rational decisions about costs and benefits and that we are all um we all

trying to maximize our own self and maximize profit and it's very individual of the world but in reality I think we know that we're not what rationality is socially constructed it looks very

different depending if you're sitting in Delhi if you're sitting in London uh and people optim So many other things apply to self right and so I think literacy allows us in some sense to bring these

different world view bring these different line of presumptions bring this culture nuances cultural context into um so I think it's a really really

important role and I would be delighted to see many many more governments actually incorporating into their kind of publication Thank you so much. And I think this

video is also rounding up again where we like initially thought about the question because specifically when we see about like um public like digital governance digital transformation in our

respective institutions. um machine then I feel like this more effective approach how to perceive these developments really helps also to build a bridge for example to what said that you somehow

have to connect with basically working on with the technology but to make them more open towards the people working in in your respective units and institutions so right now of course I do

have some some follow-up questions for you but I would also give the floor to the audience and also for you if you want to react to your respective comments a little bit Um, so the the

floor is yours if I have any questions from the audience. Maybe you have another microphone and if not I can also walk around. That would be nice. And maybe would be great if you introduce

yourself shortly and uh ask a question then. Uh hi, I'm Shiran. I'm uh doing my studies in international innovations at university uh just a few kilometers from

here. Uh my question about uh taking from foreign and policy. I need to put uh all of you on the spot here. But I think just yesterday the wall street reported that um in the operation that

it was like the previous operation in Venezuela um the Trump administration consulted flaw for decision making. So I I wanted to uh know your thoughts on uh when we're looking at sort of the future

literacy course for policy makers uh do you think that it's more of a a top down approach uh that we're taking or are we looking at a more of bottom up approach where or like a a more corporate sideish

approach that that really puts AI at the heart of policy. Maybe I can start I can't really comment like individual use of what what AI technologies um

governments consult with. Of course, you're right that AI right now is in this crazy um development where people think that it's going to be like a winner takes all

economy and that's why people are betting crazy amounts of money on these labs and spending incredible amounts of money which of course means that um like most countries in the world can't even

even compete with the amounts that for example the makeup of flaw can spend on AI development and that is one of the the key issues to tackle. I

think that's going to be one of the themes of this summit at least from from a lot of the the sessions I have seen is to to look at what what we can do about this right how can

um AI be developed by more than three or four big corporations in the world I don't think there's an easy answer to that to be honest because it is incredibly

heavy on compute on data all of that costs so much money. Um but yeah, I do think that is that is a challenge for um for policy makers all around the world uh to tackle. I think there are some

approaches that have been put forward. Um we have seen some very impressive opensource initiatives. Um I'm I hope and we're we're building on a lot of open source technologies as well. Um I

hope that these become even more successful than than they are. Okay, I see there's many other questions. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I have a

&gt;&gt; sure. Okay, go for it. &gt;&gt; Hi, I'm Rea and I'm from International Institute of Management. Quite a few students of IHM have come with me. Can you all please raise your hands?

&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, we all together have a question. So when it comes to future literacy, what it actually means for diplomats and policy makers like is it about anticipating risk or understanding

technologies or it is something really deeper and which what is the blind spot uh is there which blind spot you feel is still there when it comes to emerging technology in decision making.

Future literacy is uh it can help policy makers anticipate risk. Yes. Uh it can help policy makers do on many different system might be an emergency. We don't know what they mean

in their part. Uh but it can also help policy makers uh think about what are the alternative research that they might want. what are the kind of alternative project changes that we might uh pursue

that are different from where we are today. So in some sense it therefore helps policy makers avoid a kind of deterministic view of how uh our society is going to unfold and gives them space

to also exert their agency in steering the the path of um um of steering innovation. the first part of your question &gt;&gt; from the panel

then you hi I'm also with my question goes to a little bit of a difficulty when you

mention you know we're still having silos there's so much data it's not working together &gt;&gt; not I wanted to point any or whatever in 2011 2012

when we had those child he was like shocked by the amount of data that had to be gathered for um for observations and analysis and I find it interesting.
