## 📝 Transcript

people which is actually made by AI uh and this is made by some very young creators from Jaipur. We gave them a challenge and this is the video that

they have put together for the Janai uh challenge. Uh so can we play the video please? Can we have the Can we have the video? &gt;&gt; Once a simple spinning wheel [music]

gave India strength. It turned thread into freedom. [music] Today, another wheel is turning. Romesh stands in his field. He does not

guess anymore. He listens. [music] And in that small voice, he finds certainty. Sitta has always cared for everyone. Now something cares for her.

Not [music] loudly, just gently. Angelie dreams big. [music] She does not leave her village. She grows with it.

Knowledge travels voice to voice, home to home. Change does not always roar. Sometimes

it glows. The spinning wheel once made us self-reliant. This digital chalker can do it again. &gt;&gt; [music]

&gt;&gt; This is John AI. Let every village shine. Join the movement. [applause] That is what is driving all of us at Jun

AI. This is an initiative under the head foundation. In fact delighted to say that we have more than 100 collaboration partners. 30 of them are present in our pavilion. Uh all of us here are partners

uh to the Janai uh movement. Before I uh launch into the uh uh the panel discussion, I want to again share another very interesting thing that we've been doing over the last uh few

months. We said into the India AI summit, we must bring the youth of voices. The three key D's that the country faces are data of course on digital rails and demographic dividend.

We said if the voices of youth especially from rural India are not heard at the summit uh then we're missing out a huge uh component of this ecosystem that is to take Janai into the

villages. So in the last uh 3 months we have actually conducted across about 20 states uh 3,000 rural youth that we went and asked what do you think about AI? What are you using it for? What are what

are your fears? What are your apprehensions? What are the opportunities? And we are glad to release the Ugraph. We calling it the youth growth, resilience, aspirations

and future readiness index. We're releasing the Ugraph report today. Uh this captures AI adoption and awareness and acceleration in rural India. Some fascinating insights that 55% of the

youth that we spoke, 91% were aware of AI, 55% are daily users, right? and 17% only said we don't we use it very occasionally but there are lots of fears and repetitions as well so we hope that

this report will set the context uh for conversations over the next 5 days and of course much beyond so I just want to invite our panelists to share this report uh to release the report we're

also very proud to have the support of Gates Foundation uh Nudge and GXD hub along with CL educate and myati as research partners I'll invite uh Chetana and Satya chairman of CLA Educate

Chetana from the Nudge uh to join us. Uh we'll just do a quick release. Uh this will be available for download uh uh uh shortly. But if I can call it the

generation Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Uh so with that uh as I said we'll share these insights uh with you shortly. Uh uh we we'll also share QR codes where

you can download this uh just fresh off the press uh and and and we'll continue to do this. Our dream is to take it to a million youth every year uh around AI and technology and talk about technology

adoption u in in the villages. And that brings me to the panel and the conversation that we have today. How do we bridge communities to use AI in a more meaningful p fashion? Uh delighted

to have Romesh Rascar uh the legendary uh innovator from the US uh MIT Media Labs professor runs project Nanda. Uh we are collaborating to figure out how do we take the agentic AI cafes into rural

India and how can we create agents that work for all. Thank you Romesh for joining us and a huge round of applause. We have K Singh. Uh Kanta is the is the fiery uh UN women country

representative. Uh I was just thinking that uh you know we have an unfair advantage on the panel. One KA uh represents the voices of so many of million women that the the gender

diversity that you're talking about is at risk here. But thank you K for being a partner and uh we're doing some wonderful work on STEM and AI for uh girl students in the in in about three

states in India. K will talk about that. She is uh again a dear friend, a mentor who's been straddling the US India space for a long time. Former chairman of Bane India, currently adviser to Bane and has

been on several boards both public and private and the nonprofit. He's on the he's the chair for Akshai Patra the US delivery. one of the first members board members of delivery saw it all the way

grow from 200 to 11,000 crores and Shri thank you for joining us all the way from the US and we have Aneruda uh who's from digital green fascinating work uh in the field of AI and agriculture uh

spun off from the Microsoft uh research labs uh so we could have asked for a better panel giant who was supposed to join us is unable to make it uh from magic bus uh but the but let's get

started out uh uh you know uh with uh maybe I can start with uh uh you know maybe we'll start with k [laughter] &gt;&gt; which is why I picked the youth

right so so the thought is if you can just share for a few minutes two three minutes on what is the work and what is the perspective that you're saying how do we take janai to really to the people

and uh what are the what are the initial thoughts then we'll go around conversation. &gt;&gt; Thank you mad and morning colleagues and thank you colleagues for making me part

of this panel. Um how we do it is exactly how you are doing it and we discussed it. Go to people ask them what they need and what they're using how we could make them

make it better for them. I think that's just the beginning and that is exactly the problem statement that's not happening when we are designing solutions for people particularly rural

people and forget about women even rural young people are also not not featured in the design of of AI solutions and I think we have to start from there so first listen to people then design

keeping their specific needs in mind women have I'm not saying they have more or less problems but they have different problems or different issues and they get affected by any technological

solutions differently. So we need to keep in mind that of the 3,000 people that you consulted I hope 50% minimum are women &gt;&gt; not 505

&gt;&gt; wonderful so that is how you bring in the right perspectives but not just men and women there are also other categories of people disabled other marginalized

I think it has to be everyone. Third issue that we need to address here is not just design but devices that we design. How can they be more gender responsive? And the last thing is the

governance of AI. Who is managing the the ecosystem? Who is deciding the rules? Who is deciding the the the regulatory framework? Do they even think about women as a as a target community?

For example, the biases that human minds had, they are perpetuated by AI multiffold. And I'll just give you an example. Yesterday, I was reading a report by as scientists and I'll share

it with with with you on on my LinkedIn page basically saying young women in tribal areas in Jakan, in Gujarat, even in Udisa are made content that is made for the porn industry. It's so

disturbing. I can't tell you. I cried many times when I was reading it that for their earning for their livelihoods they are going through this content and have to comment on that.

&gt;&gt; Now how dehumanizing that is how cruel that is and they don't know any other way to earn money because that is where they have been groped by these sleazy companies. Sorry I'm using the word.

But this is how women have been dehumanized every on day daily basis how women are being targeted starting from trolling to all kinds of gender based violence. I

think nobody's listening to them and that's where we need to start talk to women and see how it can impact their future. How they they are going to be left out if they're not consulted now

and how again gender will be an afterthought and that's not what we can afford. We can't get into a civilized and advanced economy if we are dealing out. I'll stop.

&gt;&gt; Wonderful. Thank you Kra for as usual shining the spotlight so clearly on what we need to do. Uh let us switch to a global context. Uh Romesh you straddled many worlds and lovely to get your

thoughts on your vision for JAI and how do we really take AI to the masses. &gt;&gt; First of all congratulations on the report and I know Madan you and I have been talking about this for a very long

time on the ch AI mission. Um, and I know some of us think of this as kind of a social impact. Let's do good for the world, but I'm going to kind of flip that conversation around. Like, you

know, today when somebody graduates from MIT in Boston, you know, they want to go work for some tech industry or something. And that's because the profit margins in those companies are very

large. &gt;&gt; Uh, nobody goes and joins like a water company or a seaw wash planning company or a port company because the margins are very very small. But because of AI

if the efficiency productivity gains are increasing in coding if it's becoming 2x 3x imagine if other businesses also if they increase by 10% 20% maybe 50%. When that happens even these industries

that are not you know the most kind of you know profit positive companies will become profit positive. So my hope is that thanks to efforts like genai all the top talent will actually start

moving to these industries because they'll be more they'll be more lucrative than traditional because if you think right now the world GDP is about hundred trillion dollars

&gt;&gt; out of which only about five trillion or less is in it. &gt;&gt; So the remaining 95 trillion is what Jana is going to impact in in amazing way. So, so don't think of this just as

pure social impact, but think of this as a brand new blue ocean uh for talent to move into. And one of the projects we're working on uh with with Janaya here with project Nanda uh and my team members are

here. Chris Pe is here our president uh I think Mahesh Lambbe our scientist is here in the back. Both just came from US yesterday night with me. Um and our mission is to see how we can create uh

highly democratized AI. uh and one idea we've been working with uh know Madan and the Janai team is how can every one of us &gt;&gt; have their own micro AI the one of our

own AI agent because you don't want to become a a just a you know a slave to some masters for creating AI in some factories uh but every one of us should be creating their own AI and thanks to

DPI much of that is possible so I encourage you to go to projectnanda.org And we're also launching uh with the help of India AI mission something called Duth which is you know another

lay layer of DPI for AI agents for everybody. So just try go to digitud.org uh and also project.org. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you Romesh. And uh I

think the vision of an agent for all or multiple agents for every every citizen right imagine if 1.4 four billion or whatever even if you take a billion people how many of us have multiple

email ids all of us right I'm sure in a couple of years we'll raise our hands when I say how many of us have multiple agents right it's you already have right so I

think that is the power uh that you're talking about and it's just not a social impact it is the it is a intersection of where you can do good feel good and make good money right let us switch back to

an India context entry I will come to you subsequently uh Anuda so from from the digital green angle. You've been uh you've been at it now for several years on how do you really make a difference

to the lives of farmers. Uh it would be lovely to get your thoughts in. &gt;&gt; Thank you man and thank you getting us together for this one and reaching us here making us reach here. [laughter]

&gt;&gt; Thank you. So digital green has been in this field for helping farmers get correct advisories last 20 odd years. So in the last 20 years we have last four or five years we have been with the AI

stuff and trying to reach farmers because of the technology changes the smartphone use and everything. So we are now we have our own farmer chatbot which is called farmer.hat. It has reached out

to a million odd users and six lakhs are in India and we are working in eight states. Now couple of things which I want to point out over here. When we were designing this whole thing we

realized this is not about access to models about is more about usable and trusted decision support system for the farmer. Now that was the whole thing. We also realized the digital divide is not

the only divide. It is the divide of languages, social, economic and geography. So and what Ganda was talking about woman. So that's another whole layer to the whole issue of gender is

the whole another layer. And thirdly is also we have to think how AI can make solutions for the last mile and the last mile connectivity and that's where the game is because that's where our farmers

or people in the villages the youth in the villages are going to be and they are wanting that service. So that's what we are in the business of and interestingly in the last one 1 million

users which we have on farmer chat 45% of them are women and why they are there that's very fascinating and we have not we when we were looking and talking to them through our FGDs and things and

user research then we realized why they are there why they are the major users of farmer chat because most of the men in India in the northern belt and other belt are migrating for to work in

various NHI projects but the woman is left behind not only to take care of the cattle to the farm to the elderly in the household the children everything she's around doing it and for her to get a

advice which is on the phone although shared might be in most cases shared but to get the advice on the phone without any judgment a correct advice helps her to take decisions and which makes a

significant contributions to the family food security or family income per se. So I will stop there because maybe the next slide I will talk about other things which are

&gt;&gt; wonderful. Thank you Anuda. I think what you said is absolutely right that I think Gandhi G's vision of Survi and Antoai uh is what we should look at saying how does it reach the last man in

the line and how does it reach everybody. Uh so with that uh Shri uh coming to you two things one is of course you seeing world from the outside from the valley but you're also in the

inside. I was just reminded uh Romesh I think yesterday's Elon Musk made a interesting powerful comment saying that AI is like a supersonic tsunami. Uh we are not even aware of what's going to

hit us. Uh because models will be very very different. Business models are going to dramatically change right it's uh it's the usual hyperbol but there's a I mean we have to look at that kind of

possibilities as well. Would love to get your thoughts from both the perspectives. because you're doing a lot of work in education in India and uh and the and the worldview as well.

&gt;&gt; Sure. So let me just uh talk a little bit about the opportunities in India. So I do a lot of work as you mentioned in the education space over here and we are actually coming out with the report. I'm

a member of the board of an organization called Central Square Foundation. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And we are releasing a report day after tomorrow that actually is a survey of

12,500 households across 10 states. 500 teachers just to understand the usage of edtech and AI in low-inccome households across the country. &gt;&gt; So very specific and there may be a lot

of overlap with what you have here &gt;&gt; but I think a couple of important points that I want to bring out over here. One is that &gt;&gt; access is not an issue.

&gt;&gt; You know a lot of people think in India that we need to provide access whether it's technology or AI to low-inccome households that actually no longer the issue right now. There is a significant

actually usage of technology and interestingly there's a significant usage of education technology in low-income households in this country. The other thing that's important to

understand is that a lot of children are using AI today. And I I'll make a couple of points. You know, when we release this report, you'll see all the percentages, but they're very high

percentages in terms of the The number one edtech tool that they use is YouTube. &gt;&gt; YouTube. Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. I'm sure it's over here. In terms

of AI, the number one AI tool that they use is WhatsApp. So actually both and this is true for adult but I want to make the point about children that children today are using

AI maybe about half of them in ways that we may not even appreciate. So we sitting over here thinking that we have to give we have to provide access we have to give technology actually that's

happening today as we speak &gt;&gt; and so there are many implications that come out of this and we'll get to that but let me also make one other point which is a year ago last year Michael

Kramer who won the Nobel economics prize in 2019 came to India and did a study of the implications of using edtech and AI in this country and one of the things that's that's very

interesting in terms of the application of technology is these personalized paths for learning. So the general term is personal adaptive learning or PAL that's the term that's generally used

and these paths you can actually customize for every individual that is now the power of what we have that we can provide. So I want to Maybe two thoughts as a correlary to that to

sort of expand maybe you know broaden the lens a little bit. Number one is that every individual today you know to your point every citizen in this country has different needs.

&gt;&gt; I think we have the opportunity to figure out and customize how to address those needs in an individual manner. So when we talk about I'll give you one example there is no shortage there of

schemes of benefits the government of India or state governments provide to the citizens the citizens don't know what they are and they don't know how to access it

&gt;&gt; what if we were able to create a layer that customized it if you are let's say an individual over 60 or 65 these are schemes for senior citizens if you're a woman these are schemes that are

available for you if you're a villager and the second part I want to leave and this is to the point that K was making. I think gender representation is important across the board you know when

you look at our representation I do a lot of work in gender as well in India surprisingly wrong gender but I still do work in that but one of the things that you you it'll be shocking for you to

realize is that when you look at the corporate sector the representation of women in the corporate sector 18%. &gt;&gt; It is lower than actually most countries in the world

&gt;&gt; even ones that you may be shocked to compare ourselves to. &gt;&gt; We have to find a way to increase that. The thing that I the point that I want to make is that as we think about

economic empowerment of women, as we think about creating more entrepreneurs, there is a very strong SG movement in this country. &gt;&gt; Correct.

&gt;&gt; The biggest issue that they have is market access. &gt;&gt; They create products but they don't have market access. What if we were able to provide that through the technologies

that I have today? So I want to leave those few thoughts with you. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Thank you so much. Uh Shri u there's so much of wisdom in the room that I want to now just go there. We we

we are running I think the try and get as many voices in as possible. But just to your point, I I loved uh how the the the Bhati generation is thinking and I just want to say uh somebody told us

beautifully in Uttar Pradesh, what is the difference between Google and AI? And he said it lovely. He said Google AI, right? And I thought that's so well put

saying that it's just not information, it's it's pathways. And lastly, he says Google AI. So it's actually turned the the world is

in my phone, right? It's just not information. So what it also means is the old models that we have thought about the last 20 years uh will have to be completely reimagined, right? And

that's the opportunity that we are in. I I think the supersonic tsunami is that opportunity. It's not about technology. It's about the the intent behind using that technology. I want to bring in um

uh you know there is a fundamental layer that is just not about technology. It has to be about human creativity and in that context uh Satya I'd love to get a couple of minutes uh from you

perspectives on u on how you think you know the underlying human creativity intelligence needs to be enhanced. One of the studies I was seeing recently is

apparently for the first time in human history IQ is declining right uh the last 10 years it's always increased so somebody was saying we've reached the peak point and maybe we'll

go back to being apes and I said maybe it's not apes we'll be IP AI right so just a couple of minutes &gt;&gt; sure uh thanks madan I think uh one of the important places that I see uh the

grass root taking one village at a time work that Jana is planning to do would be actually at the uh capacity building at the grassroot level absolutely aresh &gt;&gt; right

&gt;&gt; where we move away from the ro learning the earlier uh legacy method where uh remembering uh data facts and then regurgitating the

examinations all of that can be built correct aresh &gt;&gt; and then bring the four skills that uh have been spoken about for the 21st century which is even more critical in

the context of is critical thinking creativity communication collaboration amongst the citizens I think if that can be built as a very fundamental layer in education education becomes in that

sense a little narrow termact I would call it as a citizen capacity building village upwards. I think it'll be a wonderful thing to partner with with the onset of AI and the absolute grounds up

work that you're planning to do. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Totally agree. Thank you. And you were talking about women

participation in the economic uh workforce and how do we increase that uh I just want in Chetana from uh Nudge who's doing some very interesting uh work around making sure women women's

economic empowerment using AI uh is there so it'll be good to just get a couple. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Uh thanks Madan. So uh the Naj Institute along with the GXD half

general and digital hub lead at KI University we are working on an interesting project to increase women's participation in AI and digital what that means is mainly uh three things

that I would want you to take back is women are powering AI already so how do we make it formalized like Kam also talked about a lot of people who are working behind the scenes and one of the

key areas that we are working in is to formalize that work in terms of career pathways in terms of making those work dignified. And the second is the design part of it, gender intentional design

which we are focusing on a lot of apps to make it more intentional in terms of designing it for women. What is it comfortable for them, making it safe, making it uh usable um and the third is

augmenting livelihoods where Aneruda also talked about the farmer app and in terms of how can AI augment existing livelihoods. So increasing work design and augmenting existing livelihoods

through AI is what we work on. We are looking for partners. Would be happy to chat a lot. Thanks a lot. Before I open it up for questions, I just want to bring in one more voice. Chris piece is

there. It'll be fantastic to hear from you uh Chris on uh on what you're seeing from the outside in uh as you as you see from the lens of Boston MIT to what's happening here. uh just a couple of

minutes would be very &gt;&gt; thanks and hi everyone. I think one of one of the things that is standing out to me already even from just this room is that uh as as Romesh was saying a lot

of the focus in the US is on the is on the tech side of it and we're hearing many more voices here on on the people's side of it and I think that uh the some of the critical implementations will

come from not just the tech side but when we think now we'll have like 50 apps on our phone will we have like 50 agents it's it's quite it's quite natural I think folks in this room to

think we're going to have 50 agents. One of the key things that we need to do collectively as a society is to make sure that we've got an education component how to use that. So how if

you're now in effectively it's different from using 50 apps. If you've got 50 agents that are working truly for you then we need to have an education component for general population on

leadership and management of the of that resource. If we have that then we'll compound the benefits. Thanks. &gt;&gt; Thanks a lot. Thanks a lot. Uh thank you Chris. I I just wanted to bring these

voices in for the for the for to bring the the conversation much more richer. So we'll any thoughts I mean this is a conversation. It'll be fantastic to have thoughts. If I can request you to just

keep it under a minute and if it's a comment or a question we'll take about five six of them and then come back to the panel for a for a reflection and closing conversations. Yes sir.

Right. &gt;&gt; Okay. openource. &gt;&gt; Sure. point.

&gt;&gt; We will we'll address that. We'll address that. Thank you. We'll take another one there. Yes, ma'am. Thank you. Uh before I I mean we'll come back to that but I just want to share

another just a perspective. Yes sir. I'm just saying all of us here are Janai. the question that we are bringing up I think it's the responsibility of all of us to figure out the ideal answers to

that hope so that we don't go very fast in the wrong direction I just want to say that listen we we have to collectively solve for all of this and I just wanted to make that point that if

you can step out of this room saying we have to solve it together I think the purpose of this conversation would have got achieved but we'll come back to you yes sir yes we'll come

&gt;&gt; correct &gt;&gt; exactly exactly Exactly. &gt;&gt; 100%. &gt;&gt; 100%. I think that has been the single largest challenge that we'll face. We

reinvent a lot of wheels. We'll come back to that. Yes. Yes. Sure. You only know Sure.

&gt;&gt; Got it. Got it. No, basically you're saying how do we how do we take what we have ring fence it and whatever. We'll we'll come back to that. Uh we have two more. We'll come back to you. Yes.

Correct. &gt;&gt; Yes. Wonderful. Yep. Great question. Uh we'll take three more and we'll come back. Yes. Yes. Sorry. Four more. You have

your hand. and again whatever. Sure. &gt;&gt; Language.

&gt;&gt; Okay. Okay. Interesting thought. Uh we had you and one more. Yes, please. Okay. We have Yes, ma'am. Got it. Okay. Uh, in the interest of time, okay, we'll take two last

questions. I know it's an oxymoron here. &gt;&gt; You said how to convert, &gt;&gt; right? Sure.

Okay. And one last question and we'll come back. Yes. Okay, one more comment. Yes. I mean, yeah, it'll stay the fringes. &gt;&gt; Okay, great. Okay, so we've got a bunch

of thoughts. I would suggest that yeah the way that the thoughts in the room are around responsible ethical AI the sovereign part of AI how do we build what is what makes sense for us there's

a lot of work around conversations around inclusion across uh women and uh sh we're also talking about the whole early education etc so I would suggest that if you take two minutes just to see

what is top of your mind as broad responses rather than specific things because as we said we're all figuring this out uh together and I'll come back on the collaboration at the end.

&gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. Yes. &gt;&gt; I I think u you know these are such important questions and we cannot solve them overnight. &gt;&gt; Yeah.

&gt;&gt; At the same time these questions have persisted through different technological revolution and different diffusions. Um so I think it's important to take a

um kind of a slightly longer longer term view and I was just reading through uh the report which is fascinating. I highly recommend reading through it. Um, and one of the questions was what are

you using AI tools for? And most of that for like caption creation, asking questions, but only 18% we're talking about it's actually helping them with the you know getting

new form of a library. &gt;&gt; And and I think it's you know it's very easy to start having conversation of what about now. So I will tell you a quick story. I was meeting a really

famous head of a department medicine department at a top university in the US and and she said oh I'm going to write an article in whatever nature or science about all the mistakes the LLMs are

doing when they answer questions about uh you know about health and I said don't do it &gt;&gt; I said all these things will be solved in the next year or two because you

might be complaining about but if it's a technological problem it'll get solved with technology. So don't worry about spending an article and putting your reputation out there and spending your

energy trying to tell people how the health questions are incorrect on a charged PDF of three years ago. And I think the same thing is true now. I would encourage you to get not too

focused &gt;&gt; on what's happening right now. It'll be almost like talking about the weather. There's not much you can do because there are enough forces out there

that'll go and solve those problems. But there are other issues for example you know issues that you mentioned where some of it is dehumanizing in so many ways folks are making a clear

distinction about the technology for today versus where it'll be three years from now um and uh just have a longer term perspective &gt;&gt; wonderful I think that's very

&gt;&gt; thank you once again for lack of any other knowledge I just know about women and but um I will also say other marginalized groups whosoever has been left behind I want to talk on behalf of

all of those people um three things are very important. One is uh when we are riding this wave of AI and technology and whatnot, people need to be skilled and skilled in the right manner and that

is I think most of us are making an effort towards and our our work with you in the tribal districts of three uh states is amazing. We were very um uh confused about starting that program.

But we saw girls from um where they were using AI from caution to being so confident uh from being very reluctant to being very reliant now on technology. We have seen women moving from where

they were in in their homes to moving away from to other other cities to work. So I'm saying skilling is very important. Data is absolutely critical because if you don't capture data now,

women will again be left behind. They will not be part of the data. Not just that data collection but they will not feature in that data. So they have to start featuring in that data. So that we

have enough evidence to say this is where gap is what you're talking about Shri 18% in the formal workforce in any country which is looking at five trillion economy or a 17 trillion

economy. No country can reach there unless the the the talent pool is is utilized fully and women I'm not saying more or less um I mean I know women do better job but I'm just saying I'm not

saying that whatever opportunity is a matter of opportunities if they are given right opportunities at right time they bring a different perspective and that is what

we need to count on that the world has been running on one wheel how do we bring the other wheel which can bring the balance so The third point is that and last is again leadership of women

and governance. So we need to be careful about all these things right now otherwise the the the time will be passed and we'll be doing the patchwork again like we are doing on violence now.

Technology has facilitated gender- based violence so much that's already out of control and that is so worrying that one girl drops out because of some incident 10 others drop out

&gt;&gt; and that we can't afford at this point in time. This country is too ambitious and too inspirational for the world. We cannot leave our women behind. Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Very well said. Thank you. &gt;&gt; So I'll just make a few comments. One is that um you know as you think about gender representation

it's very important by the way you should say you should not apologize for saying that women do the jobs better than men it's true &gt;&gt; I think we should all acknowledge it own

it &gt;&gt; and the thing that we have to realize is that when women are economically empowered it changes the family and it changes the community and it changes

society it is very important for us as a country. This is not just about labor force participation. It is actually about changing the country. I feel very passionate about this. But that's a

separate topic. Let me talk a little bit about education itself. I I don't disagree with the comments around sovereign AI. I don't disagree at all. I think for me the more important part is

less and I'm going to make a controversial statement over here. It's less about whether the AI is sovereign or not, but whether the tools that you use recognize the context in which

you're living and appreciate that. So I I don't disagree also about the fact that ultimately we do need sovereign AI, but anything that you interface with today has to understand the culture and

context of where you are. That I think is more important. The thing that I will say is the following, which is that we still have a long way to go to make sure that people use technology for their

needs. Whether it is somebody who's a 60-year-old woman who's never been literate, you know, we have the opportunity to now make that change, make that difference.

&gt;&gt; And we should do that. &gt;&gt; And so things like what I was talking about earlier, personalized learning paths for anything that you want, anything that you want to learn, we have

that opportunity today. And so I I would hope that we take this opportunity and I hope that for that opportunity by the way there are two things that in my mind are important. One is that we need to

create low data mobile friendly AI. So right now it is very heavy it's not easy to use &gt;&gt; and for the Indian context we need to make sure that the AI that that Indians

the way they interface is important. The second I think everyone will agree guardrails are important and making sure that you know we understand because children are now accessing you know

this. So when I was talking about children in low-inccome households using AI through WhatsApp &gt;&gt; they are accessing it. &gt;&gt; We need to make sure that they do it in

a responsible way. &gt;&gt; Not everyone may have the ability to put locks. Maybe they do. I don't know. &gt;&gt; Anyway, so those are two things in my mind that

&gt;&gt; wonderful. Thank you. a couple of minutes and &gt;&gt; yeah uh addressing the question on that uh you know we are building on sovereign so farmer chat is completely open source

so we are building on open source so everybody can use it access it and understand how we are building it first thing is that second thing I think all of us have talked about in India it has

to be for Indians it has to be for the local languages which we are talking about and mother your report talks about you know the what youth AI I what youth want from AI basically is local language

45%. &gt;&gt; And other part which is important is help with real life tasks like form schemes health access farming and all that another 22%. That's a significant

uh solution to government. So we that's a huge area where we need to provide solutioning for. &gt;&gt; To give you an example, the moment we put the government scheme on farmer

chat, &gt;&gt; yeah, &gt;&gt; our usage went up. So monthly active users and the weekly active users just took off. People started using it more

because they're trying to find which scheme to apply for and which scheme to they can be eligible for. But these are things which the AI needs to build solution for the local situation and

Coming to the issue of taking actions based on somebody talked about health actions right in farming if you take an action it's also can be suicidal you lose your crop right

&gt;&gt; so what we have done for the farming uh side of the story so we've got around 5 million queries being raised every day queries are coming in and be it pictures or be it voice or be it any different

types of typologies of queries are coming in so we also have a human reinforced human learning framework &gt;&gt; so there are aonomist agriculture scientist s at the back end looking at

those queries how the answer has been provided and making sure to tweaking it so that the next time a question on that chili crop comes then the answer is to the point right and making sure as much

as can be done so that's a whole effort that has to be made to make sure that is India specific crop specific and agroeconomic zone specific so those are efforts which are needed to be done and

making sure that the AI talks about Indians and Indians in the villages. &gt;&gt; Perfect. Thank you so much. Now, I think that was a fantastic uh summary of uh of the broader questions. I'll just end

with a couple in the I think we're running out of time. I'll come back to the collaboration part. See the whole idea of Janai is to build a collaborative around AI. Three things

are happening. One, all of us are many of us are reinventing the same wheel. We are wasting resources and we are wasting time. to other the point here is I think the window of opportunity that we have

is closing very fast if we don't act together now it'll be hard to undo things because as you said we're moving very fast in the wrong direction we can't so the idea of the collaborative

is can we build x number of people and use AI to figure out hey if you're doing this you've learned it what can I do that can build on top of that do visit us at the janai collaborative in hall

number 14 we are probably the only non-state nonprofit into the country pavilion do Come there and you will get to meet some amazing people. We have actually

chronicled stories of 12 AI superheroes from Sirohi and Raichore. Six women, six men who are doing exemplary work in all the issues we're talking about. We're releasing this tomorrow, but you'll get

to meet six of them in our stall and hear from real life stories. So with that, thank you so much. I I a huge round of applause to everybody and uh I would love to invite a dear friend Asha

Jadea Motwani to hand over the momentos uh to this panel. Asha lovely to have you in the hall with us. &gt;&gt; Yeah for free.

Oh, lovely. They've also come out with a with a image from our So, this has a photo of our panel right now. &gt;&gt; This is a fantastic power of transformation.

&gt;&gt; Thank you so much and uh wish you all the very best for the next five days. Let's truly make this conversation. &gt;&gt; Yes. So we will share the report uh if you can just share that. Uh yeah

exactly. Thank you so much.
