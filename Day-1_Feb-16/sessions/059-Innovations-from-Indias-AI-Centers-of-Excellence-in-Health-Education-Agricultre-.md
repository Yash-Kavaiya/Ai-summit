## 📝 Summary

This panel explores emerging innovations from India's AI Centres of Excellence across Health, Education, Agriculture, and Sustainable Cities. Speakers will examine practical, high-impact AI systems—spanning service delivery, decision support, and public infrastructure—that can move from pilots to large-scale deployment. The discussion will focus on measurable outcomes, data and governance foundations, and pathways for responsible adoption in government and partner ecosystems. The session will highlight examples, implementation lessons, and approaches to scaling.

## 📝 Transcript

India which is massive country 1.4 4 billion population but also understanding the field reality problem right the solutions here that you see that were selected they went

through a competitive process actually they went through a prototype process other in more than there's this go to the next slide

We want to just AI models that are good but we want to make it scale across. We basically want to be built like UPI like diger the digital that the

whole world has seen from these AI COE's have been set up as section so they can partner with with the best and the brightest and

whether it's academic they lot of flexibility in doing so grants and the educational. So these are significant grants for

these these AI centers of excellence and these innov technology. I was the founder CTO of in 2009.

I'm the managing trustee of the ego governments foundation that Nandan Nillei the then CEOs and I set up in 2003. And uh I'm also a research affiliate at

MIT. I'm really looking forward to these discussions with these experts. So let me introduce our panel of professor Rajiv Wahhuja

computational at Upsala University in Sweden but April of 2021 which hosts the agriculture AI a professor comput material at Absala

University is internationally recognized researcher who has published physical society. Nitin Sena of the school of AI and intelligence

systems and professor in the department of computer science IIT. By the way, he is the youngest recipient of the prestigious prize land

prime along with K. Basically they described an through which a number is time

in reasonable time a land and received manyell prize and footton prize and so many other award. uh he his his current work spans uh computational complexity he the energy work of the AI center of

excellence uh next we have Dr. Kitika Rangar Rajan. Hi Kitika. She's an encore. She both has an MD from as a PhD from IIT.

So we we have people the domain of we also so this is very important to us in this project

her her healthare accessible in her clinical work for cancer care with special interest in breast and neck cancer to more detail with

associ department of computer science at the Indian Institute of Technology. He's a key contributor of the AI centers of excellence in agriculture anam he

from the Indian decade computing research and education. Welcome. And we have uh he's the chief strategy officer for

the excellence in education at II Madras which is bodhan which was just launched right here at barat montapam about two three days ago. Dr. worked for TCS for 20 years in 11 countries

committee and contributed to education policy initiative in Caroline and last but not least is the chief operating officer of CO in health Indian of science in Bangalore

um previously he worked in several industry and academic research like Google research Microsoft research and at MIT in Cambridge. He has a bachelor's from Aunti Kpur and a masters from

Harvard. Welcome all our panelists panel. So we are going to you know what maybe I'll stay right here. Um a lot easier to see all of you.

Um we're going to go through these questions there. I'm trying trying to do three rounds. So I'd like panelists to keep it to two to three minutes start uh answers. Let's start with Kita.

you you work in uh the area of breast cancer detection. Yeah. PhD think uh tell us can help in addressing &gt;&gt; is this

you so uh thank you um I'll use breast cancer as examplar to sort of everyone about how we're looking at the problem so the idea over here is not to just come up with a

model which everybody does but to really try to find an end-to-end solution to a problem when we were faced with breast cancer which is the most common cancer among women in India it's also the uh

most common uh of death due to cancer uh you know you India because India is very different from the west you simply cannot offer population screening for India uh it's just not solution so we

can't a solution of the west so we first said how do we decide whom to screen. This is the first question we tried to answer. Are there any meta techniques that can tell us from detailed

questionnaires uh who needs to be screened and who does not need to be screened? At the second level, we said once this person comes for screening, do we even have the capacity to screen

these people? Uh so that's when we went into mamography AI. We try to say uh can AI actually you know say that AI plus technologist can safely say that this is normal and this doesn't need to go to a

specialist for reading. Uh so that's that's some of our work that's what we're trying to do. &gt;&gt; Great. Thank you. Thank you. So uh related to that at the ISC uh Indian

Institute of Science where the um AICO for health exists. Um see I I talked about it's not just about creating amazing AI models for our IITs and you know as specialists and so on can do

will it actually be deployed across the country? Will the poorest Indian in the smallest get access to this? Now India we have done this with DPI and so on with Adar

and UPI. So Rahul the question to you because you're working on technology tell us a little bit about the scalable AI DPI platform that IAS is building to ensure that these solutions scale

throughout the country. &gt;&gt; Sure. Yeah. So when we talk scalable AI API effectively what we are asking is how do these AI health solutions some of which

already exist different companies organizations are working on them how do they just these uh isolated but actually reach the 1.4 So uh think of it what we are trying to

build in the platform as a standard space with all its checks and balances AI infrastructure which then can serve uh models to redo all the work of uh building a deployment stack and so on.

But if some stack and so on. But if something has to certain certain have to be true. So first we have that uh whatever we

build it's uh built with domain agnostics and is modular. And what why is that? Because health care is not one problem. It's health care is not one problem.

It's got uh it's got non-communicable diseases, infectious diseases, geriatrics, mental health and mental health and so on. And all of these have very workflows. Anyone in healthcare

knows that and for each of so what we need some kind of unified core So what we need some kind of unified code can then host

risk prediction and having to replicate. very important is these models have to be able to uh in very kind of also touching. It is

I mean the happens on the road is digging the road. because of just random activities people do in India. So

different so it's but the valid is pretty good. So the health score actually helps uh yeah these are the the other side generation. So there also

example there are solar there is renewable energy there is nonrenewable energy there is coal so if there are now in India solar is growing so I think 40% of generated

through solar there is also wind on the western uh part of India so these three how do you circulate the according smart not grids are required so we also

have a team in uh that works on smart grid. So battery system.

Okay. Wonderful. Thank you, Nathan. Like I was AI feeds on large amounts of magic

AI model might not have the kind of data that you all have. Whatize that data? If we can get the mics to work, we can

maybe we can get AI to work. &gt;&gt; Okay. So yeah, I mean I think anybody and anybody in this room understands the importance of data

data is very special that patient
