## 📝 Transcript

One more. Hello. Hello. There's no Go ahead. number.

Hi, good evening guys. Can you please settle down? We'll start the session. Yeah, guys, please settle down. Yes. Yeah, good evening everyone. Very warm

welcome to a panel discussion on AI meets creativity uh skilling for innovation in the intelligent economy organized by future skills prime a NASCOM and ministry of electronics

information technology digital skilling initiative in collaboration with Adobe to start the session may I now call our esteemed panelist on the stage starting with Mr. Rah dagupati

[cheering] actor producer entrepreneur and digital and creative professional Dr. Rashish Kulkarni [applause] board of directors IICT

Mr. Raji Singh Chief Business Officer and Chief Marketing Officer Make My Trip Mr. Sarange Agawal Vice President Learning and Development Cognizant and Dr. Dr. Bilashak Gore,

Chief Executive Officer, Sector Skill Council, NASCOM. And finally, I would like to invite our moderator on the stage, Miss Mala Sharma, global vice president and

general manager, student product and marketing Adobe. [applause] We are truly honored to have such an accomplished group of leaders shaping the future of creativity, technology,

and skills. May I now request Mala to lead the session. Over to you, Mala. All right, welcome everyone. Uh, it's great to have so many of you here. It's like standing room only. Thank you for

joining us. This is a really um, it's a session really close to my heart. As I was introduced, I run education globally for Adobe and we think a lot about creativity and AI and the intersection

between both of them. So, it's great to have all of you here and welcome to these amazing guests. Before we get started, um we'd like to run a quick film if we can uh that exemplifies

creativity and AI. Dinosaur. YOU ARE GOING TO say age. [groaning]

Guys, guys, guys, WHERE DID YOU GO, GUYS? Great oxidation event. Oh my god. OH MY GOD. OH MY GOD. OH MY GOD.

Oh my god. Oh my god. OH MY GOD. OH MY GOD. Ever shut up. Please, please, please, please.

I've I've got an idea. But you won't like it. [groaning and screaming] [music] &gt;&gt; Ignore them, turtles. Do not say a word

or you will die. No. No. Turtle. Don't say a word. &gt;&gt; I can't. No. No. No. No, no.

Go. GO. [screaming] [applause] What an amazing fun movie. Do we have

the creator in the audience? Sid. Hey, Sid. Woo. There's Sid. He's the He's the filmmaker. And um Sid, I have a quick question for you. Do you have a mic?

&gt;&gt; Okay, you &gt;&gt; come in front. All right. The question is, how much of this film was AI generated versus your own creativity?

&gt;&gt; Uh the idea is original. Um but pretty much 99% of it is AI. &gt;&gt; Wow. 99%. That's amazing. [applause] All right. Um, this is where I'm going to switch to you Ra.

So when you think about Sid's response there, 99% was AI generated. When you think about film making, there's a variety of steps. There's script writing, there's visual effects,

post-prouction, etc. Where do you see the impact of AI happening first or already? &gt;&gt; Well, hi guys. Good afternoon. &gt;&gt; Can you hear me?

I think the mic. &gt;&gt; No, can you hear me now? Yes, that's usually how my voice is, but but let's be decent and get a mic. Hello guys. Good afternoon. Hi Mala.

&gt;&gt; Hi. &gt;&gt; Uh well, like I think every business is is going through some kind of AI native uh process where you know the AI world is like the internet. You can't be

ignoring it in any manner. I think the film industry or the entertainment industry has been the same in some form. where pieces of work have been dramatically shifting. Where it's been

shifting greatly is in the pre-production of a film. Uh usually most of our ideas are on a page, it's written, it's pencil drawn as sketches. And every time in a creative room before

you greenlight something, everyone has an imagination that's different from the core filmmaker. But here that communication has kind of changed pretty fast where you're able to create some

part of the film or some part of the storytelling experience &gt;&gt; uh much much before you get into the original course and that's going deeper and deeper as uh few filmmakers who are

making these big impact big spectacle movies are almost being able to today watch the film even before they get on to shoot. Uh, so you want to Sorry, you're doing something with my name.

[laughter] &gt;&gt; It's still you. It's still you. It's not the AI. &gt;&gt; It's not AI yet. So, uh, so yes. So, it's taken that part of

the work uh pretty dramatically. Uh the other part that it's come into is in the visual effects world where earlier a process of getting a shot done would have been a 3day 5day affair and now

it's a 2 hour three-hour affair and and when when you for the ones who understand visual effects we work in multiple layers. So if there's a live piece that's shot there's uh multiple

layers of creation that kind of goes in. So now what's happened is there'll be one or two layers that will be worked by an artist and then the rest is being worked on in an AI process.

&gt;&gt; So it's fixing pieces of it. Uh is there a very definitive workflow today uh where everything can go AI like how Sid is doing? No, not really. &gt;&gt; Uh but uh there is pieces of the puzzle

that's being taken up. Yes. &gt;&gt; And what do you think will always remain human- centered? Well, uh, the base to anything is is storytelling. Uh, so if a creator like

Sid today made, uh, Yaposaurus in this manner, there's a certain cultural context that he understands, understands a sense of art. &gt;&gt; Uh, so your social literacy becomes much

much heavier. the understanding of stories, the understanding of your culture, of roots, uh the literacy of communication in some ways where you'll have to be very clear, very articulate.

Uh the ones that are clearer with the idea will be able to use AI in a in a format that's better. Uh you have to be tech literate in some ways. I mean, you know, everyone doesn't have to start

writing code, but one must understand what each AI tool offers in some ways. and and right now we're in that phase of extreme change &gt;&gt; like uh I' I've worked a couple of times

with sit and what he did few years ago into this is quite dramatically different and I think the change is happening every six months every year with products like Adobe and others

Adobe and others pushing that envelope uh forward yes &gt;&gt; that's awesome thank you I'm going to shift to you Dr. Ashish Kulkarni. Um, so Rana just talked about what remains, you

know, the human domain and what can actually AI can help from a learning standpoint and from a academic standpoint. You know, obviously the government introduced the AVGC concept

recently. You're the mastermind behind it as I learned earlier. Um how do you see learning change and what is your vision for how learning changes? &gt;&gt; Well the thing is that uh India when we

did the first education policy we were we didn't take uh creative arts performing arts design sports into our consideration. They were always extracurricular activities and a lot of

us got bashing when we wanted to tell that we want to make films and we want to make a career as a singer and all but now it's uh it's changed we uh in the last two and a half decades uh when uh I

had coined this word AVGC uh we had to do a lot of education to the government to the parents and to the uh the schools and universities uh to really allow kids to have a level

playing field with science and commerce. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; Uh today you are at a different pedestal because of uh the national education policy

&gt;&gt; and which allows kids to take uh creative arts, performing arts, design and sports from the sixth grade onwards. So we have now broken it up into three segments. Sixth uh seventh and eighth is

the foundational segment and then ninth and 10th is uh consolidation and then you have the professional uh you know where you actually prepare to go to the university and a lot of people

mistakenly thought that you know learning uh computers is learning learning animation. people thought that they uh they would teach gaming and uh visual effects and animation in the

school. uh you know so the my question to them was like u uh you don't teach engineering and medical and law in the school you know you do the foundational education

&gt;&gt; so that you have physics chemistry mathematics to go to engineering and physics chemistry biology to go to medical and that's how we have now structured the program uh through IICT

and we are now going to implement that this budget has seen that we got a mandate to do that in 15,000 schools and 500 uh institutes And that's a good beginning. But what's

important that I I want to tell you in the creative education you know what comes out of AI today a lot of people in excitement think that oh wow what a what a difference and they

forget about the grammar of storytelling &gt;&gt; the foundational skills have to be still taught because you need to know what lens was the best what composition was the best whether there is a continuity

we have some legendary you know camera people in our We also have legendary uh editors. &gt;&gt; Some of it I believe would not go the editing will have to be in the control

of the directors because what sequencing and how you want to really tell your story is very critical. Second thing is that as we design the curriculums, we realize that the the foundational skills

are one. &gt;&gt; The technical skills are the the layer in between people have to learn different softwares like we work with a series of softwares which you know you

guys give it to us and you do different versions year on year. The the challenge now is that when you do the curriculum uh it's so happening that from the semester 3 onwards after the

foundational layer the curriculum has to change every single semester that you go to because there are new new tools coming through AI and the ways of film making getting introduced. So you need

to really see and like Rana said that presently we are using it as uh as one of our things if we had 10 people to whom we give a brief for character design and story writing we

will give the the similar briefs to uh AI as well &gt;&gt; and then we will see uh what to pick what not to pick and it's actually giving us a great perspective uh to

actually do the pre-production previsualization But as we move forward uh ideation to script to screen every single aspect is getting affected and we will have to

really make sure that we uh while teaching foundational skills we constantly look at the new technology doing a lot of other things for us &gt;&gt; and how do we really enhance the

storytelling uh aspect emotional intelligence and behavioral intelligence is more important for a storyteller Apart from AI itself &gt;&gt; because storyteller is binding you with

the emotions from the very first frame director and actors show you &gt;&gt; and then you are connected and connected with the film actively or passively with the power of your emotions

&gt;&gt; and in the social media it is with the behavioral intelligence. So along with artificial intelligence the creative industry actually is mixing up and that's why we are calling in ICT it as

the school of emerging intelligence &gt;&gt; so that we actually consider all the three when we actually design stories or an experience for our audience. &gt;&gt; That's awesome. So some tension in the

questions now Rana you didn't go to school for film and you know uh Dr. Avin Ash is talking about the um sorry Ashish is talking about the importance of learning in a structured way. Um what

are your thoughts on that? &gt;&gt; Is it important to go to school or can you just teach yourself? &gt;&gt; Uh see one I mean just talking for where the Indian entertainment industry is

over 98% of us have never gotten formal education in any entertainment medium. Uh it's always been hands-on on the job. we've trained for some time and you keep getting better at it as you keep doing

it and uh that's always it's always I guess cinema or entertainment was the first gig economy in some ways where a lot of people come together for a very specific task get something done and

kind of leave uh would we want formal education yes of course we just never had it all these years uh it's unlike uh there were one or two film institutes in Pune in Chennai which were very popular

for for a season. But it's not like a filmmaker getting out of there is coming with a certain skill into the movie industry. That never uh the business and the education never spoke in any manner.

&gt;&gt; Uh but with technology with using visual effects, animation, all of that is been the most structured part of the entertainment business once that came into play.

uh there's definitely a bunch of things that he spoke about uh Asher which was the base of it will still continue to be story so understanding how to be able to tell a story the basics of storytelling

I mean whether just not for film today whether it's a brand whether it's a company whether it's a nation it's all a story it's unless you're able to construct that story right uh your

product or what you're trying to sell is not going to reach the intended audience &gt;&gt; so I think that base becomes important and one thing that wasn't touched upon was ownership because that's going to

change pretty dramatically. Uh earlier big studios were the only ones that could develop big IP, big universe and stuff like that. But today it's in the hands of independent artists.

&gt;&gt; So that base of ideiation is &gt;&gt; is what needs to be taught. But it's a it's almost like like I can I call myself an aged millennial in some ways &gt;&gt; where the early part of school that

wasn't uh a skill to have that was not uh credited for knowing that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. It was great if you got 100 in math. Uh but you but what you got in art class was never credited in that similar

system. Uh so I just feel like this is a a diff like the intelligent economy is pretty different now. uh that construct of repeatability is gone. It's ultimately it's the differentiator will

be the ones who are building IP on these tools or the ones just using that those tools. So I think that becomes the serious differentiator and &gt;&gt; uh it's great that it's going through

schools and especially in a country like India it's &gt;&gt; uh to adopt it in a large scale I think that's the only way it's done. &gt;&gt; Thank you

&gt;&gt; Mala. Just to add to that the issue is there are two issues that we have &gt;&gt; for higher education there's a dictat from the UGC that &gt;&gt; the the teach the faculty teaching the

undergrad have to be masters &gt;&gt; and the faculty teaching masters have to be PhDs we have none in our industry &gt;&gt; right [laughter] &gt;&gt; so we uh we went back to the government

and got something done called professor of practice &gt;&gt; so people who have not gone to school but can still make great films and can handle camera tell stories. I do acting

they can come and teach. &gt;&gt; I can be a professor of that. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Second &gt;&gt; professor Rana. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Second second important thing in

the structure of the UGC and AICT is that most of our students cannot write a three-hour written exam at the end of the semester. They would fail. So we need to actually if we have to give them

a question paper on editing or acting, it's not going to work. So we need to assess them on a continuous basis &gt;&gt; on a practical. So these are the two distinctions that we had to bring in

while we actually doing the creative education. &gt;&gt; Yeah. No, I love that and thank you for being so practical. Shifting gears to industry, you talked about brands and

how brands need to sort of you know build build their own voice. Um shifting to make my trip and uh obviously a very different industry travel. Can you say a little bit about Rishi um what is what

has AI done for your brand and your company's brand and how is it sort of changing the business model for you? &gt;&gt; Sure. Um so Mal just pick up from what what God said what Rana said and even uh

Asha said that that see the core the core of the core of brand building or the core of even selling is actually storytelling. uh and and and just I I found it very interesting to say that

today you can't teach marketing in a in a B school. Whatever I learned 20 years back going to a B school if I implement it now now it's designed to fail. Uh and and and

theoretically I mean 20 years back if I mean when mass media was not as prevalent how would you tell how would you sell a destination to a friend? You would say you go to Goa because it's

great for you. It's your vibe. You'll have fun. It's the kind of place you want to go. And then you'll end up thinking, "Oh yeah, my friends told me he knows me. He thinks I'll have fun in

Goa." Then came like this mass platform of content distribution where you said mass destinations. Oh, Goa is good for everyone. And everyone ended up going to Goa and saying okay, yeah, must be good

if everyone is saying it's good, right? And the storytelling became more like a platform storytelling that I'm selling myself on a platform. Today I think what AI has done is again got us to a place

where we can hyperpersonalize where I can tell you Mala Goa is great for you because you like the temples of Goa or Rana Goa is great for you because you'll find some great locals to locals to

shoot your next next scene. So I think what AI has done for us, it has given us this ability right now to talk to our consumers one-on-one, hyperpersonalize content for them and have a conversation

instead of selling our story. And and conversations always work better than standing at a podium and shorting your and shorting out your brand message. So I think

so when when we started hearing like 3 years back 2023 that that there's something called a large learning map uh an LLM which can which can comprehend better for you. We got extremely excited

uh we sit on 20 years of u so we think about ourselves at least internally as a data company that we have 20 years of data of 50 million Indians uh who have traveled who have served in us. So we

have we can we have a comprehensive knowledge back on them but we didn't know much to do with know do about it other than just sending out notification that I the summers have come here's a

great sale for you uh so we got very keen on saying that okay with this technology can can we do something better for a consumer uh can we have conversations can we think about

hyperpersonalizing like doing hyperpersonalization not for for the sake of saying it but for telling that story much better &gt;&gt; and also

Indians are kind of contributing hugely to the travel economy of the world. A lot of Indians now travel abroad. 30% of times we we go to a country for the first time. So there's lot of cognitive

load when you plan travel. So you you're actually in a happy space. You want to go for your summer break but you're also thinking yeah me I've never been here. So how would it be? How would the

airport be? How would the visa be? How would do I need forex? uh if I'm going like I was telling you that if if if Indian plans to go to SFO for the first time has not taken a direct flight they

think okay what would happen at the London airport when I'm changing do I have to change terminals with my bag baggage get auto checked in so what it also did was that we we always knew some

friction points that that our app is not able to solve and we thought okay why not then build a conversation flow that wherever the app is breaking supposing you want to ask this question but you

are not able to ask this question we open up our chatbot which is called Myra and help you solve those questions and learn as well. So it's a constant um like it's a constant learning exercise.

The more we are opening up Myra, the more we understanding from our consumers, the more we are trying to solve for frictions in their journey. So it's been an interesting journey and I

dare say it's the start of it. I mean we are in in no way we understand the end state right now. But we are very excited, very curious of of of using AI, machine learning, generative AI in our

platform to to solve for the consumer. I think the first principle that we have kept for ourself is that don't do it for the sake of doing. If you aren't solving a problem then don't then then don't do

it. &gt;&gt; Makes sense. And is there room for a chatbot in film making? Rana &gt;&gt; can you imagine have an agentic collaborator helping you with the film

making process? &gt;&gt; Well uh just not the film making process. I think what's AI doing right? I'm saying there's a bunch of decisions you have to make in the course of your

day. Whatever field you're in. uh you have somebody right now in a physical world that's taking meeting notes that's uh sending it to different team members. So I think everyone will have an agent

in some ways. Uh I think the shift now is coming into using AI as a tool from using it as a person or an agent in some ways where whatever skills that I have or whatever tasks that I need to

complete. There will be some very definitive human tasks &gt;&gt; and the rest of it there will be some kind of AI process aiding that uh that to happen.

&gt;&gt; Uh so I think that that should uh it'll definitely lead into everybody. I don't know if it's a chatbot, but it's a it's a task bot in some ways. &gt;&gt; Right. Right. Right. And a a task bot is

great because people who chat, we know what happens with them. &gt;&gt; Yapposaurus. So &gt;&gt; I saw the [laughter] film. Yes. &gt;&gt; Yeah. All right. Um back to you uh Dr.

Ashish. Um to make learning real and meaningful for AVGC. Uh what role can a company like Adobe play? Like how can we be helpful in the process?

Well, the the thing is that u you know one of the key things that we realize in India is that uh you know when I work with uh say Telangana or or Tamil Nadu artist uh many of them who

have extremely great foundational skills uh who have done who has been who have been sculptors for example and I can tell you you know when I was in advertising before I got into animation

27 7 years ago I used to deal with these painters who used to draw Rajnik Kant and uh you know Kamill Hassan sir and Rajni sir 40 50 ft and they didn't require additional

&gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; prints uh all of a sudden I realized that they lost job and I got 72 of them to my studio &gt;&gt; and they are now working with Disney and

DreamWorks and all they they done fabulously well &gt;&gt; um so much so uh we brought in artists from Krishna Nagar in Bengal, Mahabali Puram

sculptures to Chanapata in Karnataka. Now what's happening is that most of the softwares that are there, they're all in English &gt;&gt; and you know I I know you give uh

Japanese and Korean to the small population there but why don't you give it to many of these uh languages where artists are amazingly well. Of course, we had to have the regional uh you know

uh language uh uh leaders to train them when it comes to software because their foundational skills are from their fathers and uncles and uh you know their sisters and mothers. They are the ones

who have taught them in the childhood. So I I think some of these are extremely important that we teach them in their language so that they can pick it up from there. Second is and it's not

difficult in the AI world today. &gt;&gt; Uh second thing is that you know when these kind of programs like other tinkling tinkering labs and uh the other forms are there you know with the

schools we need to really sensitize and probably ICT and Adobe needs to work together to go to uh the uh the school boards. &gt;&gt; Mhm. because we have been able to go to

the central boards as of today after NEP and we are implemented that in 4,000 schools trained about 43,000 teachers. So the train the trainer program is somewhere we would love Adobe to partner

with us so that we can actually do it at a large scale because if we have to implement it for 34,000 kids and we are saying that you know even if they don't take it as main subjects

creativity and design and critical thinking and lateral thinking are the foundational skills and thereafter actually taking them to the next level is very important whether you become

engineer, doctor, anything if you are a if you have your design thinking and critical thinking was taught to you, you would be a different person even and I I believe that's where Adobe uh needs to

come in uh more deeper at the same time with our new programs that we are doing with the schools. uh I think foundational skills are best taught on your softwares because uh you know when

world was talking about uh handdrawn 2D and the flash came in with micromedia which was a further taken by Adobe &gt;&gt; uh we discovered that it was made for web design but we used it for animation

&gt;&gt; and today it has become a very important tool for animation &gt;&gt; after effects is probably one of the simplest form uh way people can start using it for anything and everything. I

think this you know simplifying the tools that you have done now needs to go further down to the school level uh with the help of our programs and we would really like to see along with

foundational skills they are using these tools so that you know there there was always something when we were learning driving you would learn it on Maruti or you learn it on Mahindra you learn it on

Hyundai so adop can actually play that role of carrying forward the tool with the learning process. &gt;&gt; That's awesome. Thank you for the

feedback and you'll be happy to know actually many of my team are here in the audience who support our schools go to market and um the train the trainer model is a very important part of what

we do obviously providing software as well. Um but talking about training sorry go ahead &gt;&gt; even train the trainers like we have signed up with Kerala government

&gt;&gt; they are not adopting NP by the way they are in opposition. Oh, &gt;&gt; but that's where we said that okay you can you have freedom of doing it from grade one.

&gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But their teachers have to be trained in malalam. &gt;&gt; So I think we need to really find a way of doing that in regional languages too.

&gt;&gt; Yes. Yeah. No thank you for the feedback and uh yes and we should follow up more about the work we're already doing and how we can do better. So thank you. Uh talking about learning and development.

I'm going to switch to you Sarange. Um you're obviously uh learning on the job right with AI changing so quickly is incredibly important. Sarange is uh responsible for learning and development

at Cognizant. Um tell us a little bit about how you're thinking of upskilling you know people already on the job. What are you doing with that? &gt;&gt; Sure my love and thank you everyone uh

for being here. See the what what AI has done basically it has shifted the conversation from how the work needs to be done which tools needs to be used to how I can add value

and I'll I'll explain this by helping you understand that visualize five or six years back if you would have come to one of the cognizant uh development flow the software development flow you would

be able to identify there are techn technical people who are working on codes. They know the practice of coding. There would be consultants who are interacting with the with the clients

and there would be you'll identify the creative people and like Ash and Rana said I've been talking about they are the creative people. So there there are distinct roles, distinct tasks, distinct

skills. Today if you go you will find developers are working on the design to create a new solution. Consultants are using AI to define a prototype and if I can say

the creative or the designer people they are using the data they are using the analytics to make decisions. &gt;&gt; So what has happened mala is the the whole

uh the definition of talent has changed. It's no more about how the work is being done and how um how skilling needs to happen for a particular role. And that was our big um I would say shift or eye

openener uh for a couple of years back that we cannot have those traditional carrier architecture which IT teams or IT companies were aware of. Uh the siloed roles. Uh we cannot talk about

how I can skill a developer, how I can skill an architect, how I can scale a designer. We need to focus on what are the core capabilities each individual needs to have for uh for developing or

doing the work which they are supposed to do and in that tools become important they always were uh but tools will continue to come they will continue to evolve what we have started realizing is

just not the tools but some of the core capability and I think foundational capability Dr. Rashish is talking about the biggest foundational capability comes in terms of problem framing. What

problems I need to solve. The second one comes actually creativity. Can I creatively solve that problem? And the third one comes from a decision making. How do I make the right decision

especially in terms of AI because you can get all kind of responses, all kind of solutions but what is the right decision right? So that's that's one big shift and the second one we realize that

creativity is no more a skill which we can train few people in a classroom rather we have to start recognizing that creativity is a foundational skills most of us will have it it's not it's not in

the domain of few people and I I'll just give you one small example last year um we did cognizant did a wipe coding hackathon and Um the our CEO Ravi said let's give all the wipe coding tools to

everybody. Let them play around with it. Let them see what they want to do. Let them imagine whatever they want to do. It's not about a client or a cognizant problem. Anything in their domain they

want to do. Let them come together. We were so happy. We won Guinness Book of World Record for the largest VIP coding event. 50,000 employees generated 30,000 working prototypes.

&gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Within one week. &gt;&gt; That's amazing. For us it was a big moment and I would say it's a mindset or a a change

management moment because we realized if given the right tool given a safe environment and it's kind of a permission to experiment creativ creativity becomes a

shared capability and that's that's the big change on how do we help people learn creativity or kind of embrace their creativity in whatever the processes they are coming

up and which makes mala biggest challenge for me or my team because learning or skilling is no more about coming in a classroom. &gt;&gt; Uh we have to I mean we have been

talking about hyperpersonalization for a long time. Um Mala you would know the flow of learning in the flow of the work has been a phrase for last 8 years or so everybody's talking about but today with

the help of AI with the help of agents we are really doing it we are working on a talent transformation uh platform and just to give you an example all of us I guess have learned in growing up through

punchandra and amaritkata stories right we all have gone through tinkles and supundis to to learn. How good it would be if today I want to learn generative AI and agentic and say I want to learn

it like a story from a punchandra or a story from a amachit kata and then the morals come in couple of years back that was like yeah it's a crazy idea you may have but you

need people who are good in storytelling you need good people who are coming from the script writing and then why would I invest so much of energy and effort today with the AI same platform same

learning you can do it. If you want a professional case study, you can do it even in a socratic learning method. You can do a storytelling method. The the key change which we are challenging

ourself is the art of possibilities with the AI. What can you do? How can you reimagine the process? &gt;&gt; Love that. Thank you so much. Uh you know, you touched on something that's

very close to our heart. We think a lot about this is the importance of communication, critical thinking, collaboration and of course creativity. And I am very hopeful that with all of

this efficiency that Genai should create, many of us who get stuck in meetings looking at data, trying to make decisions that can be pretty wrote work that that gets taken care of and how we

are spending our time is really doing what we as humans are great at which is critical thinking and collaboration and sort of getting into the arguments with each other and coming up with the right

idea. like that's what we're good at and um that's what I'm hopeful for. I'm going to shift to you uh Dr. Abhilasha. Um you've heard a lot of the conversation here about you know uh the

importance of apprenticeship learning, the importance of learning on the job. Um just the ability to problem solve in these new ways with with AI in the midst.

How do you think about the change to skilling in particular, you know, at NASCOM? That's what you do every day thinking about how to upskill uh people. How do you think this gets impacted?

&gt;&gt; I think the evolution of skill if we talk about in India and in last one decade it has been tremendous. Uh it has been really positive. So earlier what Ashish also spoke or what Rana spoke

that it was not into a formalized structured way of learning. But if I talk about today in India we have a national skill qualification framework where everything is standardized. So in

India you can say whatever you are learning it ranges from level one to level eight. So a child maybe who can learn read or write or have passed let's say class 5 is level one and it reaches

to level eight being a PhD research scholar also in that case. So I think more structure has come into skilling in the country also some of the things rather than uh I'll say answering what

my co-speakers were talking about. So one was like that how we make it more structured and acceptable. So in our days we used to have this SUPW period where we didn't know that moral science

or SUPW that why we are attending those classes. So nothing was coming to us and uh in most of the schools it was not even on the report cards also. So we didn't knew that why it was but now if

we see it is more structured into the education system. So we can say the education is what your foundation level can be your 10th 12th ITI diploma or graduation or post-graduation and

skilling becomes a separate layer which makes you more practical which brings more hands-on practical knowledge which uh you can say uh will give you a worldly view that once you'll be out how

you have to increase your employability quotient also so that is the way evolution of scaling if I talk about earlier uh around let's say 2 3 years back uh in the skilling the

qualifications or the courses used to be 400 600 hours but now later on we realized that the shelf life of skills is reduced &gt;&gt; now being an engineer being a doctor you

have studied once and you are done for your life but now that's not the case so I think every I mean if a student is learning a AI tool today he's not sure after 6 months he'll be using it or not

so the shelf life has reduced and the same effect what we See in the skilling also is rather than a 400 600 hours of courses now the learning is more stackable in microcredential or NOS what

we call so it is more of 10 hour 20our 60 hours 90 hours where you can study what you have I mean the foundation program and you can layer these micro credentials into it also lot lot of

trust has come because around 2 and a half years back India has launched a national credit framework earlier you didn't knew that where you are learning is going there were no credit out of it

but now you have a academic bank of credit in the country you have a digil locker so you can say the national skill qualification brings the capability the NCV the regulatory body in the country

they get the standardization so that everybody can be measured on the same scale in that case the academic bank of credit stores your learning points and digilocker becomes your trusted record

keeper of your credentials. So when an employer is looking forward, he's not looking for a twopage, threepage CV, he looks at a complete succession or a progression that what all you have

studied. Sometimes we shy away reaching to our age that what all to be given in a CV what all we have learned and we keep on doing any number of courses but just like for uh in India we have a EKYC

through your Aadhaar which is a 12digit unique number. Same way for all the students. Now we have a 12digit APAR ID that is your academic permanent registry account number. So all your learnings

from school. So whatever level you reach to a CXO level will be in your Digi locker and you'll be getting credit out of it. And to answer Ashish also so with Adobe we'll be exchanging our MOU today

where almost 21 courses we'll be bringing uh with the tools also and it'll be launched on the future skills prime platform of NASCOM also when you said that it need to be embedded with

the state boards so already uh the course has been made uh getting approval from NCB where all the state boards can take up those uh courses in creativity and I completely believe that creativity

is not what you can learn through a lecture or you can listen and do that thing. Creativity is more hands-on and introducing a subject is just a starting long way of taking it forward. Let's say

with the Firefly or Express or there are so many other tools it should be part of every subject. So as a student is it is not that AI meeting creativity in one of my subject. it is more if I'm learning

science or a mathematics how I'll be using that creativity for doing my assignments in that case. So I think that marriage has to happen between creativity and AI. Then lot of things

when we were taking up these courses to schools. So people still say I mean after everybody's getting gung about AI but they still say that school kids are too young to understand these concepts.

And my simple answer is if you remember when you learned your ABC what did you learn from the letter X? &gt;&gt; Xylophone. &gt;&gt; Xylophone. At what age you saw the

xylophone? Have you seen the xylophone till today? But still we have a picture in mind. At what age you saw the zebra but still know how it looks like at even at a 2 years old kid understands. So

same way if we make the concepts easier, we break them into fundamentals. Uh we make them more like you said storytelling or visual effects through various tools. I think it will become

very very easy for students. And that is the true way of saying that AI meets creativity mices. Thank you. &gt;&gt; That's awesome. Thank you [applause] &gt;&gt; Mala.

&gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Just quickly in fact one of the things that I wanted to add is um &gt;&gt; in the higher education &gt;&gt; this time it's high time for India also

to actually change many of the nomatures that we have. We for a long period of time have worked with silos. You know we have arts, &gt;&gt; we have science, we have if if you taken

commerce a particular stream or engineering if you taken civil engineering and all you are stuck for four five years and all liberal arts and multi-disiplinary uh you know framework

actually changed that. &gt;&gt; Mhm. So we are suggesting that we need to really have something called as bachelors of creative arts and sciences, bachelors of performing arts and

sciences, &gt;&gt; bachelors of immersive arts and sciences for extended reality and gaming and everything. &gt;&gt; So I think now people will have to

realize that art and science and art and technology and art and engineering everything will have to work together. design and engineering also have to work together

&gt;&gt; if we have to do well with uh defense engineering and many others. &gt;&gt; So some of these changes also have to be brought in in the creative part getting into all the segments.

&gt;&gt; Yeah know I love that. Uh I know when I was growing up in India at that time the only choices my parents would give me is engineering dru I ended up doing business. Um, but you know, I that's

amazing that if there are courses or degrees that you can get and kids don't get into trouble with their parents and they can make careers that that's phenomenal. Just going back to the point

you made a minute ago and I know we're almost out of time, but um, how how much do you hear from industry and how do you sort of build your courses and your you know what you offer to students that's

industry informed? Uh so NASCOM runs a joint initiative with the ministry of electronics and IT with our uh partners CDC and Nile where this platform future skills prime was

envisioned and we work as aggregator of aggregator. So it is not NASCOM who is making those courses but we are getting the courses from all the industries uh let it be Microsoft, IBM, Salesforce. So

whatever courses they have cured so it's a single stop solution for all the students where they can just log in and they'll see 450 plus courses ranging from a byite-size learning of 30 minutes

to a 500 hours of courses also also interesting thing is taking this initiative one is yes industry-ledd courses all what have been uh there on the platform and another thing is that

almost 60% of the learners are coming from tier 2 tier three and beyond &gt;&gt; so that where We see that okay the trained teacher as some of them have mentioned that yes train the trainer

program is important but a country like India where we have to do the things on scale to reach everyone to democratize the AI access and other emerging technology access so these kind of

platforms which are there so all industry vetted courses and that's how rather than doing our uh courses on creativity we thought to get Adobe on the platform and why not let the

industry experience uh go to the students in terms of those courses. So it's all 10 emerging technologies with 12 professional skills where the courses are there and almost uh 26 lakh learners

are onboarded on the platform and some 1 80 cr badges digital badges have been uh taken by the students in that &gt;&gt; that's amazing. How many students do we have in the room students? Wow. Okay.

So, we're going to do a a a lightning round here of questions. Um, and I know there's people in the audience who want have questions. Give me a minute. This is my last question and then we'll give

it to you. So, in one sentence to all the panelists, what should a student, and there's many students here, right? What should their portfolio show for you to hire them?

Starting with you, Dr. Vilasha. &gt;&gt; Uh, I I just want to see the uh progression how they are learning. So being a lifelong learner I think is the best skill anybody can have.

&gt;&gt; Awesome. Lifelong learner. All right. &gt;&gt; Well, a lifelong learner becomes what any artist is. But uh a lifelong learner who has uh depth in in culture and and creativity. So that becomes quite for

us. &gt;&gt; Nice. Rishi &gt;&gt; u someone who's done something new taken some risk learn something which is beyond what the course kind of tells you

to learn &gt;&gt; awesome sanch &gt;&gt; I will say decision making capabilities to understand what AI is telling you and what is the real context in which you

can take those decisions &gt;&gt; great and Dr. Rashish. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Well, I look for storytellers. So, I look at a sto ability to tell a story. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. All right. I know we have a

lot of questions in the audience. Can we take a few? Uh &gt;&gt; Shre. &gt;&gt; Oh, is it okay? &gt;&gt; I'm audible now.

&gt;&gt; Yeah. Thanks. So thank you so much Mala and thank you as team panelist for such an inspiring and insightful session. Now we move to a special moment where we the exchange ofou between adobe and sector

skill council NASCOM for the future skills prime initiative. I would request miss sangeita Gupta chief strategy officer and senior vice president NASCOM along with Mr. Jadev Gopal Krishnan

director and head of education to join us on stage and I would also request Dr. Bashaga Gore and Miss Malash Sharma to join them for the exchange. Please round of applause guys. Please

&gt;&gt; don't be very &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; I know we are running out of time but Sangeita ma'am if you can just speak few

words about this MU exchange. &gt;&gt; Uh thank you for a very fascinating panel Mala and I loved all the insights uh this MOU with Adobe we're very thankful for this partnership because we

can talk about learning creativity but we are providing you access to to the real courses where you can make a difference. of all the learners out there please go log into future skills

prime uh adob there are 21 courses from Adobe that will be live around uh digital marketing content creation and design uh I think we'll encourage each of you to go through these courses the

first one on genai for modern professionals is already live so we'd love to see many of you logging in please please go through it share your feedback and and be with us as part of

this journey where we make AI and creativity much more real thank &gt;&gt; Do you want to wrap it up or do you want to take a couple questions? &gt;&gt; Hi, very good morning. Hey, sorry. Very

good evening everyone. [laughter] it reason morning because the energy in the room is so &gt;&gt; lively that it feels that still it's morning. So good morning, good evening

everyone. So I am Jay from uh D2L India. I handle business for a small company called D2L. And uh my question to the esteemed list of experts over here is that uh so we we are talking about

learning learning foundational level right from K12 to higher ed. We are also nowadays talking about uh training. We are talking about upskilling, skilling, lifelong learning. We are also at length

talking about continuing education. Are we also thinking in lines of having verifiable credentials that will be relevant to the professionals

once they are into job or while they want to move from one profession to another depending upon the industry demand. &gt;&gt; So

&gt;&gt; do you want to take that? you touched on that a little bit &gt;&gt; has has uh the aligned people thought ever in this direction. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Sure. That's what I said

also that through ABC or through diger that's how it becomes a trusted verifi verifiable credential for the employers also. So in case you are changing job and adding upskilling yourselves that be

seen in your complete portfolio there that &gt;&gt; so so I have a complimentary question over here. If I can please talk over a coffee we'll just

two more questions. Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes ma'am please. &gt;&gt; Uh so I'm uh representing my uh firm Skillpill. We are currently helping MSMES from northeast India in uh

learning and implementing Genai uh tools in their regular workflows. My question is uh like Sarans sir mentioned about tal talent transformation platform. How can platforms like NASCOM or

Cognizant uh can actually help in transforming the rural or uh you know uh workforce in the grassroot level like say for MSMES how can they play the part?

No, great question and uh goes back um be it Adobe um NASCOM or Cognizant for representing the industry or um ICT part of it. I think the the power of AI is giving us that ability to scale, ability

to address be it a language, be it a capabilities and ability to move away from the self-paced learning. So that way that's the opportunity and I keep saying that it's up to us how do we see

the art of possibility and then extend it forward. So simple answer is yes there is a opportunity there is a possibility. I think some of us have to come together to convert that intent to

a working approach and then move forward. What I would add is one of the things Adobe is doing is we're working not just at a central level but also at state levels and we are uh actually uh

not just working at the higher ed or you know degree grant technologies but also Kate schools where we're trying to integrate AI into grade six and above. In fact, you mentioned, you know, how do

you make AI possible when you're learning math or English or science and the team has done an amazing job of integrating AI uh projects as you're learning a traditional subject. So, uh

you know, please connect with the team. Jayv can wave his hand, let us know which part of you know, India you're from and we yeah, we'd love to connect. Assam actually, I think we're already

working with Assam, so we should talk to you offline. Yes, &gt;&gt; thank you. I'm I'm so sorry guys. We're running out of time. We'll take just one last question.

&gt;&gt; One last question. Yes. &gt;&gt; The lady please. &gt;&gt; And you can grab us as we leave outside. A very good evening to everybody. Uh I am an assistant professor and I I come

from Chandigar University. Uh I am not here with a question but I would like to thank uh Adobe specifically because uh our MBA I'm the program manager for MBA digital marketing and the amount of help

that Adobe has uh put forth for putting the right kind of tools and the skill sets especially Adobe Firefly I must say that has been very very much helpful. uh one aspect although I would like to put

forth that for the Gen Z uh very honestly uh dealing with them on an everyday basis I must say uh the impact of social media has been uh very much not very productive. So can we as as the

industry uh you know leaders here uh can we come forth that we can bring forth some kind of messages from all parts of the industry that although I teach social mark social media marketing but

we should make our Gen Z a little bit more aware about to go ahead and put forth the efforts towards the productivity rather than the uh thought process of just being mere scrollers.

So I would just like to request here as an educator from the industry that the uh leaders of the other industry they can go ahead and play a very big role in taking an initiative of putting across a

positive message so that the generation younger generation who's following you should be able to go ahead and follow the same. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you guys. Now we like to have a group photo please so the team can come up. NASCOM team, please. And the Adobe team.

&gt;&gt; Should we go ahead? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hey, don't forget the cubbies. Please. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. Yes.

Thank you so much everyone for joining us and have a great evening ahead. Please just &gt;&gt; guys please guys

please &gt;&gt; guys please please guys He's maintained pretty fast and that's over

a large part of things that are things &gt;&gt; absoluting unique There's a bite. &gt;&gt; Yeah, there's a bite.
