## 📝 Transcript

release which has happened under your guidance and we look forward to have the discussion further. Thank you to the secretary so for giving Vicki and UNICEF this opportunity and we were able to

have this discussion. So I'll just say that the the topic is very close to the whole discussion because we understand the stakeholders we are talking out here are really important whether you talk

out their inclusion whether you talk about governance whether you talk about having the AI by designs keeping children in mind. So that is what the session is going to talk about it and we

definitely feel this is the starting point. We will come back to you with further more initiatives in this domain along with our partners. With the with this I welcome all the dignitaries all

the delegates. Thank you for being supportive and my may I now request our director general Miss Joti Vij to kindly deliver the welcome remarks. &gt;&gt; Thank you Saraka. Uh, Professor Ajay

Kumar Sud, Principal Scientific Advisor, Government of India. Shri S Krishnan, Secretary Ministry of Electronics and IT, Government of India, Her Excellency Malin Sinners, Ambassador of Norway to

India, Sri Lanka, Bhutan and Maldives, fellow panelists and your friends. Good afternoon to everyone and on behalf of Fiki, it's my privilege to welcome everyone to this very important session

on AI and children turning principles and into practice for safe inclusive and empowering AI. We very happy to partner with UNICEF for this very important session and subject. UNICEF office of

innovation is working to ensure the next generation of AI is inclusive, ethical and impactful. My special thanks to professor Sud and Mr. Krishnan for joining us this afternoon and they are

the ones who are leading the AI agenda in the country. Very happy to have you here with us. Um as I see it u AI and children have two basic aspects. One is to make AI safe for children and the

other is to empower them. Uh the national education policy 2020 has emphasized the importance of AI and its role in school curriculum and ministry of education government of India has

reaffirmed its commitment to advancing AI and computational thinking as essential components of future ready education thus empowering the children with the with the with the AI tool. This

initiative marks a nent yet significant step towards the ethical use of AI to solve complex problems as technology will organically be embedded from the foundational stage beginning in grade

three from the upcoming academic session. As far as industry is concerned, India's edtech industry is playing a major role here. AI's adaptive learning abilities have a big impact on

education delivery. Leading Indian edtech platforms are continually looking to utilize AI's adaptability to analyze student performance and suggest tailored uh learning experiences to address

specific areas of improvement. As artificial intelligence becomes deeply integrated into the education, health care, governance and daily digital interactions,

it is increasingly shaping the experiences of millions of children across India and around the world. India today is home to more than 250 million schoolgoing children and at the level

nearly 1 in three internet users is under the age of 18. And these numbers do underline the scale and urgency of our responsibility. The decisions we make today will

influence how safely, equitably, and productively children engage with AIdriven systems in the coming years. We firmly believe that principles must be translated into practice. Ethical AI

cannot remain confined to guiding documents. It must be embedded into the product design, procurement frameworks, regulatory standards, data governance systems, and capacity building

initiatives. When the conversation concerns the children, the margin for error becomes extremely small, making responsible implementation even more critical. And we're very deeply honored

to have uh with us today the distinguished leaders who are shaping this agenda at the national and international level. And we do look forward to meaningful and insightful

discussions today and to identify clear and actionable pathways ahead. Thank you for being part of this dialogue and very warm welcome once again. &gt;&gt; Thank you ma'am and thank you for

putting up the right perspective from principles into practice and that's what this session gets into. But next we get to you the real face for whom we are organizing the session. Can we have Miss

Prasadi Singh youth advocate to talk about and to give a children and a youth address. How do she feels that AI for children is important and how the children are the early adopters of AI

and how they needs to be part of the integral system. Over to you Prasidi. Four minutes to you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; The time of great importance.

Greetings. Namaste and welcome from generation AI. I am Prasidhi Singh 13 years of age from Changalpatu Tamil Nadu a UNICEF India youth advocate and I present to you the children and youth

statement for a safe and inclusive AI future not just a document a mandate built from the voices of nearly 54,000 young people across 184 countries further informed by focused group

discussions across across India with other children and young people. This statement is an urgent call to action to ensure that the AI systems are shaped with and for children and young people.

We present the following aid demands calling on governments, regulatory authorities, think tanks, civil society organizations, UN bodies and technology companies to ensure and take immediate

and collective action. Demand one, ensure that AI systems are inclusive by design and use diverse and representative data sets that reflect the lived experiences of marginalized

communities across cast, class, gender, geography, and racial contexts. Two, ensure strong data protection, ethical standards and safety in the development and use of AI, including age appropriate

design and safeguards against harmful AI generated content. Three, invest in education systems and institutional capacities to prepare children and young people to engage with AI critically,

ethically, and safely. Four, develop and implement parental guidance and support mechanisms to help them guide and protect children's interactions with AI while respecting their privacy, safety,

freedom of expression, and evolving capacities. Five, invest in emerging opportunities for children and young people to engage with AI through incubation, through

mentorship, through project-based initiatives that support realworld problem solving. Six, invest in building accessible AI ready skills for children and young people and ensure that they

are equipped for meaningful employment opportunities. Seven, address the risks of job displacement and exclusion, particularly the use of automated screening that can often unfairly

disadvantage children and young people from marginalized communities by ensuring transparency and human oversight in AIdriven recruitment processes. And finally, eight,

meaningfully engage children and young people from grassroot communities as AI ambassadors and contributors throughout the AI life cycle, real seats, real opportunities, real ways to engage in

the decision making. Because when young people shape AI as equal partners, it is nation building, it is planet building, it builds creators, not merely consumers of the future. So yes, as Gen

AI, we want the future to be smart. Certainly, we want the future to be smart, but we also want it to be fair. The only question left is whether you are ready to build it with us. Thank

you. Namaste. [applause] Thank you Prasidi. And you already had a round of applause. You can understand. Yes, that's the answer from the group that we are ready to build up with you

all getting into the picture. With this can I request uh Shares Krishna Secretary Ministry of Electronics and IT sir so kindly deliver his address. So we we first of all compliments to you sir

for organizing such a mega activity which is assemble who's in and who and anyone you talk about the subject with respect to AI as under one roof. So compliments to the ministry and we are

happy that we could partner with you but on this subject sir your thoughts over to you for your address. &gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Thank you very much u principal

scientific advisor ambassador Cynthia McAfei uh Mr. [clears throat] Gokul Subramanyam and Joti Ve of Fiki and of course Prasidi I was very happy to hear that Prasidi was from Changalput in

Tamil Nadu my home state which brought back memories to me of the earliest joke and since we are in a UNICEF uh UNICEF gathering uh I think it's worth recolcting because it's the first joke I

remember I was told as a child and it was about Changelput there was this person whose father told him saying that look I have to get up in the morning and Changelput is a town which is 60

kilometers from Chennai it's exactly an hour so I have to get up in the morning and go to Changelp so please make sure that you wake me up in time so this boy got up in the morning and being a young

kid he decided that you know why should I put my father through all the trouble and instead of waking up his father he went to Changelput and came back so the father got so angry that he boxed his

ear so hard it came out so he lost a So this kid was crying and he went out onto the street and suddenly he started laughing because he saw a dog running along without either ear both its ears

gone. So he said this dog has gone to Changelput twice. So this joke is relevant in a completely different context and it is relevant because of one the kind of initiative

that children and the youth are capable of taking and two how misunderstood they can sometimes be and three the kind of mistakes that parents and the elder generation makes. So I think from that

perspective I can fully empathize with what Prasidi had to say about what we need to do for youth and for the younger generation as far as AI is concerned. Clearly when she says Gen AI she does

not mean generative AI she means the generation of AI and that I think is important. We doing all of this for them. This is not an event which is truly meant for our generation. It is

the ability to sort of make sure that we equip that generation, the next generation with possibly a technology which is broad-based and crosscutting which can make all the difference

especially for countries of the global south to really move up in the development chain. They would probably become countries. They would probably become truly developed and prosperous

with opportunities, fair opportunities for all only if we make the right decisions today. Which is why the theme of even this AI impact summit is about people, planet and progress. The human

centricity is important. The democrat democratization of AI resources is important. Making sure that human capital is developed in such a way that they can take advantage of AI is

important and understanding and especially I think that is what is critical. We need to look at this not with fear but with the understanding that this is something which can truly

be very meaningful for another generation and very meaningful for humanity itself to address it in such a way that we don't worry so much about the ill effects. Of course, we have to

guard against them, but look at the opportunities and see what it can do in terms of increasing human potential, human capability, the way productivity can go up and the way

that economic progress and societal change can reach everybody. I think that is the uh positive outlook with which we get there. At the same time, we need to think about governance mechanisms which

will guard us against the ill effects. And that is something that at least in the government of India and the ministry of uh electronics and information technology

that is something we are working for all the time. For instance, even in the latest uh regulation relating to AI which came out just last week which is about how synthetically generated

content can be uploaded with labels. But even when you do it with labels, it doesn't give people a license to actually put out content which is harmful to children and others. So there

is we need to be mindful of this. We need to ensure that it protects them. But at the same time, we need to make sure that we offer as many opportunities as possible so that they can access it.

This particular summit also includes UI AI, a challenge which has been thrown open for children between 13 and 20 years of age which has been extensively participated in. So it's in that sense

oriented towards this. Of course you have a stellar panel including our u the chair of our expert panel on AI governance who would be talking to you in great detail about the other elements

of it. Today uh I am I'm sure you're also very excited but truly the success of what we have attempted to do here in Delhi as part of the AI impact summit is reflected in this hall as it was in many

other halls. standing room only, everyone engaged, everyone participating and uh uh with with the kind of enthusiasm which we wanted to put on display because this is what India can

do to AI when the time comes and this is what we can generate with the kind of human engagement with this when when uh the Stanford vibrancy index on AI comes out. what they highlight and the reason

why India ranks third is because of the talent and because of the participation amongst youth and how ready they are for AI and clearly like Prasidi and many others that is a generation we should

not fail and we should work and ensure that they have this opportunity. I would um I would have loved to stay and hear the views of all the participants and the discussion around the house but

unfortunately I think there's a lot going on outside of this hall as well. Uh we are waiting to receive the prime minister at 5:00 p.m. as well in the expo. Um and I can assure you the expo

is something that all of you before you leave the AI summit should go and visit. It's open for the public from tomorrow for four four days till the 20th. So please do visit that as well. There are

incredible number of uh um startups and many other companies who have displayed wonderful things there which I'm sure uh you would truly find enriching. Thank you again for all of you for joining us

here at the AI uh impact summit. I can see the visible impact. You have made the impact by all turning out here in such numbers. Thank you. [applause] &gt;&gt; Thank you sir. So thank you for such an

address from the heart and of course talking about people planet and progress with which we all abide by. With this I come to our next speaker professor Ajay Kumar Sut principal scientific adviser

government of India sir for your address. Uh you have released the strengthening of AI governance technological framework. So we like to hear about and giving the child in mind.

Thank you secretary sir for joining us today. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much. First of all, my congratulations to Fiki, UNICEF and mighty for putting this very very

important uh session on AI and children. Uh I fully concur with what Prasidi said and what uh Mr. Krishna said. It's really a very exciting moment and the energy and vibrancy in this summit on

the first day itself is palpitable. You will all agree that this is tr truly inspiring. So we all know that AI as AI is becoming more accessible, it is also becoming more ch present in children's

daily lives and uh this is coming through learning tools uh through content platforms and different models. So this as was mentioned creates a governance responsibility

to ensure that children can benefit from AI potential for learning and inclusion while being protected from harms that scale quickly in digital environment. So we were just looking at the data uh

which is there in uh open source that uh in uh children interaction with AI is really rising very very rapidly in the last one year for example 67% of uh teens in UK now use AI in US it's also

uh almost like 40% of uh elementary age children and they are using AI powered educational tools. Now in India's childsp specific AI usage data is still emerging. It's not uh uh fully done but

I'm sure it will happen soon. But the fact that ecosystem is uh primed for growth is clear because 85.5% of households now own a smartphone and 86% have internet access within their

premises. So they it may not be in houses but uh this is the available data. This immediately tells us that the digital penetration uh is has happened and the Indian

children are in increasingly exposed to AIdriven platforms and that is why it underscores what was said the need for safe inclusive and empowering framework uh developed for tailored for their

development uh needs. Now as a as a AI systems are now shaping the learning pattern the information access behavior responses especially of children that really we need to look at a big

challenge is far as I can see we still do not fully know the long-term effects of growing up with AI companions uh personalized learning apps

algorithmdriven feeds and synthetic media. More evidence is needed with the help of all of you, all the experts to understand how these tools impact a

child's development, mental health and education over time. Now, ch uh for children uh also true for adults as well often uh we describe AI is a double w sword. So the governance objective

should be to sharpen the edge of opportunity while blunting the edge of risk. On the opportunity side, AI can support more personalized pedagogy by helping children learn at their own pace

and providing timely feedback beyond classroom hours. So you probably all know uh a few months back uh Tong district in Rajasthan uh they had a AI enabled personalized learning experience

initiative called parai with AI. I'm sure some of you would have looked at the outcome of that initiative. Uh this was to address weak mathematics outcomes in government schools. Uh so as a result

the class 10 mathematics class uh rose to 96% within six weeks as per their data alongside an improvement in higher achiever performance. So this AI can

also strengthen improve uh strengthen inclusion by improving accessibility for children with disabilities. For example, through speech to text, text to speech and translation features

that uh usually reduce barriers to participation across languages and abilities. And this is where the power of AI will come. At the same time, we have all uh been seeing there are

associated risks that require deliberate safeguarding and this is what we need to see. How do we avoid over reliance on AI tools because this does weaken critical thinking, independent problem solving

and learning resilience. So the fear is that now everyone's CV the is perfect because you generate using chat GPT but is it really the truth thing and you can really be fooled by AI generated

framework you start believing in it so you this is something which we all need to guard against. So uh as uh because uh we have also seen that uh children often uh lack the data literacy to understand

how their interaction may create uh long-term digital footprints and exposures because what you do today is going to be there for uh ad infinitum uh on the uh digital platform and this is

something we need to worry about. So in this context as was mentioned India has taken governance initiative and our office has been uh deeply involved. Uh India AI mission provided a pathway uh

to build capability and widen access while strengthening safeguards for uh safe and trusted AI. We brought the AI governance framework in November 2025 and uh two weeks back we had a white

paper on strengthening uh AI safety uh using technolal framework which was mentioned and this is something again an experiment which we have to do how technolal framework which uh uh about

which we had a very very good experience in DPI 1.0 to uh how it can be adopted for AI safety and also the data governance. So this is something where all the players are needed uh in this uh

safety exercise. Now uh uh internationally the UNICEF which is a part of this uh guidance on AI and children they set out requirement for child- centering AI governance safety

and all that uh will go a long way uh to operationalize on how AI is designed and deployed. Now I will just close by few remarks. The real balancing act uh lies in empowering children through AI not

just as a user as was mentioned but as future creators and this is probably the most important message which I see how children should be involved right from the beginning in creating it not only in

the using it and that is why by integrating AI literacy into school curricula and the other platform form we can make it happen and good news is that our ministry of education has a program

they had a pro program here few days back and uh there is a definitive uh strong attempt to bring AI in uh school cura so I think this is an ongoing effort where the need to embed child

specific safeguards and guardrails into governance framework is not a choice it is a must and all of us should put our heads together to make sure that the future generation is not a victim of

today's technology and this is something for all of us to see and I think the deliberations in this uh uh panel discussion will help to come out with a more actionoriented plan and I wish you

all the very best and it is a pleasure to be associated with this AI movement. ment in the country uh personally as well as by our office uh along with mighty and other stakeholders so that we

can make a difference for the young generation. Thank you so much. [applause] &gt;&gt; Thank you sir. Child being adopters not only creators and it's being a must.

That's a message we carry from your address. Thank you. With this can I request the speakers for the inaugural session to kindly switch over. Thank you dignitaries for joining in and we

proceed with the panel discussion. Uh my team who just set up the ders but it's a esteemed set of panel which has joined us today. The panelists for this session are her excellency May Ellen Stenner

ambassador of Norway to India Sri Lanka Bhutan and Maldivs Dr. Sanjiv Sharma member secretary NCPCR Mr. Thomas Devin global innovation director UNICEF Mr. Gokul Subramanyam president Intel India

and a co-chair for Vicki AI committee Mr. Hector D river director responsible AI public policy at Microsoft Mr. AJ Witch senior country managing director Esenture Mr. Kumar Anraata, Vice

President Capgeemini. And the session is going to be moderated by Miss Henrietta Ridley, chief AI UNICEF. Henita, you have a hard task. I can only afford to give you 23 minutes.

&gt;&gt; 23 minutes. I can I can work with that. Thank you very much. &gt;&gt; And thank you panel for joining. Um I wanted to start with a very quick human moment. Um I lost my luggage on the way

here. So, I'm here with far fewer resources than I planned, but still functional. And it's a really useful reminder for today that systems fail. And the question is whether we've built

and are building AI so that when it fails, children aren't the ones that are going to be paying the price for that. We have a 23 minute conversation with seven speakers. I'll keep us moving

hopefully. Please help me as best you can as we go through that. Um, I may step in gently. I'm I will try not to be rude. Um, but I wanted to start. Your excellency in my luggage sit situation.

I've learned that it'll be fine isn't a very good strategy. Um, and I'm going to attempt a simple question that's never actually that simple. So, how do you make AI designed and

governed in a way that truly empower children and young people while safeguarding their rights and well-being? And could you share Norway's vision in it and experience in ensuring

that? &gt;&gt; Yes, uh please I can and thank you very much for having me on this uh this uh panel. Safe and inclusive AI for children and uh and young people is a

priority for Norway. Uh so it's great to be here. We also have a very clear vision. Technology including AI must support and not undermine children's rights. Uh it must not undermine the

children's safety, participation, learning and well-being. It must support it. Uh so uh that's where we uh are. So um in your luggage uh situation uh you know you could not trust trust it. But

uh we think that digital and AI uhdriven environments should be trustworthy. Uh they should be equitable. They should be empowering uh and align also with the UN convention for the rights of the child.

Uh so that's a starting uh starting uh point. We have the Norwegian government for five years coordinated a national focus on safe digital upbringing of uh of uh children. uh we

we have a strategy that highlight that it's important to address both opportunities and challenges and risks uh uh linked to digitalization protecting and empowering children in an

in an AIdriven world requires combining rights based governance digital components competence and risk mitigation frameworks digital empowerment

comes with digital comp competence. So, uh we have been working to increase parents and children's digital competence to secure children's rights in the digital environment.

We um we have uh actually found out some we have found some very worrying uh numbers. 95% of Norwegian children aged 9 to 11 have their own mobile phone. That's up from 85% 10 years ago. 72 uh

percent of the same group of children uh use social media even though the legal age is 13 years old. Um and almost half of the 13 14 years old have seen scary or violent images or videos at least

once in the past year. So this is uh this is really quite uh worrying. they've also got hate messages directed uh at at them. So what we need to discuss what can we do with uh with this

and where social media is a is um a main source of news for Norwegian children and youth as I believe they are all over the the world. Uh we are discussing higher minimum age for social media use.

Um we are also discussing uh raising the GDPR age of consent uh up to 15 years uh of uh of age. Um and uh we are uh working at issuing national health uh authority recommendations on screen use

uh on screen time and on social media. We are uh also uh looking at measurements uh to remove mobile phones from schools. Uh we are proposing legislation to strengthen penalties for

violations of marketing regul regulations targeting children. Addressing online crime and exploitation of children and youth is also necessary. So all these experiences

um ensure uh to ensure a safe digital uh upbringing for all children is a really a top priority for the Norwegian government. We we cannot allow the algorithms the screens to take over

childhood. They must uh be protected from harm harmful content, abuse, commercial exploitation and misuse of personal uh data. So uh that's uh where we are. uh and uh what we need to do we

think from Norway. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Fabulous. Thank you so much ambassador. The emphasis on guardrails is such a powerful framing. If we now zoom out from a national approach to the global

picture I'll hand over to Tom. You have the advantage of seeing what works globally um and what we therefore need to take with us at all times. If you had to name the core pillars that actually

make AI safe, inclusive, and empowering for children, what would you say to those? &gt;&gt; Thank you. I'll try to be brief. Famous last words.

&gt;&gt; Um first, it's wonderful to be to be here. Um and and indeed, we look at AI as an incredible opportunity for us to achieve outcomes, better outcomes for children. It's also something that is

going to revolutionize everything in the world. the way we access knowledge, the way we build skills, the way we access health care, the way we potentially access social protection. And so the

question is how do we design those systems in a way that makes the most of them and helps the next generation to really thrive in the world rather than become the victims of systems we just

haven't thought through. We would suggest three key principles. The first one is AI must be safe by design. Not as an afterthought, not as an afterthought, but as a foundation. What does that

mean? It mean strong age appropriate safeguards, protection from heartful content, manipulation, bias, misuse. It means data protection systems whereby sharing of data is actually protected

and consensual for children. It means built-in accountability so that when something goes wrong and we know things will go wrong, there is red address mechanism. There is the ability to look

under the hood and understand what has gone wrong. How do we manage this better? Second principle, AI must be inclusive by default. It has to serve every child, not just the digitally

privileged. We know that 90% of AI systems today in the world are built by 10% of the world's population. Most of the systems that we're building are not

appropriate to the global south. They don't understand it. As we know, initially there were so many facial recognitions that simply was working for white people only. And there's so many

elements of this. How do we manage AI system that are built for inclusion that managed the understanding of how will this work for different languages? How will this work for different

disabilities? There are incredible potential to use texttospe speech to text to revolutionize access to knowledge for children with disabilities. Are we optimizing for

that? Do we understand how does that work in rural context? Do we have online and offline capabilities for these AI systems? All of this will be elements that we want to build from the outset

and not have to retrofit afterwards, leaving behind ever further millions of people in rural settings and in in in less favored settings. Three, AI must empower children and young people not

just as users but as creators, as participants, having voice in the governance, having the ability to challenge whether it works or not. When we bring an AI solution to school, we

should work with the children to understand how is this working for you. We should work with them long term to understand in bringing that knowledge, are we building learning outcomes that

are built by the AI or by yourself? Are we potentially making it more difficult for you to be critical to have identical thinking and so really building this at the heart and having parents

understanding how that works for in order for for them to be really able to be the guiding principles and understanding how these systems work. So AI literacies for children and for

parents as well. These all all of this means and this is really what makes me so happy is the panel. This is a all of society approach. It will only work if all of us gets together to make it work,

to challenge each other, to have governance systems, to have address systems that that we feed in, participate in and and manage. Thank you so much.

&gt;&gt; Brilliant. Thank you, Tom. That gives a really clear set of principles. Now, those principles only work if they show up in practice as well. Um, so let's look let's look at what accountability

really looks like. I will also just say I've been reminded of the time. We've got five speakers and we've got nine minutes. So do with that what you will. Um but Dr. Sharma um what steps um what

are some of the steps that have been taken by NCPCR in ensuring that AI systems remain safe and accountable for children. &gt;&gt; Thank you for having me here. So I'll

[clears throat] start uh where Thomas left. Um so but I'll I'll I'll I'll take a few seconds to tell you two stories to tell you what AI is doing so far as child

lights are concerned. There was this boy who was chatting with the AI chatbot without knowing that this is chatbot and got so emotionally dependent one day he committed suicide

at the prompt of this AI chatbot. So this is one story. There is another story a state in India is using AI based app to find out the weight and measure of the children those who are attending

the angari there's a scheme of government of India where the children go they study and eat the food so this AI tool has enormously improved so these are the the pos there is a positive

story and there's a negative story and both bother us at NCPCR national commission for protection of childlight Right. Let me tell you is a child right body set up by government of India. We

are a statutory body. So we have some statutory powers that we can implement. So um coming to what uh we are doing is one very important area which have been bothering us is the child sexual abuse

material. 2024 alone we have more than 64,000 cases of child sexual abuse material being generated in the country. Uh so as a result of this what we are doing is we are developing an AI based

tool which we will be able to actually deploy and proactively find out which are the social media platforms and the internet platforms that are being used for circulating this CSM. And uh

fortunately uh in a recent court case there is safe harbor principle which was extended to the social media platform wherein they were not responsible of third third party content has been

removed. So we can take action against them. We are working proactively on this very quickly. There's another very important issue which have been bothering which has been bothering us is

related to the mental health. The NCPCR runs a teley teley uh therapy line where we provide the counseling and we always find it's very difficult to get the volunteers for this. So AI can be used

for this and recent studies suggests that the accuracy rate of AI tool is 89% for detecting the psychological conditions and the secondly uh mental health is is actually something which if

we can actually detect early we can do a lot in this. So why tool can be used for this? Ministry of education as sir has already pointed out is starting the AI in from class third curricula. We are

engaging with the ministry of education to to to develop the responsible AI tool. So these are the few things I want to stop here. We are doing so many things but because of the positive of

time I'm not taking your time but if you want I'm always available for the discussion. Thank you very much. &gt;&gt; Fabulous. Thank you so much. [applause] Um so I'll move on to Mr. Subramanium.

Staying practical if empowering AI is the destination. What are Intel's priorities? Where are you placing those bets? &gt;&gt; So um clearly um technology is pretty

critical and at a compute level for us responsible AI is at the foundation of everything that we're doing not an afterthought. So there are very common things that are important but normally

overlooked. one is protecting the data, protecting the model and protecting the user. So all of these are important. A lot of times data and models get talked about not so much about the user. The

second aspect I think uh uh Priscilla talked about uh professor S talked about and Christian one is how can you give compute such that our children learn to use it and contribute and not just

become users. So bringing affordable AI so that they can actually be not only users but co-creating it with us. And the third part is when we talk about AI, it's about giving a very transparent

scaffolding so that the human is in the loop. That's a very important aspect and how to bring technology such that that scaffolding is always available. An example could be a parent being able to

be a co-pilot when the children is using the AI. So when a question is asked about give me a picture of a doctor regardless of what gender or color it shows the parent is able to sit down

with the children and ask why do you think that answer came so that the child is able to know what is wrong with the technology or what is right with it. And the last part is making sure that uh

this is less of technology but a more a human responsibility that all of us have. We shouldn't make AI suddenly become the next generation digital babysitters which means it cannot be

taking the human out of the loop. Already the communication that the generation AI grows up with is a lot with these chat bots and these language models. the words that come out that are

generated are not as powerful and accountable as the words that come from a human and that generation will have to now know what that word means and that's something we all have as a social

responsibility. &gt;&gt; Excellent. Thank you. Um now we have got and I will ask for some help. We have three minutes. We have three of you left to speak. So we're going quick fire. We

will make it to the end. Um so Mr. Um, for India and other global south economies with huge [snorts] numbers of young people entering the workforce, how does AI reshape skilling?

&gt;&gt; Just put it on chat GP, they'll get an answer. &gt;&gt; Fabulous. There we go. &gt;&gt; No, but jokes apart, the buzz that you see today on skilling and upskilling is

basically to fill the immediate gap. To really make a long-term impact, you need children to come on board, right? And that's where I think all of us need to play a role. uh the nature of work is

going to change as these kids grow up. I think the responsibility is on us to to make it happen for them. Uh what AI is going to bring to the table is democratization. The word is being used

a lot. And equality of knowledge, right? Their ability to learn anything is possible and you don't need to have a degree. You need a certain skill to be able to solve problems. That's what's

going to be important. My mantra, one line mantra or a one word mantra to anybody today is learn to learn. teach that to the children in the education curriculum. Each one of us

needs to learn that the the knowledge available is immense. If we can build that in the DNA that you constantly need to learn, that's where AI will play a role. It it will give you enough data,

it will give you um enough ability. The second I would say secret here is access. If like you spoke about it, if there is no access, we can keep building the knowledge. It doesn't reach the real

user. So access and then of course that leads to a whole lot of inclusion right so I would say that's what AI is bringing to the table I think you and I have that responsibility to make it

happen for precidi future &gt;&gt; fantastic insights thank you [applause] now Mr. Revoir, you're really at the pointy end where principles meet product and policy. How are global tech leaders,

decision makers approaching the design challenge, AI that's safe, inclusive, um, and genuinely empowering, especially for children? &gt;&gt; Yes, thank you very much for having me

here. Um, at Microsoft, we invested in responsible AI practices long before there were any codes, directives, regulations, etc. mandating it because we really felt that it was necessary to

earn the trust of our users. And so 2018 we launched our respons responsible AI principles among which privacy, fairness, reliability, safety, security, transparency, inclusion

and since then this has been our northstar when we develop some new lines of AI systems, applications and models. We build from the start these AI application system model models with

this responsible AI standard in mind. Um it's so interesting to look at data usage and how models are used. It's it's it's fascinating to see that for instance on device generally copilot is

used for work tech employment questions on your phone you're mostly asking health questions and unfortunately for young users sometimes these kind of AI companions products

have be considered as a counselor sometimes even as a doctor and that that has led to tra tragic outcomes and I think that's our responsibility as a group to elevate the floor for safety.

It can take many forms, but the heart of this of this is really advancing the science of AI evaluation, better understanding the risks such as emotional dependency, over reliance,

psychopantic behavior, anthropomorphic behavior and actually we need to do this together. Microsoft, we just launched a Microsoft youth council to actually onboard the kids in this adventure to

strengthen safeguards. So for all the kids in the room, I invite you to apply to this youth council and help us to make our product safer. &gt;&gt; Amazing. Thank you. [applause]

So let's end where it really matters. Who benefits and who risks being left out. Mr. Praap, how can we ensure that young women, rural youth, and first generation learners are not left behind

in the AI transition? What concrete skills or systematic shifts um are most critical to achieving inclusive AI? &gt;&gt; How many seconds I have? &gt;&gt; You have a minute.

&gt;&gt; I'm going to keep going until we get to stage. &gt;&gt; No, the the there are few strands of uh AI that there's a there there's a need for all

of us to understand. one there's a need to make it real democratic because right now what's happening is that the content is getting developed by few limited people based on what I've experienced

what I have seen what I have heard and the kind of data which is being available there without bringing in the the experiences of the marginalized communities I if I talk about India

itself there's huge chunk of people whose voices are still not heard there. How to get those voices heard in some of these discourses which is happening there. There are languages which are not

written. So how you bring in those uh verbal uh form of communication into the data pack which is getting uh available there. Third is that we all are talking about AI for people. No one or uh

there's a need to bring in AI by the people and with the people there. And that's where uh uh uh the young people kids they need to become part of their and and they need to share their voices

when they they when we all are talking about inclusive uh AI there that's one second is we are not looking at the whole augment capacity of AI there you talked about

rural women you the the asha workers are there the if you look at the uh the nurses who are working in rural areas If you bring in AI to their uh doorstep, augment it in a way that can enhance the

delivery of theirs that will in so many ways will change the the quality of life that people are having. But that will require we all need to bring in the voices from those segment to come in

there and talk about it. We are we are asking everyone to get mainstreamed on AI without acknowledging or without sharing that whose stream we should consider as main. We are all are asking

or we everyone is asking that we all need to go and follow uh certain certain views and certain opinions which are there whose opinions are there and the moment we unpack these realities the the

AI will become more inclusive there till the time we hold it and we hold it by saying that hey this is the ultimate truth we won't be able to make it very inclusive there. Thank you so much and

thank you to all of the panelists um making it in time. Can I &gt;&gt; hand over? &gt;&gt; Can I have a round of applause for the panelists? You can see the diplomats,

industry, everybody sticking and to our moderator. Thank you Henita for making my life and our life easier and wrapping up in time. It was not easy to get the content from the dignitaries in the

given time. Thank you for being supportive. Can I have Cynthia now the of course the UNICEF India representative for giving her way forward as well as is the the conclusion

after that we wrap up kindly don't move right now thank you &gt;&gt; my dear friend and I just the wrap-up is number one thank you to the panel and to the myriad and expertise that you

provided from different sectors thank you to Ficky to pulling this together and bringing such a diverse perspective but also diverse audience thank you to the government of India for making this

possible. The energy as you said is palpable and so thank you for giving us this opportunity. You have brought incredible insights from across very different perspectives

whether it's industry or rights governments beyond India. So what we would love to see and as you go forth and you talk to your colleagues and you go to other panels, this is what our

dream would be is the declaration when the leaders come on the 19th and the 20th and they release their declaration that it talks about very explicitly the pathway that you're informing which is

that the leaders they say it themselves the leaders commit to promoting and protecting children and young people in active AI participation. that we're going to work together to

build their future as well as to protect their safety. And when they do it, that holds us to account. So, let's have and encourage the leaders to declare that and then let's hold each other to

account to make sure that we deliver it. Thank you. [applause] &gt;&gt; Thank you all. Thank you panelists. Thank you, Cynthia. Thank you, everybody. Can I have the the speakers

for the group photograph? Can we have the speakers for the group photograph?
