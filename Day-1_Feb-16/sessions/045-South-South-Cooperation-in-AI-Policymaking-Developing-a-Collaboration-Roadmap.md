## 📝 Transcript

Hallelujah. Sorry, that's All right. Um, welcome everybody. Thank you so much for coming to join us here. This will be a really, really

interesting session with a number of different countries from across Africa and across Asia that's represented here today. We're going to be talking about South South collaboration on AI policy.

One of the things I want to mention is that this is a group that has been doing South South collaboration on AI policy for over five years now. So my name is Rachel Adams. I'm the CEO of the global

center on AI governance and we have been working together with GISZ from Germany and the human sciences research council from South Africa in supporting a very dynamic network of leaders working on AI

policy from five African countries from Indonesia and from India to think about how working together we can learn from one another and develop meaningful and effective AI policy solutions that work

for southern countries and southern contexts. So, it's my pleasure to be moderating this panel today. We've got a number of speakers. So, I'm going to move quickly

and introduce our keynote speaker, Wolfgar Bungart, who is the senior policy officer within the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development. He'll be giving a few

opening remarks to set the tone. Thank you, Wolfgar. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Good morning. Hello. &gt;&gt; Good morning.

Well, dear Dr. Adams, dear members of the Africa Asia AI policymaker network, dear colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to welcome you to this panel discussion on South South collaboration

in AI policymaking. This session brings together seven members of the Africa Asia AI policymaker network. So we will have the privilege to hear seven perspectives on

AI governance from seven different countries. I believe that it's quite unique. But let me start by thanking Dr. Rachel Adams and her team from the Global Center on AI governance for

hosting and organizing this event as well as Paul Platinga and his team of the South African Human Science Research Council for their strong support and of course I would like to thank our

panelists who have agreed to share their perspective with us today and especially Mrs. Rama Deilanka from NITOK from the Indian government. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, you might wonder

what exactly is the Africa AI policymaker network. What does it do and what is so special about it? Well, imagine you work for an African or Asian government or a

government agency and it is your responsibility to draft a new eye regulation policy. This is a very important and a very challenging task, right? So, how would

you approach it? What would your first step be? Well, you could start by looking around you. How does the regulatory framework uh of other countries look like of your

neighbors of other countries in your region or even beyond? You can draw inspiration from their AI strategies, legal texts, policies, directives. But there's just one problem. These

documents, they cannot talk to you. They won't tell you how they came into existence, how the overall process looked like, and which stakeholders were consulted.

They won't tell you which choices had to be made and why certain decisions were taken. And they won't tell you which part are rather country specific and which are of a more general nature.

So if these documents cannot talk to you, you should talk to each other. In order to learn from the experience of others, you must enter into exchange and dialogue. And that is in a nutshell the

very very simple idea of the AI African Asia AI policymaker network. The network was founded in 2022 bringing to together officials from seven different countries Ghana, India,

Indonesia, Kenya, Rwanda, South Africa and Uganda. The German Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development has supported the network right from the

start by providing the structures required to organize itself and by providing the resources for capacity building and in-person exchanges. And in fact, we are very proud of what

the network has achieved so far. It has evolved into an influential platform and a crossber community that strengthens collaboration between Africa and Asia. It has become an important promoter of

fair and responsible AI serving as a collective voice for policy makers and it has produced tangible results. For example, by compiling an AI policy playbook with practical advice for AI

regulators. Therefore, I would like to thank all members of the AA policymaker network, many of whom are here today for their achievements. With your work, you are

contributing to making AI more equitable, transparent, inclusive, safe, and responsible. Well, let us now turn to the panel and hear from some members about their

experience. They will present to us their pathway to AI governance and how they envision the partnership within the network. You would be surprised at the range of

topics because there are so many aspects to AI regulation including questions of interoperability, data exchange, sandbox management and auditing. I'm sure the AIA policymaker network

will not run out of topics and that is exactly why it is so important. Thank you. [applause] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Wolfg. We'll try and keep the

door closed so that everyone can hear all the exciting remarks that's going to be uh made today. I'd like to introduce my colleague Dr. Odille Aayodelli who's the senior research specialist at the

human sciences research council and one of the lead authors on a draft paper that's been developed with AI policy leads from across these five African countries and two Asian countries around

how can South collaboration on AI policy work over to you. Thank you very much. I'm going to do my best to stay really short because um not only is the room full. Um I know that

what the policy makers have to share today would actually enrich everybody in this room. So um distinguished colleagues uh distinguished delegates and partners and know without a doubt

we're living in times that are a bit too interesting. And what I think a lot of us have learned is that AI can't be treated as purely a technical project and governance can't be left as a black

box. Uh we what the network has showed us so far is that we need to think holistically about how to build responsive AI policy and systems. So as um Rachel introduced me, I'm Odila

Aayodle from the Human Sciences Research Council which is South Africa's statutory social science body and our mandate is to develop polic relevant evidence that strengthens democratic

democratic governance and supports public policy. And that's precisely why we're proud to contribute to the policy u maker network. And I just have to add this in before I quickly go through uh

um these our our key recommendations is that the network is so important because it creates the structural bridge between evidence and decision- making ensuring that AI policy is not only technically

sound but is socially um socially grounded and context aware and very importantly aligned with public interest which actually speaks very much to the sutras of this um very important summit.

Now um a big reason why I'm standing here is to um talk through our draft discussion document. Um before this slide there was a QR code and a link and the link actually um leads to our oh

hopefully he can go back. Uh the link actually leads to our dis our draft discussion document and we hope that you will all take the time to um read it and comment it comment on it and um as the

polic makers um speak in the next few minutes. They'll actually give a lot of meat to what what was actually in the in the documents. Now, South South Corporation rather the South South

Corporation agenda is no longer about development discourse. It's about being more strategic and the key items that we or key mechanism rather where partnership really matters are we've got

six of them. One of them being regulatory harmonization. Oh, there we go. Regul regulatory harmonization and mutual recognition for AI enables shared services and devices.

I'm not going into detail because of the time. The second being joint AI skills programs and talent mobility shared infrastructure data exchanges and a collaborative development model

and crossborder um regulatory sandboxes and experimentation uh frameworks collaborative AI audit and um monitoring policy peer exchange advocacy and

multistakeholder participation as I said um the the details of it are in our draft discussion document which we hope you engage with and even though I've got a

whole lot of cards [snorts] I'm going to stop now. I think what's important I'm going to leave leave it here is that we have to ensure that um AI benefits the benefits of AI as well

as the risk of AI not concentrated for a few um and it's important for the south to in ensure that we're in all these conversations and also move from normative discussions to tangible um

practices and with that I'll leave it. THANK YOU SO MUCH. [applause] THANK YOU ADILLE. We're now going to spend the next um part of this panel hearing from representatives from each

of the countries here. These are people who have been leading AI policy development in their respective countries. They're going to talk to us a little bit about their experiences in

developing AI policies for their countries and in working within this network. We really hope to be able to have a few minutes towards the end where you'll be able to ask ask questions. So

I'm going to invite the first three speakers. Um I think two of which are here on the and at the front. Um Richard Kiari, welcome. Thank you so much. Uh Richard is the deputy director of ICT

within the national treasury of the government of Kenya. We also have Katserina Adam who is the coordinator of data protection and information security management within the Ministry of

Communication and Information Technology of the Government of Indonesia and my dear friend whose name I'm going to pronounce beautifully Cyprien Shamiima

who is the program manager of the AI scaling hub within the center for the fourth industrial revolution within Rwanda. So Richard, if I could invite you to provide your remarks first and

then Katarina and Cyprien after that. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you Rachel for that kind introduction. Uh my name is Richard Kerry. Sorry

I'm quite tall and she's Yeah, from my country we're quite tall. I come from Republic of Kenya. Uh that is in East Africa. those of you who are trying to figure out where it is in the

map and I was in charge of policy development at the minister of ICT in Kenya before I moved out to the national treasury. Now our journey in AI policy development

started in earnest around 2022 and with general support from development partners like Giz, we try to come with uh we called all the stakeholders together so that we can

come up with uh an AI policy but it never became an AI policy because the concept was still new and many people started saying that you want to legislate something, you want to

bring rules on something which you don't even understand. So they said let us start with the strategy first then we watch what other countries are doing and that is the time now we are

going out to come up with now a comprehensive uh policy. So in our AI strategy one of the issues that arose was actually on the infrastructure we

actually have the infrastructure to support all these particular models. When he had seen so many big players coming and setting this in the country and people are worried that this is not

our solution, they are just being solutions from outside the country and we are not really uh very so we wanted to have our own infrastructure or if you can share the infrastructure amongst

South African countries then that would work out better for us. The second aspect was data governance framework. Right now we are working on a data governance policy because we realized we

need to share data amongst our colleagues our peers not only personal data but even data to do with agriculture which is actually a key backbone of our economy data to do with

health data to do with wealth I mean uh weather all this data and it cuts across all countries whether it's Uganda Rwanda whatever it is but we didn't have a framework for sharing that and so we

thought it was an important aspect for it and the third aspect we talked about was about ethical and responsible and inclusive AI use. We have all seen that what AI is capable of [snorts]

uh disinformation. We have seen all sorts of uh large language models coming up with all sorts of things which are really affecting even our national security and even our

social infrastructure. So all those things we wanted to share and find out uh how can we really cooperate with other people and what are the experiences in other countries.

Then uh among the things that we thought about in uh [clears throat] in uh about cooperation is meaning cross crossber that was transfer I think I've alluded to that so I don't have to take a lot of

time on that forums for sharing best practices we can learn from each other uh whenever you have had meetings that have been very stormy and many people bring a lot of issues and sometimes we

are not even able to address them and finally how can we set up a shared IT infrastructure. Uh we may not have enough resources but you know as uh as southern countries, South African

countries, we can actually pull our resources together and we come up with AI infrastructure which is going to uh solve some of our problems. I didn't want to take a lot of your time so I

have been given a few minutes. So I want to stop there and then I give my colleague another chance to talk. Thank you so much. [applause] Sorry because I come in a mini version

so I have to &gt;&gt; Okay, it's okay. Okay. Um thank you. Uh it is privilege to be here in Delhi. Namaste. &gt;&gt; H good morning ladies and gentlemen. It

is true honor uh to be here standing here with you all united by a share vision that ensuring AI serve our people's uh dignity and development in uh in Indonesia our national road mapap

2025 till 2029 focus on 10 priority sectors um from food security to health but we know that the heart of AI is uh not the code it's the people so uh this is I we launched

uh we call the AI talent factory. Uh we move away from slow traditional curriculara to uh recruit, train and deploy model. We focus on project based learning um to bridge the gap between uh

education and industry. Uh we aren't just uh training the coders but we we try to nurturing problem solvers uh who understand our local context. uh as we accelerate we must remain grounded right

so in Indonesia is currently updating our national AI uh ethics guidelines uh for us uh ethics is not a barrier to innovation it is the gut rail um that ensure our AI development remains

humanentric transparent and respectful of our diverse uh cultural nation uh I believe the real power of this summit is in our cooperation So let's look beyond uh our

border. Um a south south talent hub maybe we can imagine a share project uh on tropical agriculture or regional health diagnostic where developer maybe in Delhi in Bangalore in Telangana or in

other uh country and researchers in uh Jakarta in Indonesia collaborate and also we have like proposed the microcredential recognition. Maybe uh we can make our digital certification

portable across uh across our uh nation and also uh data sovereignity uh maybe we can let sing our framework we must be able to train AI on our own terms uh preserving our sovereignity while

embracing innovation and also uh this one is important regulatory sandbox peer learning maybe we can collaborate um on regulatory sandbox By sharing our safe space uh for testing AI, we can learn

from each other's success and failures, allowing us to regulate wisely without stifling the spirit of our startup. So the story of AI is often told as a race between superpowers. But looking at this

panel and the audience today, uh I see a different story. U the future of AI is being written in here. Let's write it together. Thank you and I look forward to learning from all of you.

&gt;&gt; Good morning everyone. Um my name is Cria. Um I'm from Rwanda. I'm a a program manager for the AI scaling hub um at the center for the fourth industry revolution. I'm going to

quickly share an overview of Rwanda's journey as far as AI policy development uh and implementation is concerned and then I'll touch very briefly on um some of the south south collaboration um

opportunities that we've had um with our partners. Um so for Rwanda um we really started with thinking about what is the vision um for AI um what is the vision, what

are opportunities um and what are some of the key enablers we can put in place to unlock those opportunities. And so the first um thing that the country did was really to put in place the national

AI policy which defined the vision um for Rwanda as to position the country as a global center for AI research and innovation. and we've done you know lots of work um to make sure that uh we are

really like building an ecosystem where AI research and um um innovation can thrive. So we defined that vision and then during during the development of the AI policy we're also thinking about

where is the value for AI. So where is the economic opportunities? And so as part of the national AI policy development um we conducted a study um which record an economic and impact

um study of AI to try to understand the economic contribution but also the social impact of deploying AI in Rwanda. This is back in 2022. We had previous estimated that AI was going to

contribute 6% to the national GDP along with lots of social benefits. Uh but this is a pre-generative AI uh moment. So that's before that was before um JPT really became mainstream and now we have

a sense that that was actually um underated understated. Um so we think if we repeated the exercise it's probably going to be um a lot more but along with you know that exercise we defined uh the

priority sectors which you identified to be healthcare, agriculture uh and education and that's where we are focusing our interventions today. And then in other priorities we really try

to think about what are the key policy um enablers um what are the accelerators um and what are the safeguards that should be in place. Uh so for the enablers we're thinking about things

like digital skills um AI literacy AI expertise um data infrastructure and data strategy as well as compute infrastructure. Then for accelerators we committed to accelerating the adoption

of air in the public sector and as well as the private sector. And then we put um we as far as safeguards we also thought about developing ethical um development and deployment guidelines

for AI which were were also published in 2023. Moving on we also um learned that Rwanda was not going to do it alone. Um so we believe that South collaboration is

quite quite important and so in 20 5 that's actually last year we convened the globe I was going to say the content but was read the world um around the global AI summit on Africa with a vision

of really building with the vision of establishing a platform um where we can shape um the governance um of AI on the African continent but really thinking about the the the global south um in

general. So that summit was had the first version of that last year. Um and we want to be having it recurring. So it's coming back next year. As part of the summit, we also helped draft the

Africa declaration on AI um which was launched in adopted during the summit uh and worked with Smart Africa um gets foundation and other partners um to also you know conceptualize and and launch um

the Africa AI council which is um an advisory board to smart Africa for everything related to AI governance on the continent. Um so that is on the national um AI policy development um and

kind of like our effort to strengthen the south south collaboration. Um as part of uh this implementation journey we've had to also test uh the value of AI by deploying lots of pilots uh pilot

projects in health agriculture and education as our um um as our focus sectors. But we you know we learned that you know our general observation were that you know most of uh some of these

projects were having uh difficulties uh when it comes to scaling the projects and this is not just for Rwanda it was um it is an observation across most of global south countries. So we started to

think about how can we have a model for scaling these use cases um and make sure that they can go on to have uh the impact. So we worked with the Gates Foundation um to launch in a form of

this model called um um AI scaling hub and the goal there is to take all of these um use cases that we have developed as MVPs and pilots uh and think about where they need to scale. So

that includes providing compute uh resources for some of these teams that are developing solutions making data accessible but also working with the government to really support uh the

policy and regulatory landscape to make sure that there's a conducive environment. So we there is a lot of things other things that we have done. I'm not going to go into that because of

the time. Uh I want to move on to a few uh examples of uh south south collaboration that goes beyond the global summit that we hosted. Um in 2024 we partnered with Singapore to develop

um an AI playbook for small states. Uh thinking about the unique challenges that small states are facing. Um and we wanted to develop uh a practical guideline for mostly for policy makers

on how to re navigate those challenges such as you know you know challenges related to the the size of the market for small states uh representation global uh training data sets access to

computing expertise. Again those changes are quite shared across um most ecosystems but but they even more pronounced uh for small states. Second example is um our collaboration with UAE

and Singapore. Um in 2022 we launched an AI fellowship um which was um a a thing of this center for the fourth industrial renovation network but wanted to see how we can uh use this network to really

strengthen uh south south collaboration. So we launched this platform as rather this program as um a platform for collaborating and making sure that we can learn from each other's experience

to strengthen each other's ecosystem. Uh and as a result of that initiative um last year Rwanda actually mandated that all civil servants take um an AI fluency and literacy course. Um and we worked

with um UAE center and uh um the Dubai Center for AI to have over 100 thou,000 civil servants in Rwanda take um this certification course from from the platform in um at the at the Dubai

Center for AI um 1 million prompters um program. Um so you know learning from really like learning from this experience um of South South collaboration and our um contribution to

making sure that we you know we can collaborate. um we we've learned that there is lots of benefits and you know there are tangible outputs uh at least from our own collaboration with within

Africa but also beyond Africa in places such as uh UAE and Singapore um and you know we really recommend that um we invest a lot more resources and effort in supporting these type of types of of

collaboration that's why at the AI scaling hub we have a dedicated work stream which is around uh knowledge sharing um we are position mentioning it as a learning node um where different uh

policy makers but also implementers and technical experts that are implementing solutions in different spaces uh could really collaborate and share their knowledge um and the global air summit

is coming uh back again next year. Um so we really encourage uh partners to to join us and support these types of platforms over. [applause] Thank you so much colleagues. I'm going

to invite the next set of speakers to come and and join me at the front. Uh Miss Rama Devi Lanka who is the lead at the frontier tech hub for state-led engagement within NITI AOG within the

government of India. uh Miss Irene Karungi Seito Leco who is the senior ICT infrastructure engineer within the ministry of ICT and national guidance in the government of Rwanda. Uh Missazi

Vuvuzza who is the director of cyber security within the department of dig uh communications and digital technologies of South Africa and Mr. Maxwell Ababio,

head of technology and ethics within the data protection commission of Ghana. So, um, Miss Lanka, if I would you like to speak from that?

&gt;&gt; Wonderful. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Hello. Good afternoon, everyone. Are you all listening or bored? Yeah. Uh well um I thank HR HSRC and GIS pay way forward for giving us this

opportunity to share our experiences, our policies, our initiatives with each other with different nations today and this is I think third or fourth time I'm actually part of these uh discussions

and it's a great learning platform you know for different countries. So I'll just touch upon um the national policy in India for the sake of our you know international visitors here and also

what we are doing in NPIO in terms of AI specifically. So uh I'm Ramadi Vilanka. I earlier I worked uh I led the emerging technologies hub in the state of Telangana and recently moved to Nityayo

and my primary role is to work with different states in India you know take frontier technologies to them and at frontier technologies what we do is we go one step ahead you know now we are

working on AI implementation and all but under Frontier Tech hub in it we look a little bit ahead you know and see what are the mega technology shapes that are happening across globally and advise

government you know uh what are the policy you know frameworks or policy uh um policies that they need to bring in to be ahead of the curve in those new technologies that's what we do at

Nityayog as part of frontier techa so coming to the national AI mission I think I see a few uh Indians here so you might be aware of it but I still you know would like to mention about it

because it's a fantastic uh initiative by government of India India mission it It has been set up in 2024 with a budget outlay of 10,000 crores you know and there six pillars under it and everybody

uh you know earlier spoke about infrastructure. Infrastructure is one of the key pillars. 10,000 GPUs have been you know being issued to students, researchers, startups, state

governments, academic institutions and so on at a subsidized cost of uh 60 rupees is what we call for an hour which is less than a dollar combined. you know if it's compared with other nations is

far far less in cost because we wanted to accelerate you know the adoption of AI the development of AI in India that's one second AI models again at the end of the day when you look at AI you need

infrastructure models data right these are three things so models government of India is looking at you know sovereign models is what we call LLMs you know because India I mean Indians speak 22

different languages and we need a sovereign model of our own so bat jan and and we have another uh server AI they're working on uh Indian based you know LLMs so that um especially we are

looking at you know voice based AI because when a farmer really needs an advice he should be able to just pick up a phone you know and say how is the weather today what do I sew when do I

sew in his own native language that's what we are looking at you know so models is one data is another one and all of you who are in the AI space agree with me that you know data is one of the

core areas. Is that 17 seconds just left? &gt;&gt; 17. Okay. [laughter] I was just Okay. Thank you. Okay. So, government of

India has set up a data platform. You know, about 2,000 data sets are available which startups, universities can data is another one. And at the end of the day, as earlier speakers also

mentioned about this responsible AI is one of the core thing that whatever India does, you know. So they have set up an AI safety institute that looks into governance, ethics, biases and so

on. Skilling is another pillar. So I'm not going much into that because of the time constraint. That's what India AI mission is doing. Now today uh if you look at the length and breadth of the

country, schools, students, you know, colleges, universities, startups, uh companies, they're actually, you know, doing fantastic job in AI. That's the outcome of the India mission. So now

moving on to the NITI Aayog's role. You know as I said we look at one step ahead but with specific to AI what we are looking at is you know how do we leverage the potential of AI in various

sectors you know for example uh India has a vision of becoming a developed nation by 2047 which is that's called vixit bharat so uh and we are looking at 30 to 40 trillion dollars you know GDP

is what we are looking at while traditional uh ways of you know increasing this GDP has certain limitations so we are looking at can AI actually accelerate that you know uh uh

vision of achieving that 30 40 30 to 40 trillion dollars. So what we are doing we came out with a road map called AI for economic development. Maybe other countries can also look at this wherein

we are identifying key sectors that can become more productive and contribute to the GDP. Example banking, manufacturing, you know automobiles. These are the sectors if they adopt AI you know the

productivity can increase by 10 times and that could contribute to that uh GDP you know that's one unlock that we are looking from AI the second unlock R&amp;D can we identify innovative areas growth

engines that can you know contribute to our GDP so you can actually you know get this report on NITO's FTH frontier techub website so have a look at it it's a very good report uh that's one second

what Another report that we came out with was uh AI for you know uh we have about 490 million informal workforce. So uh they are carpenters you know small works they do but they contribute about

more than 50% to the GDP of India. Carpenters, construction workers, artisans, plumbers, electricians and so on. So we actually came out with a road map you know to identify what are the

technologies that can actually increase the productivity improve their livelihoods and some of the systemic barriers that they are facing are you know trust you know where a plumber or

cook comes to you and says I need a job you don't really trust her or him you know so can we build a credential system for them that actually helps them to get jobs that's number one second can we

actually identify tools that actually help them to do the job better and you know uh improve their income and so on. So that's another report that we have come out. So I request all of you to

just look at those reports. And the last one that I would like to talk about is the South Cooperation which is a very important aspect of today's you know discussion today. So please let me know

how much time I have. I'm really concerned adopting and accelerating AI. So can we uh countries within the south south you know exchange experiences, ideas and

initiatives for example uh uh in Telangana and even government of India we have built this data exchanges. So countries like you know Indonesia, Kenya, Raanda can they actually take the

knowhow because to do that initially it takes at least a year you know to build that kind of system that time can be cut down if we actually borrow this knowledge or you know exchange this

knowledge with each That's one. Data exchanges is one that I've actually indicated. I'm not able to see from here. So, so yeah. Yeah. Yeah. DPI, digital public

infrastructure is another area. India is a leader in this area and all of you are are aware of UPI stack payments you know. So, in fact, we are looking at AI in uh you know whatever uh AI in DPI is

what we are looking at. So, digital public infrastructure it cut downs the cost and it can be implemented at scale. what India has shown in different areas you know Jan Dhan that try this thing uh

so that's an area where probably you know all of us can actually I mean India can support different countries in adopting these DPIs and the third one yeah playbooks for successful

initiatives in fact at theio we have developed a repository of use cases that's right now available on the website so this is a great tool you know I mean these uh uh use cases or

solutions developed by different startups, companies in the areas of agriculture, education, you name it, you know, across the spectrum. They're actually available on a single platform.

So if any country or any state would like to implement a particular solution in agriculture, they can just go to the website, you know, if there are available solution, look at it that

fantastic innovative solutions, they can just pick up and you know, look at if it's suitable to them. Yeah, these are some of the few areas that we thought and I just want to mention one thing

last year when we met Kenya in Kenya actually we have discussed a couple of initiatives and one initiative that is being implemented in Telangana is soil analysis. So in fact my former colleague

Anand asked me to convey this you know that project has been implemented successfully that is one of the outcomes of our discussions in Kenya just wanted to mention that and thank you [applause]

so I mean uh I didn't speak much about AI governance responsible AI while uh that is at the core of everything we do but I wanted to focus on the opportunities and the potential of AI

you know for uh south south countries That was my intention. Thank you all. &gt;&gt; Good morning. I hope we still It's not at midday. Yes. Good morning. Um gentlemen and ladies um I'm so honored

to be here to speak on behalf of Uganda. Uganda is a country in East Africa. We neighbor our neighboring countries Aranda, Kenya, uh DRC and Republic of South Dan and Tanzania.

So I'm here to just give a few highlights of what Uganda to date has been able to achieve and implement and what we foresee in the future for cooperation with uh the global south

countries. Over the past years, Uganda has taken um deliberate evidence-based steps um to build a trusted and inclusive AI ecosystem. Now AI is uh one of the technologies that we're

considering um in 2021 um Uganda we developed a report a report to be able to understand what are these emerging technologies and what can we harness from these emerging technologies. Um

this report was focusing on what opportunities are available for us um with these emerging technologies. to date um we are currently now conducting we've conducted a comprehensive um

national AI landscape assessment which is now directly informing the um the national AI strategy that we are developing. So Uganda we are looking at harnessing AI as um one of the emerging

technologies. Why? because we also have the digital transformation road map which was developed in 2024 which positions AI as a national priority for our country. Um this

ensures that AI supports social economic transformation in our key sectors which is one of them being agriculture, health and delivery of public services. We've also enacted a personal data protection

and privacy law um because we recognize that we need to have trusted data governance in the foundation for as a foundation for responsible AI. Second, Uganda has focused on strengthening

institutions as well as people. In 2025, last year we established a multisexual national AI task force under the Ministry of ICT and national guidance particularly to coordinate policy to

align um implementation across the different sectors um different sectors, government and stakeholders as well as guide ethical governance. At the same time, Uganda we have invested in

capacity building um not just for public servants such as myself but also for the citizens. So these are different courses but we've also enhanced most of our high institutions of learning are now setting

up different laboratories undertaking lots of research to be able to come up with AI solutions to solve some of our key problems. Thirdly Uganda is aligning also with global standards and ethical

frameworks. Um currently Uganda we are undertaking a readiness uh assessment for ethical AI. Um we're doing this together with support with UNESCO and we are also uh currently supporting the

part of the membership of looking at global AI supervisory networks. The ministry of vicity is the spearheading on this from Uganda side. Um we also hosted the global AI innovation movement

and evolution conference in Campala recently um which shows that Uganda we are doing our best to position our country as a regional uh platform for dialogue on responsible AI. So looking

forward what are we looking forward in terms of um providing immense value in u we are looking at deeper cooperation with partners across Africa and Asia. particularly we are learning from

several of the south global south countries such as India um currently our national ID u national ID card was actually developed based on the shared uh principles for DPI but we're also

looking at um learning more a bit more on how trusted digital identity can enable secure and scalable AIdriven services we're also looking at having closer

policy collaboration among global south countries such as um harmonized governance approaches. So we cannot have silos but how do we harmonize these approaches? One of them is currently we

have the ESC African African community that is now currently working on an on um an AI strategy and this is being done alongside our national AI strategy. So there's a lot of uh stakeholder

engagements with the different neighboring countries in East Africa so that our national AI strategy actually speaks and aligns to the regional AI strategy. We're also looking at

collaboration in having common guidelines for emerging technologies such as generative AI. A lot of citizens are now very taking up you know these generative AI

uh tech um applications like CH GPT and and the like. So how does how how do we as government be able to have proper guidelines that um take into consideration these um emerging

technologies like gen AI? Finally, Uganda believes that our shared future lies in joint investment in skills, research and in infrastructure. We do have challenges such as compute power.

We have limited data sets and we also have a bit of uh limited uh skill set. So we're looking at collaboration in that area and the possible ways we're looking at is having exchange programs

with global south countries um some research partnerships um and also looking at shared compute capacity and multilingual uh data sets so that a AI solutions reflect our local context and

we're able to serve our people. In closing, we are building AI on a foundation of trust, um, ethics, and collaboration, and we look forward to working with partners across Africa and

Asia to ensure AI accelerates inclusive and sustainable development. Thank you very much. [applause] I shouldn't have looked at the time. Uh

good day colleagues. I'll try and be very quick. Um I'm in cyber security so as a technical person we don't speak a lot. Um South Africa our journey in AI started

in 2024 when we then had a framework and we've done all the public consultations we've done all the clusters. We have we've done quite few of the processes and end of this month we're taking it to

parliament for approval and we hope to have an AI policy by March. So one of the things that um we decided that we need to look at is our existing legislation which is the POPIA

protection of personal information act and cyber crimes act and my role in the whole AI policy was to look at the cyber security protocols to make sure that we have data protection. So and our

president had commissioned a presidential commission on for which then led to the development of AI hubs and that also led to us having to have the policy. So we partnered with the

universities uh four of them. So we have four AI hubs and we're hoping to have more uh once we have the policy. So the process is quite very long and I think the colleagues

have also touched on some of the issues but I won't go to them because it's the same issues that we face especially with African countries. So um now I would like to look at the south to south

corporation which is very critical for us to shape the AI governance that supports innovation but while we protect the rights and ensuring accountability in the use of it. So we first of all we

want we would like to look at peer exchange for the regulation. Uh we can work together to design an innovation friendly regulatory approaches. We can have our AI regulatory sandboxes where

innovators can test these systems but to ensure that it's under supervision then government can learn while supporting this responsible innovation. And the second one on compute partnership, South

Africa has partnered with Microsoft who has pledged 300 million rand um on on on AI systems and on AI infrastructure. I think the colleagues have also indicated the issue of AI infrastructure and also

you have countries like Kenya that we can collaborate in with their G442 from the UAE and we can also explore these uh approaches. And thirdly uh minimum common principles for data

sharing. I think we all saw what was the issue with the covid-19 when it came to data sharing mechanisms. So we can develop use cases on that uh for example on health surveillance and epidemic uh

response drawing from those um lessons. In conclusion, uh through peer learning on regulation, shared compute partnership and trusted data sharing principles, the global south can build

an inclusive, sovereign and innovativedriven AI together. I think together we can do more and make sure that we have a responsible AI and accountable. Thank you. [applause]

&gt;&gt; Good afternoon. I think I'm the tallest one here. and the last with the last minute. But anyway, I'm going to make my conversation a bit straightforward. So,

good afternoon everyone, my fellow policy makers, everyone. Maxwell Abu from Ghana with the data protection commission and from West Africa. So quickly um we started this um 2022 till

now and um there was a stakeholder engagement which is very critical to us because we have to make sure we involve every single party in drafting this and it has been done and being submitted to

the cabinet uh waiting for approval. And um another thing we thought about which was very important for us to consider is the cabinet ministers because when a policy document is being submitted to

these higher authorities sometimes we do forget to get them involved at the early stages. So there's always a bottleneck. We are waiting for approval. We are waiting for approval. So we did a

workshop with the cabinet ministers to understand the importance of this policy and its effect in the various as in the country as Ghana as a whole. So we did that and it went on successfully. During

that program we also did uh we came up with something called AI focal persons for each ministry. If we have Ghana as a data protection our act mandate that every ministry is supposed to have a

data protection supervisor to see the lawful process of personal information. So why don't we also consider having focal people for AI who are also going to oversee the relevance of adoption of

AI in various ministries so that it wouldn't be like a cut and paste and also we did that and there was a capacity building training for prompt engineering for chief directors and the

ministries now as we speak a lot of we are a lot of people are using the genai tools most of them don't understand the risk of putting all these information them when they are not properly or

having an understanding of it. So we did a training for them and it went on successfully on the south to south corporation during our AI strategy. We did some benchmarking with Rwanda uh to

learn about the implementation and it went on successfully and uh this network the pulmanet we've been meeting as Rachel said and we've been sharing ideas all these years. So I think it's been

done and the cross border which is another important thing and the interesting thing is at a continental level we've come up with a crossber data framework which is also going to help

which I think one of our colleagues said trust is actually the issue now once you have trust sharing information becomes easy if not then we are all going to live in a truth economy where we don't

trust every information we share with each other so I'm bringing my conversation to an end and I think whatever I have to say it has been already been So thank you very much and

I think you get to [applause] see &gt;&gt; okay thank you very very much as we welcome in the next session I just want to thank all of our speakers and and thank you so much Maxwell for ending on

the point of trust. Thank you all. Have a good set of conversations. [applause] [cheering]
