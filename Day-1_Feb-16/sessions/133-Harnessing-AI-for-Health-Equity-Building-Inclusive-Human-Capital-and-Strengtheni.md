## 📝 Transcript

samples uh but without taking much of time uh I'll just explain you how this uh session is organized u there will be in initial opening address by the founder and chancellor of

ns university professor Dr. Balvir Tommo. Followed by that there will be a distinguished address by professor Elon Kbush. After that we'll start a panel discussion and the panel discussion is

structured uh in in a very different way. There are two important uh issues which we will raise and request each panel member to do a 2 to 3 minutes intervention. So basically

uh now it's 5:33 by 5:45 or 5:47 the initial opening and distinguished address should be complete then 15 minutes of first intervention and 15 minutes of next intervention. So you

will get some time for Q&amp;A or 5 to 7 minutes followed by that um we'll request uh Dr. Monadal and professor Baltomer the founder and chancellor of Nim University to to stay uh on here

near the dash so we'll have an MOU. Thank you so much. Uh may I request uh founder and chancellor of new university to give the opening address. Good evening

honorable dignitaries, distinguished guest, innovators, policy makers, healthcare leaders and esteemed participants at the India AI summit.

Welcome and good evening. It is both a privilege and responsibility to reflect on how artificial intelligence can become one of the most powerful equalizer and

advancing health equity across our diversity and dynamic action. As we stand at the intersection of technology and humanity, AI offers us an unprecedented

opportunity to bridge healthcare disparities, bringing predictive diagnostic and communities, enabling precision medicine for populations, strengthening disease surveillance and

transforming public health agent defy systems with speed, scale and compensation. However, technology alone cannot solve inequity. It demands visionary leadership, ethical

governance, interdisciplinary collaborations and a shared commitment to the inclusive innovation. At Nims University, we strongly believe that a meaningful progress emerges when

diverse knowledge systems converge. Our integrated co ecosystem spanning technology, artificial intelligence, medicine, public health, management, law and social sciences creates a living

laboratory where innovation is not only developed but responsibility transferred into a real world system impact. We invest in NIMS as a collaborative hub where

researchers, startups, policy makers, clinicians, industry leaders co-create solutions that ensure AI remains equitable, accessible and patiententric.

I warmly invite all distinguished delegates, thoughtful leaders and change makers present here to collaborate partners and engage with NIMS University as we

collectively shape scalable, ethical and sustainable AIdriven healthcare module. Together we let us ensure that the promise of AI does not remain a privilege for a few but becomes a

fundamental right for all that transform health care assess outcomes and dignity for everybody every individual every society. Thank you very much. [applause]

&gt;&gt; Thank you sir. Uh may I request professor Luna, founder, global health center, uh board member, Nims Institute of Public Health and Governance Ou. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much. It's lovely to be

here and being here being reminded of the fantastic regional summit that we had here about a year ago and uh where I was also speaking in some of these halls and I'd like to congratulate NIMS and

the other two universities that supported Ashoka and Mah for that wonderful successful event which everyone still talks about that was able to be here and has brought a tremendous

shift also into how the world health summit for where I am the co-chair of the council uh is approaching a regional summits. The issue here is of course absolutely critical to address and

actually one can just address it with uh uh three short words and that is equity by design and uh unless really as we move forward with artificial intelligence for health

care systems and for prevention and health promotion unless we ensure that equity is part of the design of each and every one of the applications and the way we approach artificial intelligence.

Uh we will not uh be able to fulfill its promise. Actually uh as has been discussed at some of the sessions here at this summit, we might even have the opposite effect. And this is also where

research comes in. This where the public private cooperation comes in because unless we have good data, unless we have reliable algorithms that do not consistently repeat the inequalities and

the biases we have in our societies. We cannot expect that a new technology and a new tool will be able to help us overcome those problems and those biases. So we have to work together to

uh clearly put this technological advance into a social and a political context. We need to be sure we train the people who train the algorithms that they are aware of the social and

political context and that as I said they include equity by design because our health systems as they are are of course uh defined by unequal access by very uneven capacity by fragmented

governance and by incomplete data and uh this is the challenge that we face and that I hope very much that uh the panel takes up. It was very interesting also just before I came here. I was in

another session that was discussing with uh uh public health decision makers from various uh Indian states how they approach uh the introduction of artificial intelligence into their

systems. There were public uh and private sector representatives there and it was very clear that unless you have a clear idea about governance about what you want to achieve about the public

health purpose and outcome that you want that otherwise you will not achieve the results that we need in our societies. So uh I would like uh to uh very much underline also what is at the focus of

the work of NIMS in public health that there is a public purpose and this public purpose for us who are in health is population health is uh the reduction of health inequalities.

We see health as a human right and unless artificial intelligence helps us move that forward. It uh will not be fulfilling its purpose. Thank you. Thank you professor. We recognize the

presence of uh professor Dr. Anuraga Gerwal dean of TVI school of biosciences Ashoka University. Ashoka University was the co-host of the world health regional meeting sir. So we have a very good

memories of this place and we also recognize the presence of Dr. Deepak director international nims university our faculty Dr. Anupama Mr. Anerud and Viola uh we really thank Irene the

coordinator for this session so uh always thank people before you forget and get involved into the real business. So now I request founder and chancellor of NS University S please occupy the

chair uh please miss Venita Dr. Mona uh Abimmanu please uh there's a there's a request here that we should have a group photo now

before we start a panel that's part of the protocol so let us take a group photo and sir please uh let us stand together uh should we stand or sit what's the protocol stand Okay.

Hallelujah. Please occupy your seats. Good evening. Uh I think everyone is here. Uh Miss Nande who is the chief of health of UNICEF. Uh there's a lot of uh

traffic. She should be here any time but I think we should start. So as I mentioned u thank you for the opening remarks and the distinguished address. Uh I think it was well within the time

limits. I said 5:43 now it's 5:44. I think we should start the uh panel discussion. Uh as I suggested the first 15 minutes is a two to three minutes intervention by each of you. Uh then

followed by the second intervention. So the I will start with uh Abimmanu uh with you uh and this particular theme applies to all. So you can think about uh what should be the appropriate

response. Um as I come to the next person uh Admanu uh this is the intervention is same across everyone. How can AIdriven health solutions be designed and deployed to advance health

equity in communities facing digital divide you could also highlight on the practice models or the better best practice models at UNP you have done excellent work in co and o to

&gt;&gt; thank you so much uh Dr. Sanjay my regards to extreme panelist and uh colleagues uh here um I think uh thanks for for organizing the session and and talking about equity as the uh uh during

the keynote address also we hear that if there are inequality and if there will be digital divide then uh AI will going to amplify the inequality. Now the answer is also in AI. uh if I say three

or four key things AI, A stands for maybe accessibility, affordability, accountability and I stands for inclusive design in terms of that. So yeah, I think uh one of the key

aspect is to have accessible system which can work in hard-to-reach areas. Uh again thanks for quoting uh some of the interventions during national co vaccination drive when we were designing

coven and and it was supposed to be utilized by 1.4 billion beneficiaries including those who are living in hard-to-reach areas which offline environment. Can they access can they

register? Is there a mechanism to do that? Uh that is the accessibility effect uh aspect. The second aspect is the affordability. uh do every citizen do every beneficiary or even uh with

respect to the healthcare workers uh around 1 million Asha workers and 200,000 A&amp;M can they access uh these uh applications uh where we are planning to incorporate AI uh so the designing

aspect uh must be such that the affordability uh criteria is maintained both with respect to the uh user interface but also So with respect to the digital literacy and the inclusive

uhity aspect I think I can keep on talking about it but I got a reality check uh when somebody said that you are catering 1.4 4 billion population through 1 million healthcare workers and

there are 22 kind of disabilities. Are you sure your um applications like co even can access if somebody is color blind if somebody is not able to uh view things properly if if there are some

other issues uh how can we make it inclusive &gt;&gt; I can stop here we'll we'll come to the particular intervention a little later uh uh Dr. Mona uh you're the director of

National Institute of uh research in digital health and data sciences. So your perspective about AI and health equity issues please. &gt;&gt; Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Hello. Yeah thank you for the question. I think um when we talk about health equity and digital divide it's very important how we actually look at it and look at the problem. Uh so some of the

things will come from the field experience that we have actually had. Uh the first was uh when we are actually looking at some of the solutions we forget that we are very excited to bring

in the solution but we forget about the entire continuum and uh we might just go into the field and this has been the problem that we've been seeing. People are excited about a particular problem.

They'll say okay we can screen cancer, we can screen this but do you really have the entire continuum? It's just not that you screen the person and then you leave the person. You have to make sure

that the entire referral system is in place. So equity is in the of course we all know that probably there are certain people who will have better understanding of technology and there

are people they are who will be having less. So for example the elderly certainly they are technologically challenged. Um and then you have women they will probably like in the rural

areas or in the slum areas if it's in the family most likely the man of the family will have the smartphone and everything. So we will have those kind of challenges but even if you're able to

do those things uh specifically but ensure that you have the entire referral system. So for example uh two or three studies that we have done in the field. One was the DR screening that we did. We

were very successful in identifying uh DR referable DR in the field in a rural setting. There were like 60 people we identified and to our surprise when we went back to understand like okay we

referred them we told them you can come to PGI but we never had a retina specialist nearby. PGI was like 200 kilometers and out of that only one male person made it and that person also

never came back again because it was too far it was not plausible for him to get back. Then in fact one of our uh physicians said there's no point in telling the person if we do not have the

entire referral. So equity is not only that aspect that you are saying. Uh second studies that you are doing is more on the health education. So one was around how you use the chat bots within

the WhatsApp. It was a fairly successful um uh implementation but again I think it required a lot of handholding and but we had to make sure whatever knowledge that was being given to them had to be

structured and validated. I think we were one of the first few that we actually the papers that came out was around vaccine hesitancy and we had the chat bots in like integrated within the

chatbot within the WhatsApp and any information that we had done was validated but the reason it was successful was because um the person who was actually

leading it was a pediatrician. He was leading from the front and he already had a buy in. when we took the entire system into the real world it failed because we did not have motivated as

motivated frontline health workers. So you have to see like how you are actually implementing in those things. Last is like the pragmatic trial we did for the integration of the like some of

the systems that we had done. We realized although we say digital tools simple counseling might be even better. Some of the things that we see may even not require the digital tools at that

level because what you require even for that equity if you have certain things within that vicinity if you do a good counseling people will actually go. So we have to be very sure how we are going

to be implementing at which level and how it is just not because you have the digital tools and the AI but where you do it how you do it and how you implement it and all the continuum is

there. So all those systems need to be in place. Thank you. Thank you. I think uh a man you covered on the innovation side and the scale side. I think you've covered into the implementation

plus the you know the component of evaluation that is critical. Uh thank you so much. Uh Miss Vinita uh madam to you from your experience on uh AI and health equity how do you design the

solutions for that? Yeah. So I I think uh very important inputs have just uh been mentioned. Um from the practical experience um I know this is uh you know the best practices will come later but

it's very important to understand that when we are building AI models especially for health and looking at health equity who are we really going to design this for so the element of code

design here is very important. Now when I say who are we going to really be designing this for are there data sets already included? are the data sets of the vulnerable population of the remote

area populations of the gender biases included in the AI tools that we are going to look at for designing health equity. So that's the first important thing the inclusive welcome welcome

inclusive design principles must include those data sets. I'll come to examples specifically later because I was involved in a very important initiative called the Edison Alliance or the World

Economic Forum which we implemented in Africa and India for resource constraint and vulnerable populations and we reached our target you'll be happy to know one year before because we were

able to triage and get those data sets into technology platforms to impact health. The second thing is the deployment strategies. Mona and um Aban Manu have both spoken about it.

deployment strategies would actually mean are we focusing on scalable but lowcost implementation models that will be able to integrate AI tools and um this has to be combined with digital

literacy programs. What's the point of giving um uh high-flying platforms either to the frontline workers or to the populations when as you said Mona most of the women are deprived of even

using those. So can we use instead say simple 2G platforms and large scale uh LLM models again on on this um it's very important for us to be able to understand that whether it's Africa

whether it's India we need multilingual interfaces &gt;&gt; so are we already um uh you know approaching the codees with those interfaces which are not just relevant

for the frontline workers but equally relevant for the people we're going to impact and a very important point is like in Edison alliance which I can come back to later. We had um the real

dashboard metrics which had incorporated AI. So we knew exactly how many footfalls were happening in the primary healthcare centers, how many women because you know suddenly we realized 3

months into the model that more and more women were using these tele medicine centers. So we immediately put in an AI dashboard, AI empowered dashboard and chatbot to attract more women so that

the women started approaching these primary healthcare centers. We knew the needle was moving. Women were taking charge of their health and when women take charge of their health, it's not

just theirs, it's the whole family's health. So we were able to bring in more diagnostic tools for infant uh mortality, for vaccinations, for various other things to you know measure anko

issues in women. And finally my fourth point is as soon as you start building an ecosystem like I have done in past in Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh even in Rwanda I was apart when I was in Bharti

AEL um of of the telecom models that we were building for health is it can't be done by one stakeholder. So health provider, you need a telecom provider, you need the government, you need

community engagement to bridge the digital divide and you need monitoring. Where are the equitable metrics to monitor the AI impact where we need research institutes like NIMS?

&gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you ma'am. Thank you so much. Uh Andra sir, you were instrumental also in health AI strategy and vision. &gt;&gt; Over to you sir.

&gt;&gt; I'll keep it simple. I think I think there are two ways. One is to use AI to explore the digital divide. So people who use AI on satellite images to look at the parts of India they don't light

up at night are looking at poverty. You can use the data being generated through the Aayush man system and many others anywhere in the world there will be an equivalent continuously use AI to

explore those large data sets to understand the degree of the divide. And the second is imagine your solutions for people suffering from the divide. And recently we were building a paliative

care system. Right? A typical example would be give a bot that somebody puts on a smartphone. But recognizing everything that was said so far multilinguality.

Can you use AI on the recipient end of a simple phone call? The person picks up the phone calls speaks the language they want. The other side uses AI to pick up on their language, find the right bot,

deploy it, use VIP and come back. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; For the person experiencing the palative care advice and this we call pal GPT. &gt;&gt; It's no difference from picking up the

phone to call a healthare service except on the other end you have a multilingual bot with proper local knowledge, proper local data. And we ran a demonstration where the person would even get advice

on which place in your locality would service you with your insurance status uh and so on. So very contextual local things and if you think of it and you're trying to benefit those people it will

occur. &gt;&gt; Thank you sir. Thank you. I think project Bashni also uh is &gt;&gt; so we were leveraging project Bashni basically on the back end.

&gt;&gt; Okay sir. Okay. &gt;&gt; And India is building the digital public goods. &gt;&gt; Okay. required to do this so that the burden is not on the person building

these appliances. &gt;&gt; And that's I think the best way of thinking of India's vision of DPGs and DPIs. &gt;&gt; And then people using this free stuff

that the government is providing to derisk themselves in trying to build innovative solutions. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Uh Miss Nande, thank you so much. I know

you were uh the difficult uh you know coming here traffic but thank you for making it. uh we'll hear your thoughts and then before we go to the second uh set of thematic discussion we need to

have a group photo because she was missing [laughter] &gt;&gt; because one of the momentos all the speakers are getting is the group photo as soon as this session gets over. So

over to you Miss &gt;&gt; Okay. Well, first of all my apologies for coming late. I was held up in an immunization action group meeting with the um additional secretary and mission

director, joint secretary and colleagues from the states. And you'll be pleased to know that prime on top of the list was equity. &gt;&gt; Okay.

&gt;&gt; Um for children who are missing immunization either zero do children or underimmunized children. Coming from UNICEF, I have to begin by

saying that equity is one of, if not the most important things that we look for. Armed by the convention of the rights of the child, no child should be left behind. Every child should have access

to all social services, not just health. And beyond access, they should be quality services. And not to say a lot, I think many of the esteemed all of the esteemed

speakers have had a lot of um important things to say. Right. Just want to say that I think AI is an opportunity on those two fronts, access and quality because it presents

a range of uh possibilities, predictive models, analytics, machine learning and through that we can have a better understanding of who is being left behind and how to reach them. But also

because of task simplification, it means that health workers can release some of their mental and emotional energy and spend more time looking after our clients, our patients, our children,

our babies and give quality care. So an immense opportunity at a patient level also an immense opportunity at a population at uh you know sustainable development level to accelerate

achievement towards the sustainable development goals. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you so much. I think amazing from where you brought in AI's enabling power at individual level,

family level, community, society, state, national, international level with you know child centric uh equity uh normative uh uh discussions. Thank you so much. Um with the permission of the

audience also because I know you are listening to this very carefully. Give us one break to take a photo and then we go to the theme too. Is it okay? &gt;&gt; Yes.

&gt;&gt; Okay. Thanks. Thank you so much. Um now we go to the theme two. Uh first thematic area was AI for health equity. We understand that it is extremely critical. But the second

thematic area is how to do this. So how do you bridge digital divide? What collaborations are needed? Can we go beyond sector? Bring different sectors together, different actors together. So

from your experience u would be great uh to hear uh maybe I will start with u anorak sir uh over to you sir. I think I mean how to do it is always about getting the right set of actors

together. I mean the funders, the executors and the stakeholders in particularly who take it and scale it and usually we break down because we don't put all three together when we

envision a project. So things become pilots more than solutions. And if I had only one thing to say, I would say that imagine the final stakeholder, the person that you're going to scale it and

the users who will benefit from it from the very beginning. Usually everything else, the interested academic, the funders will fall into place once you do that. Over from my side.

&gt;&gt; Thank you sir. Uh Vita madam you were mentioning about the &gt;&gt; I'll just mention um in fact two very successful partnerships that we had done with Edison Alliance. So imagine we had

a telecom provider uh I can't name them because they're out of business in India now and a healthcare provider that was Apollo who worked together to improve broadband penetration which is so

critical when you talk of digital inclusion in healthcare unless you have the broadband penetration which means you have lowc cost tele medicine solutions that will reach the people

you're targeting and number two for example Mastercard now you will say what has masterard got to do with health equity it's a elite concept but no Mastercard actually did amazing work in

Ethiopia and they brought uh health solutions to community healthare workers which is so critical people who are actually deploying equity in healthcare solutions to the most vulnerable

population with the community healthare workers who were empowered by the mastercard you know healthcare tools so there many new innovative partnerships that are now being worked on I I'm

seeing them personally between insurance companies companies, healthcare companies, government and telecom providers and companies like Mastercard which will bring in so much digital

inclusion so that people who are for example using finan fintech tools can embed healthcare tools alongside with seamless insurance coming to them. So these are the kind of solutions which we

have to think of out of box and and you know come up with better healthare tools that are AI monitored. &gt;&gt; Really amazing amazing uh interesting also is to know what triggered that

collaboration you know any any thoughts. &gt;&gt; Yeah so for example uh when we started the Edison Alliance we realized there were three areas which needed AI

solutions. One was health, the other was financials, the and the third was education. And you'll be surprised at that time um uh we I was with the Poland we took the lead in healthcare and what

triggered was that we were not we realized that in places like Madhya Pradesh and some other states I won't name them despite all the advancement that you know tele medicine was making

uh it it was simply not possible to reach those populations. Why? Because we were not having broadband. &gt;&gt; Yeah. we were not also things like we were not having um uh you know solutions

to charge batteries of cell phones. So imagine for those two basic reasons and it was not really gender issue. It was these two technical issues that was stopping us from you know getting the

health on a broadband platform to reach these populations. We saw in Africa that already in Kenya for example e- money had made big waves. So we realized there was an e-highway. Why not use it for uh

simple healthcare solutions and reach you know with better vaccinations and and and SG SG goals could be achieved in Rwanda which had made huge strides in in um you know many fintech and uh e ways

we were able to piggyback ride with healthcare solutions. &gt;&gt; Amazing. So I think imagine if you could do this with education with fintech you could very well do this with health

because both education and fintech are where women and children are equally involved. &gt;&gt; So I think these are the solutions we can look at.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you madam. I think the reforms in health also needs the reforms in other sectors. I think this is the best example. uh Miss Nandi if uh I may ask you to continue with the uh case

studies examples on intersectoral cooperation for equity in AI. &gt;&gt; I mean these are all excellent uh elements that have been raised by previous speakers. Um I think of the

business case understanding that is critical before you even begin to think about um where and how AI can be an enabler facilitator and and then we have to think of those in public health

&gt;&gt; um who are specialized um professional associations um um academia different organizations international

national civil society who are involved in public health and then from a human- centered designs perspective of course we have to talk about the patient and communities. So those are beyond talking

about the funders and talking about um you know the high high level or high stakes um organizations that we collaborate with. I think these are important people or um elements to

consider in collaboration. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you. I think you really um stressed upon the business case. Um also from the other dimension is how do you sustain if there's no business case?

I think it's excellent. Thank you so much. Uh Dr. Mona um your thoughts please. I think I think I um I agree with what most have

said u and I'm actually surprised whenever like we are in this field every day I almost feel like we probably missed out on that collaboration because I don't think there's any other like as

at this point the most intersectoral point where I feel it's like we just the blocks and health I always think about it as an outcome. rest everything is like you know

generally if you see it is all intersectoral coordination and we have to bridge the digital divide I'll just give from my our own personal experience still remember that uh when we were

trying to screen for diabetic retinopathy when we actually went into the field um there was no electricity like if we had electricity it was because we had put in

a generator from a project and uh if there was a surge of electricity we lost all the cameras. So then what I had to do is I went back to the company. We asked them can you send your engineer.

So the engineer was there till we had the study. So I think we just have to think through the things if you simple like a school teacher might be much there for the education part. So you

have to think because I'm always amazed at how actually the equity and we have just now everything has to be collaborative. &gt;&gt; We cannot be talking in silos. If I do

not talk to the person across the room and I think like just if you look at this conference we have agriculture we have energy we have everything everybody has come together for this conference we

can think about data centers but if we say okay environment is not a part of it um we have to think about it because we all know that if you build big data centers the carbon footprint is also

going to grow. So it is a cross collaboration cross across the ministries and I was recently a jury on the nation building and I think I was quite surprised. Everybody was talking

about the health problems. Unfortunately the health person was not there. So we had no participation from actually medical students but everybody they did a beautifully beautiful job all the arts

and the uh IITs and everything they did a beautiful job how they would solve the problems except the helpers and but you can very well imagine how crossc collaborative it is that they could

think through our problems probably they did a better job I almost felt that I can just take it and implement it &gt;&gt; but they did excellent job I think it is just so cross collaborative Absolutely.

I think you brought a very good case study about very very critical uh I like I really like the two points. One where you spoke to an electrician you spoke to a company because you you went out of

the comfort zone to get them on board. I think that was very important and the second thing you covered is about data decarbonization because we are talking one side about huge data centers but

also we have a data which actually is uh you know increases the carbon footprints. Thank you madam so much abundu over you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. So I think uh most of the

things we have already discussed I'm left with uh maybe two three uh anecdotes which I can share but broadly we are talking about uh convergence uh collaboration and uh most importantly

co-creation. uh some of the recent initiatives I can talk about is uh when we initiated uh uh UI platform after co uh it is supposed to be used by 1 million healthcare

worker typically one&amp;m or Russia worker uh use uh uh or manage 26 programs and and every program may have one or two applications uh running in parallel and

just imagine the burden of data entry and I I discussed with team and I discussed with Asha workers and ENM that is it possible to to uh maintain a good adherence rate in such scenario. Uh

something which came out uh is uh to reduce the burden of data entry the Bhashni and the AI enabled voicetoext uh can we use that with UNIC with the Amazon web services we managed to come

up with a voicetoext API. So I I understand that it is much beyond AI and much beyond uh it's not just a technical but a governance issue but then at least uh 40 to 50% data entry burden can be

reduced uh and more importantly with the co-creation approach to understand so they need not to perform data entry they just speak that okay this is the name of the child this is the details of the

vaccination this is the weight of the child this is father's name this is mother's name and and let the system do the data entry work uh for these 1 million healthcare workers and similarly

when we are talking about the convergence and the collaboration um India is aiming for u measles roella elimination u uh though the goal is later but then ministry of health is uh

aiming for this year and uh we are generating so much of data of MR1 and MR2 vaccination coverage however the outbreak data is coming from some other data set and the case reporting is

also happening parallelly and uh and then there are other disease modeling patterns and then came this this uh AI modeling that if all of us can come together and use uh outbreak prediction

then based on uh the burden of uh or the overdue of uh measles rebella vaccination and uh extrapolating that data with uh the coverage and the uh the outbreak and the case reporting and the

disease burden modeling like the migration and other stuff can be uh this has came out well with respect to uh outbreak prediction and uh this is giving uh healthcare workers early

warning system that okay let's let's try something else because there's a prediction of of uh outbreak based on these uh GIS based systems and AI based systems in place so I think this

collaboration this convergence and this co-creation u has to be further strengthened when we are aiming uh to ensure equitable access to uh healthcare services and leaving no one behind.

Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. Um if I have to summarize it's difficult from all but I picked up few words one was innovation implementation

uh integration inclusivity but most important uh anoraka covered was being independent develop your own models you know

consider diversity of the country and make it more inclusive. Uh amazing uh panel. Uh now I will open the floor for a few questions. Uh we will take uh three questions. When you ask a

question, tell your name, organization you come from and very specific question. Over to you. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. My name is Jen. I read

Thank you so much panel. Uh my name is Gorov Chan. I lead a AI and ML machine learning and data sciences group for Fiser uh APEC region and thank you so much for bringing the human equity into

the picture. We uh in terms of the responsible AI and since AI has been my bread and butter but we still have to think about uh responsible AI and our safety net is the human in the loop.

However, in the ruler areas where we have a asha worker or a doctor who is oversighting about 100 or 200 or 500 people, they are often overburdened. And the problem is that

when they are overburdened, they are they mentally uh challenged enough that they can say that no this particular answer that is coming from AI can they challenge that. My question here is that

how can we ensure that we create these data governance framework so that these AI workers how can we prevent these AI workers? How can we prevent these um mainstream or or the on the front line

folks uh so that they are not uh overburdened by this and they are not just simply accepting the answer because they are underresourced. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. Mr. J, thank you so much. uh I

think uh from your experience that's thank you uh thank you so much for this uh wonderful question I think I think that's where we have to think about I

think the the data and the u the infrastructure is is lying with the AI developers but the accountability is with uh the public health uh stakeholders including Asha workers and

and the frontline workers it's it's very important to u ensure the data quality and and that should be a prerequisite before we even think about introducing AI because

AI will amplify and if the if the data quality is not correct then AI will going to amplify the system weaknesses which is not uh the right thing to have. So to empower the last mile healthcare

workers uh we can think about the process of automization using AI like how can it reduce the data entry burden, how can it improvise the data quality for them and then uh there should be

checks and balances to to see that uh on the regular basis on the output indicators as well as the outcome indicators. So output indicators could be the uh the adherence rate, the

activity rate, the time of updating the data and the quality of data which is coming in which will lead to the outcome indicators of the uh like uh the coverage data the uh uh outbreak data

which will help our frontline workers to take decisions. But before that two steps back we need to have that checklist and but thanks for a very important question. Thank you.

Um yes ma'am &gt;&gt; so just written about this that you know when you're building these sovereign AI models um what is very important which

also came out in our preparatory discussion was trust and trust is not a slogan right so so trust is about so many things what kind of data I I would also go and say something like you know

um the clear liability the public procurement methods um also very important is um the model transparency and I can I take a step further and and and since we these inputs might go into

a white paper can we build some constitutional um red flags you know where um especially for health equity these are high-risk use cases so I think all these

models need to be really worked on if AI has to be scalable trust has to be scalable &gt;&gt; thank you thank you so much Um what we have time for one more question I see

here maybe a gender balance one more &gt;&gt; well I will definitely give you a chance but one from yeah deeply please for bringing the diverse culture where we are with lot of you know

socioeconomic lags uh which we have now uh my point is with AI of course we all know AI is here for stay but based upon the field experience like I'm doing or probably

I'm working with uh don't you think we are amplifying this urban rural gap or public private gap rather than simplifying the solution for that like ma'am elaborated the point they are

probably not user friendly for them so uh meaning how we can cater that problem. &gt;&gt; Sure. I think work in progress but uh mono ma'am over to you.

Thanks. &gt;&gt; I think I totally agree with you. Uh but at the same time you have to agree it is a technology. When mobile came we also had that question. Slowly I think uh

slowly we have caught up. So I know like at this point I always think as like a brownian movement. Everybody is going in lot of directions and we are trying to find a method to it. So hopefully I

think um what we do is generally right now we do not even have the guard rails yet. We do not have the evaluation frameworks. What we generally try to target is what is feasible. So once we

have the use cases that are feasible that are easy and we have a handle on it then we start taking the difficult problems. I think that is probably it's right maybe rural and urban we are

amplifying but at the same time I think government itself is also taking lot of those uh uh like actions so that equity maintains but that part I think we have to wait for the right moment as

technology comes it will be there but slowly I think as we catch up slowly I think co was a big equalizer u it was at one point like government had to put in like internet at every place because

education had to be delivered. I think because education had to be given at every stage teley uh like consults came in for the hospitals. I think at that point the we really put the technology

solutions in place. So I think there will be moments where those watershed movements are there but [clears throat] then as we say slowly everything will catch up. But

&gt;&gt; you have to understand we cannot try to post economy at every point in time. We have to do it. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Uh anyone would like to comment on that particular work in

progress question. Okay. If uh if there are not many questions sir I promised you please ask one quick question then we close in next two minutes. Hi.

So my specific question is on the uh data privacy and uh data interrupt. Uh we are talking about uh you know uh India scale. I'm very India specific question. uh if you want to really do

something on a scale and if that data is not interrupt how do I as a patient uh on the continue of care how do I ensure that I get the best care and I have I have the uh ownership of the data

essentially &gt;&gt; thank you thank you &gt;&gt; yeah please &gt;&gt; so thank you for that question I'm about 3 months old in India very you but I've

come into the excitement and the ambition around the RCH portal. RCH being reproductive and child health which is um owned by the government supported by UNICEF uh digital

longitudinal health record system that has already been um adopted um rolled out in about 25 states. The ambition is to take it across the whole of India and with that have interoperability

because we know that there are different systems working across different states. Um with that have several add-ons which will enable you know the the digital analytics enable the AI um aspects of

it. So I see that um as being sort of a a a test case that the world will probably learn from. We've already had about three or four countries visit India just to learn from what has

already been done. But maybe just to say that this is in action and this is the ambition of the government of India. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you so much. Uh yes you want. Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. Uh very quickly just to add that aderance to Aayushman Bharat digital health mission specifically Abha and uh three directories which are in place one is HFR healthcare facility

registration HPR healthcare professional registration and uh the Aishman Bharat health account the unique health ID once all system and that is very strongly uh taken up by government of India once all

these processes will be in place then interoperability will be uh much easier that we have seen with RCH2 portion tracker integration using the ABA uh uh ids and and that is

the good and specifically with respect to privacy adherence to the recent DPDP act is something which will make uh the end user the beneficiary very confident that the data is in safe hands uh for

them. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you so much. Uh before we close um Elona uh would you like to uh comment a few? Yes, I'd like to uh comment on one thing

that we are always doing in our work in this field on digital and AI and that is to actually try and put the element of generational equity uh into the equation because uh we are very keen in

everything that we do that this co-production this co-creation this co-design actually includes the next generation. It's got to include young people and particularly working in and

with low and middle inome countries where some of the populations you know over 60% are under 25 but they are not part of the decision making in their country and they are not part of the

vision of a digital health strategy. One of my colleagues is here to be a survan and he has worked he has read how many 80 digit 87 digital health strategies and in how many are young people

mentioned &gt;&gt; 43% &gt;&gt; in 43% and those are not necessarily the countries with the highest youth population so I would urge that there

are different components of equity also that we need to take into account and that also India as a very young country in so many ways should make sure that decision making that input is also

ensured by young people and of course both male and female. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you so much. Um &gt;&gt; 30 seconds time starts now. global

network. So we all know the lesson learned. Thank you for being around since this is a very sensitive issue of generational equity in the generative AI

and the SM in this country alone. How do you see the platforms not only here but around the world the driving system that behind the healthare systems the

investment driven systems that it comes to the profiling is different. How that is how are we actually enabling

systems that bring you &gt;&gt; Thank you. What I request uh student panel members is you can have that discussion after this uh uh because &gt;&gt; very restricted time zone we having but

Ela if you would like to respond &gt;&gt; later okay they will respond to it. Thank you so much. So uh thank you all the panel members. Uh now may I request uh our founder and chancellor of Nims

University Dr. from uh to stay there. Um so formally this panel discussion is over. Uh thank you so much. &gt;&gt; We'll go ahead with the MOU between National Institute of Research in

Digital Health and Data Science and N University. Anorakir you be there
