## 📝 Transcript

quality is the best. Everything about Japan is the best. But as we see, you know, the societal issues that we have in Japan and the the scale issues that we have in Japan and the technical

issues that we have in Japan, it's become much much clearer in all domains, construction especially, right? That yes, we have a lot of good and important knowledge, but in order to scale that

globally and in order to continue growing, we now have to look outside of Japan. And so you see major enterprise companies, you know, in my industry everywhere, right? We have the top five

general contractor companies in Japan, you know, the the mega super general contractor companies acquiring companies all over the place, whether that be in India, whether that be in places like

Singapore. You see all of the construction consultancies expanding their operations overseas and developing up, you know, similar to Fujitsu, like research centers and innovation centers

outside of Japan as well. So I think that is a movement that we are seeing. I think that you know ultimately it becomes a two-way flow and so we do need to import talent. We do need to make

sure that Japan itself is shored up but on an innovation scale that connection continues to grow globally and I think you'll see it continue to keep scaling into billions of dollars of investment.

Yeah. me. &gt;&gt; Okay. Um Okay. Uh I think the you strike a very uh important point. So I think the for Japanese Yeah, that is

very important point to uh look at the you know our challenges. So I think that in Japan the uh labor force that we are decreasing the labor force. So uh we need a more uh talent from India to

sustain our industry. So of course the robotics can help us but I think the we need the real you human interface still needed. So yeah I think the in that sense uh like I said uh yeah we can work

together. So I I think this is not straight question but uh I think the yes you pointed at a very important point. Thank you very much. &gt;&gt; I just have a comment.

See um I mean I represent this side of the equation. I've spent about seven six seven years in Japan. There is still a very significant

gap between how we see ourselves and how Japan sees India [cough and clears throat] in terms of policy, in terms of risk, &gt;&gt; in terms of uh uh you know uh

lot of other factors which are very cultural in nature. Okay. In the seven years postco due to significant challenges in supply chain they are significantly improved

their you know sort of investment strategies with India as a focus. So if you look at uh the two very successful Japanese companies in India, of course, Suzuki stands out. The second

one is Dyken. Okay, manufacture for the world with India as a base. These were the two standout companies. But you don't see too many other companies come in, right?

It's not that they don't have problems. The fact of the matter is culturally I might be politically incorrect to make the statement here. Uh they are very comfortable working with Southeast Asian

countries. Okay. So we need to really look at how can we make India a great destination for their investment not just as a market for also scaling up

our manufacturing capability. Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia are markets where Japanese companies outside of the west have significant exposure to.

So that is the primary destination and those were colonies of Japan prior to World War II. Therefore, there is a lot of cultural integration between these two markets.

So there is a little bit of history. So we need to unwind that. I think our governments have done a fantastic job. When prime minister visited uh Japan in August 2025 when they signed the next

version of India Japan uh journey. There are lot of commitments made on both sides. Commitments alone do not help. I think commitments need to be followed by

investment. Very recently I'm seeing a lot of banks investing. You would have also heard SMBC is invested in a bank in India. Mizour has also acquired a bank in India and that is just the starting

point. Once you get the banking ecosystem starting to invest in another country then you will find capital flow. So I am very very hopeful the next 5 years is possibly going to be the best

time for the India Japan relationship given the struggles that Japan is having with the other Southeast Asian partners. So keep this in mind there is a history associated with it and we need to work

to unwind some of the things that have happened in the past and that's possibly why there is still reluctance. &gt;&gt; Um thank you very much. Um time five. Uh now we have reach already end of the

session. Um thanks once again uh to the dear panelists and the audience. Uh actually so we have the small gift uh for the panelists. Dear panelists could you stand up

and thank you so much for your kind cooperation and please give them a round of applause. [applause] Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Now we would like to close um the event. Thank you so much for the participation. And so lastly uh the company that participated uh the panelists from Japan

today are also exhibiting the Japan pavilion at whole 14. A total seven company including those will not present today or showcase their uh work. So please feel free to visit if you're

interested. This concludes the event and you may exist at your convenience. Once again, thank you very much for participating today.

&gt;&gt; Really enjoyed what you said.
