## 📝 Transcript

And then with this trade-off also comes the question of governance and also the regulations around the &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; Sh.

Hey, what you doing? India is there or not? Um I mean the way I see it is that with Gemini chat GPT uh being free for Indians if you're with

particular subscribers with with with with particular mobile operators there is already market diffusion. Uh so the one and and and these are very powerful global platforms with that can do uh

that can do vertical integration integration. One uh ray of hope in all of this seems to be open source AI. Uh great thank you for joining us. Uh so uh one ray of hope is is open source AI as

a means of addressing competition in the space. Um and governments are also concerned about dominance uh in AI as well as uh the in the control of the supply chain. Uh so sovereign the

sovereignity conversations that we were having about digital about 3 or four years ago uh have now uh expanded and become even more uh important in case of AI. Uh we have a great panel over here.

I'm not going to introduce the panel because you can see the names and uh I'm going to start uh with you Mark. Uh I know you weren't expecting that but uh you know I'm I'm just curious uh about

uh does open source AI uh solve a problem of competition? Uh does it does it address uh sovereign dependency? uh if it does, how does it do that? And I want

this to be the baseline of the conversation because I think for many people, they don't understand the importance of open source uh and the importance of the open web. And that's

something that you've you're deeply involved in, deeply steeped in for for decades now. Uh &gt;&gt; oh, I'm that old. Um well, thank you for joining us and thank you Enigo for for

agreeing to host the panel. Um, I I guess I do start with that premise that [snorts] if we care about sovereignty and and I do as an individual, as somebody who, you know, runs a tech

company, an organization, and also as a Canadian in my own country, I care about sovereignty and how technology relates to it. And one of the challenges and I think opportunities in the fact that

sovereignty is such a big topic at at this event. Um the challenge is I think you ask 10 people what sovereignty means, you're going to get 11 answers. And you know really I think we're

working through the question of what is it that we want. And I think at the heart of it it really is control over our own destiny at that individual level at that organizational level at a at a

national level. And being in a world where technology is really centralizing even more than it did in the previous era of the web, that makes it harder to imagine how we have control. Is it

centralizing in a few not only countries but even just regions of particular countries? And if we want to have sort of economic control, control over how our societies use technology, that

centralization actually is really uh a barrier, a threat to sovereignty. And so that's where the open web and open source really are quite interesting is at the heart of the open web and

Misilla obviously has been a champion of the open web forever. uh and the idea of open source is that anybody anywhere can create anything on their own terms and keep it for themselves. And of course

there's problems with that too. But at the heart of it, it is really uh designed and almost the definition of creating technology in a way that allows you to have a better chance at

sovereignty. And I say that phrasing quite specifically because it's not really the technology that matters in sovereignty, but the way that we make the technology does matter in terms of

us being able to take control and have agency for ourselves. So maybe I'll just say a little bit in the in the context of AI and then pass it back to the other panelists. You know

why does sort of this value of openness that I can take a piece of technology use it on my own terms own it for myself even if somebody else created it I can study it I can transform it why does

that matter in the and how does it matter in the context of AI pretty much the same way but it is more complicated because we're not in software economics we're not in a world where I can just

download Linux and everything just works on a PC we need much more powerful hardware. We need energy. Uh we need stuff that takes a lot of money to train because of the hardware and the energy

and the expertise. But what open source does or what it can do in AI and we're starting to see is allow us to share in covering some of those costs, leverage what other people

have built already and take it further. And so I would think as governments, as companies, as individuals, we want to, and we'll dig into this more in the panel, look at how to build this kind of

commons in a way that helps our economies, helps our countries in the AI era in a way that is similar to but takes advantage or looks at the reality of how things work today uh moving

forward. So I won't go further than that because I think we'll get into it more deeply, but I think we have an opportunity to build something really exciting for sovereignty with open

source AI and I think we have real risks with the level of centralization both in terms of regions and companies that we face right now. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm going to move to Lavu. Uh I

wanted to just get a sense yours is a government that's actually taken leadership in in open source AI. uh you've got the Vishwam project uh and in a sense some of the work that's been

done over there is pathbreaking in the country um I'm just curious about whether you think um as India is a large market for AI with the but does it actually have agenda setting power can

it shape um sovereignity align alignment um is there room for deployment of sovereign AI uh and uh in the country or are we merely a market for large platforms?

&gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. coming from Andhra Pradesh or CM he's much very much a techsavvy guy even today while I'm here um in Andhra

Pradesh Bill Gates is visiting uh and he's trying he's trying to our CM is trying to talk with him on how we can actually leverage AI in um uh in sectors like agriculture

medicine healthcare these are the things that he is talking about so he's at the forefront and uh on the other side he's already talking about quantum and everything so we are southern south

Indian states primarily Andhra Pradesh we are there we understand what's happening and we trying to be the first mover but at the same time where are we as a country there are two ways to go

one uh what happened with the software industry if you have seen from 80s to 2010 2015 15 there are a lot of big companies that have come up in India software services uh and uh like TCS VRO

and all this huge valuations and everything but if you have asked them what are the products that you have developed they haven't it's more about servicing

the other uh country products from the other countries so that is what one uh uh parallel I can say and the other one is uh when we talk about the UPI UPI was developed in India for the Indian

market. These are these are the two things that I can but UPI is a regulated space. &gt;&gt; Yes, that's what um &gt;&gt; that's that there's a regulatory

advantage over here. How does this play out in AI? &gt;&gt; That's exactly uh if you you these are the two examples that I can quote here. One is the software where we are

servicing on the other side you have EPI which is very much regulated. I think we need to find good you know play both of these things going forward rather than just going on one thing and living the

other other way. So going forward I think uh we need to have if you have if we're talking about air sovereignity and everything we after what happened in the last one year what we have seen with the

trade wars and how uh where we reach right now with various trade deals I think uh India is producing enough data enough enough tokens uh of people are producing enough tokens in India. I

think we need to going forward we need to have our own LLMs but at the same time we need to if we should be very lightly regulated not say don't say that I'm going to regulate everything like

what China is doing we have to be rightly lightly regulated maybe give few of the sectors to be regulated like healthcare education those things but rest of it to be light regulated so that

the foreign companies also can come and actually you know use this data create the algorithms L&amp;Ms and everything but at the same time give um that's sort of a uh encouragement for the private

players in India also to actually go and play around that. So I think uh we need to have both of these things going rather than have too much regulation, too much of uh uh open AI you know we

need to find a balance in in these two things going forward. &gt;&gt; Uh Mark uh wanted to get a sense from you about uh you know you've argued that open source can be a key avenue for

sovereign AI but it's not a guarantee. uh what are the minimum conditions that have to be true uh in terms of capability, governance, ecosystem maturity for o openness to actually uh

translate into autonomy rather than just a symbolic dependence, right? So what does open look like to you? &gt;&gt; Thanks for the question and it's

[clears throat] great to be here with this with this audience. Um, you know, I like how Mark Surman um framed the the the approach which is um open source gives a better chance at sovereignty and

control. And I think the better chance is really what I'd like to focus on because &gt;&gt; would you hold the mic up? &gt;&gt; Sure. Because um you know a better

chance of sovereignty. What does that mean? It kind of also means that open source if you see open source through a sociotechnical lens where there's the technology and the um the the social

aspects working together in tandem to create the final um technology itself then it's it's clear that open source does um mean more transparency um creates more optionality for developers

and builders but there is no guarantee um open source by itself does not automatically um lead to accountability, agency or resilience. And for that to had to happen, there needs to be a

concerted effort from the open source community and others to really galvanize around these tools to make them work as well, maybe better, maybe better in certain circumstances and sort of um um

you know, maybe sort of you know in resource low resource languages, etc. um than the competition which could work just as well or even better in certain circumstances as well. So the approach

that we take at the responsible AI future foundation which is a new foundation um we really look to the countries themselves to ask them you know what are your needs what are your

capabilities across the entire AI stack not just the models but the compute infrastructure all the way up to the application level and really do a deep dive and analysis to understand

readiness um to understand um um you know the the ability to adopt different technologies again along the stack because it could be that a need might require open source. It could be that a

need might require renting a proprietary model. Um and there's a sort of you know spectrum between one and the other that I think really if you really need to um you know understand the nuances and the

very specific context dependent aspects within each nation. Uh Joel, should countries choose sovereign AI or should they choose open-source AI to deliver on the on

sovereignity? Because we've seen uh over the last few days and there's a big launch planned I think for later today um India is launching Serbam AI uh and they've been rolling out different

products and services over the last week to I think today's day 10 or 14 day days of rollouts for them. So they've timed it for this conference. Um I'm just curious about that choice between

sovereign AI and sovereignity through open source AI. Uh what should governments choose? When should they choose these? Um what should be the conditions in which

one one is better than the other? &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; All right. Thank you. Pleasure to be here with you uh today. I think this is a great question. I I think you know

Mark cornered the definition of sovereignty quite clearly. Sovereignty is about control and it's about autonomy. &gt;&gt; That's not how governments see it,

right? &gt;&gt; That's how you and I see it. It's &gt;&gt; I agree. I agree. Governments are coming along. Um the reason to me this is the the right way to think about sovereignty

is because it it applies at the individual level, at the level of enterprise and at the level of governments and nations. Now, now one thing I think we we haven't uh perhaps

put a finger on as clearly today in this panel is is the fact that sovereignty actually applies across many different levels of the stack. We talk a lot about models. models is the one part of the

stack that's actually probably the easiest to share. But actually to have sovereignty, you need to be thoughtful about the compute infrastructure on which your models are running and also

the guard rails and as well as the governance of those systems. And so I really think about the whole stack and the system as being part of a strategy for sovereignty. Some of these are

easier to open source than others. And in some cases when it comes for example to governance it's no longer a question of open source or closed source. It's actually a question of do we develop our

own governance model or do we align to international standards. There are many reasons why international standards might be beneficial from an efficiency point of view. However, there are many

reasons where some governments may want to have some slight differentiation in terms of that. I think the the question of multilingual representation is one that's been alluded to that is very

relevant. The requirements in terms of language may change from one geography to another. And so I think it's it's useful to think about sovereignty amongst all of these axes. Specifically

to go back to your question on open source and and to take more narrowly the question of open weight models. I think the progress has been so phenomenal in terms of models that to

start completely from scratch to me seems stepping back too far for most countries. I would certainly encourage many initiatives to start with what's available in terms of the open source

today and then build from there what they think is the solution that is needed. I'm I'm uh Mark sermon I'm kind of wondering about the definition of open

source over here because you know we saw uh open source should be uh free and free as in beer kind of free right uh if you go back to the the way we used to talk about open source earlier uh but

we've seen different definitions emerge of open source number one secondly the moment deep came out you saw advisories going out against even using deepseek open source. Um

what is open source today and how would &gt;&gt; things &gt;&gt; how would you I think the mic's off. How would you define it? How would you uh what's if if the waters for the

definition of open source are mudded in this manner? Um how do people choose? I mean the the answer is what is open source today in the context of AI is is so many things and it helps to get I

think some definitions but also it helps to not get too fixated on them in in really to be focused on what you want whether and I think that is that control that agency and that sovereignty but you

know at its heart uh open source or free software have these characteristics which are the ones I mentioned before right I can use it for free I can study it I can go decide it's transparent. I

can audit it. I can shape it. I can change it again in the future. Those are really the things that those properties are the things that you want for that control for that agency, right? So, I

can take it, I can change it, I can see if I trust it, I can see what went into it. And you know that the um the old thing that Nicola was talking about from the free software world is there was a

kind of joke uh from the free software people about stuff that was really kind of fake open source. And that was the you know there's two kinds of freedom. Free as in beer and free as in speech.

And it matters because I I think something that is just free beer is very attractive uh but doesn't actually give you those qualities especially the ability to

trans you know to kind of look inside of it to have transparency to study to change it and that's a a bit of the the challenge with and I think it's the you know the challenge we have with the

technology but to to get to this spot but it's a challenge we have with things whether it's you know what open AAI does with GPTOSS or what Alibaba does with Quinn or any

of these openw weight models. They lean towards the free beer end of the spectrum and that we don't know what went into the pre-training. There's still a big black box there. It doesn't

mean we shouldn't use them and we do and I think it, you know, starting from scratch on top of those things makes sense. But I think we do want to in all parts of the stack

encourage ourselves and push ourselves to really have that full open source free speech version of it. If we can get to fully performant models where can we can see what were the ingredients what

went into the pre-training if there are ways we can see what some of the checkpoint points are so we can take it in different directions and I think that will actually just happen naturally in

the market. there's people like AI2 in in uh Seattle in that are kind of in that direction of more fully truly open source models. They're not as performant yet, but I think that is just a matter

of time. So to me to go back and then I I think you need that same kind of open source across the stack in other technological components that's different than the the governance

components. But you know whether that is looking at ways open source that we can use compute differently. It's probably not open source chips. We've never cracked that. But it may be open source

techniques to use compute more efficiently. Open source at the data layer and used in appropriate ways. Open source at the developer layer. So to me, it's those core principles and then

looking all across the stack. But also knowing we don't need to be pure about it. There is always going to be a mix. There always has been a mix of things that are along the spectrum from real

openness to things that are closed and sometimes closed for good reason. &gt;&gt; Can I then just drop a suggestion that Mozilla consider an open-source index that ranges from free as in beer to free

as in speech? Well, there is in fact a publication or a paper coming out in the communications of the ACM on the spectrum of openness uh that we and others uh

&gt;&gt; I I think because for many of us in India the free as in speech uh concern especially when it comes to Chinese models is there although we don't know how much we will have as free as in

speech. Well, and I think there is an investment question and I'd be interested to know in what what others think on this. We do need to and I I think this is really achievable given

how many billions of dollars or billions of whatever currency governments are throwing at compute to back some of these projects that are doing the more truly open models just to get up to to

parody with, you know, some of the open weight models. That that just seems like a solvable problem that needs some political will. you wanted to

&gt;&gt; I was going to make a a bit of a a different analogy which is you know like there's the free beer and then there's the free beer recipe right and so free beer you know you can give someone free

beer but once you they consume it that beer is gone I can give someone the beer recipe and then you have the ability to multiply that beer over time and so to me that's that's a distinction that

actually matters because once you open source something you give the ability to have that multiplicative effect in terms of creativity, in terms of impact, in terms of um building up prosperity.

&gt;&gt; Okay. Um and actually can I I think I like the recipe and it's it's all the things you all said and it it gives you a head start. So if you're a government trying to build this, a company trying

to build this, having the ingredients and having the recipe, you can get there faster and cheaper. uh for the other mark uh uh and I'm just I wanted to get a sense from you about

uh risks because we want to talk about ecosystem rollouts now um and uh when governments adopt open weight models what are some significant security and supply chain risks that you see in

practice what should they use to assess trustworthiness and I guess free in speech is one of them but what else can they I think the risks are very real. Um, you

know, my previous role was at the White House a few years ago and um the question between, you know, the value of open weight, open- source models was um very much an open question and it was

debated um kind of vehemently um within government and outside as well. And so um you know a report that came out from um the Department of Commerce, the National

Telecommunication Information Administration said that um you know in reviewing all the benefits of um the release of openmate models on the most advanced models, they they see they saw

no reason to um restrict the release of those models. Um but they didn't but they also didn't say that there wouldn't be a reason in future uh because the risks are real in you know cyber

security risks and other types of threats. Um you know I think in the agentic world that we're talking about I'm sure is a topic of conversation here. Um I think um a shift to agentic

AI could also shift the security calculus when it comes &gt;&gt; I mean you've seen with open claw that there is barely any security and people are struggling with that. There have

been even just simple prompt engineering attacks, right? That's open source. But &gt;&gt; that's right. Um and you know the prompt engineering attacks and sort of um you know what we call agent hijacking

attacks which is sort of to include different prompts um in the in the model such that the model does bad things like exfiltrate um um passwords and and data and um you know run malware and those

types of things. Um again at the the Department of Commerce last year, last September, they produced a snapshot of um some leading openw rate models versus US models and um DeepSeek in particular.

Um um the model that was tested at the time, again there's a snapshot, it was DeepSeek R10528, Deepseek um R1 new um on average it was 12 times more likely um than the

evaluated US frontier models to follow malicious instructions designed to do those sort of bad things. Um the again we need a concerted effort. Well, let me just say that report took hours and

hours and weeks and weeks of sort of PhD and engineering time. Um, and that is a capacity that not many countries really have. Um, and so the cool thing about open source is that they have decades of

experience sort of looking at cyber particularly cyber risk vulnerabilities um and addressing those in a sort of um open sort of way um across international boundaries. I guess um and this might be

already happening. I I could be ignorant about it, but I think um there needs to be a very concerted effort to look at those security risks when it comes to open weight models, not from just the

government um but also the the community itself. &gt;&gt; Kalissa, thank you for joining us and I know it was difficult to find the place. Um I'm I'm just curious about and go to

go back to a question I'd asked earlier about um choices between sovereign AI models and open-source AI models. Um how does uh how do you how do governments defi decide between the two for one and

just to take take off from from what Mark just said uh just curious about uh what kind of infrastructure decisions contract cloud contract decisions model dependencies tooling decisions do

governments um need to take early in order to uh deploy AI? Well, thank you first for your patience in still going until I got here. Um, I did get to ride in a tuk tuk on my way

here after circling and finding a gate open. Um, [laughter] this is the the the price I pay for being on too many things back to back. Um, so my apologies, but thank you. Um, so I look after sovereign

AI for nations globally and get to talk to a lot of countries about the decisions that they're making. And uh, when they think about these decisions, they're looking at their overarching AI

strategy, not just one component. And what brings me a lot of hope is they're looking at the long game. They're not looking at the, you know, the first release or the first implementation. And

they're not looking just at hardware or the applications. they're looking at the entire stack in between. So that's you know the hardware, the foundational models and all of the uh infrastructure

that goes into building those great applications. And I think the great leveler that we've seen for decades has been open source, right? And for a century before that has been open

standards, right? We've seen standards come about uh you know at least for a hundred years &gt;&gt; when you're talking to governments what are they afraid of

&gt;&gt; what are they afraid of well there there's there's a lot of doom and gloom trust me there's there's a lot of doom and gloom and and misconceptions as well and I think you know when it comes to

you know proprietary or open or sovereign open it isn't an eitheror debate it is what can you build that is going to bring you the most um capacity building internally to your country

where countries are looking to strengthen their intellectual as well as financial capacity uh for economic growth. That's why they're doing AI in the first place. No

one is saying hey I want an AI strategy so I can go build a data center. That is never the goal. &gt;&gt; So so I'm saying that's on the positive side of things right? they had this

growth there's some amount of intelligence that comes into the mix optimization of tasks what are they afraid of from a geopolitical perspective today what's driving them

towards sovereign AI what's driving them towards open source AI what's creating the demand because they can choose between proprietary models and open source models right now and that will

solve the problem that you're talking about right &gt;&gt; but what's the fear &gt;&gt; right so there there are a few ways of first defining sovereign right so

sovereignty could be in the hardware side where you're looking at supply supply lines, right? And if you're constraining your supply side, uh on the hardware end, you're thinking about

geopolitical concerns. If you're thinking about sovereignity with the software stack, you're thinking about nefarious, you know, use or uh you know, influence as you've been describing. And

if you're thinking about sovereignity from the economic standpoint, you're thinking about your own workforce, your own citizens and companies ability to continue to innovate as well as compete

in a global market. So if you're looking at all these things at the same time, you're looking to invest as locally as possible for that economic argument. You're looking to engage as globally as

possible again for the economic argument but also for that collaboration point and those standards and open source that can bring you into that global developer community as well as the confidence and

trust and transparency that come with that. So those are actually very big paramount decisions that need to be made early. Now on the sovereign um do I get to control my own destiny when it comes

to models? You can build on top of and around or fine-tune existing open or proprietary models depending on you know the path that you take or you can start from zero and build your own. Um we

encourage folks to never start from zero. Someone has been down at least part of that road before. And so I think that as you grapple with all of the you know pros and cons of these many uh

countries are realizing that there is a benefit of both end you represent a government a state government are there uh what are your existential challenges what are you

afraid of right now &gt;&gt; regarding &gt;&gt; regarding the deployment like that push towards deploying AI sovereign AI so there's a positive side to it but are

there things that perhaps perhaps you're unsure of are there things that in terms of what to deploy, how to deploy, what are the risks, what are some of the questions that you're considering inside

the government when before you take a decision &gt;&gt; as I mentioned earlier at least in the last one year or so what we realized sitting in not just at

the state level but at the as a member of parliament sitting in the Lok Sabha also what we realized was uh not just in the AI level but in every level uh how where are our choke points.

So you know in the trade deals in everything every decision we have to make u when we have to not just about the air but even the sovereignty of the land

when we have to defend that when we have to make a decision on that we have to think where our oil is going to come from where our semiconductor is going to come from where are our choke points

when you have that at the back of your head so going forward as she said just now there are different levels at which we need to maintain our son that's what we think about it either at the hardware

level we need to have that we have talking about chips we're talking about GPUs we need to have we can't completely depend on uh some company outside of India and you know expect it to be like

that and you have seen what we faced six months back or eight months back uh when there was a restriction for a very brief moment of time correct that semiconductors can't go inside into this

country the latest GPUs can't go into this go into India when you have when you listen to those obviously there will be red flags I'm I'm going to move to Joel because what should governments

build for themselves what should they enable what should they avoid owning altogether what are the decisions that they they need to take and why &gt;&gt; yeah I think right now you know we've

talked about the different ers of the stack. The place where I see a lot of governments um wanting to have more o ownership but but not just ownership it's also about resiliency. You know I

think someone mentioned the the ability to not have the dependency on a single tok point in terms of your supply in terms of your your access to to that layer. Um a lot of it is on the physical

infrastructure, the ability to build data centers on their own land where they can um have uh protection of the data locally. I would say that's probably number one. Number two is

probably on the governance side. So the ability to decide in terms of uh security protocols, in terms of transparency, in terms of ability to audit the AI systems, that's the second

place where I see governments having the most sovereignty. I would say the model layer is the one that is the easiest to circulate. Um, and so at the model layer, rather than necessarily always

build their own, what they're interested in is having optionality, not having dependency on just one model provider because the changes are so fast. You know, you have to be able to sort of

flip on a dime which model you are using based on some of the latest advancements. You don't do that with a data center and you certainly don't do that with regulation either. So the

monol layer is the one that is probably the one that has the most ability to change quickly in reaction to to progress. &gt;&gt; Where all in the in the stack do they

need to preserve exit options? &gt;&gt; I would say um data and model is probably the the biggest one and exit option you know comes in in in different flavors. Um but I would say certainly on

the on the model the tooling I think there's a question of whether the agents are going to be captured within the same layer as the model right now that is looking like a plausible scenario. Um

and I would say so both both of those &gt;&gt; uh so Mark s the beauty of open source is essentially uh about leverage right in the sense leverage doesn't sit with a proprietary provider. Uh I'm just

curious that even when we're deploying open-source AI where is it that uh the deploy that that the the the deployer has low leverage what do you think they need to

strengthen for a good question &gt;&gt; Micoft &gt;&gt; it's a good question this is my thinking phase um you should I come back to you

on this &gt;&gt; uh nobody I mean somebody has a good &gt;&gt; somebody else has a good answer to that. But I I think it it's an interesting question of where they have low

leverage. I guess maybe it'll get to to a piece I wanted to build on top of &gt;&gt; Joel's in terms of where government should be, you know, focused. And I think, you know, one of the places you

have low leverage until you have it is talent and workforce. And so I think a key piece and we tend to talk about these kind of almost physical or you know

tangible digital parts of the stack. Uh so I I either do or don't have those chips and those data centers on my territory or the electricity for that. Um and I you know I need to have those

so that I have leverage and I can or can't switch off the models and you know you can and I think building technologies at a orchestration or developer layer that let you switch and

have hybridity and have the ability to change is really important to have optionality. You need people though to run this stuff. I mean in some ways in some areas

less and less but I think we are always going to need talented people and is you know it's not surprising that you see you know whether it is open AAI or Microsoft or cohhere or any company in

the space building more and more for deployed engineer programs or ways to embed technologists inside of companies because you need people and I would say if you're relying on the talent from

another country or outsourcing to talent from, you know, other companies to do everything you're doing. You're not building your own leverage and your own capacity. And I would say one of the

things open source offers you is a way for companies in your country to be able to have a leapfrog, have something to offer into their own market without having to do all the R&amp;D themselves. And

one of the things I push governments on is look to your startups that could be the providers instead of you going to Microsoft, going to Palanteer, going to OpenAI and get them

to come in and be forward deployed engineers in your uh in your government. Build up those startups that can beat that capacity because that's a way you can keep leverage. And if you don't if

you just outsource it to to other countries and never build that capacity internally, you really don't have any leverage. Uh Mark, uh if a country can't build full

uh can't build their own um is deploying, what what realistic uh where where do they have leverage in terms of what can they do to still preserve sovereignty?

uh whether it is in terms of uh resources uh what do you think they should do you know to preserve sovereignty? &gt;&gt; Um well a really flip answer would be I

I would work with those countries to find out exactly what they would want to do rather than me telling them. just to give an answer um here to sort of give a framework. Um I think an honest answer

is something like um an acknowledgement that for many maybe even most countries um the goal is not to eliminate all um dependencies and be fully in control. um for many countries particularly in the

global south which our foundation the responsible future foundation works um almost exclusively um it's likely an impossibility um and so you know

the the questions about um how to manage both the risks and opportunities strategically um where to diversify where possible where domestic um building a domestic capacity um matters

and matters most um and where to avoid single points of failure, those types of things. I think those are the questions to ask. And if I could just uh lay out a kind of a hypothesis, I think there's a

certain paradox around um sovereign AI approaches which makes international partnerships even more important and strategic. Um by this I mean you know if you take the the um if you take the sort

of um supposition that we can't eliminate all dependencies um and it's likely that each country is going to have to evaluate their dependencies across each layer of the AI

stack. um approaching that systematically might mean that you know maybe using an open source model is the right approach or maybe um a proprietary model is right for this particular

context or this particular industry or even the sector. Um maybe that means using um choosing a regional data center then rather than a transatlantic one. Um maybe that's finding some type of

leverage to make their existing contracts more equitable and those relationships. And so this paradox that um to be you know that this paradox means that there will be there's a

chance to be more mutually beneficial um and interdependent through these partnerships rather than going it alone. Uh Kalista, I just uh wanted to get a sense about what what is it that um

governments today could commit to um over the next 12 to 24 months about doing um with uh sovereign AI or open source AI for sovereignty? What do you think are the next steps to take?

I think the best &gt;&gt; myself. &gt;&gt; Sorry about that. I think for every one of us that's been articulating um the strength in growing your own

intellectual capacity, your own um technical capacity. Nothing is is happening in our tech space without collaboration. That collaboration happens across every border

&gt;&gt; and that collaboration is absolutely &gt;&gt; India definitely needs your chips. India definitely needs your chips. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Those are the hardest to come by. &gt;&gt; So I I think that every country priority

number one is understand where your partnerships and synergies are going to come from. Um attaching into you know global um massive developer networks is paramount to accelerating your

intellectual capacity. attaching into existing models is accelerating your technical capacity. Um, as as much as you uh would love to develop all of that yourself, invest in your own engineers,

your own developers attaching onto your peers and and front runners and leaders so that you can learn faster, right? There's I mean, as I said earlier, there's no reason to start from zero.

there are blueprints, you know, libraries, things that exist to get going faster. That's how you start to, you know, get that developer flywheel going. That's how you start to build

that internal capacity. And I think that's that's exceptionally important as a nation. Don't start with like 50 things you're going to do in the next three months. Start with like a few,

right? Like less than five, maybe two, and and and go from there, right? get really good at those and then build from there. And you'll start to notice you're, you know, creating and fostering

innovation within your country um that can start that, you know, the cadre of startups that are going to continue to fuel that ecosystem. And it's not just the infusion of AI developers, but it's

AI literacy. Ensuring that every industry within your country is embracing AI as part of their career, as part of their industry, as part of what's going to keep them uh competitive

in their field. Whether that is, you know, teachers or doctors or farmers bringing AI in in a way that helps them be better at their craft. Right? Every one of us, well, most of us There are a

lot of people way younger than me. Um, everyone at some point in time had to bring cell phones into their life and embrace that. You know, that was a step change. Embracing internet was a step

change. There's a lot of step changes that had to happen. We're still seeing a waves of folks that haven't embraced AI as part of every industry yet. And then as I'm not done yet, one more thing.

Every every country needs to figure out what is it that's moving my GDP. What is it that is my economy mover and double down on bringing AI to that? Right? It's not just I want to, you

know, double down on AI. No, it's what is my existing industry that I'm going to apply AI to. you know um this summit uh there about 250,000

people expected at the summit here in Delhi um and I feel that this is India's uh next evolution from from the digital India moment that we had about in 2016 uh this is this this conference itself

and the amount of attention it's got from both the central government the state government and the attention it's getting in the media from the startups here uh this is going to lead to

diffusion of AI across the country where digital became a priority in this country. Uh about 10 10 12 years ago. Uh this this conference alone is going to make AI a priority. Suddenly every

department every will start thinking about how do I deploy AI. It creates a certain amount of pressure for adoption and deployment that and that served India when it came to digital. I think

it will serve India in terms of AI as well. I'm going to open the room. Uh I'm going to open this to questions in the room. Uh yes sir. First here. Why don't you take this one?

I I have a fundamental uh question you know that I'm trying to address because lot of innovations that have happened in the history of mankind is led by the markets right and by the time society

catches up and governments catch up I think things are in a very advanced stage of development uh this is happening with data this has happened with natural resources we may see it

with water we will see it soon in the space right So do you see at any point of time where possibly civil societies and governments and industries sitting together and devising this because that

takes away a lot of this challenge around open-source sovereignity. &gt;&gt; Open question. Anyone you want &gt;&gt; you want the government go first? [laughter]

&gt;&gt; I just coming out of a panel discussion. Uh this is what I mentioned there also. Uh I totally agree with you. U there was a one CEO of a software company in Bangalore. He was in uh he was getting a

some NDTV or someone was interviewing him and asked him how come India has done incredibly well in software space. The answer he has given was in 2001 or 2002 was that the government didn't

understand what we were doing. So they couldn't regulate they couldn't you know bureaucrats couldn't get into it. So by the time they could understand government could understand there's so

much of it that has happened. So with the with this as well uh you know it's the same you know there will be a lot of youngsters here um the uh a lot of software engineers I think we have the

largest pool of it what they need instead of trying to do so much from the government side trying to make everyone sit together formulate something uh I think we need to open up to them um as I

mentioned earlier maybe the hardware infrastructure built it for them give it to Instead of them accessing those infrastructure from a outside company

for a very high price, why don't you subsidi subsidize it so that they can build on them and at the same time if you come to the data as well again uh you know government side you know

bureaucrats all of us will sit together and say oh we can't do this you can't you know the amount of regulation that we can put instead of that you know maybe two or three areas yes there'll be

very sensitive areas like health or something. So those can be regulated but rest of it give it to them so that the existers can play with them create the LMS not just for the products for India

product for the world. Okay very quick questions quick answers the lady here with the mic. Is anyone with a mic at the back? &gt;&gt; What do you think are the most common

mistakes that government are making at this moment? &gt;&gt; That's a fantastic question the governments are making. I mean to me it's the fragmentation of

the regulation environment. um having regulation at the state level whether it's in the US or whether it's within the EU that fragmentation just adds so much friction doesn't necessarily lead

to better regulation and as a major tax on innovation &gt;&gt; yeah but if it goes to the UN then it just never nothing comes out of it right maybe standards bodies

&gt;&gt; that the UN is where regulation's going to die but but let me I'll give you my quick answer which is I I really think underinvesting in talent in their own countries and buying from talent in

their own countries. The technology, I think, is going to take care of itself. They're investing in data centers and chips needed, but really invest in your own companies who are going to deliver

things in your country. Buying is a great idea. &gt;&gt; I want to like just kind of pile on with the regulation thing. I It's It's the secondary effect of regulation that

worries me. If you overregulate and stifle innovation, that talent leaves Right? That's called brain drain. You want your most talented startups leaving your country and going and starting

their fabulous businesses somewhere else. Overregulate. That's a surefire way to push them out. &gt;&gt; We have eight minutes left. Somebody with a mic.

&gt;&gt; Uh good evening gentlemen. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; I'm going to next question is going to be at the back because a bunch of people there. I can't prioritize.

&gt;&gt; I want to ask the question about subgenity of AI. uh they are too concerned about AI that AI will take the jobs it by AI. &gt;&gt; That's not a question.

&gt;&gt; The second question is that that AI is not that safe to use. Uh we can use uh open claw on our system and using prompt injection anybody can hack the open claw like that every single AI model.

&gt;&gt; I I don't see a sovereignity question there. I'm sorry. I'm going to go to someone else. No safety questions. that there are multiple panels with some of these questions being answered.

&gt;&gt; Safety will come, safety will come. &gt;&gt; As we are talking about the open source, I would like to discuss about the hardware open source. Like currently GPU market is quite regulated by the big

companies like Nvidia and AMD. So we need some open source on the like designing of GPUs and their technologies. That's what I'm asking. So So go ahead. I mean one of the things

that makes hardware easy to use and and kudos to Nvidia for that is it is actually like the software that makes the hardware use go well right like CUDA in this case and so on and so having

open standards of how to operate hardware can be a major uh accelerator &gt;&gt; we have three minutes left a question at the back at the back somebody okay that gentleman standing there he's been

raising his hand for a while &gt;&gt; short question is to uh Mr. Redmond. So I worked in the GI systems in the particularly heavy machinery industries. So uh my question is related to the edge

AI like uh in the like in the heavy equipments like autonomous hall trucks. Uh real time inference is very crucial. So my question is look Nvidia working on the on edge training or is this like

centralized retraining or adaptive training kind of that. &gt;&gt; Sorry I'm going to allow that very quick answer cuz that's not a soft entry question but go ahead.

&gt;&gt; Yeah my answer is I don't know. She doesn't know. Okay. Who else? You want to get as many questions in there? There's a gentleman there. Just pass the mic to him right there. Yeah. Yeah.

&gt;&gt; Good afternoon, sir. &gt;&gt; Good afternoon, ma'am. &gt;&gt; Uh, I have a simple question. I'm from the health sector. &gt;&gt; Mic up, please.

&gt;&gt; Yeah. Uh, I want to know about how do you how do we conceptualize about sovereignity in health sector? &gt;&gt; Sovereignity in health. Uh,

&gt;&gt; I'm not going to talk about privacy here. No, I I mean I I think that while there is a privacy piece, I I would use some of the same criteria as before is that those people accountable and

responsible for the health system have that control and agency over the technology that whether that means I'm a hospital or a doctor or somebody in the government responsible for healthare I'm

procuring, designing, managing technology, governing technology in a way that I control it and it can't be just the rug pulled from somewhere else or the the data be exploited from

somewhere else. So I think those same uh ideas of control and agency matter and for me as an individual patient I would also want to apply those things. Mark can I also ask you to address the

previous question on open source hardware. It's tricky. Okay. Uh who has the mic? Yeah. One minute left, right? Who has the mic?

Mic. Mic. Mike mic. Come on. Pass it on to someone. Ask a question. I can't one last question. I want to get as many people in this in this conversation. It's a Mozilla panel, you know. So, we

need to bring this is community here. &gt;&gt; So, I'm a software engineer. I use models every day. So, uh we can see the trend has been that the state-of-the-art coding models have always been the ones

that are regulated by the companies like uh that are privatized models. uh always uh sort is much ahead of the open source open weighted even open weighted models not even the ones that we have the

pre-training info about. So how do we tackle that? How do we make sure that AGI comes before uh comes through open source through like the open uh through the beer recipe kind of way instead of

the beer kind of &gt;&gt; the scientist should answer. We have we have AGI in the room now. Go ahead. &gt;&gt; I mean two quick comments. One I think the gap between closed and open has been

diminishing. There's a lot of analysis that shows that secondly and you know having open sourced many models in the past or shared openweight models in many cases you share a model with you know

hundreds of billions of parameter that one gets you know a handful of download you share a model that has like one billion parameter or less that's the one that gets all the downloads. So the

definition of frontier actually is something that is multi-dimensional and a lot of the power sits in sharing openly much more efficient models. &gt;&gt; Great. Uh thank you all for joining us

and uh I'd like to thank the government of India for bringing the AI summit to this country. It's it's great that we are having these conversations here. THANK YOU

THANK YOU. Thank you. &gt;&gt; We need a group photograph. Thank you all of you. We'll hand over madam and photographs. Thank you. That's that's

no walking around with a mind. That's I love that. &gt;&gt; Thank you, sir. So, we'll see you on Saturday. Well done. Well done.

Thank you very much. You're based on Next session is about to start. We are interesting the to the previous

organizations. I believe I was not on this panel. I think in this panel and I'm in the panel which is coming down

everybody just like all the case and
