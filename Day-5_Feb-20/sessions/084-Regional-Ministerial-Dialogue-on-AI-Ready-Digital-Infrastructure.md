## 📝 Transcript

models or talent how how we can ensure that it works in a federated manner. Um I think I'll just I was discussing and maybe I'll just focus on one piece uh which is on AI ready data if I can focus

on that and and leave it for the uh uh esteemed panelists on the large number of issues. Uh some of the elements that we are focusing on include one is on how to make it more discoverable. Uh that's

that would be a very basic point to ensure that uh uh it's discoverable. Second is uh how to ensure that the data sets are trustworthy and that would be the second element. The third would be

on the interoperability and uh the fourth would be on the usability across systems. So on discoverability uh the metadata of that structure is extremely important. So that would help to that's

the first element of having a metadata structure which is understandable and well defined and can be uh used across. The second on the trustworthy part would be the quality assessment. So we've

developed a kind of a quality assessment framework which focuses on the quality of the data so that to ensure credibility on the data uh interoperability a lot could depend

on whether data can talk to each other. what is the uh unique identifiers that we have which will ensure that uh different data sets whether are they talking about the same thing or

different we are able to identify that and the fourth would be on the usability across systems would be based on the standards and classifications that we have whether it's a common definitions

and common standards so that uh two sets of data don't refer to the same thing of different things and I suppose this really forms the bedrock of uh making uh data AI ready and that's something that

we working with ministries depend on and uh governments and state governments across the country uh and given the importance of data sets in the AI infrastructure it's uh it it has an

important part to play uh the other aspect on data is also on its dissemination and access on on how we are able to ensure that uh data sets in in themselves have have value beyond AI

and what kind of dissemination and mechanisms can be there which will make it usable for people to leverage them for business for while preserving the uh privacy issue uh aspects of uh of

individual data. uh one other thing since we are talking about and I'm the panel would be having discussions on uh uh AI infrastructure I just wanted to uh focus on uh one thing that I think

discussions over the past couple of days has also come up that the existing models seem to be extremely uh data infrastructure on infrastructure heavy whether compute infrastructure data

infrastructure and every time a new query is put out to the model. Does it necessary for the billions of bytes to be again run through again and and the gigawatts

of power that we need and are there alternative mechanisms available? And I just want to highlight yesterday one comment which stays with me is what Vishal Sikka had made uh that when we

talk in terms of AI infrastructure we talk in terms of gawatts of power. compared to that a human being requires 2,000 calories which is only 100 watts. So are we are we missing something out

there in the infrastructure and perhaps a greater focus on the models going forward is there. So I'll stop here. Thank you for inviting me. Pleasure to [applause]

thank you so thank you so much secretary and I'm now going to join the fireside chat here. um the discussion that we have planned will cover various different aspects of

digital infrastructure. So when you hear digital infrastructure you might be first thinking of the data centers and the compute but we actually want to have a conversation that also encompasses uh

the solution side the skills side uh so that we really look at the whole spectrum of uh of uh infrastructure even standards. So this these three S were introduced yesterday by ITU's head uh

the 3S of uh solutions, standards and skills. Kind of a nice way to open up to the panel. Uh we have different perspectives here today and we're going to try to stick to time but let me

introduce you um to this panel by asking the first question. uh and I would request that each of the panelists then quickly states their uh name and their institution to shorten the time. What we

uh would like to hear from each of you is that from your vantage point, what do you see as the most critical gap, the most exciting opportunity for the global south in generating positive impact

through AI? So we've asked each of them to think about a concern or opportunity and then also to maybe link it to strategy or vision. So maybe I'll first go uh to the lady on my right from the

WTO. May I request you for your perspective on the big challenge or opportunity. &gt;&gt; Uh thank you so much to the Asian Development Bank for the invitation and

the organization uh to this interesting conversation. My name is Johanna Hill and I am with the World Trade Organization and let me start out with the the opportunity side of the

equation. Uh we really um are seeing that AI and trade when they work together can offer important opportunities for developing countries and low-income economies. Um our

projections at the secretariat have led us to believe that by the year 2040 trade could grow by almost 40%. So that would be the 40 by 40 effect. Uh but then here come the caveats right? Uh for

that to happen for those opportunities to really be realized one element that is really important is the digital infrastructure the skills that you mentioned and policy readiness. Um you

know we've heard throughout this conference and before the important opportunities and applications in different sectors in agriculture, health care, uh new services being developed as

we speak. Uh new services and goods that are becoming more AI related, more tradable. Um and we are also seeing that that can have important opportunities for the smaller firms in developing

economies and in the big economies also. uh we did a survey uh with the IC uh that we published last year uh on the opportunities for businesses and for small and medium enterprises and of

those respondents um many of them were saying that they're already using AI of course from bigger companies more developed economies uh but even the smaller firms are also seeing

opportunities in areas like market intelligence um so we do see that it can be a gamecher &gt;&gt; fantastic and one of The things that I've been hearing a lot at this summit

is that specifically the technology has moved so fast that there's a huge adoption gap an understanding of how they can actually integrate the AI into their business

models into their little shop right that takes a picture of a product and uploads it quickly. AI can be super helpful in this but hasn't yet reached that audience. Maybe I'll turn to the other

side and request our colleague from Usbekistan to share his perspective. &gt;&gt; Uh thanks for the question. Thanks for having me here. Uh let me talk about the gaps uh which are exist in our country.

I think the uh the first one is uh unequal access to compute capacities and I think and advanced AI digital skills. So in that sense uh these foundations play crucial role because if you uh we

uh l like uh uh if you don't bridge those gaps will be many countries nations will be just the consumers of AI rather than uh creators of AI value. So in that sense is advancing uh strategic

ideas. First one is developing u human u AI skills AI skills. First of all we we have launched our program 5 million AI leaders program with our partners with UAA UA UAE. Uh so this uh program covers

uh uh all status of the our nation starting from students professionals and public servants. So uh we not concentrating on the on the tech sector but also we try to uh cover all the

spheres of our uh nation and secondly we are developing our infrastructure. Uh for that reason uh our government is allocating uh around 200 million USD. So to create our own government data data

center with supercomputers GPUs acquiring from Nvidia and also uh we are working with uh data world it's Saudi Arabian company uh to create energy efficient uh uh data center which which

is based on the renewable energy uh it is a very big project it's around 5 billion USD and it will be uh the data center will be put into operation within two three years hopefully and also we

are trying to develop our government uh strategy uh we adopted AI strategy 2030 uh last year and uh this by uh by the year 2030 we're trying uh to get the uh uh AI relied

products by five u 1.5 billion USD so overall All these gaps must must be brided and at the end we'll get the uh idea is to get AI must be human centered and uh serve for the welfare.

&gt;&gt; Fantastic. So u either by coincidence or planning you touched on the 3s the solutions the skills and the standards the policies. Fantastic. Thank you. So a very comprehensive view with multiprong

strategy that uh you didn't introduce yourself so I just say you're with the ministry of digital technology and uh an institution quite focus the center of the development of AI and the digital

economy. Fantastic. Okay, let me turn back to this side. So from Indonesia we have um someone who's actually in this skills domain. Uh would you like to share with us what you from your vantage

point perceive as the key opportunity or challenge? &gt;&gt; All right. Thank you. Uh hi everyone. Uh I am uh professor Ham Brieza. Uh I am the co-chair of the national AI road map

uh Indonesia 20330. uh and also I am the president of the collaborative research and industrial innovation in artificial intelligence the organization that uh was founded uh

in 2020 when we launched our first national AI strategy towards Indonesia 2045 that is the visions and I think AI will take us there really so uh from my vantage point I think uh we

uh we have no uh we need to move beyond numbers you know even though we understood that uh AI economy will create it uh millions of uh jobs uh and also uh potential economy of up to one

trillion. So from my fantas point from the uh Indonesian perspective global south there are basically triple deficit uh in terms of uh what we are going to you know uh it is the most challenging

one. The first one is that about certainly about the data and infrastructures, the compute infrastructures. uh we are still lacking uh the connectivity uh the networks but

uh as I have uh marked down here you know uh in order for us to smooth up all the AI use cases for public services for health services for agricultures and many other things you need to uh

basically solve this uh triple deficit and that is also So regarding how you need to develop the AI talents uh uh I I am uh there is a uh a significant lack uh and uh scarcity of high quality

uh localized uh data set tailored to Indonesia as well as shortage of AI skilled talents that limits the capacity of a long-term innovations capac capabilities.

So our government is addressing these gaps uh through the the national road map that I uh co-chair and our primary concern is the how the digital divide

and how the AI divide which is created by this uh you know generative AI agentic AI uh towards many of the the public sectors in Indonesia uh in and general in the global self

that we can tackle uh so that uh uh while there is 9 to2% of our uh skill knowledge uh worker but we are still uh using you know a very basic uh AI tools and needs to be aware

of all the and uh all the risks uh you know applied to the output of this uh AI tools. So those those things are that I think uh will uh be my point of view uh towards closing the gaps for the uh

global south and especially for Indonesia. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. And it's of course one of the most populous countries in Southeast Asia with a very young

workforce &gt;&gt; 270 millions. &gt;&gt; Yes. and uh startup uh buzz in Indonesia is also palpable. So, lots of potential in Indonesia. Last but not least, I want

to go to our um Asian Development Bank country director um for India, Mio, can I request you to &gt;&gt; share your views? &gt;&gt; Thank you. From ADB's perspective, of

course, foundation is important. We need to have a power supply stable power supply and the devices that people have access to and and re reliable broadband even in our office. So that's a

foundation but we are in India do we expect India to put so much money on foundation to have a ground level impact but India has a scale. So what we need to focus is as

others already said is a service. So we work on agriculture sector, water supply and uh even irrigation sector where AP is uh AI is widely applied because of the scale in the of the people that we

have in a global source. Why we work on the foundational infrastructure we at the same time we really have to work on how AI can be applied at the service level and this is where ADB would like

to support. Thanks. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Mio. Um, so we have, as you can see, different perspectives at the same space of how do we get at grappling with this massive development

opportunity that AI represents. Uh, for this first round of questions after the opening, let's go into the foundations a little bit. I want to go to Uspekistan again and you already mentioned you have

uh ambitions on infrastructure policy and skills. Now how do you actually balance this in terms of priority setting? Can you go for all of them all at once? How do you finance it? Do you

does this keep you up at night? How you balance these three different strategic objectives? It's a tough question because we are developing nation and uh

we money is also always is element for us. So anyway our uh our government trying to uh uh trying to allocate enough resources so we can uh cover all the aspects of AI development to do to

create the AI ecosystem. First one as I already mentioned it's a strategy 2030 which uh sets the uh our priorities which is human centered AI and secondly uh with the uh

government try trying to allocate enough resources overall now uh the government announced about uh 300 million USD for development of AI and this uh the money go uh goes to uh first of all is uh

implementing uh projects AI projects in the government sector in the social sphere, healthcare, education, transportation, uh uh cyber security and etc. and also

government is trying to uh provide the necessary infrastructure building with building data centers acquiring GPUs and also we are now creating a data lake which which will be uh collecting the

data of the government sector. So uh uh SMMES startups and other uh who who wants the data they can use uh those data for for free or for some for some money usually it's free uh and uh

anyway uh we're trying to work with other countries as I already said that we are we have a good project 5 million AI leaders so uh United Arab Emirates uh they helping us to to uh helped us to

build this program and it was launched now over 1 million people already registered and uh go to training certifications there. So uh also we are uh trying to uh uh attract foreign

foreign investments and now government announced uh very good uh in tax incentives and other incentives to uh for example if you are want to invest in in knowbakistan uh and try want to build

a data center which cost over 100 million USD you will get very cheap uh electricity and tax intense and customs uh exempts and etc. So uh government trying to balance uh with

cautiously but still providing uh necessary conditions for the EOS to to build AI ecosystem. &gt;&gt; Very impressive. And since I had the opportunity to chat with somebody else

from USPakistan this week, I also know that in your KPI as a public servant, AI roll it out has entered that KPI space. So that's always going to make a difference.

&gt;&gt; Uh let's go back to Indonesia. Now I'm going to you're of course skills is your comfort zone, but can I ask you about the infrastructure side? Uh I know that the hyperscalers, the big cloud

companies, international cloud companies have invested significantly in Indonesia now. How do you see that now moving into the AI age and is there a lot of activity on additional infrastructure

buildout? What do you see happening in that? &gt;&gt; Yes. uh so I I see this uh questions and I'm really eager to answer this because uh suddenly our in

infrastructure is undergoing a uh transformation really uh to meet the demands of the AI uh demand and certainly with the availability of uh many of these uh new infrastructures

was coming out of the government and also from the business. Uh I think we will get there now benchmarking with many other countries. uh including you know in the regional

Assean uh take for example uh the presence of the global hyperscalers uh uh in in in the country uh have established actually uh multiple uh cloud regions right uh in Indonesia. But

uh certainly this needs to be amplified because as you know uh 10 years in in uh many other uh technology is one year in in in the AI right that's what they they are saying so how do you can fulfill

this uh uh demand of uh uh AI compute uh massive data uh for training because you need to build our uh uh own for uh for example large language model that can you know align with our cultures. Uh

so those hyper scaler uh needs to move beyond uh just being uh a host for this uh you know many of the uh AI models uh

from outside of the country right so uh and the readiness uh is also being fedulated by our shift uh toward the sovereign AI. Uh we are now uh preparing the residential

uh regulation actually to push forward uh the innovations the investment and uh we we need to collaborate with many of the hyperscaler that and we are

ensuring that the physical infrastructures like the GPU uh data center and uh localized uh edge computing, yeah, is uh going to be present in in in the

country. And one thing that the vice minister of uh communication and digital affairs uh mentioned to me uh yesterday that we are strolling building up the ecosystem.

Uh that means there will be uh special economic zone uh for this uh hyperscalers and new data center uh being abroad uh being brought forward uh in order to you know align and be part

of our AI uh national AI road map AI journey in Indonesia. And uh we are going to uh prepare ourself in this uh uh AI transformations

so that our digital consumer uh is going to be part of our uh transformation. Uh the technology is accessible for all uh even you know the the what we are uh

uh right now uh you know participating in the India AI summit says about democraticizing AI for all. So that I think that's that is a very significant uh theme that uh

is also part of our national AI road map. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Fascinating. And again I I I think you as a large economy uh you have that opportunity similar to how India is also

portraying it this week of really wanting to develop your own uh you know language models and really playing in that league. However, there are many countries uh also countries we work with

who don't have that kind of scale and who who need to look at it quite differently. So the the different nuanced strategy that you mentioned of investing into the big AI, the small AI,

the edge AI, all these different pieces very interesting with this dynamic. Can I turn to WTO? How do you see trade competitiveness evolve? That's really your space where you are at. What are

those interesting approaches that are emerging which could help support maybe the crossber collaboration while you also of course respect data sovereignty countries will need to collaborate right

there's not enough money to go around for everybody to play in that top league so trade competitiveness what do you what do you see there &gt;&gt; so I was talking about the opportunities

of you know trade growing by the use of AI uh and if you think about that growth comes from the lowering of trade costs. It comes from powering AI enabled goods and services crossing borders. Um and

it's also new new products and services that are going to be invented are being invented by AI. And when you talk to business, when we we asked through the survey, some of the constraints that

they are having uh and doubts in the use of AI have to do with competing regulations and having that having a high a cost uh in trying to comply um and fragmentation is actually in the

area of data for example that can become a problem. And so we developed and published last year in the world trade report uh what the secretariat calls the AI trade policy openness index to help

regions measure how they're doing in that space. Um and in there you can see for example that some of the lower income economies can seem quite open in that space but it might be because of

the lack of regulation. And when you talk about AI, I think what a lot is what a lot of countries and customers are looking for is, you know, AI that is responsible. You know, trading AI with

trust. So just not having regulation can also be a disadvantage to your competitiveness. So starting to look at those things that way. And then in the part of the solution side, definitely

the regional approaches are important. those collaborations um and sharing infrastructure for example when you when you don't have those economies of scale those huge

investments coming your way um and then not every single company or every single country is looking to be on the edge of things necessarily but do want to adopt AI to boost their economy and their

competitiveness. No, thank you so much. And uh I don't know whether people heard about this new initiative um that the uh working group on the democratization of AI of compute

has uh come up with ADB is actually supporting that. Um really this has not yet evolved right this collaboration on the infrastructure. How do you share that properly across borders still new

territory and very interesting to see. H can I turn to my colleague Mio and request her to talk a little bit about the engagement that we've had with member countries. What does demand to

ADB actually look like in this space? &gt;&gt; Uh for those who don't know about ADB, ADB is a regional bank that lend them money lower than the commercial rate to support public goods. So the public

goods as a digital infrastructure is included in that. But the tricky part is this slightly lower than the commercial rate. So what the government ask us is why do we have to borrow from ADB? What

is the value addition that you have? So I always talk about the first thing is we are here to mobilize a private capital. So ADB is happy always try to invest in the township planning and the

implementation also we can have a water supply road project to have uh and that can be connect to the industrial parks and then so that private sector can invest in a the digital related

facilities that's so mobilization private capital is a one and the second is is an application across sectors we just don't look at the single sector project as I said we can work on road

and water at the same time and we while we work on the agree AI project and we work with the cap building capacity of the institution as well so that they can handle AI and the third is the knowledge

as I said we support quite a bit of uh this master planning or the strategy development or even mun at the municipality or the state or even at the regional level is in India and even

including outside India and and of course we always bringing in international experts so that India can learn and also this is a good opportunity for India to expand their

capacity to outside countries. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thanks Mu. I actually had a follow-up question for you that would have touched on this drisking and catalyzing

investment topic. Um maybe I'll won't let you ask you to repeat that now but I let me just add our digital sector office being fairly new uh they are getting a lot of demand for guess what

data centers and you know we we welcome that we have conversations with government but I'm truly impressed with the conversations at the summit here earlier this morning

I attended one where uh the state of Telangana was sharing what they're thinking about and they're really quite uh cognizant And kids to school.

Not many kids fit into a Ferrari. Milk doesn't need it just doesn't make sense. So we need to look at what type of compute is needed for what. And I think we in ADB are also learning more and

more how to engage in these conversations properly. We're learning alongside everybody else in this room probably. And that's an important distinction to make because it'll

influence the financing bit. How much do we need? What do we actually need? and when and how do we make that investment sustainable? Just wanted to add that it's an insight from this morning that I

I couldn't um not retail. Uh let me go back to Indonesia and ask you about um cutting edge skills because you're in that space. I found it very interesting that you're you're actually uh you said

co-president or co- co-chairing this platform uh where you bring together private sector um education sector government and uh as you are looking at that um how is your organization doing

it in practice? How do you bring these people together and get them into action mode? How do you do that? &gt;&gt; Right. Okay. Thank you. uh very important uh question here. Uh I think

so I I I would like to say in three pillars that uh we that what we are doing the especially uh that we chair the AI ecosystem uh in Indonesia where uh the government the industry uh are in

within uh an academia as well as the uh civil society as well as media. Yeah, we call this pentahelix uh platform. Uh we discuss about I think three pillars. Uh first one is uh the talent uh certainly

second one is infrastructures and the third one is how basically uh we can articulate use cases uh towards all the uh services the public services uh if we and businesses as well. So uh

Indonesia for talent we have set at our target uh quite ambitious in terms that we want to have at least uh 12 million uh talent by 2030.

And for us this is something that are uh fairly challenging considering that we are still lacking uh around 3 to 5 millions uh talent uh as of now right. So what we are trying

to achieve uh together with the the whole uh ecosystem is to establish uh uh an academy the Korea academy where we we uh promote to not only upskilling and reskilling uh some of the uh uh civil

servant and others uh uh workers. But we are also looking at how we can uh train the trainers. Uh we work uh with several of of our friends. Uh uh I will note here that the

uh elevate uh Indonesia uh for example uh part of the uh Microsoft and many others uh big tech uh that are there works together with our ministry uh to estab establish this this program for

talent &gt;&gt; and it's a digital academy or is it a physical? &gt;&gt; It's a a digital academy. Yeah. Yeah. with uh the LMS learning management

system and many other things. We also established the Kora chat uh actually is a chatbot for the for this uh uh training uh and uh upskilling program that we do with the the the government

beyond talent. Uh basically we are aggressively uh looking at the how we can nurture uh this talent to works in data centers in many others uh uh startups and incubators

as well as to establish the some of the most uh demanding use cases. Uh so the third one is uh we try to work on climate uh health uh nexus uh in establishing

uh how we uh counter and predict the climate sensitive infectious disease such as balaria and deni and we have established for the past three years the climate smart uh Indonesia which have

attracted uh many of uh the universities as well as NASA uh uh you know uh pollution and quality air quality programs uh to look into this uh uh use cases. So we can basically reach out to

many of the uh you know areas where uh the uh the health the disasterprone uh area because Indonesia is a supermarket for uh disaster. They say you can have the

hydromeological uh disaster, you can have ecological, you can have many things. So you need to &gt;&gt; I'm not buying any of them. Of [laughter]

course, we don't want to be shopping in. &gt;&gt; So, really amazing this focus also on the use cases, right? And prioritizing those that match with your country needs. Yes.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Give the highest impact, right? &gt;&gt; Super. Uh I'll turn back to just wanted to ask you to elaborate a little bit in terms of private sector

capital mobilization. uh you have all these ambitions you shared uh across the board really in terms of infra in terms of skills and so on so forth. um Uspikistan as an economy

uh has still a good chunk of traditional economy but also has a very active startup sector that I'm learning more and more about how dynamic people are around the region central west Asia

going and finding uh scalable solutions but these are the still growing companies for mobilizing capital for your infra you're going to need the big ones or you're not going to need the

international partners or what are you thinking about this private capital uh mobilization? How what's your strategy there? Uh first of all I should mention that uh according to the uh documents

adopted we try we uh by year 2030 we um we are planning to attract around 1 billion USD foreign investments for uh creating AI ready digital infrastructure and uh part of this goes to creating

data data centers and also we uh working with our Chinese partners also uh it's a biggest company IT company Huawei so they so they're also involved in uh creating AI ecosystem in Usbakistan

mainly is uh first one is upskilling uh uh skilling public servants in to help them to adopt in adoption and also creating the necessary uh training programs uh for the specialist and also

creating the AI infrastructure uh like um data centers, data links and also uh we need to create uh to get uh we are uh transferring to uh 5.5G g and also uh working on 6G also with

Huawei. So uh over uh and also uh as you mentioned already about startups we have developing our own startup ecosystem and we have established many uh venture funds uh funds of uh fund of funds and

uh and also there there are many emerging private funds. So they are now uh we uh trying to uh invest in air startups uh attracting uh private funds, private investments. So currently we

have uh located around 50 million USD for AI startups. So uh there they are already uh providing services uh both uh for public and uh for businesses. So uh trying to balance and uh attract all the

uh stakeholders of the ecosystem. &gt;&gt; Fantastic. So you're you're mixing also your public funds that you invest for example in the fund of funds and then bringing in more investment domestically

from your investors but also from abroad. Uh that's amazing. and then having large industry partners that are interested in the market bringing them in like Indonesia did with some of the

hyperscalers you are bringing in Huawei and and Chinese partners so basically it's a mix of of different strategies you mentioned also that's that's fascinating again um

Pikiststan being one of the larger countries in central west Asia and uh and Indonesia both uh fairly large in their region Um and then of course again I want to come back to this point about

diversity of country contexts. That's both a challenge but also an opportunity. I mean for us at ADB it adds of course complexity because we need to respond to these different needs

but from the perspective of WTO uh is there like a specific area such as maybe interoperability standards or AI talent mobility or the shared data sets joint research where do you see regional

cooperation making the biggest difference? Um I I think that it's a a bit of a matter of context right at at the regional level and and at the national

level. Um we've talked about the divide in in the digital divide and how do we overcome that and the role of infrastructure and skills and and the rest and at the WTO secretariat we've

been very concerned on this issue and so we partnered with the World Bank and we did a study called digital trade in Africa a general one and then we did some country uh pilot studies to look at

the situation and we did see that some of the regional work like the ACFDA and the digital protocol really made a difference in how it helped bring them along and to set a certain standard uh

in many of the countries that we studied. uh then we did a similar uh study with the World Bank in Latin America and the Caribbean and the Interamerican Development Bank partnered

with us and we saw there that the situation was a bit different more diversity in terms of regulation and trade policy uh infrastructure needs. So there's basically not one sizefits all.

&gt;&gt; Uh but we do h we have seen regional banks playing a very important role in helping countries that want to go the regional u in the regional way. Uh I know Azan has done important work in AI

policy for example um and other regions are also working in that sense and and I do think that that brings economies of scale to a certain extent. uh it helps you resolve questions on the electricity

sometimes um and so I think there's a lot of opportunity uh and further work to be done at the regional level. &gt;&gt; Thank you. And uh I think uh with the regional cooperation integration agenda

being also top of mind for ADB. I just ask my colleague also to uh tell me a little about bit about her perspective. Of course, she represents ADB in a very large economy in South Asia. Uh, but we

do have regional cooperation happening uh around the region. Mio what's what do you see as opportunities with regards to regional corporation integration on this digital infrastructure space

&gt;&gt; right thank you so again um ADB uh we support India I'm in India our office covers India so we are here to support Vixie Barat so that the India can grow at the pace to become a develop

developed country by 2047 and the AI is a necessary means to do that But again as uh everybody knows that we are the regional bank. Nobody around us should be left alone or left behind. So ADB

through like this through this kind of forum has to be a catalyst for the global south. So we are here of course there are many countries who cannot invest in scale. What are the solution?

So we are here to support the solution and also we support big tigers like India to support those countries too. That's number one and number two is the balance approach. When we talk about

regional cooperation or the work in a small country, I was quite shocked about five years ago. I went to the small neighbor country here and I was working in the agriculture sector and I said I

was proudly introducing. Uh can I I want to introduce uh aquaculture using the AI based fish feeding system and my negotiation ended in three seconds because the government said no we are

interested in employment what are you talking about what the AI based feed will just reduce the people going to work there. So that is a big lessons learned for me. We need a ecosystem but

even we talk about AI we the solution may be elsewhere. So does as as aunt you introduced the skill is super important and then since that understanding again going back to India we've been investing

more than like five billion the skill including the PM setu and uh working on over 10 10 states and now AI based skill is the big part of it. So we are always mindful that the regional cooperation

and we should not forget or should not leave any country to be left behind but solution again may not be as direct as we expect. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Yeah thank you Mio. And we have one

minute left on the clock. uh that throws uh a spanner into my closing with the thought that AI may not be the solution for everything but I think it's a fair ending
