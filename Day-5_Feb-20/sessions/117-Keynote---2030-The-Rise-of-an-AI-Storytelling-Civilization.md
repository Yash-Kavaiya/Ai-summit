## 📝 Transcript

90% of area of subs Africa is you know covered by three plus generation mobile tower but the issue is that we are really struggling with lack of

demand how we going to fully utilize this and and by creating some more value and profits. So now we are you know modifying our some approach to really think about to creating demand

through government program through developing some use cases that's why we are just keep you know highlighting the importance of small AI small AI is not really small things so it is really

about how we can really change the lives of our people So our approach is little uh just tweaking uh to the the user centric and demand uh driven uh things. I would uh yeah that's our approach.

&gt;&gt; That's great. And I think um MDBs um and the relationships that they have with countries can play a massive make a big difference in how the evolution and and the benefits of AI will will uh occur

will come to people. So looking forward to what comes out. Um, Cyel, I know I started off um by bucketing you as a private sector guy. Uh, but I also know um you've been thinking deeply about

government policy that enables or doesn't enable uh innovation and and and and growth. Um so as you look at the next years um even from a private sector innovation lens what government policies

might propel the innovation ecosystem uh to serve u you know uh to to serve the uh underserved populations around the world. Any any quick thoughts cy? So see I think um you know the

government has a very tricky balancing act right at I mean when we were going through this entire experience of building AI kosh um there's obviously for very good reasons a lot of

sensitivity around sovereign data uh what data to expose and if exposed to whom right equally without sharing of data I mean the reason why AI has taken off in a big way in some sectors is

because internet came into picture 30 years back and internet has been pumping you know billions and billions and gigabytes of data right so AI has something to chew upon now if we have to

do the same with government data then that data you know needs to be needs to be exposed in a controlled manner so my sense is that from a policy standpoint how do you actually provide that

access to data I mean walking that tight rope uh where uh valuable data is made available to the innovators while not compromising on you know sovereignty or

you know safety. I think that is one of the policy areas the government has to look at. Specifically for a country like India or you know similar countries which operate in a federated model the

center can do only so much. The real action as we know in a country like India happens at the state level and we have 30 plus of them combining states and union territories. So at the state

level also similar policies and institutions have to be set up. So Telangana for example has set up a section 8 public sector undertaking to drive AI right that creates the kind of

focus and the agility that you will need to keep pace with this technology and do some real work at the grassroots. So my suggestion would be create those accountable institutions

uh who can anchor and drive AI and amend policies around data to make sure that people get access the innovators get access while not compromising on uh sovereignty. It's not an easy thing to

do but yeah those would be my words. &gt;&gt; Um thank you Syel. I think the uh role of institutions um both uh for safeguards but also to enable the innovation ecosystem um haven't been

more important uh than than it's now more important ever before. Um I I think you know it's hard to summarize uh this this this conversation but I will say that I think we're at the cusp of

something extremely important and something very potent in some ways um and and um um can can unlock a lot of opportunity for for uh billions of people uh especially I think the the

segment of the population that was left out of the digital revolution because voice was not uh was not not the predominant way of interacting. Um I think AI opens up that window uh and

hopefully will drive a much more widespread adoption and usage by common people around the world. And so um looking forward to the next few years and thank you very much to our panelists

for a wonderful discussion. Thank you all. Thank you so much to all the speakers. Uh we will just have one moment being given by the organizing team. Um so yeah

we made it. Thank you so much for being a part of the India AI impact summit and just to tell you that the expo will be open tomorrow if people still want to come in and if people are still not

tired but uh we are done for today and the sessions are done. Thank you so much. Thank you so much.
