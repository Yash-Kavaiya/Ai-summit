## 📝 Transcript

companies into the hands of developers, startups, businesses and communities everywhere. Very few individuals have done more to bring revolutionary and transformative technology into the hands

of millions than Matthew and Rajan. Matthew Prince is the co-founder and CEO of Cloudflare, a world economic forum on foreign relation forum technology pioneer and a council on foreign

relations member. He has degrees from Harvard, Chicago, and Trinity College and co-created Project Honeypot, the largest community tracking online fraud and abuse. Matthew's founding mission

for Cloudflare was to help build a better internet, a goal that has become increasingly critical in the age of artificial intelligence. Rajan Anandan is one of India's most

influential technology leaders and investors currently serving as managing director of peak 15 partners formerly Segoya Capital India in Southeast Asia where he focuses on backing founders

building transformative technology-led businesses with decades of experience across entrepreneurship investing and global technology leadership Rajan has played a pivotal role in shaping India's

startup and digital ecosystem orchestrating this conversation is Rahul Matan who brings the perfect blend of legal insight, policy depth and the ability to

ask the questions everyone else is thinking. RA is a board member and partner in Trillegal's Bangalore office and heads their technology, media and telecom practice. He has extensive

experience advising on high value TMT transactions in the country. He has worked with companies across sectors from telecom majors to internet and data service providers offering advice on

regulatory matters and operational issues. So, please join me in welcoming three awesome leaders on stage. And with that, the stage is yours. &gt;&gt; Thanks, Charlotte. And since I haven't

worked with you, I'm going to square that circle. Uh, Matthew, I just heard your uh keynote up in the big 30,000 uh seater hall, and you ended with a very powerful statement, which is that uh

this wonderful AI technology should not be built by a handful of companies in the same postal code. And that in many ways seems to be the the uh driving motivation for having this discussion.

But it's it's uh easier said than done in that AI is a very big and complicated stack and uh a lot of that stack actually involves complex hardware and uh it's hard really to move that uh

hardware around the internet. So if we are to dem democratize AI uh and if we are to come up with the infrastructure construct that would democratize AI what would that look like and uh uh what is

your idea your vision for how this would be if not now but but sometime soon yeah so so let's let's talk first about why AI is hard and expensive uh today so so the first thing is AI requires lots and

lots and lots of chips uh largely produced today by one manufacturer, Nvidia, that use a ton of power and are very very expensive. Um they were never built to do this if

we're totally honest. The Nvidia chips were built to power gaming consoles, right? And then for a while to mine Bitcoin and then magically to, you know, create a super intelligence. But but if

you had started with let's create the super intelligence, you would have designed those chips somewhat differently today. Um that's challenge one that keeps AI very very hard.

Challenge two is that it requires a real specialized set of knowledge. There's a very small set of people in the world that know how to build these models and how to run these systems. And so you

have to ask why is that not something where everyone knows it? You know, if you had known that you could specialize in this in school and, you know, literally make a hund00 million a year,

we would all have studied AI, right? And yet, if you go back just 5 years ago, the people who were studying AI were kind of the weirdos. Why was that the case? Well, because AI was one of these

fields that kind of had promise in the 70s and had promise in the 80s and had promise in the 90s. And then everyone was kind of like, you know what, we're tired of this. And so the AI professor

was kind of shunted off to the side. And so if those are the things that today make AI extremely expensive, the question is are those things permanent states or are they going to change?

Well, we can measure one of them already. Uh already if you look in enrollment in computer science programs across the world, it is up dramatically even though supposedly there's no future

for computer scientists um in just the last two years. And then and then secondly, the enrollment in specifically AI theory courses is out off the charts. Every university that used to sort of

shutter their course is now standing it up and building it like like crazy. And so I think that over time we're going to have more and more people who are able to do this. And so having to pay

enormous salaries for those people, that's probably not going to be the future. On the chip side, you know, if you have literally a company going from being an obscure gaming company to the

most valuable company in the world, obviously a whole bunch of people are going to chase after that. And if you look at the h history of silicon, anytime there has been a silicon

shortage, it turns into a silicon glut over time. And with GPUs, they it's kind of had hit after hit after hit. I think that what we're seeing at least is that both from startups as well as incumbent

players as well as from the hyperscalers and other players that are getting involved there are so many people who are making this this silicon that no matter what the price per unit of work

done is going to come down. The other thing that I think is encouraging is that if we look at the actual AI models themselves, it doesn't appear that this is necessarily a, you know, one company

is running away with it. It's it's sort of like, you know, Google gets a lead and then Anthropic passes them and then OpenAI passes them and then, you know, some someone else passes them and then

and then Google does it again and and it keeps leaprogging itself. That to me suggests that the actual model making is more likely in a steady state in the future to be something like a commodity.

And if that's the case, if the cost of creating the models is going to come down, if the models themselves are more commodities, I think that we can't assume that, you know, the the literally

hundreds of billions if not trillions of dollars that are going into building the leading AI companies today that that might come crashing down. And my prediction would be that you'll be able

to build models that will be on the frontier. They'll be more specialized, but they'll be on the frontier for tens of millions of dollars in the notsodistant future. I I'll put put a

date out there. In five years, you'll be able to build a frontier-like model uh within a specialty for $10 million or less. &gt;&gt; Rajan, uh about a year ago, uh one of

these companies in one of these postal codes were here and you asked a question. um you know what will it take for India to compete and um you were told it's

hopeless don't don't compete and yet at this summit we've come out with a model that's uh by all accounts haven't yet played with it competitive so what Matthew's saying um seems to be working

out but he's putting a 5year timeline I would argue there perhaps would be we could be more aggressive with that timeline so what is your view on this as someone

who is actually uh you know in India working with some of these really smart people who are working under constraints uh but are yet putting out uh some fairly impressive uh um models uh

interesting use cases uh what's life like at the other end of the absolute frontier I mean whoever what what people call the absolute frontier of these mod what is life at the other end of it

where there are many different applications, many different use cases and many different types of models. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Uh firstly, uh hi everyone. Great to have all of you here. So I think the

first thing is look um Matthew I don't know whether you've been following a company called Saram. Um I think firstly it's important that India is not trying to get to AGI with 1.4 billion humans

and a million Indians turning 18 every month. AGI is not the thing that you know we need right our focus really is to uplift 1.4 4 billion Indians and I think our ecosystem, our innovators, our

government, our investors, our technologists uh are of the view that to really do that you don't need trillion or 5 trillion parameter models. What you need

are highly performant extremely lowcost models that are a billion parameters to maybe 100 or 200 billion parameters. uh and actually for the amount that you mentioned uh we have launched 30 and 100

billion parameter models there are sort in indic languages in fact I don't know whether you know this Matthew but if you look at voice AI in indic languages serum today is both sort in speechto

text and text to speech and is a fraction of the cost of the global models including the global leader in in voice AI So I think what you're going to see is uh the governments actually and

and by the way uh the reason uh Sarum is able to do that because of tremendous support uh from the government but it's not just Sarum there are 12 uh large and small language models by the way just uh

uh a clarification um um because when Saram launched I think somebody said India is really good at small language model the last time I checked chat GPT and Gemini anything above 30 billion is

actually a large language model. So we are actually in the large language model race just a clarification there. Um so basically what we have 12 companies actually 11 companies and Barat Chen

which is part of IIT Bombay that are building these models. I think this number goes to 15 20 very very quickly and I would say actually long well within this year Matthew in

many many things that India needs right um we need to uplift 100 million farmers and for that we need to build basically models that work on feature phones right in local languages that's done right uh

that was actually launched on on Wednesday and so on so I think that's the first thing and now when you ask this other question of Look true frontier which is you know the frontier

today is call it a few trillion maybe it'll go to 5 trillion 10 trillion I think it's going to be very if you define frontier that way part of it is also definition of frontier and more

importantly what's the objective right uh if you define that frontier that way I think it's going to it's not going to be it's Indians are not going to be able to do it with these set of architectures

but what we are going to do is to Matthew to the point that you made which is look LLMs are the most inefficient compute machines ever in I mean this is the you you know these are not efficient

architectures right we believe that this is the beginning not the end we believe there's going to be many many more to come after transformers uh and I think that is where the bets are going to be

made in fact I mean you know Jan Lukun is here and he sort of said that look uh you know this is not sort of the this is not going to lead us to AGI we don't really want to get to AGI but even if

you just look at where AI is going to go so I'd say at the model layer this week India entered the race but we're going to play this race differently which is i.e. we're not going to try to build

trillion parameter models and we'll do it at super super low cost. Now coming to the the chip layer that's harder for India but uh I don't know whether you know this Matthew but 20% of the world's

semiconductor designers are in India. 4 years ago we had no semiconductor startups. Today we have about 35 to 40. They span the spectrum from low power call it 28 nanometer chips all SOC's all

the way up through actually two weeks ago we announced an investment in a GPU company it's a very seasoned team Intel AMD company called Arani Monday this week we uh in you know we announced an

investment in a company called C2I which is going to make memory focus on memory so we'll see even at the chip layer uh because what is very clear to us and I think to many in India is you know we

have to have the sovereign stack our friends are no longer friends or sometimes they're friends or sometimes they're not. Um and as India we just need to have the sovereign stack and we

can't we of course are going to have alliances and today I think very important alliances announced with PAS silica and so on but we've got to actually have a sovereign stack. So

whether it's the chip layer, whether it's the compute layer, I think it's great that both Adani Reliance announced hundred billion investments into AI infra this week. Uh at the model layer,

what we where we have excelled is on the application layer. And what I can tell you is at the application layer, I joined Google in 2011. At the time, India had 10 million connected

smartphone users, no venture capital and no unicorns. Today we have, you know, a lot of venture capital. We have 900 million smartphone users. uh we don't have enough capital but we have enough

uh venture capital and we have 125 unicorns at the application layer I can confidently say whether it's consumer whether it's enterprise Indian companies will win okay because the traditional

formats of consumer consumption which is call it search or you know now Geminina Gemini chat GPD etc will scale to my my view will probably scale to two or 300 million they're not going to scale to a

billion Indians right to scale to a billion Indians you got to have image you You got to have video, you got to have highly local language, and it's got to be it's got to be ultra ultra low

cost. So, so I do think we have a shot. Um I think what you've just described we we we we ship this week. Um I think by the end of the year, we're going to ship 100x more because Matthew what's

happened in India is we don't we can't we we we we're trying to do things differently. Payments is an example which I think the whole world knows about and you'll see that playing out in

many other things. And I'll lastly end with this. Um, Matthew, 2015 India had two space tech startups. Today we have 320. And I would just say don't sell yourself

short. Like you may not India may not need AGI but India may still build AGI, right? And and I I think that the thing that actually might end up holding back the biggest AI companies is that they

are so unresource constrained. If you look at what was the biggest over the last two years innovation that really drove AI forward, it wasn't anything that Google or or OpenAI or or or anyone

else did. It was actually DeepSeek and Deepseek's ability to say that within the constraints of the chips that they had access to that they would they had two incredible innovations. they would

prune the tree more efficiently and they'd be able to process that that pruned tree much more quickly. I I wish Deep Seek had been an Indian company, not a Chinese company. It would have

ended a little bit more &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; But you but but find it's it is I actually think those places with constraints and I would not be scared

away if you're an Indian AI company by hearing the hundreds of billions of dollars that the big US AI companies are pouring in. that that seems like an asset. That seems like an advantage that

they have, but in some ways it's blinding them to what will be the real innovations that cause AI to become more efficient, that cause AI to become more scalable. And there is no way that the

long-term solution to this is you have to turn up your mothball nuclear power plant. So, we're going to get more efficient. And I would bet that that efficiency comes from places just like

this. So if I can push back to both of you, um I think there's so not that I disagree with any of this, but to say that so one of the things that Deepseek did was it came up with this reasoning

model. I guess other people were working on it, but they did a really good job of doing reasoning really well and really powerfully. &gt;&gt; I mean the the real the the Deepseek

innovation was being able to say that you you've got to build this giant tree if you're if you're building a a a AI model. And they were able to say probabilistically there's a whole bunch

of branches on the tree that we can ignore. Like there's a bunch of things in your life that have happened to you that your brain is just really good at forgetting about whereas there are a few

just salient moments that have formed who you are as a person. What Deepseek did is did a better job of pruning that. The the big US AI models don't have to do that because they can just well let's

just buy another H200, right? and let's just keep throwing more money at the problem. By having the constraints and especially in this case the memory constraints, it forced DeepSeek to come

up with a better pruning algorithm which allowed them to then just be able to deliver AI at a a much much much more efficient uh level. &gt;&gt; And I suspect Saram did something

similar because um I I mean I spoke to Pratush and he said that one of the things that the big guys who've been coming around went and told him was how do you do this with 15 people?

&gt;&gt; Yeah. And it's certainly some of those constraints that that are at work. I wanted to talk um along similar lines on uh this idea of open source open weights. Perhaps I just stick with open

weights because open source is a controversial uh uh definition. A lot of the early models at that time there was a lot more openweight stuff coming out. um of late that's gone down

and the power of open weights uh of open weights models and perhaps open source is different uh is that you can actually I mean developers uh can actually tinker around with the model uh and customize

it to their use case but increasingly we've seen a sort of a drop off other than the Chinese models uh Kimmy and Quen which are still open with I wanted to just discuss among the two of you uh

perhaps um from different perspectives uh maybe the use case perspective and perhaps just the whole internet infrastructure perspective how important open weights is and some of the backroom

chatter I've been getting is as these models get more performant it becomes increasingly dangerous to put out highly performant models as open weights because of something that openai called

malicious fine-tuning and the fact that uh as as these models become better it's easier to undo the fine-tuning guardrails that have been that have been established such that these models don't

do bad things and so that's why it won't be won't be delivered. So I know that the ecosystem needs open weights because not everyone has the time to do the training and someone just perhaps wants

to do the pre-training and get the model out. Uh but I'm also hearing from the other side that open weights has this fundamental security challenge and I know we go to security separately but

just on open weights what's the you know what's the way we thread this needle between these two things? Well, I think that um okay, let's let's let's I'm going to tell a story. I don't know that

a 100% of the story is right, but I think it adds up to something that approximates what's right. Let's imagine that over time you are one of these major model makers. you're open AI,

you're you're anthropic, you're you're Google, and you look at this and you say, "Huh, if we keep playing this out, then this is a commodity, and the only way

that we win is if we restrict as many people from getting into the game as we possibly can." So, how do you do that? I mean, one of the best ways to do that is just to

scare everyone that if you're if everybody has this technology that the world is going to end. And so, the next time you come across an AI doomer and they say, "If everyone has this, the

world is going to end." Just keep pushing them. Just be like, "Okay, and then and then what happens?" And then what happens? And then what happens? And basically, you know, the most likely the

scariest scenario is these things can design very bad maybe pathogens or or other other um malicious vectors uh biological vectors that could then get synthesized and spread around society.

To which I say, well then shouldn't we be regulating the synthesizers, not regulating the sort of technology that that's out there? But but again, there gets to be very handwavy. But if

you think about it as a strategy, if you believe that these ultimately are commodities, then what you want to do is actually regulate them in order to make it so that yours is the only company

that can be safely trusted to handle this this commodity. And I think that that's again somewhat cynically a lot of the explanation for why the people that are building these horribly dangerous

scary things keep telling you how horribly dangerous and scary they are. I've never seen another industry that has done that. You never you don't see like the automobile industry be like,

you know, this could plow through a a crowd of people and kill and be used in a mass murder event, right? You don't you don't that just doesn't make any sense. And so the only way that I can

make sense of that world is if if from a business perspective if it's actually trying to do some sort of regulatory capture. And so I I am pretty discounting on what the risks are here.

Um I I tend to think that more open is going to win and I tend to think that the Chinese approach right now is the smartest approach to take on what looks like this enormous kind of just money

machine which the US is creating. And so as I think that as as India thinks about how it's going to regulate AI, I would be careful about listening to sort of the AI doomers, I would be especially

careful about trying to regulate the output of what is fundamentally a a um a at least a pseudoneterministic system, right? We have built machines that act like humans and yet we think we

can regulate them like machines. the better way to regulate them is actually more like humans. Look to the criminal code, not the engineering code in order to figure out what that regulation

should look like. And so I I I am I am very much pro- open. I am I I I think we should think about what these risks are and what these dangers are. We should definitely be, you know, testing and

looking for those, but I tend to think that they are somewhat overblown. And if you want to understand why they are somewhat overblown, I would argue it is because it's the strategy in order to

keep the people who are currently in the lead in the lead going forward. &gt;&gt; I think you may be absolutely right because on that big stage that you were at just a short while ago um yesterday

there was a call by uh one of these companies uh for an AEA for AI um that it should be regulated like nuclear technology. Uh and and the the other example I keep giving is you know at the

turn of this last century people were just walking around the streets and getting electrocuted because electricity is highly dangerous and yet we sit in this room which literally the walls are

buzzing with electricity and we're completely safe and this is the nature of all technologies but on the positive side Rajan all the all the AI deployers that we have in India are

large number of them are relying on open source and if the open-source pipeline starts starts to uh to diminish. Uh where are they going to go? I mean Saram can certainly deliver these models but

but how important is it actually to the community of people that are I mean AI and Chach and all it's all well and good but it's really those those applications the voice applications that people need.

How how dependent are they on open source and what can we do to continue to keep keep this open? Yeah, look, I mean, firstly, as uh Matthew said, look, if you invest a trillion dollars, okay, you

can't give it away for free. It's as simple as that. It's just economics. Um, so you can position it any which way you want, but fundamentally it's about economics, right? And how do you build a

business, especially if you have to invest so much? Um, no, look, open source is absolutely critical. Uh, you know, I think the the I mean, Llama is the most recent example, right? where

the reality is if you're going to launch the next state-of-the-art version of Llama, it'll be closed because otherwise how they going to monetize this, right? And especially if you have, you know,

you know, they're spending 80 billion other ways to make money, they don't make money, &gt;&gt; but for them 100 billion a year is a it's kind of a lot, you know. So, um,

anyway, coming back, look, it's super important to the ecosystem. I don't know. I don't have the answer to that. I think in March you'll see one of the big companies make a big announcement uh

massive massive announcement on on on their commitment to open source. But it is it is a you know I think the only way you do this is you there has to be a different path. Okay. Because if you're

going to have to invest hundreds of millions of dollars uh to build a new model or billions of dollars to build a new model or tens of billions of dollars that doesn't that's not really open that

you can't keep those models open. Right. So to the first question that you asked in Matthew's response, you really need to have a different way of doing this, right? So actually by the way, if you

look at voice AI for instance, um I'll give you some data, you know, India has very low labor cost. Um if you look at human cost of voice today in India, it's uh 5 rupees a

minute to about 20 rupees a minute. 5 rupees a minute is the lowest you can get. Um MX would be probably 40 or 50 rupees a minute. Um today's voice AI cost is about 3 rupees a minute. So

already and that's why you're beginning to see voice AI really beginning to take off in India right uh but even with today's soda models you can get to about maybe a rupee right now the question is

even at at a rupee now you're one you're 20 one the cost of humans so it's going to really take off but if you want to make voice the primary medium through which 1.4 4 billion Indians will access

AI. That's still too expensive, right? You got to get it down to maybe five pies or 10 pesa. Uh and that's actually not about open source. It's about compute and it's about the cost of

inference. So if you ask me, open source really really important, but we have to find a way to get the cost of inference down. Obviously, model size, all of these things matter. uh and and uh you

know we can talk about that as well but a short answer is look it's really important but it is not clear to me how you do this especially in the current game that we're in because anybody that

wants to be at the frontier the way frontier is defined today actually has to go out and invest right and and honestly I don't know how the Chinese are are doing it because you know it's a

bit opaque as to exactly how much are they investing &gt;&gt; you run a hedge fund which is basically what deep is &gt;&gt; exactly just get the money

&gt;&gt; and they and they have that they have this on the Meta is the I mean meta is the fascinating question here because what Meta was so because it took me a really long time to understand Meta's

strategy like why are they doing all this VR why are they doing all of this AI what they learned was the lesson that if you are caught on the wrong side of a platform shift and you then become

beholden to some other platform where in the past they they were on the web and that was fine and social worked and they no one controlled the underlying platform and then the platform shifted

and all all of a sudden it was on mobile and you had to then they were beholden to both Apple and Google that that put them on a back foot and it really limited their business. So they are so

desperate to whatever the next platform shift is, stay in front of that platform shift. And so for a while that looked like it might be VR, that looks less likely today, although you know never

never count these technologies out. The real next platform shift is almost certainly going to be AI. And so if you control the social graph, which is a unreplicable kind of asset that they

have, they need to be they need to make sure that whatever the next platform is, that they can that they control that or at least have an equal seat at the table of everyone else. And so if they

continue to invest in open source and you're like, why are they spending so much money in order to do this? It's to make sure that as the next platform shifts that it's it's going to be uh

that they aren't in the same backfooted position that they were with Apple and Google. That would be my analysis of meta. &gt;&gt; So uh and you know you you mentioned um

uh India's policy. I'll just have you know that I I've been involved in three of the policy documents that India has put out and we're very pro- innovation. Uh in fact we have what we call seven

sutras in all three of them. The third of which &gt;&gt; the the Europeans say they're very pro innovation too. So we're really poor innovation. Uh and we don't need a

report to tell us after the fact that we're pro- innovation that we should be. So our the third sutra actually says all other things being equal, we will prioritize

uh uh innovation over cautionary restraint and and that's now in the financial sector, the health sector and also the overarching guidelines. But I I I want to uh throw it open to to

questions in a bit. I also want to talk through you know you you are in many ways uh um our last line of defense against security um that's sort of the leave the AI side out of it but

Cloudflare is our in to many of uh the big internet properties one of our last lines of defense for security I wanted to ask you how much uh from your empirical evidence you're seeing that AI

uh is increasing the cyber security risk and this is I'm asking you specifically from the same thing same point that you made to me last time because that some of these people are overblowing the

risk. One of the risks they blow up or that that I I don't want to comment either way that um AI is going to accelerate uh cyber attacks y &gt;&gt; uh because uh agentic swarms etc can do

things much more danger. So what's the evidence that you have with this? &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, so, um, so I I think this is sort of a long-term good news, short-term scary headline story. Um, the

long-term good news, let's start with short-term scary headline. There are going to be a whole bunch of scary headlines of bad things that AI does. you there will be a story about an an

Indian family who lost all their money uh because they wired it to some criminals that made it seem like their daughter had been kidnapped or um I mean we're already seeing the the level and

sophistication of fishing scams um go through the roof uh in terms of of of what what uh is is is being done. Uh and so that bad guys are going to use that to attack. The other thing that we're

seeing is so there was there was an example there was a company called Salesloft had a a program called Drift a piece of software that was connected into hundreds of thousands of Salesforce

instances. Salesoft got breached by a Russian hacker. The Russian hacker didn't understand how Salesforce worked. So they kind of fumbled around for a really long time. Had they just used AI,

which is what we're now seeing a lot of North Korean and Chinese hackers uh do, they would have been able to just be instantly knowledgeable on how to get as much information out of Salesforce as

quickly as possible, and the breach could have been orders of magnitude uh worse. So, those are those are the those are the bad stories. Um and and and and there's going to be real hardship and

real pain that's caused from it. The counter to that is that folks like us, I was just with Nikesh from Palo Alto Networks. Um, you know, Jay from Zcaler is here. We're all using AI in our own

systems to make them smart. In fact, Cloudflare, we would have never described ourselves this way. But the whole theory of the company was let's get as much internet traffic flowing

through a machine learning system to be able to predict where security threats were. In the same way that three years ago, we all looked at chat GPT and we're like, whoa, that's amazing. internally

about three years ago, we we was the first time the system said, "Here's a new threat that we've ne that no human has ever identified before." And that went from being something that, you

know, happened once in the first 15 years of Cloudflare's history to now it's happening on an incredibly regular basis where the machine learning is able to is able to win. And so I think the

good news is that the good guys will always have more data than the bad guys do. again caveat to regulation preventing us from using it in order to do cyber security in various ways but

largely um that we're we're able to do that and I think that we will actually use AI in order to stay ahead of these threats that's what we're seeing it's going to require some change in any part

of your life where you are uh today relying on some what someone looks like or what they sound like in order to verify that who they are and give them access to anything secure, confidential,

that's got to change. And so the simple thing that you should all do with your immediate family at your next holiday meal is decide on a family password. And that seems silly, but I guarantee you at

some point some hacker is going to call up and say, "Hey, your son or your dad or your grandmother or whatever needs needs money." And if you say, "Hey, what's the family password?" And they

say, "I don't know, Arvar." you'll know that it's a scam, right? So it's a simple thing that you can do and it's going to be these simple things which I think are going to get

translated and I think businesses have got to go away from oh the person looked right so we look let them in the door like that can't happen in the cyber world and so we're going to have to lock

systems down there going to be some scary stories but I would predict again that in 10 years we are more secure online than we are today. Rashan, I wanted to talk about data because um a

lot of the conversation is around how the models that we have serum accepted uh are models that are largely built in the west uh and therefore are western centric and this way to solve this is to

bring in cultural and contextual data. Um and I know there's a something of a land grab going on for for the data. Um I uh so as far as the data companies in India are concerned the companies that

are actually you know hoovering up the data annotating it making it ready what's the what what's the business model for them are they feeding this all up back to that that one pin code in the

US or are what what's the what's the negotiating part and I asked this question because we have a lot of data in this country but I know that there are countries in Africa where the deal

is already done and the data is out the door. There are there are deals I know for 25 years worth of medical data out of Africa in exchange for setting up an EHR system because that's the trade

that's a deal they've done and I was wondering whether we are thinking about this in a nuanced way. Um and then you know I know Matthew you've got some ideas on crawling. I'll come to you on

that. But uh uh what's actually happening on the ground uh with this because I'm a little concerned uh about the way these &gt;&gt; so I think the first thing is we don't

have as many um I mean there are in there are you know initiatives or NOS's like AI for parat that are collecting data but if you look at the leading global data companies they're not Indian

right uh India probably has a handful of startups that are um uh that are that are actually in the quote code business of AI data of AI So first and foremost I mean because these companies are global

you're absolutely right uh all the data that Indians are generating um uh is actually going to uh you know going to those sort of few handful of handful of companies. Now that being said, look

firstly you know for for um for Indian companies to actually keep the data here we have to have model companies right like you know what I mean otherwise you have to sell it because if you're in the

data business you have to sell it to somebody um but I think the benefit we have is you know like on a like you know we've only collected probably one less than 1% of the data we actually need if

you really want to get to AGI right like if you look at physical intelligence and things like that and India really has a competitive advantage in fact we've been looking for start you know for startups

we could find fund uh you know that would basically do all kinds of data collection for robotics and uh things like that so that's number one I think number two we're also beginning to see

companies uh that are leveraging their proprietary data in very very interesting way I'll just give you one example uh so we have a company called cloud physician it's an Indian startup

they run these remote ICUs in tier 2 tier three towns uh in India they've been doing that for four or five years they've got this extraordinary amount of proprietary data

that they've now used to actually build about a dozen or so specialized models uh in healthcare and now they're actually taking those models to market uh in the US right so and and the kind

of data that they have which they've collected over four or five years for a different for a sort of a healthcare delivery business if you will uh has been very valuable so we you know in our

portfolio we only have a handful of companies in different spaces uh that are using data as an advantage to actually build a final uh proposition which is usually tied to some sort of

domain model uh or something like that. But but I do think um you know we need a probably some sort of firstly we need a lot more innovation around this. I'm surprised we don't have more companies

that are actually trying to uh sort of build businesses around this India's data advantage. Um and and second we need to have I do think we need to have some smart regulation. I don't know

where the regulatory framework is on on data. I think that's going to be super super important. I do know like AI for Barat etc are being quite thoughtful about who they share uh data with which

is great. Um so yeah that that's sort of where it is but it's a huge opportunity for India. Uh I don't I you know my real view is like look basically you know it's all the all the data on the

internet that's accessible to everybody. You just need like literally large amounts of capital. Uh most of the data that we need to get to AGI we don't have yet. Uh and uh we have 1.4 billion

people. So &gt;&gt; well create it. But Matthew you you wanted to intervene in that whole thing. uh you had uh something called um uh maybe you didn't call it maybe the media

started to call it pay to crawl uh and you may have something more sophisticated like an AI audit or something like that. Uh what's what's the idea behind that because that's also

part of this democratization of AI uh as I see it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So so firstly correcting a little bit of a misconception um all the money in the world and you still

can't even crawl the internet. So, uh, how much less of the internet does Microsoft see than Google? Microsoft Bing, they've thrown a ton of money at it. Uh, it for every six pages that

Google sees, Microsoft sees one. Uh, OpenAI knows how much of an advantage that is. So, every 3.5 pages that Google sees, OpenAI sees one. That means that twothirds of the internet

&gt;&gt; is hidden to most the the most sophisticated model and anthropic it's it's almost 10 to one uh in terms of what's there and so if you want to ask why did Gemini just leapfrog open AI I

don't think it's the chips I don't think it's the researchers I actually think it's the data and I think getting access to data is important and so if we want to have a level playing field uh there's

a real risk that Google is going to leverage the monopoly position they had indexing the internet yesterday in order to win in the AI market um tomorrow. And and that's something that we're really

concerned about and I think we have to do one of two things. We either have to bring Google down and say that they have to play by the same rules as all the other AI companies. That's something

that you could do from a regulatory perspective. Uh and that's something that the UK is looking into, Canada's looking into the uh Australia is looking into. Um the the the alternative is how

do we give all the other AI companies the same access that Google does? and and that's that's I think an opportunity uh to also solve some of the democratization um challenge that's out

there. One of the things I really worry about is that AI is going to disrupt the fundamental internet business model. The fundamental internet business model was create content, drive traffic, and then

sell things, subscriptions, or ads. That was it. Like I don't care if you're B2B, BTOC. I don't care if you're a media company. That was it. create great content, drive traffic, sell things,

subscriptions or ads. AI doesn't work that way. So, just take a media company. If AI scrapes your ads and and takes it, let's say it's the New York Times or the Times of India or whatever it is, you

can now go to your AI and just say, "Show me all summarize all the articles from the New York Times that would be of interest to me." And you're going to read it there. Now, that's great for you

as a user. It's it's better as a user experience. So, it's going to win, but now the Times of India isn't selling a subscription or an ad. Now, the New York Times isn't getting anyone to click on

an ad. And that's going to make it harder and to give you to make this clear how much harder it's gotten. 10 years ago, for every two pages that Google scraped on the internet, they

sent you one unique visitor. And then you could monetize that visitor again by selling them things, subscriptions, or ads. Um, today, what is it? 50 to1 or excuse me 30 to1 for for in in Google's

case 50 to1 in Bing's case that's the good news in uh in OpenAI's case it's 3500 to one in Anthropic's case it's half a million to one they take a half a million pages for every one page they

give back so AI takes but it doesn't always give back and if the currency of the internet has been traffic that traffic is gone and it's getting harder and harder to then make money through

the traditional business model of the internet. So, one of two things happens. One is well, the internet just dies. But that's not going to happen because the AI companies need the content. They

need the information. They need the things that are out there. And so, the alternative is a new business model emerges. And that's what's going to happen over the course of the next 5

years. A new business model that's going to emerge for the internet. And think how exciting that is. Think how rare new business models for something as grand and as large as the internet are. How

often they emerge. Almost never. And yet we're all going to live through it. And that's an incredible opportunity. And I don't know quite what it is, but it has to be some way that the people who are

creating the content and creating the value get compensated for the things that they are creating. And what the encouraging version of this is to think about the music industry. The entire

music industry 22 years ago was valued at eight billion US dollars which is a lot of money but it's not that much money because that was the Beatles and the Rolling Stones and like

everything right why was it that well because Napster and Groster and Kazah and all these things had commoditized they were basically taking the music and musicians weren't getting paid for the

music anymore what changed one day Steve Jobs walked on stage and he said it's going to be 99 cents per song Right? iTunes launched almost 22 years ago to this day. And that wasn't the

business model that won, but it at least was a business model and it started the conversation and that evolved into what is the business model that won, which is something closer to Spotify, which is

now I don't know what it is in in India, but in the US it's like $10 a month. And what's incredible is that Spotify last year sent over $12 billion to musicians, more than the entire music industry was

worth 22 year years ago. And that's just Spotify. There's Apple Music and and uh Title and Tik Tok and YouTube and tons of people. There's more money going into music creation today than at any other

time in human human history by an order of magnitude. Now, different winners and losers, and we can debate whether or not the right people are winning and the right people are losing, but there is

more money going into music creation today than any time in human history. And so, as we figure out what the next business model of the internet is going to be, let's try not to make it one

that's worse. Let's try and learn the lessons because traffic was always a terrible proxy for quality. So, let's actually find something that is a proxy for quality and let's reward the people

who are creating that. And the good news is I think that's what everyone in this room wants, but it's what Sam wants. It's what Daario wants. It's even what Elon probably wants. And and that's the

sort of thing that is actually going to drive not only a healthier eco internet ecosystem, but I actually think that a lot of what's wrong with the world today is that we have monetized traffic. And

what that has meant is we have monetized basically making people emotional or angry or whatever it gets to click on things, which is part of what's driven society apart in a lot of ways. I think

if instead what we monetize and what we reward is the creation of human knowledge, that's what the AI companies want, that's what we all want. And I think that's what we can actually do to

actually bring our society back together in a lot of ways. &gt;&gt; I want to turn it over to the audience for questions. I don't be the only one asking questions. I'll take

hands are going. I'm going to take three questions at a time. &gt;&gt; I like Indian audiences. They ask questions like you go to the UK and everyone just sits on their hands.

&gt;&gt; No, no. Indian audiences are very very Now we'll have to shut them up because we don't have time. I'm going to take this one. I'm going to take that one. I'm going to take this one. Right. So,

so uh first up here. Yeah. And and I have a rule. A question not a statement. So, it has to end with your voice going up a little bit. Then I know it's a Uh sir this is uh for you. Uh you you've

touched upon a lot of interesting topics across domains. Um first of all I remember you talking about the deterministic uh AI outcomes. Um now AI having crossed the threshold.

&gt;&gt; Give me the question. &gt;&gt; Okay. Um so how uh what in your view would make AI trustworthy? Is it something to do with explanability deterministic uh AI? And what would be

the pathways? Let me get a couple more others we won't get through the lady lady at the back there. So one is uh I'll keep track of how we make

&gt;&gt; how make AI more trustworthy. &gt;&gt; Um my question is for Matthew. So you mentioned about the paper crawl we see robots.txt getting ignored u by AI companies. My question for you is what

what makes you believe that AI companies would be equally invested in a creator based compensation when AI scrapes the internet and is not giving back attribution or compensation. Yeah.

&gt;&gt; Trustworthy and how how do creators get paid &gt;&gt; and attribution. I think she also wants to do attribution. This gentleman here &gt;&gt; uh hi uh my question is to Rajan. So

Rajan what do you think uh you were explaining about the consumer and vertical uh part in the application layer. So what do you think where are we in terms of investment from a venture

capital side point of view in terms of how can we match the Y combinator and A6 Z level in terms of investments. &gt;&gt; Great. &gt;&gt; So trustworthy AI is already more

trustworthy than most humans. Um the the simple fact is that an AI is a better driver than 99.99% of humans that are on the road today. And literally since I started talking within a kilometer of

where we're sitting, there was an accident where between two cars, I mean we just know that's happening. We're sitting in Delhi, right? You will not be able to find any news about that

anywhere on any publication anywhere on earth. And yet if one of those two cars had been a self-driving car, it would have been front page news around the world. Our expectations for AI are too

high. We have built a system that acts like humans and we need to think of it as acting like humans. The smartest CEO that I know in terms of doing this is uh Robin Vince at um at BNY Melon. In their

case, they've actually have AI employees. The AI employees get an employee number. They get an email address. They get a quarterly review. They can get fired if they don't do a

good job. They can get promoted if they do a good job. I asked if there are any AIs that are supervising humans. He said, "Not yet, but it's inevitable." Right? That's the way to think of it,

right? Is that they are they act like humans because they are like humans. And again, we are all fallible, but but and and and and we're all going to make mistakes, but already we see in certain

disciplines like driving, AI is better than human beings are. Uh in terms of getting paid, I think the empirical evidence is that when you've actually seen, forget robots at TX, that's like a

no trespassing sign. Anyone can ignore it. when you actually block the AI agents which is what we have done then they come to the table and so with big publishers like cond NAS dot d-mered um

and others where on starting July 1st we said all of the AI companies are blocked they actually came to the table and they were able to get things done in the case of Reddit Reddit was willing to block

everyone including even Google and as a result they got the public number is seven times as much for the Reddit corpus licensing that than the New York Times did even though the two corpuses

are about about the same. So again, I think that you the first step in any market is having some level of scarcity. As long as you're making it easy for anyone to take your data, then you're

not going to get paid for it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I think on the question on um consumer AI, I don't very few people know this, but India today has more consumer AI startups than the US.

Uh in fact on Tuesday this week at the pitchfest just our firm one firm we announced five new seed investments in AI companies. Four out of the five are consumer consumer AI companies right and

and the reason is reason and and we think this is going to explode because we have 900 million Indians on the internet. 850 million of them are active every day 7 hours a day on the internet

and every space has potential for tremendous innovation. Right? If you take education, um, education hasn't been accessible to a large part of online education because

it's just been too expensive. Right? But today with AI, you can have a 99 rupees a month plan with an AI tutor across in fact the fastest growing AI education company in the world is in India and

nobody's really heard of it because actually fortunately these guys are all just being stealth and just building uh which is uh which is very good. So I think it's a great time to be building

consumer actually it's great time building AI companies but especially in consumer AI we're going to see some breakouts look the world's leading uh AI consumer AI companies in education

healthcare um entertainment etc will be either here or in China they they won't be in the in the western world because we just need it &gt;&gt; the one beautiful thing about this

summit is there have been so many wonderful rich diverse conversations this is one of them Matthew Rajan thank you so much thank you all for being such a good audience thank

&gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Good. What?
