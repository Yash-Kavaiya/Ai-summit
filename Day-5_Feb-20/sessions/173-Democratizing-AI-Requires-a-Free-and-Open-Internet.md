## 📝 Summary

As AI becomes deeply embedded in economies and societies, the key question is who has access and who benefits. This session brings thought leaders to discuss how true AI democratization depends on preserving the Internet as a global platform rather than fragmented walled gardens. It will explore how open-source ecosystems, data commons, and distributed compute powered by an open Internet can enable startups and developing nations, especially India, to realize inclusive "AI for All" ambitions.
