## 📝 Summary

Children are becoming among the earliest and most intensive users of AI, often before safeguards and regulations are fully in place. This session asks a direct question: how can AI be shaped to strengthen children's safety and wellbeing rather than undermine them? Drawing on technology leaders, child-rights experts, and a young AI innovator, the discussion examines advancing innovation, where risks demand firm limits, and how trust in AI can be built for the next generation.
