## 📝 Summary

AI is rapidly becoming a foundational layer across education, creativity, and enterprise. This session examines how human potential is shaped, scaled, or constrained by AI systems and what it takes to ensure these technologies expand capability rather than concentrate advantage. Leaders from automation, AI-driven enterprise, data ecosystems, global business, philanthropy, and the creative arts discuss where AI meaningfully augments human skill, and where intentional design is required to prevent new forms of exclusion.

## 📝 Transcript

to being the first woman partner at Soft Bank, you know, investing over a billion dollars to now an entrepreneurial journey at Optimize Go. Today we are talking about scaling human potential

etc. So how have you scaled your own potential through all this that landed you in AI Kiran? Why did you land in AI now? &gt;&gt; All right. Yeah, we we'll all get seated

since we have all our fellow panelists seated here. Uh so I'm just so excited to be here and uh a first call out to all of the community members here because that is

really that is really the story. Amazing. And you come from where? Where are you coming from? &gt;&gt; Mumbai, &gt;&gt; Gura,

&gt;&gt; Jamur, &gt;&gt; Himarshal Pradesh. All right. um just a microcosm of the community that's now officially 10,000 but growing to very quickly like in multiplying by two or

three fold and we'll we stay tuned for the announcement with partnerships like the one that we have here. Uh so yeah my own journey has been one of um I guess um if I had to think about a theme uh

it's my favorite meta poster which is in offices all across the globe which says what would you do if you weren't afraid and it's a phrase that I want us to think about you know what would you do

if you weren't afraid and think about what comes to your mind right uh so it's about you know taking risks and um uh not being afraid to start over again I had someone come up to me yesterday and

say Hey, if their business is on a certain trajectory, but now if they have to move over to AI, if it meant starting over all over again, what would I recommend to them? And I said, start

over, all over again, right? Because there's a certain trajectory that if you are in, it's all about projecting where you will be 5 years from now, 10 years from now. And if the new trajectory gets

you further ahead, you know, by the way, and even if you fail at that, it's better to shoot for the stars and miss versus doing a path that feels achievable, but there's not the stretch

in it. And of course, with that comes a lot of assumptions about both, you know, the financial ability, the the support that you have from your family to do it. But if you have all of that, certainly

go out and stretch to that. So that I would say is what what has been my journey and um the inspiration for AI Kiran as well in that all of the different roles that you mentioned I was

often the only woman in the room certainly the singledigit percentage at the max and I think all of the women in this room relate and it has been about incredible male allies who also helped

with us getting to the roles that we are in and so that becomes a position of privilege and responsibility to make give it forward and then that's when I met Lakshmi the fearless Lakshmi

who has been a pioneer both in her own reinvention. She was the OG um technology 25 &gt;&gt; technologist um connector um builder of real builder and someone who's focused

on scaling human potential just like everyone else here. So Lakshmi tell us your story and I can't wait to hear the stories of everyone else here on this panel. Yeah. So, uh you know for me when

I sit here uh today in 2026 uh in 1994 9394 we were talking about internet is going to be big and people would say what is this you know what how will anybody make any money in this etc.

So what we are looking at now is nothing new. This is just a reinvention of things we've been seeing for the last 50 years, you know. So I've been at Intel, I've been a venture capitalist, I've

been, you know, in uh uh philanthropy, all kinds of things. But what brought us together to AI Kiran is that for the last 15 years, my work has been about finding amazing people doing amazing

work and get them to tell their stories because we only hear about the 10 famous people. But innovation is happening everywhere. So how do you find them, connect them and get them to tell their

stories and teach people how to tell their stories? So I brought Ted to India. I mean I worked at Intel, venture capital, all kinds of stuff. And then I decided for the last 15 years my journey

is going to be how to create a platform to showcase the amazing talent that's there in uh India and across the globe that doesn't get told. So that's what I've been doing. So when I met Kitika

and I look at in the AI revolution there is an amazing opportunity for us to do it right from the beginning. In every revolution industrial revolution we messed up the environment the rivers and

everything. 200 years later we are like okay let's clean it up even in the internet revolution you know we have the problems with social media you know mental illnesses all kinds of things

good and bad but technology is great actually you can't fight it so how can we be part of this to make it inclusive from the word getgo that's what excites us in this journey and as she was saying

we have no idea how to do this you kind of say we're going to do this And it's amazing like in six months the kind of progress we had as she said um you know one of the things uh you must say Kitika

about the chat GPT thing. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You know um I I share this when we started AI Kiran and by the way this is the most you're going to hear from both

of us because we the rest of the session we're going to hear from our incredible panelists. Um and uh when we started if you went to chat GPT and said can you tell me about a 100 women in AI in India

it would tell you 10 women right? and it will tell you that I cannot answer this question and these are some sources that you look at. Um and so over that period of time so we launched with 250 named

women. So right there we added a zero. Now it's an incredible community of um you know 10,000 uh women who are all taking this on their own rallying it self-organizing

um creating new ventures. We just heard about dag.ai AI which is uh KML is doing that and uh helping tailor and fashion designers use AI and you have to tell me your yeah huge round of applause for her

and I'm doing whiskey whiskey is basically a WhatsApp assistant for women first but it applies to all busy professionals where you manage all of your calendar in

two WhatsApp &gt;&gt; awesome right so if we can create a platform to even add a little bit of like that oomph and make it bigger faster bolder I mean we have done our

jobs and so yeah so we have already added a two zeros to the first number that chat GPT had it's just about you know as they say in a startup add a zero add a zero and we'll be at that million

so with that let's jump in so u talking about scaling human potential I have to start the conversation with Radha I've known Radha I mean I knew Radha about reading about her first in Silicon

Valley she was one of the first people who brought HP to India in 1987 before anybody thought of uh you know the technology uh corridor. So we used to read about her and then she started a

you know I support which is a software company which is one of the first unicorns in Bay Area. I was still reading about her and then through a common friend Chitra I met her and been

a great friend for the last 25 years and talking about somebody who reinvents herself all the time to benefit the community that's been her you know whether it is HP or whether it's I

support and now she does something called IMEIT and uh rather before instead of me saying what you do the kind of work that you do in scaling humanity

the humans in the loop has been amazing. So tell us about how many people you have, what you're doing, and what does scaling really mean for you. actually

&gt;&gt; I said indeed um &gt;&gt; you know I've had quite a journey together &gt;&gt; and um &gt;&gt; sorry by the way I have to say how you

know when you say Huelet and Packard she actually worked with them yes so Lakshmi really dates me as well but that's okay I work with Andy Gro also let's really ourselves.

&gt;&gt; I grew up in HP. Um I'm originally from Madras and that's where I did my engineering. And um you talk about being a woman in the room. It was we were 17 girls and

2800 boys in engineering. And um I really had the opportunity and I went to get my masters in the US and uh just kind of fell into working at HP

labs which was one of the most prestigious places then and the beauty of HP was David Packard particularly literally did the management by wandering around. you would run into him

everywhere, open offices and uh ended up being a mentor was so fortunate. Um the two of them created Silicon Valley the Silicon Valley we talk about today and then when um I had the opportunity by

sure I ended up in Europe ran medical products group for HP in Europe and then at that point um I was like okay I'm going back to the US what am I going to be doing and there's this whole thing

about what is happening in that country of yours it's so behind in electronics that country of mine, India. And I was so kind of enraged by that comment. I said, "That's rubbish. We

have the best mathematicians." All of which is true. So David Packard said, "Okay, I'll give you 3 months. Go and figure out what you can do in India." And I tell you it was the greatest

opportunity because I ended up in this beautiful garden sleepy town called Bangalore. and growing up in Chennai was of course I'd gone to Bangalore for my holidays

and the talent of you know in in when you're working with computers I used to actually at that time I was working on multi-threaded Unix and the kind of talent in what you could develop anyway

it wasn't three months and that extended to about five and a half years and I set up hipackard in Mangalore and the first two multi multinationals of anybody doing software in India was

Texas Instruments and HP. The other most amazing thing at that time, I think even more amazing was those were the years that TCS started, Infy started, Vipro started and so we celebrated together

the first million dollars of software export from India jointly and I remember doing that million 1989. I bring this up because if you if when within a lifetime when

you can see an industry technologies completely transform a large country with a growing middle class and it's just the creation I mean there is no question that it

is the global leader is in India there is no question about that so now You fast forward and you come to AI. AI in turn is changing it. It's changing it in ways that we never believed it was

even possible. And I think that so we started I merit um it will be 10 years in AI in April. &gt;&gt; Wow. So

thinking and that's what's fun about being in the IT industry early on. Then you say well what's happening to this industry multi multi multibillion dollar and we started in AI. So we've kind of

kind of had a ringside seat it's also you go through when you start something early enough you go through its issues. We have done a lot of work in computer vision not just the language model side

but the computer vision side and I'll talk a little bit about it but at this point we have and many of them are AI Kirin &gt;&gt; folks um we have about

little over 10,000 people working in AI 3500 or so in India And our in-house talent in India working in AI is about a lot of most of them are in-house and we also decided to set up

AI centers not in the metros because remember what transformed India was the work in Bangalore, Noida, Gura, Chennai etc. How do you then take it and use AI now

it's the new technologies but not have a divide the last thing I want is you know like five or 10 years from now we're all discussing how do we bridge the AI divide as we've been doing how do you

bridge the digital divide if we could bridge it now which is what I love about AI kirin then you are in charge and you grow and you scale so we started setting centers in Kolkata, Visac,

Kimur, Hubli, Shillang and so those are our centers and each center now has become a center of excellence in a particular area and the three areas that we work in. It was

wonderful to hear this yesterday. We work four areas actually. We work in autonomous mobility and robotics which is our largest business and there we have people in Kolkata and Meti Bruce

and then Visag is the center of excellence for healthcare medical AI cobbour and not because I'm Tamil it was the first thing I've done in Tamil Nadu but Kimbour is our center of first

center of excellence in Asia automotive AI center of excellence and the way that center has grown you know and and then our generative AI work is primarily in Kolkata Shillong it's in

multiple places and we work with the large foundation model companies so then what do you do you can focus and focus and focus on the large models how do you take that into applications for

precision agriculture breast cancer screening healthcare AI into the different areas that are so critical for societal applications. So we work with the foundation model

companies to create what are called small models, small vision models, small language models and then fine-tuning those models and working in reinforced learning with human feedback red

teaming. That means collaborating with the models what we call tormenting the models because how do you find out whether this model works or not? You torment the darn thing. You torment it

till you break it. That's an actual technical term let me tell you. You torment it till you break it and then you do the data set creation to make it right. So then we will bring in experts.

So we have on as scholars we call them globally and you can't just do this in English PhDs in mathematics cardiologists radiologists they're called scholars interventional

something something I found out more about this aronomist aronomist in Germany aronomists in the US aronomist and this is where the beauty of AI and this potential it's not potential for me

anymore It's real. It's a 10-year-old company. We run a fairly large business. It's cash positive, earnings positive. It's got all of that stuff. But it's business that drives the inclusion.

And bringing in these experts means you not only are inventing technology in Silicon Valley, Bangalore etc. you have a global set of people and experts who are contributing to AI.

&gt;&gt; So for me &gt;&gt; it's let me end by one thing which I know is most important. It's 53% women. &gt;&gt; 53% women. And I'll say one thing I believe in this

really. If anybody asks you how do you run a company with 5050 women, look them straight in the eye and say, "Have you seen the world lately?" It's about 50/50. And there should be no reason why

AI technology cannot be 50/50. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Beautiful. &gt;&gt; Great. Well, that st set sets the stage

beautifully for so that sets the stage beautifully for um maybe the next question to Mihir where uh here you're here and you're a new author and uh this is a topic that you spend a lot of time

you spend a lot of time thinking about and articulating. How do you think about scaling human potential in the age of AI? &gt;&gt; Glad to be here and I want to

Okay, we all going to share one. &gt;&gt; Uh, I applaud the vision because as Radha rightly said, the the idea of getting it at the beginning is the right idea and I'm a big fan. Um,

um, the book that you referred to is called a fiveyear century isn't available. It will be available soon, available for pre-order. um because we are we are going to see

the change worth what happens normally in a 100 years within the next 5 years. Now fortunately we have seen this kind of change at least once before in recent past uh around 1900s when electricity,

radio, automo and planes came in about same 10 15 years time frame. Imagine you went to sleep and you woke up 10 15 years later. It would look like a different planet uh in every way

possible. It worked out for the most part. So we we are about to see all of that now in five years. And uh in my role as a CEO and chairman of Automation Anywhere, we see the world

through a very unique lens. We have about nearly half a billion digital workers that are powered by AI today run on our platform. It will reach a billion soon. The human worker to a digital

worker ratio is 1 to 20. There's 20 digital workers for every and so and it is happening across 90 countries. We have customers in 90 countries across every industry. So when we saw all of

this, we decided to write a book and say it is time to tell the world what is what is happening, what is coming and what what what is this the leadership playbook look like.

&gt;&gt; Incredible. Um and maybe um Asha, we'll go to you. Uh you represent another iconic company AMD that has been at the heart of this revolution. As we think about scaling human potential and as if

we think about you know the opportunity globally and in India what do you feel are the limiting factors or the enablers? Is it talent? It is c is it capital? Is it compute? How do they

interact? You know um just to build off what both Raha and Mi said, there is no debate about the transformational nature of what we're

all experiencing. But change inherently is always personal. And and what happens and when you see either people who are super positive or

super negative about something, it's because they're internalizing what they think it means to them or what it means around them. And so when you talk about infrastructure or assets or you know how

the world is shifting, these are all going to happen. I mean you we have as a generation relied exclusively and maybe I would say not exclusively but at least extensively on

human intelligence. Human intelligence has done the most brilliant things but human intelligence has also made way for artificial intelligence and it's about a model of

coexistence as we as this develops that has to be evolved. And so from an infrastructure perspective, when we think about it, our goal is to make sure that the innovation that we as humans

have ambition for is fully supported in what we build and what we deliver for the world. That's simply put. Um how that ambition gets realized ultimately is in our hands, right? And so I think

that's where we have the ability to shape it early. We have the ability to drive success and we have the ability to learn from history. Now, I I will say that having been a history buff growing

up, um you always want people to learn from history, but people never do. And and so you you should just expect that this is going to be the most interesting time that we are living and

experiencing. And I would encourage and challenge everyone to make the most of that challenge of what it means to them personally and how you drive it. I mean,

that's my my personal view. We we will continue as a company to go build the best technology out there to to support and drive and be the best partner to the businesses we work with. But ultimately

it comes down to the ambition each of us sets, each of the corporations set, each of the organizations set on the kind of change you want to drive. &gt;&gt; No, I think it's beautifully put. I

think it's uh very different people coming together people in hardware software um you know services training all kinds of things coming together and that's why for us at AI and bringing

very diverse forces is important and one of the biggest things for us is youth uh when we look at AI and we say what can we do to get women into the fold and what do we do with youth uh and how do

we make sure it's safe for youth and uh it's It furthers the knowledge. It's not just consumption but creation. So, uh I think we have a program called fellows program. So, every year we pick 20

amazing people from different disciplines and put them together and uh I always say that that's a great way to adopt children without carrying them. So uh we have over 250 of them and Anurra

is one of our inc fellows and he runs something called Manzel mystics and the reason we wanted to bring this perspective is working with youth and creativity is extremely important. So

Anurag you are uh you've been in the music field for a long time and uh um right now you're working with over 60,000 children across 900 schools teaching music. they have like taken on

one thing. I said we're going to teach music and you actually have a van that you take to different schools and teach them and uh tell me a little bit about you teach things like uh intellectual

property and uh uh your human rights all kinds of these things through music. So tell us about that journey a little bit. Yeah. And thanks uh Lakshmi. U I I remember eight years ago uh like seeing

this dream with you and she used to see my eyes uh glittering when I used to talk about this mobile music school and it's a reality now. And uh and what I I would say it's it's for me it's less

about AI. It's more about hi heart intelligence because we're talking about human and what makes us human is a heart pumping and making us alive and the heart is learning all the time and so

and we and I personally saw like my story um I grew up in a low-inccome family in Delhi studied in a government school got 52% hence no college started learning music and I in within a year I

started my band I was in the US in Seattle learning marketing and sales and oh how did it happen? Um it happened because music helped us learn that but because I create my own original songs

based on ideas of Kabir and Gandhi G and first thing was what if someone steal my work and this this thing was there like what what if someone steals my idea and and it was very easy for anyone to just

take your idea or maybe take your song and sing in a movie or a stage. So for us one of the first thing that we teach children how to sing, write, compose and perform a song. It it is very important

for us that we made sure that they don't lose their property with they create also they don't steal anyone's property which was there and I was doing that uh translating some English song putting

some Hindi lyrics and making myself cool and but I was like no that's that's create AI is there to help us learn things um and that's what we made sure that every time we go in a classroom and

a child learns to write a song or compose a song, they must know that uh that intellectual property is a thing and it is uh a big career opportunity right now. Um u all the streaming

platform have made sure that people who are like me creating a song get the royalty but if I create a song through AI they don't get money. So we always say if you want to be if it's fun if it

you want it then do like create song through AI but the streaming all streaming platform says you cannot earn money. So we always say if you want to earn money create a song on your own.

&gt;&gt; Absolutely. Well I mean one is so amazing to see the diversity um that's represented on this panel and uh you know start thinking of your questions. We're going to do one more prepared

question but then we want to hear what's on your mind as well. Um and so let's bring us back maybe to this historic India AI summit and I know you know many people many announcements u being made

by the panelist and you know our attendees here as well on my end certainly you'll see a number of AI kit announcements is already started we'll have mi we'll turn to mi um in a few

minutes to talk about that as well. Uh so there's AI kitten announcements. There's also my startup optimize Jio where having helped brands with a move to mobile and social and being relevant

there. Uh optimize Jio and I have to say in India it's generative engine optimization. It is not GIO it's it's GEO. Uh we are helping brands with being relevant because u you know business

decisions consumer decisions are being made off of questions being asked by chat GPT uh perplexity and the like. So that's the platform and we have a bunch of announcements there. Uh but um Asha

maybe coming to you. You know we are sitting here at this historic India AI summit and you know if access to advanced ships is going to determine who can build powerful models are we at the

risk of concentrating AI power in a few ecosystems. I don't think uh the limiting factor is access to chips. I think the limiting factor is the

ambition you carry this space. Um technology is a great equalizer. Technology is also a great opportunity creator. I mean I think one of the comments Radha made right when

you talk about how India transformed driving the services market they just moved faster than anybody else. That's really it. Everybody here moved way faster than anybody else and

built what the services industry gold standard look like for the rest of the world. AI is the same. This is a technology transformation. People that move the fastest, have bold ambition,

are willing to execute will will make things happen and people will work to make things happen for them. That's essentially it. And so I think when you think about

where you've seen speed happen, where you've seen the growth happen, it's primarily been the ideas, the speed at which people are executing and then the access. Um I think you'll see more and

more compute will be critical. Um we're seeing already that you in all the companies us included are doing everything to ramp to meet the demand. But this is where I mean we we've been

discussing this you know through this entire summit. It it's the idea of saying okay how do you take human intelligence service intelligence and complement it with artificial

intelligence and that complementing of artificial intelligence is about how do you then have a thoughtful strategy as a country as a company as a startup to build that compute layer and that

compute investment structure that gives you the outcomes that you need that complement the human ambition and the human scale you want to achieve so I think it's both I do I don't believe it

will be a limiting factor for those that want to move fast. Uh you just have to be creative with the resources you have and believe me we're building fast and as quickly as we can to meet all the

demand that we have. &gt;&gt; Uh so Rada continuing on that about being faster here than anywhere else. Uh you've been doing that for 10 years before AI was fashionable word. What

kind of investments do you think are needed to move people up the value chain of AI in India? comment on the same because I think it's a really important

&gt;&gt; right yeah &gt;&gt; different investments in AI &gt;&gt; so if you look at the three parts of investments in AI think of it as

triangle right and we've heard a lot of this it's the AI let me let's call it the technologies the models explanation all the stuff the open AI the anthropics the Google deep science etc. do then

there's all the infrastructure and you've heard all the announcements multibillion dollars of infrastructure and then there is AI intelligence and that is the human intelligence and

it's the nexus of the technology intelligence the infrastructure to do this and the human intelligence that really scales AI so yes should we be worried about AI taking away jobs. I

think we should but to me it's not taking away jobs. It's how the jobs are evolving. So you ask me what are the investments needed and this is where I think really I mean yesterday I felt so

I feel very hopeful with young people anyway. Average age of our company is 24.5. You would never know that looking at me and the sassiest people in the my company would say the if it was not for

you it would be 23. I've actually and that's that sassy young people from all over India not from the cities necessarily not the IITs. So what is changing in AI? You can take young

people from a variety of different backgrounds and we had some young people come into the Immerit booth and say we're in commerce or I we're in something else.

How do we become AI people? That transformation or that it's like an equation. How do you take a large number of young people and you I don't want to use the word skilling but they become AI

ready. So you want to make data AI ready, you want to make young people AI ready and you want to make the infra AI ready. When you do all those three things, the darn thing scales. The

second thing I would say is, and this came out quite a bit in the discussions yesterday, whether it was Daria speaking from anthropic or definitely um you know from Google Sun talked about this. What

are the applications of AI? That is where we are today. We've got the large models and of course they are scaling. How do you apply it in precision agriculture? Because if you do and you

can you can actually catch crop failure. We work with like people like John Deere and you catch the crop failure in an area like this. You've saved the entire field from just and they have seen

immense amount of production increases because of that. If you can look at breast cancer screening for women and you can screen people all over breast cancer in India for Indian women versus

Asian versus Caucasian versus black the the the smaller models are very different because the parameters are different if you can use that then you're starting to get AI into societal

applications and then into enterprise AI because that's where the big business any technology scales and gets adapted and adopted when the enterprises start to use them accounting legal etc. So

that is the investment that's needed. Handing it over to you Mhir. &gt;&gt; Thank you. I think I'll I cover it on two different dimension. The first is focus on applied AI. So uh I I think it

is best especially for India it's it's good to develop the models but not to blindly chase this model race that's happening in western world because if you look at the history the printing

press was invented in Germany. Dutch used it and became a superpower for few hundred years. Industrial revolution was invented. France has all the all the parameters to succeed. A small island of

England used industrial revolution in every aspect of the economy became Great Britain. I'm making a point that you don't have to invent a technology. The success lies in applying that technology

in every aspect of economy. And that is that is India's superpower if it focuses on it. You have eight 18 or different industrial hubs in each of them very specifically applying applied AI like

auto I heard automative AI right can you create global competitiveness with those models that's that's where the primary investment has to go and it can completely change the economic outlook.

The second thing where investment needs to go is in inclusion. I think this is a remarkable technology that can include a vast amount of people that were previously not included in digital

economy. Thi think about the first computers with a English keyboard. You can't include 90% of the world population in that interface. Then came the mobile phone that got little easier.

Now you have a technology where anybody can talk easily easily participate. So this is the time to include everybody and one of the things AI Kiran and we are doing together is we announced a

partnership where together we will in next five years we will train million women and youth on AI and automation together. So and I think the both sides have to

happen. We we need to make economic growth and we have to make sure we can take everybody with us. &gt;&gt; Open it up for any questions. &gt;&gt; Yes.

&gt;&gt; And tell us a little bit about the wonderful work you do as you um also ask your question. &gt;&gt; Hi. Am I Hi, my name is Anapama. Um I am one of uh AI members. Um, professionally

I'm a data scientist now moved to a technical read role where I'm actually helping a lot of banking and financial institutions uh come up with AI and automation solutions. Um, so I work a

lot in building up PC's use cases and at the end of them uh building up uh strategies to uh for them to come up with enterprise solutions for them. Um my question uh is basically to Anurag

Hugh u and this is a little bit of a personal question. Um we're talking about AI. Okay. And we're talking about skilling. We're talking about um a new world. My question is what is it that we

as parents should be teaching our kids for the next 15 years um when the world is fully automated? um they are already in an AI age because they're growing in an AI age. They see

AI, they hear do and in fact they're doing everything right. So what are those skills that we as parents should be teaching um our kids to be ready for the next 15 years and um yeah in the AI

automated age what is it that we should be you know thinking through at this point I mean of course skills will come at a later stage but what is it that we what are what are those blind spots that

we don't see as parents and as people or as professionals who are just busy in building up solutions who are busy in automating things but there's a human factor out there right uh after 15 years

what is it that is going to make them stay connected that's a brilliant question our OG mama is here so she can answer better um I guess when I became an ink fellow I

became a father also my son is 8 years old I am an ink fellow for 8 years u for before that two years I learned to be a father uh then I became a father. So I feel the more onus is on us. Um

it I p this is my very personal I feel the five senses and there are nine emotions uh navas uh and India has a lot of literature there. I guess if as a as as

a parent I just made sure that my son understand the five senses and nine emotions and and then I plan everything according to that. It's not like I don't want to give phone to my son or I don't

want to do this or that. So my my son uh does all those things. One of the things we started doing was birthday celebration going on on street or maybe going

somewhere and and making him sense all these things. So I guess five emotion uh nine emotions, five senses if we know it, we can just Yeah. &gt;&gt; So So basically you're saying that we

need to be consistent with the five emotions. Five &gt;&gt; the five senses. the five senses and nine emotions like and ensure that this is there at the same time parallelly

where we are even automating uh and we're bringing AI. Yeah, &gt;&gt; you should send us that list of five senses and nine emotions and we'll we'll share it with the community as well.

&gt;&gt; Can I can I can I add though I &gt;&gt; I mean this is a maybe I feel fairly strongly about this. I think we need to teach all our kids resilience. Yes, &gt;&gt; they need to learn to fail. They need to

know it's okay to fail. They need to know life is not easy. They need to know life is unfair. And they need to learn to survive and thrive and learn to be happy in it. So

if they have resilience, they will survive all these changes. And I think that's where you see kids struggle because when kids don't know how to be resilient, that's when they struggle.

when you teach them early and you know you're there as a support mechanism for them to go through those experiences they will learn and especially with the change we're about to experience even we

don't know I mean we can sit here and speculate as a panel what the world is going to look like in 15 years we don't know &gt;&gt; I add something that's really great

&gt;&gt; you know it's can I add one thing to this &gt;&gt; and I know it's a it's the future &gt;&gt; oh yeah it is so she didn't ask the question she said as parents, I'm going

to talk as a grandparent. Okay? Hey, age comes with this, right? And it wasn't so much them asking me, it was my asking them. And this upper son, my

niece's son. And I said, Nikki, so what is it do you think you've learned in school? He's a junior, so he's in 11th and just one more year to go. I said and what do you think we should be teaching

kids at school and he says party look I don't think there is anything you can really teach us at this point because AI is beyond all the parents he actually said that which I actually agree with

and we started talking about it and the thing that came out is being a curious learner because he said and I'm repeating to you. Not what I said to him, but what he

said to me. He said, "Whatever I learned last year, I wanted to go into computer science at Stanford. It was my biggest dream." Hey, that's not going to get me a job.

No. And I have to do different things. So, I have to know what's going on. Resilience. I totally agree. I loved your answer to it because it gave a completely from the heart and from the

brain and from nature. But this thing of knowing what's around you, learning about it, being curious about it because that is really important in AI. You keep

pinging it to make it better, right? And this is part of the intelligence. So thinking critically, curious learners, none of this is going to happen by keeping uh phones away from them.

They're going to learn to be curious because they want to be and go out in nature and learn it, right? Or wherever. and go out into the field if you want to work in precision a and a a kid from the

city doesn't know anything about it or in medical whatever the thing so to me the answers are coming from these glorious young kids &gt;&gt; I I I was going to quickly say there are

three elements in my opinion the first is in my generation we only studied one subject uh like computer engineering I think in today people are going to do mult multiple things, right? So,

combining and when you combine the possibilities are limitless. Uh people who study rock climbing and video game design and when that person creates a rock climbing video game, it will be the

most authentic experience you could ever get. Right? So things like that, neuroscience and medical there are just unimaginable possibilities. So that is on the carrier side how you progress. I

think second thing I asked my daughter just like you so you you said you asked them and she said that stayed with me. She said that the future is that there are no worker bees. There are only queen

bees. I loved it. &gt;&gt; I loved the the the the spirit of it, you know, the the empowerment it embodies, the ambition it embodies. And

I think if everybody had that mindset, amazing things are possible, right? You said three elements come back, &gt;&gt; you know. Yeah. I think I think what

we're going to do is actually we're just going to ask the questions. We are going to combine the questions. So, just we're going to hear a bunch of questions and then the panelists can just pick

whichever they want uh and what they want to do. Okay. Question. &gt;&gt; Sorry, I I remember the third one. I think the the the third thing is the power of the question. So this amazing

thing AI that we have it knows many answers but it doesn't know what are the right questions and it is not likely to know anytime soon and so having the right questions I I'll share this

example with you on our family dining table I I do this experiment to learn from the younger generation because they instinctively know what the future is right they they know better than us

&gt;&gt; so we made a rule once and said uh you know we're going to talk about a subject and you can't tell me anything that Alexa City or Chad GPT would tell me. So they said okay bring it on dad. I said

okay. So we talked about some bird with the longest wingspan or something and they said that that's not fair. The question itself is biased towards chart GPT. Ask me something that is they said

it nicer than this but they said ask me something that is worthy of human. Right? So I said okay. So I said the Patagonia has the ecological imbalance after all the industrial development. In

order to restore it back, it's a it's a complex thing. How do you introduce new species and complex problem and and and so how do you how do you bring it back to its original state? That dinner

conversation went on for three days. &gt;&gt; Various tools were used and together as a family we came up with a plan on if you were to do it, what would that look like?

&gt;&gt; Amazing. Now imagine those conversations happening on every dining table if we have the right questions. &gt;&gt; Amazing. All right, just quick spattering of questions and then we'll

have the panel just take Yes. Yeah. Question. &gt;&gt; Can I? &gt;&gt; Hi, my name is Salil Pande. I'm founder of an AI company, Vimok. We work with

global higher education institutions. Uh I actually led my life very differently when I went when I went to IIT. I never studied and I look back and I say I did did the best thing. Um so my question

right now is uh that um with the um disruption that we are seeing and the uh pretty much like IQ is gone by AI the only thing that we are left with is EQ um and this uh if you look at the

education system and the system here we actually hold on to something like we hold on to some exam um some college and then some company then eventually we grow. I want to hear from you guys. How

would you like to now disrupt at the fundamental levels which is K through 12 going into higher education in order to support what is happening &gt;&gt; disrupting education and fundamental

you ask a very quick question all of that. Hi, I'm Hendra. I teach uh AI and sustainability at IIM Udipur. And uh quick question, we lot of countries are now banning multimedia for because

the harm is obvious because we didn't have the guardrails and things came along. AI is only going to amplify the harms just like it's going to amplify the power. We heard about the power and

we know maybe AI can be used. The guardrails that we need for the younger generation is just connected to the question follow up to him is what do we need to protect our kids from the harm

while we give them the power &gt;&gt; you had your hand okay last two questions we'll ask and then we'll have the &gt;&gt; one

disruption one was &gt;&gt; across Thank you so much this is Anjali I represent Czech Mahendra I have been doing throughout my career you know connecting the left brain with the right

brain which is creative and technology. Uh so hence you know AI is very close to my heart as well. So ma'am the question that I have for you is basically today in the world people are getting

overwhelmed and confused there are so many platforms coming over so many methods coming over right if somebody has to ideulate and strategize what to learn first and what next right how to

go about it because so much is happening there's a lot of panic around it. Um last question AI Kiran member part of service now also women for ethical the AI movement. How do we build trust in

the internet? Earlier you had provenence via people curating the internet. Uh now people are turning to chat GPT and trusting those answers over human answers. How do you build provenence?

That's the main question. &gt;&gt; Okay, last question. Sorry. &gt;&gt; I do grassroot training with people for AI but their digital gap is still very high. I have to go back and tell teach

them tech before I can teach them AI. How do you solve this? &gt;&gt; Okay. All right. Can I just ask one more? &gt;&gt; Because we are having a lot of

conversations around the youth uh and you know the power of the question etc. Uh all of you are uh fermented with wisdom and the application of AI and what you bring to the lens. How do you

crunch that wisdom cycle of the youth? Because at the end of the day it is information age. There's so much information coming. So facts, figures, information, you're brilliant at. But

how do you build that wisdom to infer to ask the right questions and to interpret you know can you crunch that wisdom? &gt;&gt; All right. So we going to give like 30 seconds to each of the panelists as we

close and maybe we'll go from you either you know the trust how do we what do we learn? How do we make a sense of this maze? What about wisdom? Any aspect that jumps to you as you want to this

incredible audience with some parting voice. &gt;&gt; I mean I think on learning you just start. There are incredible tools. I mean it's amazing how quickly the tools

and the capabilities to learn in the space have developed and how fast you can learn. I mean if any of you were paying attention to like the series of events um TCS did a hackathon where they

got women from all over the country. This was 1200 women right non-native they're not English speakers. um they come from different walks of life and in four hours they were able to do

brilliant things with the the training that they received. I mean these are the kinds of things. So the potential is massive. Um so I think anybody and that's the beauty of what we have in AI

in the positive side is you can just take it and run with it and learn. Uh I'm an optimist so I believe you can always find what doesn't work but I think if more of us focus on what works

we can do a lot more good a lot faster than what can go wrong. All right, &gt;&gt; this is the only panel where nobody has asked asked us about impact on jobs. So I'll leave it at that. The uh I'll take

the take the aspect of how do you teach them digital skills and then the AI skills. I I think there is an opportunity here to skip some of the old digital skills because they weren't very

friendly. Uh I I I think the in the new world we have seen I'll give you a few examples. We trained 700 women in Africa for 6 weeks and 500 found a job within a week. Uh we trained people in uh

Mississippi Delta, which is a very poor part of the US, was somebody flipping burgers at $12 an hour. 6 weeks later, they had a $120,000 job uh in AI. This is a technology that doesn't require you

two or four years training courses which normally the people who are needed the most can't afford to have it. So the fact that you can provide this kind of mobility on this technology is arguably

the best thing about this technology. &gt;&gt; I guess for EQ education disruption EQ to to work on EQ is arts and that's a disruption. And I'm glad AI came and hence invest India just shared that the

three uh trillion Indian rupees is going to be that's the market size because um &gt;&gt; uh for media and entertainment sector because the world has recognized that if you want EQ to be developed uh invest in

arts uh live music classes are increasing drastically and that's where I'm here we can talk more &gt;&gt; for me this is not a question for the future. 72% of the people who work at

Immerit uh come from very low-income backgrounds and come from the hinterland of India. So it is absolutely possible to be able to um you start as though they haven't been skilled before at all.

You know AI is new. There's no baggage. It's wonderful. you as Mhir said there's a whole new way of doing it and uh they learn and they are it's they learn use AI to learn and they what they learn

they teach AI it's really interesting to watch you have young women in a place called Meta Bruce who came from tailoring and those kind of backgrounds and why are they a center of excellence

for computer vision because the the focus on that single pixel level accuracy is something that they have and they learn the other skills. I would finish by saying we also have a

foundation called Anudep and this is really working across and 500 630,000 young men and women 50% being women have been skilled have been skilled in AI literacy literacy just knowing what is

AI how do you use it I know it doesn't address the IM part but I'm just talking about at the grassroots level and when they learn how to work with AI it's not an enigma it's harder I would say the

last thing I would say and I love my industrial co industry colleagues it's harder to take somebody from industry and train them in AI because they have to unlearn first than to take a young

person out of some place in Orisa in who comes from um a second tier or uh even villages and be able to skill them in AI as to how to be working with AI. So it's the nexus of AI technology and that

human and I'm such a believer that we can do this here. Awesome. So with that, let's give a huge round of applause for our panelists. One, two, if you want to get involved in the AI kit on moment

around women, youth differently able, we have incredible leaders here. Praa, Niha, Vibbhav, they're truly the heart and soul of making this happen. Let's so let's hear it for them. Please ask them

their questions and you if feel free to come grab any one of us if your questions didn't get answered. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; I just I just want to say end up with

saying that if you can work with people smarter than you, if you can work with people half your age and twice as smart, I think we'll find all the answers. And thank you so much for giving your time.

Thank you. Try water.
