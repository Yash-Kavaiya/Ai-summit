This session examines how human potential is shaped, scaled, or constrained by AI systems and what it takes to ensure these technologies expand capability rather than concentrate advantage. Leaders from automation, AI-driven enterprise, data ecosystems, global business, philanthropy, and the creative arts discuss where AI meaningfully augments human skill, and where intentional design is required to prevent new forms of exclusion.
