## 📝 Transcript

top-down approaches in terms of finding the AI solutions uh uh India's critical problems and weather and climate is a major vertical. So welcome sir. We have uh Dr. Ravi Chandran uh he doesn't need

any introduction but uh he's ministry of earth sciences secretary and uh everything and anything under weather and climate and sustainability sir is heading it and we look forward to your

su Mr. Single who is a venture capitalist and he will give a very very important aspect about uh how funding and e economy is going to uh drive the

solutions in AI for climate. Uh professor Dyogi he's professor from UT Austin that is University of Texas at Austin also he's affiliated to IIT Ruri and now one of the founding team of IRO.

Uh again sir doesn't need any introduction. uh we have uh Dr. Shukuma is uh NRF CEO and uh very very uh great supporter of now AI for science and we we look forward for your support as well

as your inputs on how can we proceed on this and we have uh Mr. Manish Maradwaj who has a very critical role in India as a secretary of uh disaster NDMA and so welcome sir we have professor Proful

Chandra he is heading uh the uh center for excellence for data sciences as well as his dean R&amp;D Atria University Bangalore and we have Dr. Karthik who is a distinguished scientist and engineer

Nvidia and he has played a major role in the very famous uh AI models which all of us are hearing and they are you know changing the scenario of modeling and

the way science is going to happen. So welcome sir. So I look forward to uh your contribution was not in the official. &gt;&gt; Oh okay. Can can we stand just here?

Okay ma'am stand. This will be on the website and records and &gt;&gt; didn't happen. It didn't happen. So I uh before we we open up the panel I

just wanted to uh have a very quick question to uh professor said uh in terms of what was the objective what we are looking when you started IRO as a uh you know in India we wanted to have this

type of a research organization. So if you can quickly tell us about uh what was your the thought process behind IRO and what do you foresee? &gt;&gt; So the idea of IRO uh uh kind of was

initiated when I had a chance to meet the PM uh in December of 2023. I was asked to come and discuss with him. um he he is always very curious and in technology and so he wanted to uh hear

about the ideas uh on AI since I had multiple interactions on research and AI with him uh during his CM time uh this was a fantastic uh time you know opportunity for me to meet and kind of

discuss uh where India India can shine uh and not necessarily follow the west or China in what we need to do um and so I presented uh both the core foundational AI focus focus on

enterprises not necessarily consumer and web and some of the areas of um uh uh you know where that we can make big economic and uh social impact as well as uh we can support the start startup

ecosystem uh where AI can uh empower uh deep AI technology that drive uh the global products from India. So that was a broad uh uh you know idea and so I currently is developing uh original work

on uh building uh very agile small specific models in this context. For example, if you want to make a model for serving uh extreme weather related issue in that is hyper uh local then uh you

know all the spatio temple aspects all the variety of modeling aspects all the uh you know prediction algorithms those are the things that we'll bring in but we will not be building on the top of

large language models or so-called foundational model which come with lot of baggage we don't know what kind of data it has been trained on many other things so original research in uh you

know creating new small agile models um and so it will be a platform on the top of India AI structure to be able to create models uh and one area in which we would love to create model we have

technical expertise here Dave and many other people and um we can you know so earth science or including disaster including um uh you know sustainability issues is one of the vertical other two

are health and pharma pharma we have very strong partnership with Indian Pharma Alliance and there are 23 um major pharma which is 80% of India's pharma uh you know kind of output and

similarly we are working with some health partners and all but here you see uh the potential partners that we could have uh in making impact into the sustainability and health area.

So thank you. We would like to uh now uh start with uh one open questions and then we'll have one individual question because I'm very sorry the time is very short. The the whole format is actually

we had a one day full workshop and we had to squeeze it in. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So uh so one disclaimer that it's not my personal thing but I may may request you to uh you know finish it in

time like definitely would like to hear a lot from all of you but uh due to constraint of time. So first one opening questions what we'd like to have is uh all of us uh you know would like you to

say is what would be one AI application or a discovery that would excite you about AI helping in this domain of climate uh as well as uh extreme events and uh sustainability as a broader thing

because everything is driven by weather and climate. We have energy, we have health, we have economics, uh and we have agriculture. Many many aspects of it. So we'd like to see what what do you

foresee and how do you u you know would like to uh say that which one u development will help us and uh we'll start with uh you sir. &gt;&gt; Yeah. When you talk about the weather of

course uh it is now depends on various applications. &gt;&gt; Okay. So when we are doing the weather forecast earlier we just to tell that in um suppose how the elephant is going I'm

able to see that elephant how it is going I'm able to tell that next tomorrow it will come here but now the problem is whether because of the climate change and other things the

space and time has changed &gt;&gt; now we have to see in on the elephant some ant is sitting that ant how it is going we want to know so we want to see the elephant plus and so I want to see

two things one is time series other one is a spatial &gt;&gt; if anything on spatial I think the physics based numerical model is doing better job

&gt;&gt; but if you want to go for time series local rhythm &gt;&gt; then a is better &gt;&gt; so we need to do integrate or we need to fuse both together in order to

understand the local weather in a fine scale and you want to go suppose cloud bust is there So you cannot do only with numerical model &gt;&gt; and with AI also.

&gt;&gt; So we need to blend both that is more important. So we want to go for high impact weather events how to predict especially cloud bust and other thing we don't know what how to predict. So that

is why we are looking with whether AI can help or not. That is one of the objective. Thank you. Thank I uh fully agree with what Ravijenda sir has just said. uh uh from the uh early

warning point of view the idea is to have uh DPG sort of uh uh asset for the public so that we are able to uh to disseminate early warning for all. So idea is to have uh trusted uh early

warning for all to be given to the citizens at uh uh low cost and uh this is where AI can definitely play a supporting role. It cannot be purely an AI. It has to be in hybrid model which

has to be connected with the physical systems of the the various sensor fabric and the satellite data which is available to us from various alert generating agencies but to have a source

of a trusted and uh reliable and resilient early warning systems wherein I definitely foresee AI playing a great great role. &gt;&gt; Yes. Thank you. Thank you sir.

&gt;&gt; Yeah. Um I think I'll just double down on the multimodal models that are coming out. I mean one is uh you know the time series model there are spatial models and I will also um you know mention that

uh today with generative AI you can just put a camera pointed to the sky and then um you can actually not only see the patterns of clouds you can forecast 1 hour ahead 2 hours ahead even 4 hours

ahead. Now if I change the camera, make it an IR camera, make it some other multisspectral camera when all the costs are dramatically dropping. Um so you can imagine a network of sensors that

complements also the great work that is being done in mission mousimm and so on and plus now with the low earth orbit satellites going up and also having much more earth observability. I think the

opportunity to fuse insights as opposed to fusing data. I mean data fusion is a painfully uh you know mindbogglingly complex unnecessary complex thing but now there's an opportunity to take

insights from A insights from B and uh fuse it across modes um and also forecasting across these uh modes I think that's a wonderful opportunity um I think that'll have a huge uh thing and

once you integrate that into you know sort of uh you know now casting and other systems I think we can have a great amount of impact the other dimension is of course AI by helping in

discoveries and of new materials and um you know sort of simulations and so on. I think these have wonderful opportunities and of course as you know the Nobel Prize for chemistry went to

somebody from an AI background. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Thank thank you sir. So &gt;&gt; sure. Uh so I will put a consumer lens to this. Uh sir have brought up the point around what is the technology

needed. I think with what is happening with voice agents right now, I think there is a need to have a simple voice framework or a voice sort of app which allows you uh to send not just

information but actually create a resilience approach for the person who is who can literally just click a button and say okay in the next week these are the things that you need to do to

survive the whatever is happening from a climate perspective right or or what do you need to do in the next month. So there is a there is a forecasting aspect to it but more importantly how it you

know integrates with my life. Do I need to stay at home? If I'm a farmer what do I do? If I'm a you know laborer what do I do? So that ability to bring that to my day-to-day life and allow me to

actually act a certain way because of what I expect to see in the environment around me and that includes daily air. Thank you.

&gt;&gt; I'll just add one term. You guys know this word jugard. So this is a very India thing. Jard we can. So there is a framework that is mathematically feasible that we can

model very well that follows equations that follows laws of nature and then there is a human element that we always beat the system and make that happen. mapping that has been very difficult in

a predictive models and this is where I think AI is coming into play that it brings the human dimensions and it brings the societal aspect with the physical constraints and this is what is

most exciting about it into a way that it will be becoming much more accessible is where I think we'll be going. Uh we had heard also about the agentic AI now I heard about the ant AI thanks to you

so I'm going to use that yeah So um I'm going to pick up where professor Naogi and uh Dr. Shiffkumar left. Um you know we work across several AI foundation models in biology in

materials and we have looked at foundation models in weather. I think the breakthrough that I am most anxious to look for is what we call small data fine-tuning. Um what that means is that

when you look at these large foundation models they are fairly general in their applicability and um as professor sh was saying when you have to find them fine-tune them for a specific use case

uh you still need data how small can that data be right uh can you use small data to fine-tune large foundation models I think if you're able to have that breakthrough uh it has applications

across multiple domains that we talked out. &gt;&gt; Um I think a lot has already been shared which is very exciting on many different fronts. One thing I'd like to see more

used in practice is transfer learning which you know of course some regions of the world are data rich and some others are data sparse. Problems are shared across the planet. The physics of

weather and climate are the same no matter where you are in the planet. Uh but at the same time there's uniqueness at hyperlocal scales. But if we can transfer on efficiently from one region

to another with constraints of what exactly we're trying to transfer on I think that would be very impactful. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Thank you Dr. Karthik. &gt;&gt; Oh I think we have a mic here. So we we

saw now right from the spatial as I say sir said it's like from akash and tuck we can we can see everything and uh I think that matters. I I remember uh once I think I was discussing with sir itself

even the due due uh effect you have on the uh immediate temperature and that can you know affect the your surrounding and everything. So from small to big is definitely there and AI also from small

to big we we should see it and that that leads to now I I I'll ask the next round of question is very very specific to uh the areas in which all of you are working as well as having lot of

influence and that's where we would like to hear from you and uh to have a direction in what way we can go at the end of this panel that's what you know can we can we all consolidate and can we

look at you what are the three to four uh immediate things which we can do it and uh with that respect I would like to ask Dr. Dr. Raviandra uh how can India's national

capabilities in AI research technology development and very importantly human resource also evolved to enable the transition from current physicsdriven prediction system to AI enabled user

specific decision systems what are the bottlenecks in that and how can we overcome &gt;&gt; yeah as so as um pointed out basically We have a

capability basically one of the strength what we have is basically the data &gt;&gt; the data volumes are huge nowadays because we have hundreds of 150 years old IM IMD's things that legacy as well

as data available now how to utilize this data &gt;&gt; and we have young brains of so many young people but we have not fully utilized that one because each one can

interpret the data different way &gt;&gt; but finally it has to come out into concrete solution. When you talk about AI and weather if you are talking about why we want to go for AI first of all

because the numerical model we have a lot of assumptions. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; Because of that assumptions the error grows.

&gt;&gt; Now that error growth whether with the AI we can reduce that is number one. When we are going for initial condition is better you can predict better. So we have to have a initial condition uh in

better way by reducing the error. So I think uh many people even some of the people many people are working in AI different people I think we need to pull the cap many resource people in our

domain so that they can look at data differently and also they can use how to uh minimize the error and also how to reduce the uncertaintities and also there are various techniques to improve

the forecast. So that's what I because nowadays the downscaling is one of the important things in the large scale model we fails. So the AI will can downscale better way in the localized

suppose 1 kilometer resolution weather forecast we want to forecast how we can do. So we need to have uh more and more minds and more and more people have to work on it

&gt;&gt; and uh I think we need to open up the data &gt;&gt; so that we have to that means different people can come back and work on that. I have only one important thing is

basically this when you are talking about AML the trust is more important as he pointed out I think we need to have a better trust in the forecast system I think where there's a need for

validation and verification that also very important in AI can make it so our capabilities are huge but we need to uh what is called utilize them with the data uh strongness because now the

biology ology people even biology people are working in AM that same people we can do one more important point is our people we always addict with the same set we are thinking only this is the way

but there are multiple way that's why some other discipline people also look at this because this is datadriven other discipline can look at it differently we can have some pathway or a way forward

that may be one of the things we can look at &gt;&gt; yeah that's a very very important point because we look only weather from maybe only physics physics angle or weather

angle. So we're looking at that that's very important and that leads to you know what is important for the disaster management s we would like to ask because uh highly dependent on the

extreme events and the managing that is very difficult. So how do you foresee adoption of AI for infrastructural preparedness for disaster management and especially reducing the severity impacts

on vulnerable population because uh cities and all maybe and those who have a access to many good things they they can handle but we have large vulnerable population. So how do you see uh AI

helping in the last mile application? uh very apt questions as you all are aware that uh India is vulnerable to multi- uh multiple hazards uh uh not only

cyclones, tsunamis, earthquakes uh landslides, flash floods, even gloss. So uh and uh looking at the vast geography and the population which can be impacted. It is very essential that uh

uh from the disaster management point of view we have a system of uh uh uh adequate preparedness and early warning capabilities. Nonetheless uh the disaster and secondly the uh the though

the country has made uh we have made uh as a whole of government approach uh undertaken various mitigation measures to mitigate the disasters but disasters uh the we can only mitigate the effect

of the disasters. So how do we keep the population uh uh in a way so that you know the early warning system capabilities are of the highest order so that we are able to minimize loss of

lives. Now this is a very important challenge and various agencies particularly uh as Rijendans has rightly said uh the IMD and for from several we have over the period of time we have

developed enormous capability uh to predict say cyclone path and trajectory very clearly 5 days uh ahead of its landfall. So in a way we are able to do uh timely evacuation prepositioning of

the response teams which helps in minimizing uh and even achieving zero mortality uh milestones. But there are other hazards and say secondly the way the hazard

uh scenario has unfolded in the last few years. It has become a multi-hazard cascading hazard sort of scenario in which one hazard leads to other hazards. So the incidents of cloud burst which

are currently uh cannot be uh predicted uh because of the uh uh there are various technical issues also behind it but uh clouds leading to landslides leading to flash floods are see this

concern. So how do we prepare ourselves given the uh the current state of resources and the development. So this is where AI can definitely pitch in. Uh so the idea is actually to uh to get the

uh various uh the from the alert generating agencies all the the data which are coming from our terrestrial the satellite data the sensory data and then to be able to use it for predictive

uh forecasting or also to better the now casting to increase the granularity of the uh of the uh of the uh even the early warning signal because uh there are limitation of how many satellite

systems we can play put into place. It is not possible to man to map each and every uh the hill in the vulnerable areas. So uh this is where uh the complications arise and since

development has also has to take place in the vulnerable particularly the in the Himalayan zone. So the challenge is here to use technology at the maximum. What I foresee is that the availability

of the of the data from various multiple sources can definitely be analyzed and used for even with the current set of uh sensor uh network capabilities to predict or rather to uh to pinpointedly

and and accurately predict uh the uh the forecast the uh the uh the uh uh early warning uh signals for the targeted population and then it will help the district authorities, the state

authorities for timely evacuation and response and relief operations to be carried out. So this is one field where NDMA particularly is collaborating with uh u multiple national agencies and IMD

and MR sciences have play are playing a very major contributo role in that development of the uh of the such a DPG. uh uh I'm very sure that uh the the startup ecosystem in our country

definitely carries the agility to uh to uh to provide to do a collaborative uh uh uh support the uh the efforts of the NDMA and the national agencies in taking this mission forward. So and this is

where I believe uh that uh we can definitely reduce the we can definitely increase our uh uh the early warning capabilities particularly regarding flash floods and the glacial lake

outburst floods uh the lightning and the uh landslides and uh we are very hopeful that uh with the support of the IMD and the minister of earth sciences we can definitely also take major and

significant steps towards even uh predicting or uh identifying the uh most vulnerable uh or the potential cloud bust type situations so that we are able to timely warn the public.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Thank you. Thank you sir. And it's it's a it's an important point as Dr. Ravi Chandran has said and which you have taken it the need of the data and

the infrastructure also linking that to and the startup uh the setup which we have and we have seen it in the expo so many uh you know people are working on climate and sustainability how can we uh

you know put that together and how can we have the best out of it so that leads to a question to uh Dr. Shukumar you NRF is enabling the research ecosystem as well as the product uh ecosystem. So we

would like to see uh how uh NRF is uh you know helping in terms of u creating AI funds what advice you can give it to the community and how to be uh making and developing uh products and

what sort of support we can expect from NRF on that. &gt;&gt; Okay. Um so for folks who may not be how many of you know about ANRF? Maybe just I can get a show of hands. Okay. All

right. Not too many but uh so so ANRF is a statutory body of government of India. Uh and you know Dr. Ravitendran is on my board as well. Uh so uh this is a body which is um uh you know sort of meant to

catalyze research and development funding in India. So we have a grant funding. Oops. And also we have um you know a capital fund called RDI which is a 1 lakh cr fund which is meant to only

for the private sector. The grant funding is uh typically for the um um you know not for-p profofit research sector which includes um academia labs you know section 8 companies and others

right so uh research entities recognized by su DS and so on. So um our our thinking is that uh we uh not only have broad-based funding for uh you know like what National Science Foundation does

but we also have more focused uh funding in a mission mode. Uh so we have a couple of programs that might be of interest. One is our AI for science and engineering is a program we have

currently underway and one of the tracks of that is AI for weather and climate. Uh so it's already there and in addition uh we are going to be launching uh a major program in about a month uh called

leaprog demonstrators for societal innovation. Okay. Leaprog demonstrators for societal innovation. So the idea is that you take a societal problem um uh then rather than talking about it let's

do something about it. Okay. And then and not do just incremental thing. It should be a leaprog demonstrator and it should be a demonstrator not just a theoretical thing. So these are kinds of

things we're doing and alongside it we are also doing challenges or we'll be introducing more challenge mode uh you know sort of things that we don't see come bottom up in our proposal formats.

So as part of that we are also collaborating uh deeply our AI for science and engineering the weather and climate we are actually collaborating with and uh with their mission mim uh

program. So, so we are linking we are getting um you know both the expertise as well as the data and um you know so that we can put together the AI expertise along with the uh sensor

expertise and data and we hope to similarly collaborate with other parts of the government and you know I would strongly urge collaboration from NDMA also uh the stage so uh so that's the

general approach and then in the um so that accelerates and also I just want to mention that just two days back we've announced a hackathon also AI I for science and engineering hackathon

&gt;&gt; for you know uh you know weather and climate actually so it's a it is currently open it's done in partnership with IBM and IIT Delhi so we put out data sets and also in partnership with

MOS and others so we have data sets and you know we are encouraging um some of the work there um but in addition we'll be doing more um as I said there's a societal innovation program which can

also admit of newer types where you bring together disciplines we actually then go to solve solve real problems and so on. So I think that's the nature of what we'll try to do and then the RDI

fund is meant for translation and scaling. Uh in addition we also have translational centers. We have a program that is open right now and so on. So these are various uh programs and

mechanisms uh we plan to do. Uh but the the goal of all of this is to always focus on impact and working backwards rather than uh you know doing um some undirected research. Right? So we want

to drive research in a more directed way towards impact but at the same time we do support curiosity based broad-based uh research as well right so that's the balance we're trying to strike

&gt;&gt; sir looking at this uh in terms of public private partnership because uh it's not just the P proof of uh concept we are doing if we would like to have uh consistent solutions and uh not only as

a demonstration product but as operational where we have uh every day uh some services coming out of it. How do you see the public private partnership coming?

&gt;&gt; In all our mission mode programs, the goal is to accelerate things from a lower technology readiness like TRL one or two to mid range like 506 and so on. That is the purpose of that and in as

part of all of those programs we are supporting programs at a critical scale. So we are encouraging consortiums to come and bid for it or hub and spoke type setup.

&gt;&gt; We are uh you know explicitly saying don't make it individual proposals. It has to be collaborative proposals. In some of our programs, we are uh you know we have put out open IP licensing so

that when you have a um you know a company or a startup and so on they can actually partner with academia pick up the IP and quickly translate. So uh that will also encourage rapid translation.

So we are uh introducing uh you know IP and other innovations to drive uh translation. So we're going to be doing this in few more programs. uh plus we have uh this uh translational research

um centers program which uh has mandates partnership with uh industry as well. So in we are using different mechanisms all of them are driving collaborations plus the RDI fund which is a 1 lakh cr fund

by the time it hits the market it will become three or four lakh crores uh it is only for industry but the industry if they don't have capabilities they must collaborate with academia and so on so

there'll be a demand for industry academic collaboration coming from that side as well so we are attacking the problem from multiple directions and uh you know all of these are meant to uh

encourage collaboration for impact collaboration for impact So that collaboration leads us to uh you know industry as we know Nvidia is uh very much into and pioneering uh in terms of

many models coming in and uh Dr. Karthik is part of the model development. So foundational AI weather models and climate models such as earth to graphcast and AIFS and many more are now

demonstrating good performance at a global scales. So what further development do you see basically the physics? How can we interpret the physics coming and the AI models and the

validations very very important as sir has said that you know very very local scale we are talking about even air quality at a 400 m so or or floods at 10 m or something like that we we are

talking about that so how do you see uh what is more to be done in terms of models operationally robust at a hyper local scale &gt;&gt; thank you yeah that's a rich question

but um I'm going keep it fairly brief because it could take the next 30 minutes to get through that. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I know. &gt;&gt; U so I'll touch on three things. One is

I think um creating the benchmark uh data sets and the benchmark metrics that are needed to achieve operational quality. And one if you look at what has led to the developments at the global

scale at 25 km resolution is the ER5 data set from ECMWF and the benchmark problems that they've defined on that data set like the weather bench uh for example. So I think if we want to get

down to the hyper local scales which of course depends on the region that you're talking about and the types of metrics that you care about it would be very helpful to create the benchmark data

sets and the associated benchmark metrics that can drive uh towards that. And if we just wind the clock back um the whole AI revolution in deep learning began because of imageet

&gt;&gt; and that was 15 well 12 years ago and they defined benchmark data sets and benchmark metrics that drove the revolution in AI. So I think we can do the same thing if we take it down to the

hyper local level as well. The second is the to leverage the supervisation techniques that AI has shown to be very powerful. uh we're already doing that right now in the earth 22 program with

taking 25 km data and super resolving it to 1 km that's also we've been doing this in weather and climate for decades with downscaling the process of taking course resolution simulations and making

high resolution &gt;&gt; so if we can stretch that even further to go down to these hyperlocal scales uh I'm fairly confident that the technologies needed in generative AI to

get us to that scale &gt;&gt; uh are either already exist or will be invented in the next two to three years. So &gt;&gt; um I'm hopeful that that'll that'll help

us get there. Thank I think that's a important we look forward to and that's where you know public private partnership comes in picture because when we see it uh very specific to India

and within India also very specific to a region we which we'll have to you know because uh we have a very different climate uh all across right from north south east west so I think uh having

maybe small models for a region also can be a future maybe in the so that uh once we have this system in terms of you know what is to be done and we have the modeling in place we need a

computational power for that because all these models still still we need a lot of so that comes to uh the investments and that's where we would like to ask uh Mr. Sepal uh your investment portfolios

have energy transition mobility because see when we speak weather and climate it's not just weather and climate it's the broadly everything in terms of cloud in terms of energy in terms of health

all all those things. So when you look at your portfolios what advice would you like to give to startups to be able to successfully scale up uh all these individual domains

as well as integrated domains? &gt;&gt; Sure. So I think uh in terms of scale up the first thing that at least in the in the climate space is very clear is that partnership with the government is

critical because that's where all the discussion we're having on data all the discussion we're having on deployment the government is the one that's driving it. So I think uh any of our portfolio

companies that are working in this space we end up uh involving government institutions that they would you know work with and we build those relationships with ministries uh at the

fund level also so that we can introduce them to the government various government programs. Um beyond that uh the other advice is that uh you have to start thinking about segmenting the

market that you're targeting. So there is the general population and that again goes through the government. There is that that funding I think as Dr. Shikwar said has to come in a p private public

private partnership because collaboration I think is an important word you used and I think that collaboration is uh both on the deployment side but also on the funding

side. Mhm. &gt;&gt; So it's great to see what the government has done with ANRF, with RDI and that capital that is becoming available. Um there's also philanthropic capital that

is actually now becoming available in this space. So there is there are philanthropists that are looking at programs at scale and saying okay can if this program can scale we'll put money

behind it. So that that that's one part but the other segment is that you have to also think about where is monetization possible &gt;&gt; and there are enough segments where the

core business is getting impacted &gt;&gt; because of whether whether or or other events right and that core business is willing to pay. So you have to therefore se you know segregate the two. In some

ways if you think about it you're building for a public good but the distillation of that allows you to build something for private good and charge for it.

&gt;&gt; Yeah that's that's an important thing because now climate is linked very much to the economics. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Climate and and the economics is is one and on the same

thing. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And it's not just short-term we have to worry about next 10 years 20 years 30 years you know everything. So that's a very very important point. So that leads

to like how are we preparing ourselves and that comes to Dr. Prul. A key challenge uh for India is balancing economic growth while protecting a natural ecosystem. So can you give an

example of real world application where AI can enable this uh transition as well as a creation of solutions which which balance uh &gt;&gt; so I'm going to pick up on something

that Dr. Dr. Karthik said and Manish also mentioned which is the intersection of weather and energy &gt;&gt; right um you know the India is transitioning from a fossil fuel based

economy to a renewable energy power based economy and renewable energy is dominated by solar right now if you look at the kind of models that are becoming available for hyperlocal forecasting

they are also giving us much more predictive power in terms of how much energy will one rooftop solar panel generate which is critical for managing the grid right India's grid needs to be

digitized and in fact um we have a team from Atrian University here which is doing a demo on combining digital public infrastructure from the ministry of power which is India energy stack

combined with AI models which do weather which use weather forecasting and do forecasting about grid loads to be able to trade energy with between consumers and producers or to do demand

flexibility. Now demand flexibility is again something that I see critically important as we talk about sustainable AI right when you move to a data center economy which is huge consumption of

energy u you need to be able to support dynamic demand flexibility uh using a combination of AI and little public infrastructure so I think the intersection of AI and energy is

something that deserves quite a bit of attention &gt;&gt; uh and I think we are there to kind of address that. &gt;&gt; Thank you. See we we have data in place,

we have policies in place, we have science in place. Now now what &gt;&gt; money in place. So what is important is how how do you give these solutions to the stakeholders and end users and that

leads the question to professor Dave because he has uh he has an experience of connecting the science to the governance to the actual stakeholders and uh uh you have been leading the

digital twin and AIdriven modeling frameworks. So what opportunities do you see you you have done it in Austin uh but in India uh we we are we we are all aware of our different types of cities

we have. So what opportunities do you see in building digital twins that uh support climate extremes and disaster management goals which all of us have just now deliberated upon the challenges

are there the solutions are there how do you link it &gt;&gt; right I have 2 minutes looks like before we end the session so this is a course I take over two semesters uh but uh what

I'll say is that weather is the tragedy of commons &gt;&gt; uh everyone is affected by it but no one can pay for it &gt;&gt; and the same way when we have to have

institutional investment ments the question comes up how do you make this into a monetizable product and this is where the issues like you know today morning the director general Mapatra

mentioned that we can create some box models which are very simple scalable and transferable and we can create digital twins which are very uh decision specific we don't need to predict every

variable at every scale for everything to try to do that so if we define why we are creating models what decision we are going to guide based on that data to decision framework We can make that into

a very intelligent scalable modeling system and that I think is where the joy of bringing AI and the physics and the human decisions and dimensions come into picture. People don't need weather. They

need weather that can help them make a decision. &gt;&gt; And this is where we need to move from simply creating the weather output to aiding something which is going to help

me make an intelligent decision. Whatever that may be. It could be a long-term hedging against something or a short-term decision of whether I walk inside or in the shade. And if we

achieve that, I think we are going to make this into something which could transform the manner in which we're predicting which is not for a variable of interest but a decision that we want

to make. That is where I think digital twins come into picture and I'll I'll stop there. So I think digital twin can be one of our first uh uh you know we can look into the complete AI spectra

right from monitoring to processing to modeling to reaching out to the end users we can we can have a complete u you know portfolio of AI applications looking at it so this uh leads to now

the end of the session uh and we would like to uh open just for half a minute I'm very sorry for this format Disclaimer, it's not my my doing. So, yeah.

&gt;&gt; Um, one word I didn't hear too much of was insurance. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And uh climate risk typically climate risk typically reflects in insurance rates either becoming uh so

high or just your house goes uninsured which is happening in Northern California in Florida. I'm not sure in India how predominant this is but uh how can you kind of mar I mean ultimately

people have to stay there it's difficult to move. So how do you marry the two? &gt;&gt; Yeah. So that I I sort of somehow sort of referred to it in this notion of translating the work that you're doing

on the DPI side and bringing that technology into sort of more monetizable projects and and insurance actually ends up being one of the first monetizable product that comes out of this.

All right. &gt;&gt; We can have one just one one question maybe and we can always discuss it outside because this is a very good opportunity. We have the experts here

and uh we would definitely like I have few questions but I'll ask you outside. &gt;&gt; I just want to quickly also mention that we have announced in this AI summit partnerships with Nvidia with um Google

and um Qualcomm as well as we're doing other things at the Gates Foundation. So there are many things happening. So you know I invite my colleagues here to work with us more and you know focus on India

as well in addition to the world. &gt;&gt; Then thank you. Thank you sir. So uh would like to thank and it was a great great listening to all of you and we forward to you

and and see I I'll tell you don't don't don't get me wrong. I was thinking you know there are eight people and I am the only one then I was

thinking it should be equal number and I was disturbed
