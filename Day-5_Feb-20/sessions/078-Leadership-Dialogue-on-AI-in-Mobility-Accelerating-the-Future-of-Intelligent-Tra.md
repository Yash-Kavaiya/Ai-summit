## 📝 Transcript

Before this session ITS India along with our members like IIT Hyderabad IIT Mumbai

Omi Foundation and a couple of more organizations our sponsors those who have supported us we have

successfully completed two pre AI summit which was one at the IIT Hyderabad, another was at the IIT Mumbai.

On the basis of our credentials, our efforts we are fortunate to get the leadership dialogue on AI in mobility accelerating the future of the

intelligent transport. We'll deliberate here. We'll request all the dignitaries, audience to come up with certain recommendations so that this

recommendations should become the part of the proceedings of the AI impact summit 2026. You know the

topic we have or the sector we have mobility. This is the one of the key sector and it's a priority sector

defined by the government also because of the different challenges we have been facing. The vast infrastructure we have in India which is the second to the US and maybe shortly we'll overtake

that. We have about 1.5 to 2% of the vehicles on the road which are contributing to about 12% of the fatalities, accidents.

So imagine the 1.5 to 2% of the vehicles contributing to the about 12% of fatalities is a very serious issue. That's why the importance of this mobility

and AI can play a vital role. So that's we'll request our leadership. First of all, I'll request uh

president of ITS India Akhilesh sir, kindly escort the dignitaries to the dais. Sanjay Bandopadhyay sir member technology welcome, sir.

Prashant Banerjee sir Dr. Puneet Mr. Joshi and Mr. Ashok Kumar because of some urgent

assignment, he was here but he has left a while ago. So they want a yeah. So that they want I'll request

Mr. Akhilesh Srivastava uh who is the president of the ITS India, president IRF India chapter and also the president of the bitumen forum. So I'll request him to take it forward.

Thank you. &gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Uh thank you, Dr. Shiv and uh very good morning uh our

uh chief guest Mr. Sanjay Bandopadhyay sir uh former secretary government of India now member of uh Supreme Court honorable Supreme Court committee on road safety

who I mean he is directly dealing with the one of the aspect which we are going to discuss today uh critical related to the mobility is the road safety. There are many other

challenges but this is the uh foremost and prime uh thank you very much, sir. Uh we have Mr. Ian Ballantyne. He is a member technical uh department of

telecommunication looking into the technical spectrum and other related issues uh which affects direct going to affect the mobility uh next generation mobility

which is coming up in a way directly. Uh we have with us Mr. P.K. Banerjee. He is uh chief executive director of SIAM, Society of Indian Automobiles

manufacturers, [clears throat] a very powerful body and you know the mobility uh require two parts, the infrastructure and the vehicles. So he is the man heading that. And then we

have uh industry experts Dr. Puneet Rathore from Qualcomm. Uh uh we have uh Mr. Not Teja Gudena but Shamik Shamik, he is from uh

ITS company called I next and they are providing doing providing the best ITS services on many part of the highways in India. Samruddhi one Nagpur to Mumbai is

wonderful highway which is uh on which they have then they have developed a very good unique solution in Mumbai uh one Mumbai kind of which was launched

by honorable Prime Minister where what future cities are going to be that's we'll be talking today uh where it's all interconnected. Uh app is the AI is going to help you to

connect all the dots from your origin to the destination in seamless way avoiding all those congestions and all. That's they have already demonstrated and we'll be

uh talking about it. And I'll be uh moderating this panel session. We have a very restricted time. Uh just 55 minutes and the organizers just told me

to stick to the time not more than 2 minutes are allowed. Uh so so I'll be straight coming to the points which we are going to discuss and my uh so the distinguished guests and

the uh delegates and the participants who has come all the heartiest welcome to you all. Uh then we have a professor from IIT Roorkee. One more professor

will be joining. Mr. Sonal Ahuja, Mr. Mahendra Srivastava, uh former advisor to try and uh forget me I mean forgive me if I don't men- mention you all

uh but uh the heartiest welcome to all of you uh for joining this uh very informative and interactive session which we are going to So quickly coming to the topic,

uh what are the five um I mean how AI is going to reshape the mobility? So mobility is now going to shift to mobility uh 5.0. If somebody can ask what is now mobility 5.0, we have heard

industrial revolution 1 2 3 4.0. So what's going to be 5.0? So I will just give a background. The mobility 1.0 uh was when uh we are moving on the uh by foot or

through animals, carts and all. Then came the mobility 2.0 when the industrial uh uh railways came or the shared uh means the government owned or the

organization owned vehicles came uh for a very short time but then it quickly moved to mobility 3.0 when the vehicles became the property, the people is started owning it, the private vehicles

came and the infrastructure, roads, etc. started developing around that. And mobility four which we are experiencing is the connected uh uh mobility, shared mobility and the uh

electric and all these are coming up. But very soon this again like to move move to three very quickly, uh this four will pave way to the five uh with the advent of AI, AI embedding into the

mobility. So the AI is now going to not keep it only connected but it's going to make it intelligent. So it's going to be the intelligent vehicles, intelligent infrastructure and overall the ecosystem

is going to be the uh mobility is going to be not uh yesterday we had a conference uh in IIT Delhi where uh one key thing came

out by telling people to follow the road safety rules or norms it's uh not going to work that way because we are seeing since last few decades the road accidents are not

decreasing. Why why not we tell the vehicle to follow the rules instead of road signages showing 60 km per hour speed is

permissible and the now it's up to driver to look at the sign if he is so careful and thereafter perceive this and take action to reduce the speed. That's all subjective, but if

the sign is conveying the directly to the vehicle through sensors, through connected vehicle ecosystem and vehicle is automatically reduced to 60 km.

There's nothing so that the the information is conveyed to the correct place. So that's the going to be the next generation intelligent. Apart from this road safety, what more

AI is going to do about the mobility? It's like second thing is you see the congestion which is a normal with globally it's a common phenomena. In India because rapid

organization is taking place, it's chaos. Probably yesterday you must have heard in the news some CEO missed the just missed the

dinner hosted by honorable Prime Minister because they were caught in traffic jam for 4 hours. So these are things not unusual. It's happening almost every

day. How this AI can solve it because we AI can with the enough data being generated can identify origin destination. It can adopt a traffic signals. The

traffic signals instead of being a isolated signal with a fixed timeline already adopted is there, but traffic signals can talk to each other. They can see the flow from which side is coming

and they can convey one signal to other that 300 vehicles has been sent from this signal to other and the next signal is prepared with that light optimization. Multimodal which we

require very badly in India and Professor Mittal will be talking about it in the next talk when we'll be talking. It's mandatory because we cannot load there is a limitation to

the road. So public infrastructure has to be, but AI can actually connect the multimodal and the last mile everything on that. Similarly the smart incident detection and the emergency response.

In case of accident or in case of any disaster or emergency, how AI can help to quickly align the responders. The moment ambulance reaches and

ambulance take to the hospital instead of person going and waiting for some aligning a correct treatment or the doctor, this information can be shared by

AI through AI to the hospital where the ambulance is taking it and the with the condition of that person the the accident victim or the

and preparedness is there. So immediate action can be there reducing the golden hour time. And lastly the AI is going to improve the freight and the logistic efficiency to a very very great extent.

By knowing I mean truck need not to wait after offloading to the next already there platforms doing, but AI can make it in a very very different way at different level.

I mean managing the thing for with the prediction or the predictive analysis or the modeling for next a month or 2 months of the same logistic companies and that's going to

improve the logistic efficiency to very very great. So I won't be taking much time because we have very limited time. I will be requesting my next speaker

to just let me have a look because we got certain changes at the last moment. I will request Mr. Banerji give his

his thoughts about it. What's how he perceives from the vehicle point of view being a executive president of SIAM,

how vehicle manufacturers are preparing themselves, what they are thinking very quickly. That will be great. Since the time restriction is given to us, we'll request you 3 to 5 minutes

a time. Thank you very much. Good morning distinguished speakers in the dice of the dice experts here. On behalf of Indian automobile

industry, I think AI is one you know tool which is going to transform the way the business is being done right from cradle to grave. What I mean by cradle to grave means

there are if you I divide the entire automotive value chain into six part the part one is basically conceptualizing the product, knowing the market requirement customers behavior,

what we call key of D. So key of D is done before the product is conceptualized in the market, what product you'll be putting in and then once the product definition is done and

you decide that this is a product at this price point you are going to put in the market the stylist come in place and and then the traditional way of doing things where you do the clay modeling

and then you define a kind of product and then get it approval of design before you convert the A surfaces into actual product. This particular concept is completely

going to transform with AI. There'll be huge amount of front loading digitization will happen and the turnaround time which takes to conceptualize a product and get the

approval before the entire investment on the jigs and dies and fixtures. Remember that if 3 years is a traditional product a car introduction timeline. Actually majority of time goes in the

jigs and fixtures and dies and tools creation and this particular design finalization of a product based on the customers need can be minimized with AI intervention.

Having done that, the next stage is identifying the suppliers, identifying [clears throat] the compliance requirement of materials identifying the right material for

lightweighting, identifying the right material for supply augmentation. So vendor selection, localization, development, validation, certification, entire

activities, blockchain content of concept, risk mitigation and of course the geopolitical uncertainty coverages can be managed by AI beautifully. So this is the second part of the entire

product development cycle. Having done that, you have to now manufacture. When you go into the manufacturing line, you have robots, you have industry 4.0, you have management of the entire

you know product assembly process with the necessary guidelines. That also gets hugely managed well. And then once the product is ready, the qualifying criteria, the quality

assurance is also part of AI. And once the product move out in the marketplace, the buyers buyers should know what they want to buy. And then preference of the customers,

the insurance companies, the finance model, what kind of services will be offered, what kind of customer experience will be given. AI driven services will be far more accurate, far

more fast faster and it will delight the customer and then you will have a better chance to succeed. Now the product is in the marketplace. How the product is performing, repair,

recall services, predictive maintenance time to time interventions and informing the customers the right place what he needs to do, how he needs to drive. With the connected vehicle being there, you

know that how you are driving, how I'm driving, how many times I'm stopping, how I when I charge, what is my duty cycle. Based on the duty cycle, I can give you a performance

by the over the air software updates in a manner that you will be completely doing the best of the optimized performance with the low cost operations and longer durability life of a product.

Having done that, once the vehicle is uh on the road, it has its own end of life. Then obviously when the vehicle is going back, you must be able to recover material because the secondary source of

material will be the future. Primary source will be stopped and then you will have a complete recycling. You have to recycle more than 95% of your precious metals and all the ferrous, non-ferrous.

One thing beautifully has happened what Indian government has done. There are six EPR rules have come in. So you have to recover plastic, you have to recover rubber, you have to recover ferrous,

non-ferrous, e-waste, battery and then you have to also recover the fluids lubricants, engine oils. So I think AI has a huge potential to transform the way we live, the way we operate, the way

we get and it will be delight. So I think I'm so delighted to be present here. On behalf of ITS, I'm so thankful that uh auto industry is in a cusp of a time

where AI adoption will transform the way we do business. Thank you. Thank you Mr. Banerji for telling at the entire life cycle how AI is going to

do the in automobile industry. Very quickly I will take you to the next what I just talked is going to be intelligent, but the vehicle will be intelligent when they are connected. We

have an expert Dr. Puneet Rathore who has done he is from Qualcomm and they have been doing the they are working on this area. So quickly

Puneet you can you want to make some presentation or you just talk? I sent something to Arjun, but I don't know if Maybe I'll I'll start.

Um Good afternoon everyone and all the distinguished panelists on the stage and and all the esteemed colleagues of the dais as well.

To my my brief talk is going to focus around information and data and how this intelligent transport systems can be enabled. And and and two very important

things that were mentioned by Akhilesh ji and also Mr. Banerjee was about intelligent vehicles or smarter vehicles. And and that is something which is um as we

as we move forward the vehicles themselves we have been hearing these terms of different vehicles. So, the the vehicle itself is having a lot more compute. The the traffic system itself

is also having more intelligence built in. So, both the vehicles and the traffic control system itself, both of them being connected and by connected I I don't intend to say

they are connected via a registration mechanism like a Wi-Fi connecting to an access point and then they are always within the connection range. This is more about presence or

perception. So, the So, the vehicle making its presence known to the immediate vicinity and the same way the roadside infrastructure making its presence and status known within the

immediate vicinity. And this availability of perception and information about what is the current state of the traffic light, whether it is green, red

going to turn amber very soon. The perception of the vehicle itself, what is the speed it is going and how fast. And all of this within the short distance of around 500 to 600 m radius.

This gives the ability from a radio point of view, the vehicle announcing itself, I'm here, I'm here. That it can go beyond the traditional sensors like radars and cameras which

can go beyond visual line of sight. And this going beyond visual visual line of sight can improve the the ability of cars to be able to take some decisions to make the driver aware so

that some corrective action could be taken. Maybe apply brakes, maybe slow down. And and this is something which can then help in making the roads safer. And and why I

and I emphasize on both the roadside infrastructure and the vehicle itself is if you look at the overall accident statistics the global statistics are consistent.

Almost 20 to 25% of all the accident deaths are at intersections. So, intersection safety is something which is very very crucial and and globally if you look at

intelligent transport systems or V2X there are countries that have been prioritizing making these intersections more intelligent, more smarter and more safer. And and V2X as one technology

could could be one of those elements which can make available this information or the data that can then be utilized by the traffic control systems and the vehicle themselves to make it

more smarter and safer. With that brief note I'll I'll give the floor back. Thank you. Uh thanks. Thank you, Munish. I mean you really categorically

demonstrated how we do we are V2X and and good I will be talking the next question during the panel about the globally global perspective how it has been implemented

in US, what are the learnings and how it can be quickly adopted in India as well and where are we. And that was one part, the connected

vehicle. Another aspect where AI can actually make a real impact on day-to-day is the in cities solving the congestion or AI-based ATMS system. For this we

have with us with Mr. Samik Joshi. He is the head of and gateways of MNX. Already doing at Samruddhi Expressway I said and in Mumbai one.

So, Samik, over to you. You can Uh welcome everybody. So, we believe that the last two decades we've spent a significant amount of effort as a country on developing

infrastructure. And in the next decade or so we'll make a significant effort to make that infrastructure intelligent. We are doing three such initiatives. One

at a city level, second for highways and third for urban mobility via public transportation. And I want to give you a segue into those three initiatives to showcase what intelligence can do

to infrastructure. So, first is at a city level what we have done for the city of Surat is that we've deployed cameras at intersections so that we can

understand what is the density of the vehicles and what are the type of vehicles at a particular intersection. Based on which we not just optimize an individual

signal but also optimize an entire corridor. So, essentially when a vehicle experiences a green light at one junction, we give a free pass to that vehicle across multiple junctions if the

vehicle is moving across the corridor. In addition to that, whenever there is an emergency vehicle which is passing through and which is tagged or identified as an emergency vehicle that

needs a green channel, we can enable that too. So, this is on the urban side. On the highway side, India has been fighting a war since last 30 years. Sir would

also be a Sir would also agree to that and that war is against traffic. Every year we lose more people on highways than we did at the peak of COVID. And it is an

urgent and important issue to address. And this is where highway traffic will start playing an important role. What we are doing for Samruddhi Expressway which connects Mumbai and Nagpur is that we

are installing more than 5,000 cameras. Each of those cameras is is enabled with computer vision analytics so that we identify stalled vehicles, we identify

vehicles that are violating traffic norms in terms of over speeding. We identify oversized vehicles that do not have reflectors, we identify drivers who are speaking on phone while

they are moving across the highways. All these incidents are then captured and the idea is not just to identify violations but also to ensure that in an event of an incident there is proper

dispatch management. So, once an incident has been detected, we ensure that we have more eyes and ears on the ground by virtue of drones as well as body worn cameras given to emergency

responders so that the dispatch and the issue resolution can be more prompt and right amount of coordination can be done with hospitals, with emergency services whenever an incident has been detected.

So, this is on the highways. Finally, while we take interventions in augmenting intelligence and build capacities on the road

the issue of incidents and congestion will not be solved simply by installing smart systems on the road. The issue will be solved only if there is a modal shift from private vehicles to public

vehicles. And for that what we have done in the city of Mumbai is that Mumbai has multiple systems from public mobility perspective. There are five bus operators in and around the cities.

There is BST which manages the city transport within the urban local boundary of Mumbai city. Then there is a bus system for Thane, there is a bus system for Navi Mumbai, one for Vasai

and Virar, one for Mira Bhayandar. All these five bus systems currently operate in a fragmented manner. There are three rail networks, the Central Rail, Western Rail and Harbor

Rail which operate railways within the city. There are four metro lines currently which are operational in the city. Now, all these systems operate in a fragment fragmented manner. For me as

a commuter if I have to travel from let's say Mira Bhayandar to South Mumbai where I might be working, I need to buy three separate tickets.

I need to plan my journey across three three systems separately. What we have done is consolidated all these 13 different modes of transport into a single app through which you can plan

your journeys across multiple modes and you can just book one single QR code. That enables you to spend minimum amount of time while you are transitioning from one mode of transport to the other mode

of transport. So, I think collectively as a nation if we want to introduce AI we should not just be thinking about sensors and data, we should be thinking about what decisions can be taken on the

edge and what are the outcomes that we need to plan. And those outcomes are something that the AI should drive and not just point solutions. Thank you. Thank [clears throat] you, Samik.

You what I was just talking about how AI actually can reshape the mobility. There's few examples which you gave Surat,

Mumbai and the it's about urban and the rural highways. We are talking AI is going to make the mobility intelligent. A lot of data is being generated through

sensors, through infrastructure, fixed cameras, moving parts. I mean almost now every vehicle is having some sensors

which are communicating data to the OEMs and then government is also taking some part of the data. But to take it to a platform where this can be analyzed where AI layer can actually

work on it. We require connectivity and the connectivity is a kind of a spectrum or the what kind of network we are going to use

and that's plays the vital role and in fact if I say the future of the vehicles will not be the deciding factor of how many lanes the road is having or what is the horsepower of the vehicle

engine. It's more will be driven by the spectrum or the communication technology how it's being and the processing unit AI is going to the software and vehicle problems are going to be solved through

this that's the mobility 5.0 the intelligent vehicles. To talk on this topic how government of India is taking it forward what is their vision how they are

planning about the spectrum globally spectrums are being allocated for the mobility for the safety purposes. Government has also taken you I mean most of you must have heard

honorable Minister Gadkari saying that we are going to come with a connected vehicle V2V and he said this in one of the address I mean where transport secretaries and

commissioner of all these states were there in Bharat Mandapam in a high level meeting. So that's things are coming up in a very big way but let us know from the

real person who is behind this the spectrum is the DOT role how they take it forward what they are planning. So for that I will request Mr. RN Pillai we have we have privilege that we have

Mr. RN Pillai is a member technical from Department of Telecommunication who actually deals with this. He is the man behind in charge for this.

So we'll take this opportunity to request him to kindly enlighten us what government is thinking on those lines sir. Over to you sir.

Our distinguished panelists speakers the delegates ladies and gentlemen very good afternoon.

So this session is on the AI in mobility accelerating the future of intelligent transport. We are talking about

and we'll be deliberating in the these sessions on multiple occasions we'll be talking about the artificial intelligence its applications how the transport systems

will be more resilient and more informed and avert the the possible that accidents for example giving the more informations and how it can enable the citizens to

have a better life. And the theme of the particularly this AI summit this welfare for all and happiness for all. This is the theme

we are talking about. Mobility mobility has always been a is is part of the civilizations and the ancient trade routes that connects

connected Asia and many maritime networks that link the continents and the railways that powered the industrial growth and each transform the society far beyond the transport itself

and movement has never been about any distance. It has always been opportunity. Today we are talking about that opportunity embedded with the intelligence which is not human

generated but it is machine generated. So as far as this this the my own domain is concerned thank to Akhilesh Sahab. He has also mentioned that how the technology will

be in at at at at the at leverage point to support the transport systems. So the transport systems will be only be made intelligent with the interconnected

devices and the informations spinning off from each this devices be it in that IoT sensors devices vehicles which are carrying this sensors and

interconnections and inferring the informations to the to have a predictive uh this analysis so that it will be of it will be of help to the particularly to human human.

So in this context that that that Ministry of I'll just draw the few points the Ministry of of road transport

as per the records the accident in particularly India 2023 this around 4.8 lakhs accidents out of which the fatalities around 1.72 lakhs. So huge figure it is one of the highest

among the among the other countries in the world. So there has this prompted the committees to be formed and DOT is also part of the committee because enabling the technology through this

the the networking is the mandate the Department of Telecoms deals with the spectrum which connects the devices in a wireless manner. So future

or for a smarter mobility lies in intelligent cooperative and connected systems. If you go to that particularly

the critical pillar of the intelligent mobility is vehicle to everything. That V2X communications by enabling the vehicles to communicate with each other through the V2V vehicle

to vehicle communications by enabling the the the vehicles to communicate with the infrastructures roadside infrastructures then vehicle to the network

and and overall V2 anything. So that means the the sensors fitted in the the vehicles they have to communicate with the network they will communicate with

the the roadside the infrastructures they will also communicate with themselves so that to arrive at their geo locations and also predict that is there any threat component and another

things. There itself the massive data will be generated and this massive data will have a will require a high this processing capacity at the data centers or distributed or centrally

and the info for the informations and give the guidance to the the the the drivers. So this is what is all about and to to arrive at we need a ecosystems where the equipment suppliers

they provide the equipment with required specifications and the devices are also the manufacturers with the with this predictive nature. Third Third

we must provide a predictive frequency band or spectrum on on which the systems must interact or interwork. So India has also taken a lead in this

because this is not not a national but international because you are having the the vehicles export and imported to India as well. So to this

we have also in DOT we are we are working on it and we have also identified a spectrum in the particularly 5.9 gigahertz that we have earmarked it so that ecosystem will

develop once we give the that certainty that this frequency will operate. Now that we have also

that our regulator is TRAI they are working on on it is for the that for the level of signaling and also the communication between vehicle to the roadside units.

Now coming to the that devices means particularly if you talk about the standards so India is also taking a standard international standards in in in ETSI

ETSI which is a European standards through this this they are defining the protocols that what the in in what way the devices they interact either IoT or M2M devices

or this the devices in the roadside units so how they will operate the protocols that has already been defined and in the process of getting a

final shape and this particularly this committee has also resolved that what are the technical requirements for interworking. And spectrum

is the lifeline of connectivity and we We have also given that spectrum for the the the two part. One is that vehicle to the roadside units or vehicle to the network and the vehicle to vehicle.

There are two segment. One is which will be on a regulated manner. Another is that we can have a on license band and that spurs actually that propels the

particularly the growth of the industry to to to develop the ecosystems. Looking ahead, the mobility will be the hyperconnected 5G and 6G tomorrow

will have the that will will will will have its place by 2000 30

as computing coupled with satellite communications in the lower orbit Leo lower orbit stations Leo and Mio that they are those are in seven

400 kilometers away from earth. So, these will be propelling the connectivity part in a massive way. And today together they will form a

seamless digital mobility grid one that senses, learns, and adapts in real time. And the adoption means they will learn

they will cope with with this intelligence and develop the new the predictive the models. I imagine a future where the freight corridors anticipate disruptions before

it occurs. Where emergency vehicles receive automated priority across the city networks. Where the connectivity reaches remote highways

and border regions. Particularly it's very sensitive for the border regions. So, now I at end I'll just

leave my own thoughts. Let this dialogue particularly this discussion this mark a decisive

step towards the future where the intelligence is embedded in the infrastructure connectivity is universal, innovation is responsible

and mobility is inclusive. India stands already already in a a formidable position to collaborate to innovate and where responsibility

calls to lead. I look forward to the insightful discussions in this panel. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, sir, for giving a

very clear road map how duties planning and how the Thank you very much. I think it's very exciting I mean that what people must be wanted to listen

since long. Thank you very much. Was one problem what during talk he just mentioned about the road fatalities. Sir, with just 1 and 1/2% of I mean the India contributes for almost 11% of the

road fatalities, which is highest in the earth in the globe. And the next second number is not even half. They are much much below.

So, serious issue and you rightly said that such kind of technologies can be a gap filler because the growth

despite our normal things things are it's not reducing, but technology can be an blur which can help to quickly reduce the facility. So, to talk on this road safety issue,

we are honored to have with us member of the Supreme Court honorable Supreme Court committee on road safety Mr. Sanjay Bandopadhyay

bureaucrat. He was secretary to the government of India in his earlier role. Now, he is leading it from the front. He recently got implemented electronic enforcement. So, I won't be entering

into his discussions. May I request you, sir, to address the gathering with your Yeah, to keep the focus I have a small presentation also.

So, dignitaries on the days the audience esteemed audience Now, many speakers have already spoken about the various technologies which are coming

the ITS on the roads and the future of mobility and we are in this AI summit and one of the major concern of the world and that specifically India

is on the safety of roads. You are going you're traveling on a car driving yourself and you are hit by somebody a larger vehicle

and even if you are not killed, but you break your bones, you say what was my fault? I was driving in my lane. The person who hit me doesn't follow the rules whether he had

passed the test or not, I don't know. Every day when you see in the newspaper somebody productive is killed and that is a major concern not only of

the government but also of the courts the Supreme Court. So, if you see our figures which is this figures are from

the published data of the government of India and collected by the state government the police department and the transport department.

The you can see the number of deaths how many deaths per day is on the recent published data of 2023 because there is a delay of two years. And the number of accidents are nearly

500,000 with so many injuries and that to these are serious injuries. The minor injuries are not counted in this.

They are called minor, but at least some some bones are broke broken in this. Now I am giving these figures in the AI

summit because I know that many people are working on the road safety to find solutions in the road safety. They are using the AI tools

to improve the road conditions. And these are the data through which these people who are seriously working in this

will be able to see that what kind of AI agents will be built in future. Whether there is a case for recovery of the investment

I will say yes with so much of thing government stands with you. The court stands with you and it is the need of the hour. If you see

national highway and the state highways only nearly 50% of the road length but it accounts for 59% of the fatalities. NHS 36.5

state highways 22.8 Of course, the traffic density is higher, but here if you develop AI tools, it's easy to manage because

you have to work only on 4.9% of the road length. Put ATMS different cameras control room ambulances

all four E's can work on on four E's of road safety. Then the productive population is affected. If you make road safe, they are ready to

pay also. It will come from the insurance sector also in somehow. the highways with a long stretch are the most affected one of the speaker

was saying. Of course, he was quoting the world thing that junctions are affected. No, in India the long stretches on the rural highway accounts for the highest number of

fatalities because speed over speeding is one of the main reason. Enforcement is required. So, the target corridors are

the long stretches of national highway state highways and there are some urban hot spots. And the target states are also these 10. So, if

these states are taken care of people who are working these states account for the highest number of fatalities in the country. Then in the road user death

two wheelers they have highest number of deaths 14.8 44.8 pedestrian 20.4 car taxi 12.4 and truck lorry is only 5.8.

Again impacting vehicle two wheelers 28.2 This may be all because the two wheeler has struck road dividers not wearing helmets

This is hurt and it is his fault. That is why it's 28.2. So, somebody may ask why how can a impacting vehicle like two wheeler will be there because if you are

driving on a wrong uh side, if you're crossing crisscrossing the lanes, not maintaining the lanes, and you are hitting something, then it's your fault.

You're booked for that. So, again, you can see the various vehicles in which if AI solutions are built in, walked in,

then it will give results. Then continuing further, over speeding the 68.68%. I think world over over speeding is one

of the main reasons. Enforcement is an issue. Training is an issue means education is an issue. And other things are there. Road

calming, speed calming measures will be there. Wrong side, of course, people say wrong side may be a major issue, but it's only 5.5%

of the fatalities. Again, the reasons of death, hit from back, 22%, 21%, hit-and-run is 18%, head-on collision is 17%,

hit from side is 17, and so on. So, I think the ADAS will help this in some aspect. And more

AI tools in the ADAS, built-in AI tools in the ADAS is required. I think it's it will come very soon in larger vehicles, and that will bring give some relief.

And by the licenses, maximum is the valid license. People who have license, they either hit or get killed, 71%. Not known means they don't know whether

he has license or not. This on the accident. Then persons killed, non-use of safety devices, helmet, of course, everybody knows.

So, many drivers killed, so percentage of passenger killed, seat belts. So, again, this is an enforcement issue based on the AI-based

on the camera, the analysis, and enforcement will bring in the results. And again, the state road and curve road. So, I give this data because

I give also in IIT Bombay the conference also I told AI conference because there will be many people who are developing AI solutions and want quick returns out of it so that

they can recover mean money and move to the next solution. These are some of the requirement where the government, other people will stand with you, and this is the need of the hour.

Now, there has been efforts on the catchment cashless treatment during the golden hour. Then recently zero fatality district program for 100 districts in 15 states

have been taken. In which the action plan has been prepared for each of these districts. And 30 33% of deaths in India take place

in just this 100 districts. And it will be monitored closely. Then the Supreme Court told that on the principle of marginal returns, electronic enforcement,

nothing new, but is important. So, an SOP was issued by MoRTH on the instance of its course, we approved it. It has various component on electronic enforcement where again

AIs can be built in, and we have written also that AI should be built in. On the iRAD, this is the accident system which generates the e-challan reports. Integration of

of the data between the transport department's iRAD and the CCTNS of the Ministry of Home. That is also important.

Data if data is not available, you can cannot issue e-challans. You cannot prosecute people. You cannot take corrective measures. So, this is an effort which is going on. But

lot of AI inputs will be required into Then challan is another thing. Only 18% of the challans are recovered. We are trying to work through the courts and the police and the transport

department to increase the recovery. But quick solutions are required. It has been pending for a last long time. Then again, e-court

is important thing. Supreme Court has taken a pilot e-court implementation in the Patiala court on this, and which will be implemented all over the

country. And we have been pushing them, this committee on e-courts, that implement it soon. There were certain issues. Because see, once accident take place,

there are two issues. There are two components of this. First, out of the total claim given 7 crore rupees, insurance company says, "I will be able to give based on the premium only 40

lakh rupees." 60 lakh, say, the vehicle owner has to give because of this reasons. Then he has to pay it. Next time he will think twice when he's handing over the vehicle to somebody or

he's driving himself that there is a default on his part or not. That will reduce the number of accidents.

Then there is the ATMS component on Then a road safety committee which deals with the whole issue in the districts has has to be accountable. Monitoring of

these committees, they implement they make the action plans, measurable action plan, monitored regularly by the state committee and the MoRTH. And we also

audit the states. And there of course is capacity building in all these components. Then recently, this week only, we had approved the SOP for pre-hospital

cares. So, now Uberization of ambulances, the first responders, the hospitals is required.

Because you always take it him to a government hospital, which is not good. Nearest hospital should be also used. Private ambulances can also be used. These responders are

trained. They try to the save life there itself. If two responders are available in the village where accident take place, they will rush and try to save life.

Uberization of both public sector and private sector is And of course, the what the health department says is the teleconsultation

in pre-hospital care when moving from in the ambulances to the hospital, the some of the care is taken so that life is saved. This SOP was issued recently this week only on

Monday, and it will be shared with the states and other stakeholders. Then there is another SOP for people with disabilities because once he's

discharged, he should get the equipment required for rehabilitation. He has to be tracked so that he again comes to a form where he becomes he can earn his own bread. So,

see there some issues where lot of effort can go into, and this AI solution can be built into it so that fatalities reduce, and the people who

are affected by this can again earn their bread. Thank you very much. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Thank you very much, sir. And I know

this topic is so sensitive, and that says everyone, it cannot be we can't do justice in just 55 minutes to talk on this. So, but anyway, we tried our best.

Our three speakers unfortunately got late, but I will not disappoint them. I will request them very quickly just two two minutes bite. So, I think we have to start with Professor. You can come over

here. There is no time to now change the thing. Just two minutes you can talk on, and then Mr. Sonal, and we have Jitin come. So, thank you for the invitation. So,

looking from academic perspective, we see a lot of role of AI for, you know, uh transportation and mobility. So, for example, one of the technique we have been working on is to, you know, given a

given a hazy image, we could convert into dehaze image. So, in in especially in the winter season in North India, there is a lot of, you know, fog and all which affects the, you know, safety of

the vehicles. So, if we can integrate these things in a in the dashboard camera, this can help the drivers take correct decisions. Another thing which researchers in our

institute we are doing is to uh work with, you know, authorities in um Haridwar and uh other, you know, pilgrimage sites is

that to do, you know, crowd counting so that we can manage the crowd crowd much better, especially, you know, in Char Dham Yatra, Kawad Yatra, there is a huge crowd. And sometime unless we predict

the crowd and unless we have a good stock of the crowd, our policies will always fall short. So, that's why we are working on, you know, with these authorities to make proper solutions.

And finally, one more uh one more example I will cite is that our uh researchers are also working with, you know, uh like for example, authorities in Nainital. In in uh

especially summer season where there is a peak of, you know, tourist traffic, there is hardly any space for, you know, parking the cars. So, if we So, then there is a huge coordination required

between parking spots and the other feeder feeder buses because you have to park your cars outside the city and then a feeder bus will take you. But, unless it is very convenient for the

passengers, they will not cooperate. So, we feel that AI will also build the trust of people in this in this whole, you know, city level management of the traffic.

And once it is very convenient that at the comfort of an app, they can understand that instead of car I should take the bus or I should do the rerouting, then they will happily, you

know, cooperate and all the schemes that government, you know, implement that will be successful. So, this is our vision of, you know, using AI for intelligent transportation, especially,

you know, making it very convenient for people, safer for the people, and bringing their full cooperation. So, that's all. I'll In the interest of time, I'll stop here. Thank you.

Uh thank you, Professor. Asking Professor to complete in 2 minutes is a In fact, totally wrong, but thank you very much for your support.

I know I have Mr. Sonal Ahuja. Uh he is a CEO of CAPS doing a lot of work in ITS related solution. So, over to you, Sonal, very quickly.

Thank you, sir. I know time is tight. So, one of the most important things that we are facing in our cities is is extreme congestion. If anyone of us have gone to Pragati

Maidan, you know, the traffic and the problems that we are facing. And I always say from the experience of, you know, being an international, I would say multinational company, where

we have implemented technologies all around, that no matter how much you will build the roads, people will always come there. And no matter how intelligent you make your traffic lights, they will be

ill geared to resort to the problems of traffic, and you will face accidents unless and until you integrate a couple of things. And that also means investing in public

transport. Now, the metro station is there at Pragati Maidan, but it is very hard to reach and people don't really know it. So, how am I going to be take people out of the cars and into public

transport? And investments in public transport must come along by giving them priority, by making public transport more achievable. And that also means that we need to

manage the demand much more properly. And if you need to manage the demand, unfortunately, we need to charge for the road space. We face extreme amount of congestion and extreme problems during

the winter months in Delhi, and cities must start seriously thinking about, can I charge the road user so as to contribute positively towards the society? Now, what are these road users

which we can charge? Clearly, commercial vehicles. They are the number one contributors, the trucks, for example. They are they are the biggest contributors to the pollution. So, can

we start by experimental uh you know, I would say implementation of a program where we can contribute to the society by charging the vehicles. Create charging zones

which are not just point based, but based upon distance, based upon GPS, based upon pay as you go. So, road user charging combined with effective tolling, combined with intelligent

traffic lights, can really work very well. And then as we saw that the most of the accidents are actually happening on the national and state highways. So, CITS technology which preempts the

people, cameras which are which are equipped with right vision, as our Mumbai colleagues were saying, um with the right with the right bandwidth, with the right

communication spectrum, and cars which have got We should make mandatory that all the OEMs in India must enable the vehicles CITS ready. If they have an onboard unit ready, if they have this

technology working on a common standard, implementing CITS, and reducing these fatalities will be much easier. So, on that, I would like to thank you so much, and I hope that in the next 5 years, we

can make India as a zero crash or a zero death country. Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; Uh thank you. Mr. Sonal, keeping it exactly on time. Now, I have got one

speaker, Mr. Jitender. Jitender, please come quickly. He is the founder and CEO of Onex, and do a lot of traffic solutions, Delhi and many

other cities, Bengaluru, and very quickly, you can talk about your AI based solution, which is going to be a game changer. You spoke to Nvidia yesterday.

Yeah, come. Okay. &gt;&gt; Sir, I wanted to keep another perspective in this. For that, I'll just take 2 minutes.

Sir, I'm uh Joe intelligent transportation may acceleration karne wale hain future mein. Wo kitna hua?

Kya hum uski koi unit na bana sakte hain? Koi unit honi chahiye ki humne jo itne efforts kare, uska itna impact hua hum AI impact summit mein hain.

Toh isko impact karne ke liye ek achha tarika hai. Aap kisi bhi shehar mein point A se point X tak travel kijiye.

Aur dekhiye raste mein jo intersections aa rahe hain, wahan jo traffic lights hain, woh traffic lights mein red ka duration kitna raha?

&gt;&gt; Green ka duration kitna raha? Agar red bahut zyada raha aur green kam raha, toh ek alag impact hai. Aur agar iska reverse hua ki maine aapko red bahut chhota mila, aap jaldi

se paar ho gaye. Toh yeh ek alag impact hai. Is saare data ko red light ke aur green light ke data ko ikaththa karke, analyze karke,

artificial intelligence ka use karke, hum ek unit par pahunch sakte hain. Jisse hum measure kar sakein ki impact kitna hua. Toh traffic signal

mere hisaab se isko naapne ki ek ghadi hai. Ek jo samay ki jo traffic signals hain woh intelligent transportation ka impact

kitna hua, woh usko naapne ki ek ghadi hai. Thank you. Uh thank you. Everyone, your solution is a much bigger because you are

implementing, sir. I will just ready for the audience and people on this I can explain. He is optimizing the time based on the AI

without any extra equipment on any of the junctions. Just by I mean you can yeah. You want to add? Yes, I'll add. Uh You go ahead. I'll take 2 minutes, I'll

finish. One minute. Okay, 1 minute. So, I've seen traffic signal go LED se bulb se LED mein change hote hue dekha hai, fixed time se adaptive aur intelligent aur smart hote hue dekha

hai. Aur ismein jo technologies hain, unmein jo limitations hain, un sab ko bhi dekhiye. Aur jo latest solution iska jo best

solution mere dimaag mein aaya aur jo hum jis pe kaam kar rahe hain, humne ek artificial algorithm banayi hai jo crowd source data ko measure karti Aur bina koi sensor lagaye,

bina koi change kare, us basis pe ki crowd source data kitna hai, traffic signal ko green ya red karti hai. Yeh this is a simple algorithm. Iski

khaasiyat yeh hai ki aapko koi gaddha nahi khodna, aapko koi naya equipment nahi lagana, aapko camera ko infrastructure CAPEX CAPEX zero hai, sir.

Data hum crowd source data lete hain. Bahut saare Kuchh ek cheezein main batana chahunga jaise saari cheez nahi aapko akele mein bataunga. Uh

TomTom se hum data lete hain, Google se hum data lete hain. Multiple sources hain. Ji. Traffic ka data kya lete hain, right?

So, hum traffic ka data Ji. Jo traffic ka regular data hota hai, speed hai, direction hai, kitni der is tarah ka data lete hain. Uh thank you.

We have almost done, but we'll take one or maximum two questions from the audience because they have been listening since almost an hour. So, two

very quick questions anybody can uh Uh Mr. Senthu, you are already doing in AI, so you want to say something? How your near misses or something? Just 1 minute.

Yeah, so one of the main things that I want to really question on is how much of this of solutions that we are doing that we can really focus on prevention. I think sir mentioned about,

on bringing on the fatalities and, you know, taking making sure that we have the electronic enforcement, right? So, apart from that, I think one of the

focuses that we are also doing on is even before the accidents happen, try to find out the, you know, the hotspots where the bad accidents can happen like, you know,

the the near misses that it could have happened because we do have an a report of the accidents, but I think we should also be seeing the near misses, and and I think we can take

actions on based on those that as well. Absolutely. Instead of after an accident saying that this is a black spot, and now rectify after sacrificing few lives, that's

not the human way. Best is near misses, what you said. AI can predict by pattern that this is going to be a accident prone area and can be corrected. Any other question by anyone?

I think there is one question. Last one. Um my question relates to the safety which and I would specifically ask

uh Shri Bandopadhyay ji for this. You know, there have been We all know that in India we have large number of accidents. As your data said that 170,000

people die every day. Now my question is what are the efforts being done because I feel that the issue of driving license, the way we issue driving license, that is the biggest culprit

because the education part is not there. You know, the large number of people who population who have who have driving license even in this room if you see, we haven't had a proper

test or education on that. So that is the reason that that we do not follow the traffic rules even though we do want to follow the traffic rules, we are not aware of. A case in example is when you

are on highways, the lane driving. You will never see a lorry driver driving on his lane. He will he or she will be always be on the fast lane. That what happens is that because of

everybody else has to overtake from the other side. And if you have vehicles coming on the opposite direction and the fatal fatalities happen there. This is a very basic thing. I'm just giving you an

example, you know. So my my understanding is that how is AI going to improve the issue of driving license because that's where the basic problem comes in. Once you improve the driving

license issuing system Yeah. Everything else Thank you. Yeah, understood. See first

I don't answer this question. I'm not government. You have to ask the transport minister of center and this state. We also ask them. But of course what can AI do I can

foresee is that the I rate system which is collecting the data on every accident and linking it to CCTNS it will throw the data that

if the accident happens whether this was a licensed person which is the license issuing authority whether he had training or not for this. So the whole licensing system can be

improved. And government you should actually ask the government on this. We also ask them. We are Supreme Court. We ask government the center as well as

the state on this. They are trying to automate automatize the driving test. Both the theoretical one and the

practical one. But I agree that a lot has to be done. Okay? I don't know when you took your license whether the serious testing was there or

of course everybody knows that the quality is improving but there is much to do. Right. Thank you. Thank you, sir. I think yeah. Just to add the AI angle

which you asked in the driving license. So as sir said automation is there now it has to be. Now we have the government is planning to put an IoT testing driving is learning license time

to score and then score will determine whether DL will be given or not. One. Second thing is where AI actually comes in the driver monitoring system which is most likely will be mandated in a year

or so. We got draft is already circulated by government where the camera is continuously looking at the driver's alertness. If there are violations are there, those

are already they are detected violation and then this is converted into a real time driver score. That gives the real. So I my license may be 20 year old

but current my driving skill may have gone down. So that will give me exact. So that's the good use of AI. Thank you very much asking this question. Can I have a follow up question on that? Let

let me just last question and if time permits will. Mr. Chaitanya you wanted to ask some question. Actually sir Chaitanya has developed a good solution where by

decelerating the vehicle the light will the collision which you can explain it quickly and ask the question. So you know, we wanted to prevent

accidents at large and that is where we are targeting to prevent a rear end collisions which are the highest in number. But anyway, my question is to prevent accidents at large like what

could be the AI involvement like is it the hardware part or the software part and how we can prevent it? Do we need to approach it as an OEM level or at a large scale level

where it goes into the implementation as an after market fit also. So because you know, to prevent accidents at large if you go only for the OEM level it might take a lot of time to get into

all these vehicles. So what could be the challenges on implementing the AI at the hardware and the software part? Well, I think what happens

if there is a See if you see the accident data fatalities data some intervention is required. And if AI solution is available, Mr. Banerjee will

can speak on this is available other part of the world. Why can't it be brought to country to save life? And then the regulations are made, they

are made compulsory and the OEMs have to follow that. And it is already available in see vehicles of say three global companies. Others can't say no.

We don't have this solution. We'll have take time. So that is one. Secondly, if some new innovation is done for Indian condition then you go in front of the government

says very good. Follow it. In these stretches in this 100 districts to start with. And then it can be additive on certain of the vehicles.

Like the control of the iris or checking the iris of the truck drivers and so on. If

certified stable solution is available, they can be add on on the existing trucks as well as the new trucks which are coming on. I think Mr. Banerjee will be able to

&gt;&gt; Yeah. Thank you very I think we are very clear that collision avoidance braking systems are already in place. Once the GPS monitored

positioning of the vehicles are implemented, I think accidents will not happen. It's a matter of time. You will see very soon with software defined vehicles with

the connectivity with GPS locations. CV2X approval which is pending with the the DOT because of the complexities is under consideration but very soon you will realize that we will have a

scenario where two vehicles will never collide. Yeah, thank you very much, sir. And thank you, Mr. Banerjee for clarifying your it's

overall the total ecosystems have come to force and as the Sanjay sir rightly said if it is implemented anywhere in the world, so what is his to bring it in

India? Nothing. You start it and as the government is very clear you just heard the member technical saying that if CV2X they're also coming up with because it's already in US. Mr. Puneet you can you

want to add one line on that? What has been the Well, I think it was it was very good to to hear that at least the globally

harmonized spectrum 5.9 GHz that you mentioned that is something which is under serious consideration. So that is something which is very good to hear. And

and one of the things I also have Dr. Mr. Singh from DC under whose chairmanship we we spent a very long time deliberating wide variety of scenario situations. And and one of the

key understanding that we have is that we really have to look at what is specific for India that we need to do. And that committee did document that we have to do those India specific trials

gain Indian experiences and which is what Mr. Bandopadhyaya did mention that our Indian fatalities may have unique differences which may be slightly

different from the rest of the world. And how do we utilize the technology to help in that? So Yeah, thank you very much. So with this

as we already crossed the time and we are getting a lot of reminders from them. Thank you very much to the esteemed panelists, our guest on the dais,

our guest in the as a participant and the delegates. Thank you very much for your valuable time. I will give the mic back to Dr. Shiv to close the ceremony with

facility centers. Thank you, sir. It has been very enlightening. And I think it was deliberated in spite of the

shortage of time. Though we have taken 10 to 12 minutes extra but I think that's fine. Because no other session was there so we could accommodate they could accommodate

it by for the 10 minutes or 15 minutes. we'll move fast and I'll request first Yeah. Professor Sikdar, sir, please come forward and felicitate our uh special guest

distinguished guest Sanjay, sir. &gt;&gt; Now to the member technology uh I'll request Mr. Sonal, please come forward.

Along with the clay sir. Sir, you also join hands. I think &gt;&gt; Mr. PK Banerjee sir. Santhanam Karthikeyan.

&gt;&gt; Ashwarya from the OMI Foundation. She is the one who helped us in making the AI roadmap report

which basically the board. So, maybe &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; Dr. Puneet, please.

&gt;&gt; Now, I'll request a clay sir to hand over to the Mr. Joshi. I'll state to the Joshi sir first. [applause]

&gt;&gt; So, to the Sonal sir, Arjun, you can take along with the clay sir. Mr. Jitender, can you come forward and I'll request Mr. Atul Rai to join

hands with a clay sir. Professor is first met the level take this opportunity. Come forward. &gt;&gt; Sir, can you hand over the report on the

AI? We have to the special guest. Our chief guest and the guest of honors. Yeah.

Once you do it will be good enough. Yeah, that's good enough. No problem. With that with this I will thank each and every one that our dignitaries for taking

time. Uh thank you very much and giving the such a vast of the knowledge uh words of the wisdom and I'm sure some of the recommendations we have given

should be incorporated in the proceedings and we'll submit a very soon in couple of days we'll submit a report. Uh certainly we'll take the help of OMI again.

Because they are the expert, they are the consultant in this activity which I've been doing. Yeah. Yeah, please. Why not? Yes, yes, I yeah. Yeah, please join.

Please join. They are the authors from the OMI who has helped us in making the these reports. So, we have released nine reports, so one of them was on the AI on

the roadmap. Sikdar sir, please give the blessing. Professor Sikdar has been into the CRRI, so he has been the director of the R&amp;D. uh other than the dignitaries, my

special thanks to RS Singh sir because he has been the chairman of the committee and who has come up with the very nice report, very elaborated report. Sir, thank you very much for

coming and doing a such a great work. And the each and every audience, all the industry members, our friends, thank you very much. Thanks to the organizers who

has given us the opportunity AI
