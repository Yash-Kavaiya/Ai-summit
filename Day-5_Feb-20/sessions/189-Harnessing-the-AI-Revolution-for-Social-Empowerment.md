## 📝 Transcript

say, you know, uh it it it's yet to unfold. We don't know what the impact is and it's yet to unfold. I believe that that contention is actually largely untrue. And let me tell

you why. Um when you talk to companies privately, publicly they will not own up to the potential job disruptions as a result of AI. And partly that is because many of the big companies uh actually

are known to be formal job creators right and they that is a very important part of their image and their contribution to economies and societies but when you talk to them privately uh

in India especially our research shows that they will own up to uh anywhere between 30 to 40% times saving right productivity gains which then translates into significant workforce cuts.

Uh we already have plenty of empirical evidence that suggests that uh you know AI systems are enabling surveillance. They're influencing decisions about who gets work when and what entitlements

people have access to. We also know that AI systems are grossly exacerbating inequality. If you just look at the market caps of some of the top technology companies, you know, Nvidia's

five trillion market cap, right? So there's a massive accumulation of capital that really uh you know there's capital share is growing and labor share of income is is uh is getting smaller

and smaller. So I guess the the you know this discussion that talks about social empowerment a key question in that is the question of the impact on jobs and

the question that I you know put out there is so if you even buy the idea that we don't know that we don't know what the impact is going to be um can we afford to just wait right or do we need

to take every action possible in terms of regulation in terms of building social institutions in terms of really working to build systems that can manage this inevitable

evolution of AI whether we like it or not. Um the last thing I'll say is just you know yes there have been technologies before yes they've had their own uh forms of inclusion and

exclusion but at the end of the day this is the first time where you have the very pioneers of that technology Jeffrey Hinton Stuart Russell Dario Amodai the very pioneers of the technology

themselves are ringing alarm bells and would we not be wise to heed them so with that I hope provocative context setting. Uh I am really grateful on behalf of the just jobs network. Um

again with support from IDRC and FCO to welcome our really esteemed panelists. Um uh Mr. Anurag Bihar who is the chief executive officer of the Azim Pragie Foundation um has uh has uh very

graciously uh agreed to chair this conversation, moderate the discussion. Uh we have uh Dr. Julie Delhanti who is the president of IDRC Canada. Thank you Julie. And um and Miss Sandia

Ramachander Arun who's the chief uh technology officer of whipro limited. Thank you so much for being here Sandy. So An over to you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you Sabina. Good

evening everybody. uh there's so much of investment going into AI u and why why is it going into a why why

is so much investment there in AI we are we are in the fifth day of the AI summit so this is like you know the 42nd kilometer of the of a marathon right U at this stage

such investment has to be justified by some monetization and uh where is it monetization going to come from? It's either going to come from productivity which comes from labor

reduction or it is going to come from new products and services or both a combination of both. That's where it's going to come from right uh we will talk more about that. At this moment my job

is easy. I'm going to just ask Sya because she's the representative of the technology world here really that which way is this technology headed and in very simple terms

what is she seeing its implications on jobs I mean what kind of jobs are going to get displaced destroyed and what kind of jobs are going to get created right and what's the underlying dynamic

because of which these jobs will be created and the jobs will be destroyed so how does she see it in the world of technology let's start with Sure. Thank you so much. Thanks Andur for the

question. So um as far as uh the tech industry is concerned, we are really witnessing a very huge impact of the AI uh evolution as a disruptor. Uh we've had to revisit uh

how job roles are created. We've had to revisit how talent has to be reskilled and we have also revisited the responsibility not just in terms of security safety but also in terms of

what does it mean to our colleagues and our hiring. I think initially there was a huge amount of uh fear that uh we would not hire from colleges which is now dispelled because Vipro continues to

hire from colleges and so do our competitors. But the but the criteria for hiring has shifted to a more nuanced uh a more calibrated way of looking at learnability looking at whether a person

communicates well technical ideas looking at whether a person is adaptable uh because AI is a technology that is changing as we speak so no one can claim to be an expert in AI and remain that

way for the next five days possibly because things that's going on changing every day. Uh with regard to our own talent, uh we have created u role personas and we have created very

specific learning modules on how the role changes with AI and everybody from the board to the CEO down to the youngest employee is going through uh a very calibrated uh learning and training

program. And there is also a very calibrated way in which services and ways of working are changing. So to that extent we see a change. Uh we are not seeing a displacement because most of

the work that we do is consultative in nature in spite of the uh market valuation uh erosion that we saw some time back because of a news uh from anthropic and palenteer.

uh the insiders in the technology world were already aware of the transformative nature of these uh solutions coming up uh and we have already been using uh these solutions significantly for over a

year. So so from a market sentiment point of view possibly there was an erosion but but from a technology impact perspective we have been bracing ourselves with change and our journey of

transformation. I I just have a followup on that and then I'll I'll move to Julie. uh I'll put it very I mean let's say a very very simple common sensical question which is

that &gt;&gt; uh we hearing about these tools where coding is becomes so much more easier right &gt;&gt; so and this is not just about vipro it's

about the IT industry in general you know uh &gt;&gt; so if coding is becoming so much easier and 50% or 70% of coding can be done by these AI uh tools then isn't it

inevitable that IT sector jobs will be lost or if there's business or volume growth much less hiring will happen. So that's part one to my question. Part two is if you move away from the IT world

and if you go to let's say design and marketing or I mean let's say my world of the academy u you read the world of research. &gt;&gt; Yeah. uh so many of research assistants

and those of you who have used research assistants or work with research assistants so much of that job is being done easily by AI right so part one of my question if coding is becoming so

much more efficient is it isn't it inevitable jobs will be lost or so much hiring will not happen whichever way and aside from that in the outside world in other industries what is it that you're

seeing right &gt;&gt; sure yeah &gt;&gt; sure let me let me just address the coding part of I think for over 15 years the industry

has been trying to explain to the outside world and as well as to the talent aspiring for careers with us that we do not have coding roles primarily. Coding is a very small task in what a

software engineer does or a software developer does. Uh there is the need to understand business outcomes. There's a need to understand customer experience. there's a need to understand

architecture and what is a well engineered code right so this is this is not new today this has been an existence I mean I've been doing digital transformation for the last 15 years and

we've been trying to change how the world thinks about these roles and today yes uh the day is here when coding can be completely handed off uh to an AI agent and uh that is indeed a

Right. But the but the fact that supports uh the success of this code in business is really the ability to have a human oversee the design, the engineering, the

architecture, the security as well as delegating the coding work to an agent. So the role of a junior developer really becomes that of a little manager of AI as opposed to saying you're displacing

my job. The person's actually going up if the person really is aware and aligns to what the organization needs in terms of figuring out what is required and those are the trainings that are

happening. That's what's happening in terms of selection. We now have COE's inside engineering colleges where we are talking to universities about this as well

&gt;&gt; and uh what about other industries whatever whatever you're seeing &gt;&gt; so so other industries uh we work with there is a variation um so if you think about it marketing

there's a lot of work that gets offloaded the strategy the planning uh the uh the oversight on execution uh the uh ROI on marketing still remains a strategic thinking job that remains with

humans but you can generate a lot of good quality visual audio and video content uh using AI today uh and and probably it's making marketing a whole lot more efficient right now if you if

you take finance for example again a lot of processing gets taken over by AI but it still needs a human to bring in wisdom in terms of how the data gets interpreted how decisions are being made

and also to make sure that the AI uh aligns to human values in some sense. So those kind of changes are happening in these functions. Industry-wise there is a lot happening uh positive I would say

in uh say healthcare for example uh even in banking for example where we are able to fight financial crimes a whole lot better. Uh in healthcare we are augmenting uh technicians, clinicians

and doctors with more intelligent input uh for decision making and while AI can make the decision you don't allow it to make it just yet because it is still a young and fragile technology.

&gt;&gt; So uh so just put a pin on something that you said and I've come back in the second round. You use the word human &gt;&gt; and wisdom. &gt;&gt; So just put a pin on that and I'm going

to come back to that uh in my second round. Julie uh if Sanda was less than less than as optimistic as she is, she wouldn't be representing the tech world,

you know. So, one should expect that she's as optimistic as she is. But uh uh what I wanted to ask you was that uh uh you know eventually a and you know from your vantage point

you know you're seeing uh how governments are dealing with this evolving situation and not just on AI safety and and and you know all the other things but

particularly on labor markets. So uh how can governments and institutions govern AI responsibly such that any disruption in labor markets is sort of minimized or handled well or the the sort of the

transition happens well. So let's assume this the picture that has painted that uh of course there's something that's going on there'll be productive like she talked about the marketing and advising

so some people are going to lose jobs there. Uh so what should government institutions do? How does one govern this situation such that the benefits are maximized? And I'm talking

particularly about labor markets, right? Not the other stuff uh while uh harms are minimized. &gt;&gt; Yeah, thank you so much. I'm going to answer that question, but the last

question just made me think about um two things. One was, you know, I'm old enough to remember when computers first came around in the in the 70s and uh you know, what we thought would happen with

computers and the that we anticipated. And of course, we did lose jobs. There was a lot of labor disruption related to, you know, typing pools and different kinds of ways. But at the time, even

home computers, nobody could even fathom what you would do with a home computer. The conversation then was that home computers would be would be used to develop recipes and that you'd have

recipes because homes were only where homemakers were. People couldn't even there's such gendered uh ideas that people just could not understand what you with a home computer. So I think in

the same way some of what is going to happen with AI in the labor market we may not be able to anticipate just yet. So just as a a reminder of where we came from with other um important

technologies but when it comes to um to governance I think the important issue is that it's not really only about technology it's really about institutions it's about workers and it's

also about research. So when it comes to institutions uh really um without the kind of strong institutions in countries, regulatory uh institutions, labor institutions, strong

research ecosystems that are able to really understand what's happening in the labor market, I think it's very difficult to uh to end up having a strong regulation of of um what's

happening in the labor market. So just those institutions are incredibly important to uh understanding where job losses might be, where biases might happen. Um and really investing in

people and institutions is uh something that has to go hand inand with our thinking around technologies. Uh another area is around um making sure that when we're when we're thinking about new

technologies that we're we're making it very humanentric and one of the things that the AI for program does when we think what do we mean by human centric it's really about making sure that we're

co-creating um new technologies with uh the the the co-creation of workers of um of communities of employers so that we can um understand how to enhance job quality

how to enhance productivity rather than you know increasing inequalities or ing um uh who benefits. So really understanding who benefits, who uh who who's going to face the kinds of

disruptions um is really important so that we're not thinking about that as an afterthought that we're really shaping AI systems using that uh that that knowledge and

similarly I think the importance of research uh in um and just I'll just give an example from our AID for work is we've done a big research program with partners

Africa that's looking at um at uh um that's collecting household data uh firm level data, worker data um to understand what the real world impacts of AI are on on uh labor markets. And it's that kind

of tracking who's going to benefit, understanding who's going to be displaced, um, and how the tasks and skills are really changing that's going to allow governments to better design

and think about, um, you know, what kind of skills development they need, what kind of social protections they need, uh, and how to how to support labor rights. Uh so really I think growing AI

responsibly doesn't mean um avoiding innovation or avoiding change but it's really about shaping AI so that it does strengthen labor markets and supports workers uh and and creates more

opportunities. &gt;&gt; Thanks Judy. Thank you so much. I'll move to Sabina. Sabina, I mean since uh you are the labor market uh expert here amongst us uh and the researcher

what is it that you see? What is it that I mean there's so much of news. We have had this five days of this grand summit. Uh what is really going on? What do we understand? what we don't understand in

the context of the impact of AI on jobs. How do you stack up &gt;&gt; things today? &gt;&gt; Just a little tongue and cheek. Um if we go back to the 1600s and we'd asked chat

GPT then if Galileo was correct, it would have said no way. Right? So this technology um you know for all the possib that it brings notwithstanding it is not just a

technology uh we can't just look at it at AI as you know machine learning large language models um it is it is um it is a system it is a instrument that is being

utilized for social political and economic engineering and my job is to look at the impact of that in labor markets. So if we limit ourselves just to the question of how

many jobs will be lost, how many jobs will be gained, that's a not even an appropriate question. Two, I agree with my fellow panelists that we we don't necessarily know how

what sort of new possibilities there might be. But what we do know, what we already see is also something that Sunda talked about, which is the uh which is the efficiency gains and Anytime there

are efficiency gains, there are layoffs. And please, you do the research, right? Like I do my job, but look at the newspapers. Companies are laying off thousands of

workers already. All the big tech tech companies have in recent years been laying off workers. Now, they can sure they can say that this is a a confluence of many factors. It's not just AI and

most of them will not just ascribe it to AI. They might ascribe it to macroeconomic conditions, to the confluence of various other forces like the pandemic or trade shocks. All of

which is true, but AI is one really big disruption that comes on top of all the other disruptions. And there's already plenty of evidence that is suggesting that these disruptions are not just

changing the quantity of jobs in terms of how many companies are already laying off workers. Again, I mean, we've heard also projections from the tech companies themselves, right? What the proje what

the possible projections of disruptions and layoffs are going to be. Um, but we also already have evidence of people being laid off. But then on top of that, I would say let's look beyond just the

how many jobs are lost and how many jobs are gained to actually look at I mean take the gig economy for example and algorithmic management of gig workers right that is a labor market issue right

um if if a gig worker is wronged the platform just you know they just get kicked off the platform um there's no mechanism for redressal because it's an algorithm that's managing the worker so

who do you talk to I mean I can go on and on and on. Now, we might be separating out platforms from AI, but actually the algorithms are AI and it's embedded in a platform economy that is

increasingly becoming the architecture for transactions and it's deeply troubling. And then the last thing I'll say is so I've already said like in terms of quantity of jobs, we are

already seeing evidence of layoffs, right? We're already seeing the evidence of layoffs. It's just that people aren't necessarily able to pinpoint and ascribe it to AI. That's point number one. Two,

we need to go beyond the question of quantity of jobs. Also look at the impact of this technology on on quality uh quality of jobs. And third, we need to really deeply think about again to

Julie's point, the architectures that, you know, that can help um mitigate some of the potential adverse effects of this technology both on the quantity and the quality of jobs. And we don't have the

luxury to sit and wait and say, "Hey, let's get the empirical evidence and then we'll figure out what to do." That will be way too late, right? So, so what do we need? We need, you know, we need

countries to think about competition policy. We need to look very closely at tax policy. We need to look very closely at how labor laws need to change. We need to look at social protection

systems. We need to look at skill systems. Everything that Julie just mentioned, right? But we have to start from an urgency about this is having a huge impact already. It is likely to be,

you know, even bigger. And we don't have the luxury of time to just sit back and wait and say, "Hey, we need more empirical evidence before we figure out how to how to mitigate the negative or

potentially negative circumstances." So that that is what I think is, you know, really really urgent that everyone get on that bandwagon and say we need to create these systems and ask for them

and do it in our work and do it in our advocacy. Thank you. I I'll just follow up. I'll just follow up with it. So uh and Julie please uh pardon me for saying this. I'm

saying this tongue and cheek and all my friends and colleagues here who are not from India please uh pardon me from what I'm going to say. So you know we Indians why should we care about all this?

And the reason I'm saying that is because you know well just about 9 or 10% of our employment is in the formal sector. So even if there is huge disruption in labor markets maybe 2% of

these people are going to lose their jobs right so why should we care about all this stuff you have any comment &gt;&gt; I do you could be sure I do

uh you could be sure I have a comment about that. So if you look at the numbers, we are more than 90% in India in formal employment. So Anorog's exactly right. He knows his numbers. So

you know essentially what you're saying is one out of every 10 people stands to be potentially affected. Right? That's one way of looking at it. The other way of looking at it is we have such few

good jobs. Right? We have such few jobs in the formal labor market. Only one in 10 people get to have a formal sector job. And now you're taking that away as well. Right? That stands to be

disrupted. So again, we're moving to a world of work that is much more precarious, much more insecure, much more uncertain, where workers don't ha, they're not even called workers anymore.

We call them self-employed contractors. They have no health insurance. They have, you know, this is the procaritization of the labor market. So not only do you have you know pandemic,

climate change, energy transition, trade shocks and AI disrupting everything but you also now are moving to a place where work is becoming more and more informal. formal

jobs are jobs are being you know gotten rid of in the name of please apologize on the in the name of efficiency gains right um and and um and so so yeah so that's why in India we should be really

scared because we have such few formal jobs and then imagine if you have these jobs in the IT sector in Bangalore disappearing all the workers that used to go to bars and restaurants and get

loans to buy houses and cars that starts to disappear and it has cascading effects across the economy. So you know so the impact of this is definitely in the global south. It is definitely

beyond the few formal sector jobs and it's deeply disturbing and we need to actually work to understand from technologists very clearly you know how these efficiency gains are going to

happen and how they're going to how can different government systems and so on infra um architecture public architecture manage some of these changes.

So we we do need to care. &gt;&gt; Definitely need to care. We need to care urgently. &gt;&gt; All right. So I mean I'm going to come to Julia on this and come back to you Sy

because I've put a pin on something that you said. Right. So Julie I mean let's assume that the alarm that Sabina is raising is uh at least half true, right? &gt;&gt; more than half

&gt;&gt; you know I have I have a deep conflict of interest I'll tell you once I'm sort of done with this so uh Julia how can you know what are the lessons that one that you're seeing

across countries you know uh you're seeing the vast landscape right and IDRC has a view across uh across the continents so what lessons can be learned uh from across the countries

such that AI is able to create opportunities right uh part of what Sya talked about uh and uh and and doesn't really deepen inequality or it minimizes it and what what are you seeing across

the countries something some good stuff &gt;&gt; I feel like I'm between the two worlds of all the because I don't disagree that there's going to be these huge

disruptions to the labor market but I do think from the research that we're seeing that there are ways that we can mitigate or um you know support better outcomes and one of those it's a bit of

what I was saying earlier one of the one of those things is that the that we're developing that technology using a really humanentric approach so really uh understanding working with people

co-creating solutions with people and some of the research that we've done across uh across Africa in particular it's really demonstrated that when we're um when we're using that approach, we do

have better outcomes when it comes to uh to better to having fewer job losses to ensuring that quality of work is higher to reducing inequalities. So that kind of you can't have that um you can't have

it as an afterthought that we're thinking about uh issues related to how we're how we're doing that. Another area again is around institutions and how we think through how we're using

institutions and and what we're what what do we need to do? You know, when we just say we need regulation, what is that? What is that regulation? And I think um one of the we have this um AI

um uh the global index on responsible AI that some of you may have heard about. It's um been talked about a lot during during the conference or at least some of the the sessions that I've been to.

And really what that is, it's the largest global uh rightsbased data set on responsible AI and distinctive about it is that it includes a dedicated focus on uh on labor protection and the right

to work and um by providing that that country uh level that sort of comparable data it looks at 138 countries. So by providing that comparable data it's it's helping governments to understand what

uh what they what they might need to do better what some of the issues are how they can improve. So really using that um that information to support governments in understanding what is the

regulation that they need not just you know it has to be based on some evidence. And I think the third big thing which won't be a surprise to anybody here that I'm saying this is

that we really need to have good evidence and evidence really matters when it comes to these issues. So tools like the global index on responsible AI really allows policy makers to move uh

move beyond kind of the abstract must must fix regulation uh to assess how um how governance of AI actually affects people's rights affects their jobs affects their their working conditions

and supports more more proactive policym uh on labor like labor regulations um again skills social protections etc and I think equally important is that we're still learning there is no standardized

here is the regulation that you be codified uh through the kind of work that we're doing. I think we're learning what's the balance between uh supporting innovation and still supporting

regulation and safety and I think working together across many countries to share that kind of information is what's going to support us in in finding the right tools.

&gt;&gt; Thanks Yuri. I'm going to come to you something, but I just want to disclose something to all of you. That's my conflict of interest. You know, Sabina is a labor market researcher and

naturally I would think she's saying what she's saying, right? Uh Julie is has this uh represent IDRC and therefore she's saying what she's saying. Sya uh is the tech person here so she's saying

what she's saying. My problem is I'm responsible with this organization Azimi Foundation and my problem is the following. My problem is that the foundation owns

about 70% of Vipro. So, so whatever is good for a tech company is good for us, right? On the other hand, my job is not to take care of the technology and this world.

My job is to take care of the most vulnerable people in the country, right? The very poorest, the most marginalized, those who have no recourse to social protection. That's my job. So, I am a

deeply conflicted person, right? Very deeply conflicted person. And I wanted to disclose that because I'm going to come to that towards the end. And it has a specific bearing on the question that

I'm going to ask SA which is you said something fascinating and I want to put a pin on that and I'm pulling you a leg you know which is that rarely do you hear such words from a tech person. She

talked about human care and wisdom right didn't she? Okay. So, uh you know really my take away from what you were saying is that the tech tech stuff know uh the coding and that kind

of stuff that can get automated but something that is human understanding people understanding desires how do you work with people that's what is hard to uh do and that's that's something that

you're already seeing right so would you want to sort of comment on Yeah. So the stereotype of techies aren't human is a little unfair [laughter] I think.

So don't anchor it in your heads. Uh but then um yeah so uh where do I start at the end of the day? What does technology consulting and technology

services try to do? They try to help our client businesses become more successful and our client businesses in turn become more successful uh when they are innovative when they

are creative when they are growing their business profitably or if they have already reached a state of maturity they are trying to bring in a whole lot of efficiencies as well

right so it's the scurve where you have an idea you nail it and then you kind of scale it and then you kind of start sailing. And when you're sailing, that's when you become a big battleship and you

have to focus on discipline and efficiency. You know, ensure that you're making profits just the same even while you're running this big ship. But then the

cycle doesn't end there. It kind of keeps going. You keep coming up with new ideas. You keep scaling it and you keep sailing it. And so profitability starts off uh with an investment. grows

and then you have to become super efficient to remain profit. And I'm I'm saying this to my boss because every dollar that we earn funds uh to the tune of about 66 cents

whatever efforts the foundation uh uses for welfare right and I think it's a beautiful creative model and I don't think that AI could have thought

of it. So therefore I do believe very strongly that creativity, wisdom, vision, foresight, human centricity is is core to any technology disruptor that comes about right. So, so if you imagine

the days when there were horse carriages, uh, all the horses would have would have been kind of crowding the roads and

people would have been going from place to place and at the end of the day, you would have had a whole lot of methane which would have kind of ended the earth a long time back because of global

warming, right? But yes, vehicles did come and you did have carbon fuel and the evolution continues. So, I don't think technology is going to stop. So, human ingenuity is going to keep

bringing techn disruptors. These technology disruptors are going to be more and more exponential in terms of what they can do and it is up to humans to figure out how to create policy, how

to create a governance mechanism and how to ensure that we derive benefits, mitigate the risks and at the same time ensure that humanity is at the center of all of this. Right now this is easier

said than done but We've done it in nuclear, right? Despite the disasters, the fact that you and I are still alive today and thriving and living a better life than we ever lived in the last 100

years is an example that yes, you could have accidents that are preventable. But accidents are created by humans and it's up to the leadership to ensure that they put the required guard rails. uh could

be policy, it could be uh you know uh guidelines uh whatever you call it and you can even hardcode some of the policy into the technology itself. Yeah. So I I'll just pause there.

&gt;&gt; So so we have to push against the stereotype. Yeah. It's good to hear that, you know. Uh I'm just going to come through one round and then perhaps

uh have the last word if I may. Yeah. Okay. So Samira, what's your take? What should we do? What what should we do really? &gt;&gt; So um so I've already kind of said what

we should do. But first I I I SA everything you said really resonated with me, right? And I I fully agree uh you know that it that the that the h humans have to take responsibility.

Um I can think of a I can think of a few very worrying scenarios where there are leaders in the world that have access to nuclear weapons that perhaps shouldn't have access to nuclear weapons. Right?

So how much how much confidence do we have in people and particularly when you look at the overall trend of growing procarity? Again take India alone 58% of our employment is now selfemployment.

It is not you know it and these are people workers that are have no coverage of health insurance or any you know any kind of uh safety net. Add to that the fact that like there's all these

different forces coming that we don't know you know if the AI if if AI disrupts jobs or pandemics happen. We all saw what happened with migrant workers walking back to their villages.

Hundreds and thousands of migrant workers, right? There is a lot more procarity in the labor market than there ever has been in the past in modern history. And the problem is that

regulations across the globe are getting weaker and weaker uh in this respect. and then we don't have precedent as Julie said like we're still trying to figure out

exactly what we should do right but I will say I mean I' I've said many a and I will say that you know the in the meantime AI is different because this is also the first time research is now

showing the first time that the current generation of young people have shown cognitive decline right so I mean rates of depression, rates of anxiety, cognitive decline. How

does cognitive dec decline affect your ability to operate at work and then be replaced by machines that are more efficient because you're getting stupider,

[laughter] right? Sorry, but this is a really worrying scenario. So, what should we do? I I think I've I've said this multiple times, regulation and building of social

institutions, but I'll take Julie's challenge and say, okay, let's go a level deeper. I think we need to look at competition policy very closely. We need to look at antitrust. We need to look at

tax and within tax we need to look at you know how do we do look at all the full gamut from you know certain kinds of transaction taxes to uh what person like wealth tax you know the the whole

corporate tax rates the whole gamut of tax tools that we have at our disposal. We certainly in an area that I know well need to look at labor regulations right there's a lot of uh discussion now about

what should happen uh in the gig economy but you know what about how do we how do you distinguish if two people have lost their job how do you distinguish you know between them you can't say okay

this person lost their job to AI so we're going to give them health care and you know other kinds of support but this person we're not right like you need to have universal systems of support for

workers of health care of um other forms of social security that that enable consumption smoothing as well so that economies keep functioning. Uh we need to invest heavily in our skill systems.

For all the talk, I can talk about Indian numbers till I'm blue in the face. of all the investment and talk about skills training in India only 4.1% of respondents in our labor force survey

uh acknow uh identify as having any kind of formal skills only 4.1% despite you know us saying skill India and talking about investments and skills

for the last you know well over a decade and a half so clearly there's problems with our skill systems. There's also well doumented research about how education, you know, the

quality of education is so poor. So how do you take a a young person in a remote part of India who can barely read and write might say that I've graduated I've done eighth grade or 10th grade eighth

class 10th class you know even 12th class but can barely do foundational uh reading or or math right uh how do you take them and say I'm going to train you for AI yeah that's what I'm going to

do like it doesn't work it doesn't work so we need to actually fundamentally think about regulations. We need to very urgently work on our education and skills systems that meet people where

they are. We need to definitely think about universal social protection systems that enable workers to transition between occupations from one sector to another, from one task to

another, from one occupation to another. And I can go into much more detail because this is something that my organization, you know, has worked a great deal on. What kind of systems do

we need to enable workers to be better protected and, you know, um and be able to make these transitions. So, thank you. &gt;&gt; Thanks, A. You know, we've got, I think,

five minutes or so, so I'm going to try and wrap up. Judy, would you want to comment? Yeah, I I just want to make a fairly random point I think and that is uh in addition to the artificial

intelligence for development program that we have, we also have a future of work project and I think one of the interesting things there that we don't talk about as much everybody is very

worried about job loss. That's kind of the big it's job loss but actually one of the bigger issues that's happening is rethinking how to work and ways of working and the disruption that's

happening within jobs and in institutions and organizations that's not necessarily about job losses. It's about a complete shift in the way that we do our work and how workers are going

to adapt to that fundamental shift in the way that they work. So it was just a just a random thought. &gt;&gt; I don't think it's a random thought at all. I think it's a it's a it is

&gt;&gt; it's a salient foundational thought, you know, for this discussion. Absolutely. You want to comment on that one line because that's such an important point. &gt;&gt; Yeah. No, I mean just to say that you

know the future works collective is a global consortium of researchers that uh IDRC funds that just jobs is part of that focuses exactly on that. So I agree 100% that that is a foundational and

very important issue. &gt;&gt; SA what about you? How would you want to respond to everything Sabina said? &gt;&gt; Um look I think uh watching and waiting is certainly not an

option. I mean, we don't want to be in a Game of Thrones situation when you're saying winter is coming for some 22 seasons and then it comes. No, nobody's going to wait [laughter]

for it. Uh so we know we know what's coming and we know what's coming is also capable of evolving and changing tremendously. So so we need to learn to change and yes, we do need to elect good

leaders. We do need to have policy at all levels. We to have uh policy embedded in platforms and of course we need to have a lot of reimagining work and training of workforce

uh so yes I think to some extent painting doom and gloom is good then we start acting right but to some extent I think it also shouldn't make you paranoid that you become dear in

headlights so yes we should act and we should move forward that all of us agree on &gt;&gt; it seems so it seems so absolutely Absolutely. No, but you know I I I think

that's in some senses a very good summary what you just now said, right? Uh what I what I wanted to say was that uh this phrase that's used boomer and

doomer boomer and doomer. So in a sense my head is the boomer and my heart is the doomer given my given my role. Uh I I want to take you just for a minute which is uh my job is more to do with

education. So we run three universities. We work with at any point in time we are working with more than 100,000 teachers, right? Uh and so I'm an education person. I'm not the labor market or the

tech person here, right? And I am deeply concerned by the effect of AI on education. Deeply deeply concerned. Uh in fact I feel that AI is attacking the very foundation of

education. the very foundation of education. What AI is doing essentially the phrase artificial intelligence it suggests what it does which means you essentially outsource your thinking.

So teachers are outsourcing their thinking and students are outsourcing their thinking. So essentially and that's what Sabina was referring to but she was referring to in the context of

social media that for the first time over the in this round of sort of assessments we are seeing cognitive declines or on test measures we seeing declines uh in student performance. Uh I

cannot tell you how serious the issue is and it's impossible to regulate this. It's impossible to regulate this because it's everywhere. So the only way we are able to deal with this in the

universities at least is that all assessment examination is now returning to the old world paper and pencil inclass test. No home assignments, no project work, nothing. Just come here

and sit and write the examination. It is truly serious. I mean I'm we don't know how to tackle this right now. And the reason I talk about that is I want to go back to what the analogy sya used

and I'm so glad that she did that which is that it is as serious as the nuclear technology right it is as serious as the nuclear technology and in one very deep way it is far more serious than the

nuclear technology because nuclear technology did not reach out and affect every individual human being. the possibility of policies and governance to be able to c circumscribe to put

boundaries to manage those possibilities were far greater and the possibilities here where a highly disrupt not highly perhaps the most disruptive of technologies is in retail form right

this is retail transformation of humanity it is so hard to do this uh but I'm really glad I'm glad that uh with uh the three of you here, we have this uh sort of uh you know reasonable

conclusion if I may say so that uh we are we are really facing something as serious as the nuclear uh and uh you can't run away from it right I mean you cannot run it's

happening you can't run away from it job losses will happen we got to figure our way out of it and uh I would want to close on this human note that eventually perhaps those

jobs that require wisdom, empathy, care, human understanding, they are going to be the hardest to replace if at all. Right? And they will stay and that's what one can see in the tech world.

Right? So with that, I want to thank all three of you. Thank you so much. I want to thank all of you for coming here. Thank you very much. [applause]
