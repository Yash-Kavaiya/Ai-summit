## 📝 Transcript

data.org is a connector, a convenor and a catalyst through five data capacity accelerators in the US, India, Latin America, Africa and the Asia-Pacific. Our capacity accelerator network or CAN

is building a global workforce for data and AI practitioners while helping impact first organizations unlock these tools in service of their missions. Through can we invest both in supply and

demand strengthening the pipeline and advancing the readiness of organizations to think plan and operate responsibly in an AIdriven world. Our work globally our work is globally

informed and locally grounded through more than 100 cross- sector partners in India. We focused on climate and its deep intersections with health, energy, productivity, and livelihoods.

These domains may appear distinct, but they are fundamentally interconnected. That insight on intersectionality gave rise to climate verse while we're here today.

Climate Verse, a vision to unlock climate and energy data tools and collaboration pathways by upskilling local talent and supporting digital trans transformation for organizations.

Let me share a bit about what we've learned about the climate and energy data ecosystems during our discovery work. Reliable, usable data is essential for decision-m

and policy. But today, many barriers persist. Fragmented ecosystems, lack of shared language and standards, and a lack of accessible hyperlocal

information, especially in emerging economies. In India alone, we conducted 50 plus consultations. We reviewed 40 plus data platforms and tools. So we've been

talking to a whole lot of people and listening to a whole lot of people and learned alongside can partners like Dan Hagra civic data lab and C's amongst others. What we heard was that data and

tools must be easier to discover, more granular, interoperable, and supported by incentives and infrastructure and paired with interdisciplinary capacity building and stronger multistakeholder

collaboration. So, it's the listening and the hearing and joining India is already doing important work in this space. But the real questions now

are how do we move from pilots to system level change? How do we design ecosystems that drive adoption not just innovation? And how do we build the interdisciplinary talent that can

translate across climate and AI? To integrate climate and energy data into real decision making, we need to build local capacity and advance organizational AI readiness and activate

partnerships across academia, practitioners, industry, and government. We all have a role to play. Today, we want to share examples of what we've been building with our partners and

invite all of you alongside our expert panelists, which you will see and hear from later, to help identify the gaps, the enablers, and the conditions needed to drive impact at scale for climate

resilience and a global clean energy transition. With that, let me invite our first partner from Arthur Global for our first climate solution spotlight, Dr. Nilan

and Kuran Shaw to share insights from their recent study on spatializing the impact of heat on human health and productivity across Delhi's neighborhood with implications for grid planning.

Welcome. Okay. Uh thank you very much uh Kurmiki and very good morning to all of you who are here today. Thank you for being there. At the outset I need to thank our

wonderful lovely partners data.org and the entire team for not only facilitating the event but facilitating the study that we're going to present today. Uh my name is Karan. I'm the

chief operating officer of the India office of Artha Global. We're a policy organization uh that works with governments uh philanthropists, multinationals and other policy

stakeholders uh to improve the design and implementation of policym. Uh I'm here with my colleague Professor Nilanjan Sirkar who's the director of the center for rapid insights which is

our rapid insights unit that aims to support governments and partners with providing policy relevant feedback in a rigorous but timely manner. So with that I'd just like to talk a little bit about

uh our work that we recently did. So we know that being in Delhi extreme heat is no longer episodic. It is a structural phenomena that we're dealing with. Uh we're not talking about heat waves as

shocks anymore. We're talking about a significant rise in the baseline. Uh when Delhi records its warmest night in 6 years, we know something is going wrong. Uh there is no relief. Nights are

no longer providing that relief anymore. And the invisible part of all this is not the temperature, right? The invisible part is the impact on health burden uh productivity and grid

management. Right? Today we know that 76% of our population actually lives in districts that are classified as high to very high heat risk and close to 50% of India's population actually works in the

outdoors. So if India needs to think about its productivity and competitiveness and cities are going to be the engines of economic growth and cities are going to be dependent on

labor markets then we know that heat no longer is just a meteorological variable but is now a significantly important macroeconomic variable. So our u our work on heat actually has

been going on for several years. So back in 2024 between the months of May and June, ARA actually conducted India's largest survey to try and integrate the impact of heat on the health of

citizens. We surveyed 27,500 Indians across 20 plus states and about 490 plus assembly constituencies to try and discover three things. What is the impact of heat on health? And how are

citizens coping both at home as well as their workplace? The results, as you will see, are startling. Close to 45% of respondents actually reported to have one member of their household ill in the

last 1 month because of a heat induced issue, right? And close to 2/3 of those actually fell sick for more than 5 days. Now, you can just sort of try and understand the impact on productivity

here, right? And when you start digging into the deep into the data, you realize that heat has very very uneven distribu disturbances actually impacting the less privileged significantly more. Right?

Even coping gave us a lot of insights. So greater than 30% of people actually said that they are uncomfortable in their own homes. And even from the ones that said that they are comfortable,

more than 40% relied on either air conditioners or coolers. Right now this tells us that cooling has become a private adaptation strategy. We still don't have a public one. Right? So that

was the motivation of our study and what made it very clear that heat has very very widespread impact and that impact is not evenly distributed. So we said okay how is heat distributed then and we

looked at cities as a critical part to identify that. Now we all know about the heat uh urban heat island effects in cities. Cities amplify heat distributed even more unevenly. Concretized areas

are causing heat traps. Building materials are actually keeping heat much longer. The lack of adequate tree cover is causing natural ventilation and natural cooling to actually disappear.

We know all of these things are actually impacting heat very badly. Right now here as well we felt that our response architecture is failing. Right? Most heat action plans in the country today

are made either at the state level or the district level. But heat is significantly experienced at the neighborhood level. Right? And that's the scale mismatch that we wanted to

highlight with the study to try and see if heat action plans can be more granularly informed. Right? Now we began our hypothesis just on three parameters. And we said the way in which heat is

experienced actually actually rest on three parameters. The first parameter is who you are, right? What's your occupation? U what are your daily routines? What appliances do you own?

Right? What sort of economic background do you do you belong to? We said that has a significant impact on the way you will get exposed to heat as well as deal with heat. So that was the most

important contribution to the study is to bring the voice of citizens and layer that with other forms of data. Right? The second question we asked is how is your neighborhood built? And this is not

your district or your city. This is your immediate neighborhood. Right? Does is it is it well planned? Is it formal? Is it informal? Is it dense? Does it have a lot of tree cover? Does it not have

enough tree cover? Those are the aspects that we looked at. And third is where you live. So even where you live actually makes a big difference because temperature, humidity, pockets of air

flow and ventilation can make a substantial difference and cause pockets of uneven heat across cities. Right? So the hypothesis was that these are the three pillars on which we will be able

to understand the impact of heat on on households and that's what led to the study. So with that, I'd just like to welcome Professor Nan to walk us through what some of these findings were and

talk about what implications does this have on plans as well as grid management. So just taking over from uh you know that that great introduction from my

colleague Karan. So let me just talk you through what the data problem here is because that's a large part of part part of why we're here. So we have good data from satellites on green cover on built

area. We have good measures from the Indian meteorological development uh from department on air temperature, land temperature, humidity. What we don't have is the third piece of the puzzle

which is how are people experiencing heat? We know that experiencing heat has a substantial amount to do with behavior, right? Um what do you have an air conditioner? Do you work in the

heat? Right? Do you have co-orbidities? Right? These are pieces of information that you need to be able to triangulate with these other administrative data sets. Now, if this data does not exist

in any systematic way, then how do you make claims about health, heat action plans, energy overload, right? You need this piece of data. So, our empirical problem was the

following. If I go to a person's household, right, I need to be able to construct the built environment for that person. I need to con uh construct what kind of heat that person is

experiencing. But I also need to construct what that person is doing throughout the day, right? I need to know whether that person is turning on the air conditioner, at what time. I

need to know when that person is working, where that person is working. So that's where the surveys come into place. Now, our infrastructure at the center for rapid insights basically uses

that geographic information, that spatial information, figures out where to sample. And in this case, we sampled 2400 households broadly across the city of Delhi and collect that data very

quickly because heat waves don't last for very long. So we did this all in two weeks. Right? So that's the kind of technology that one needs to be able to do with data collection. So just very

quickly going through some of the results, you can see that there are huge differences between when an area is more spatially planned and not. This difference is about a degree, right? So

if you happen to live on the right side where there's more green space, you are experiencing a degree less of heat in the middle of a heat wave than somebody living in a more densely populated area.

This is the area right around the airport. So many of us will be coming in and out of this area. Okay. Um this is just a snapshot of what's happening there where you can see

that a large part of this story is actually the amount of green cover. that if I just increase the green cover by five to six percentage points from 4% to 10% we're talking a degree of cooling

and um we also wanted to demonstrate that actually heat and how people are experiencing heat have very very significant economic impacts on productivity. So you can see that you

know there's a 50% increase in work loss just for a 3° uh Celsius increase in experienced heat right so this is actually not uncommon if you look back at you know some of this some of these

initial maps you can see it's going from 39 to 46 so actually the variation is 7 to 8° of Celsius in terms of what people are feeling in in in in in just in Delhi and just 3° C is in is is increasing

work loss by 50%. So we're talking about very very significant economic productivity effects here. So how are people coping with this kind of heat? Well, it turns out and this is of course

this is something that exists in the literature more generally beyond cooling that exists in the environment and across much of India you have environments that look densely uh

densely concretized like what we have on the left without green cover. People are having to turn on their ACs. People do report being having three times better sleep if they're turning on the air

conditioning, but they also report consuming twice as much energy. Right? So, as the world gets hotter, if people are going to require turning on the air conditioning to get better sleep, to be

able to show up to work the next day, we know it's going to have an impact on the grid. Okay? And I just want to make one quick point here. Without doing this kind of measurement, I might be able to

look at energy flows over the last 2 years and guess what the next month of grid uh of of grid load will look like. But it's going to be very hard to predict 3 years down the line, 5 years

down the line unless you know who's using an AC, how much they're using the AC. So that kind of grid load management is what's important. So just finishing up here.

So what I want to demonstrate here and I think what we want to demonstrate ARA global individual individual characteristics built environment characteristics are so

determinative of how people experience heat that without very localized heat action plans that integrate all of this data we can't really get to people and address their needs. The other thing is

when it comes to grid planning, yes, I might be able to plan for the for the electricity grid tomorrow or maybe a year down the line, but if I need to have planning for 5 years down the line,

10 years down the line, without this kind of data, how individuals are using air conditioners, when they're using air conditioners, how they're cooling, how the world is changing for them, you

won't be able to come up with adequate grid planning. Thank you. Thank you Karan and Nan for those great insights. Next up we would like to share another example of a use case in the

thank you um AI and energy space from climate dot and I invite Akilish McGall to talk about their work on open data architecture and how it will shape multiple use cases for India's energy

stack. Oh, just the next. &gt;&gt; Thanks. &gt;&gt; All right. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Am I audible? Yes. Okay. It's

great to be here. Thanks to data.org uh who we're working with extensively uh on reshaping some of uh energy power sector data actually in India. Um and it's also nice to see familiar faces in the

auditorium. So I think this is going to be a short but uh sweet hopefully sweet presentation. Happy to interact with uh some of you if you have some questions after this. Um all right so what we've

been doing is climate dot is trying to get a grip on India's power sector data which is significant large and u often disorganized. We have data. We have granular data. The issue is of course

getting it into usable formats. And so over the last three or four years, we've been as a as an organization trying to organize some of this data at the state level and trying to uh build learnings

that can be scaled up to the national level. Uh and uh and I'll talk about some of the collaborations that we have in this regard. Um so what is the problem? As I said, India's power

sector, we have a lot of data, significant number of data points, but it's largely unstructured and non-interoperable. And this is a problem especially when we want to talk to each

other between states for instance or between the center and the states, but also within the states. Uh we we've noticed discrepancies between years. For example, you'll see the um on the on the

right side, you'll see two rather simple examples. We have many more, but given the posity of time, I'm focusing on two examples. You'll see that for example in in in the first table you'll see ON&amp;M

being the the acronym being used but on the right side you see in the earlier year in 2016 we have it being a fully you know the expanded version of that now that may seem a very small uh issue

for us as humans but when you have machines reading this you already have the first stumbling block and that would require um significant man hours and or woman hours or people hours in terms of

to be to be accurate to be in order to make sure that the the machines read this uh and and we can you know build AI tools and so on on top of this. So the one is on on one of the problems is on

data nomature but we also have problems in data granularity and what does that mean? For example, those of you in the power sector will recognize these terms fixed charge and variable charges are

standard reporting metrics for the power sector. Uh and in 2022 we had that data so it's pretty granular. But in 2023, we noticed from the regulatory filings, this has suddenly disappeared and it's

been lumped into a single uh single cost head. Now for people working in the power sector, this may be okay and we may be able to do some simple math and get this get these numbers out. But for

machines, this is already a significant problem. So as we built out the databases, standardized databases, we we realized that these are some of the problems that we could already begin to

share with regulators, with policy makers, with data scientists, etc. so that we begin to organize this already. Um, and so what we've worked on for the last two and a half years also with

support from our partners data.org, our funders and so on, we've tried to build a unified and scalable data architecture for India's power sector that works across states and within states as well.

And I'll tell you why the within states is so important. So we we what we want to do is we want to uh get these uh the the data from various a plethora of input sources. We have PDFs and scanned

reports. Sometimes these are handwritten reports in in government files that have been digitized to scan often from a mobile phone. So it's you need to you use some sort of character recognition

some some basic form of intelligence to be able to read that and we've we've run into significant challenges there. Most of the other data is on spreadsheets and databases easier to read but the

challenge is is that this these aren't really organized in the way we would like them to be organized. So they're not consistent. Uh we of course now the the government has worked significantly

in putting out a lot of data in the public domain in uh portals and so on. Each department having their own portals but the problem is most of these portals don't really talk to each other. So they

are uh not just the the the front end is different but also the back end is very different. So smiling so I I know this is a problem. Uh and of course we have significant number of data silos that we

just don't know how to access. Uh sometimes for good reasons because these are this isn't data that you can make public but sometimes this is publicly available data that is sitting in silos.

So can we begin to have a discussion on making this uh accessible. So what we've done is really over the last three or four years built scripts, intelligent scripts that can sort of scout uh the

internet verse, get this data that we want, scrape the data and aggregate this data. This is not efficient. If some of you have a computer science background, you know that this is typically not a

very efficient way to do this. What would be efficient is to have an API or an API access to this. And um so we've we've what we've done with all the scraping is built a standardized data um

acquisition method but also uh an an architecture for the power sector. Um the key point in the outcome is to make the standardized and machine readable. What this means is uh if we can get this

data read by machines with very little human uh interaction that's the best because it really increes increases the pace at which we can begin to bring various state related data onto a single

homogenized architecture. Um we of course can the applications from this are multi you know there's a multiverse of what we can do with these applications. What we've been doing is

building uh analytical dashboards. So power sector dashboards at the state level and I'll show you on the next slide what we've done. Uh but we can also build AI and insights. So any AI

engine today requires machine readable data. Data is extremely important. So once we have these databases which various tools can plug in then building AI uh tools on top of this becomes

really really easy. Um I mentioned the API aspect uh and I think that's critical but then all of this can go into making uh better policies and uh effective decision-makings which is what

what we do as an organization. So a small example of what we did for the state of Goa Goa we're working with the state to understand how to bring up bring uh in all the power sector data

into a single portal. This is uh 15-year data goes back in history. And that's just an example on the right side of of one of the uh one of the pages of that portal where we were tracking their

renewable power obligations. Something very important uh especially from a climate and an energy transition uh perspective. The QR codes are up there. So if some of you are interested, you

can uh scan the QR codes. It should take you directly to the website. And it's it's a very interactive, very u visually built dashboards. Uh and I have one minute left. Um just wrapping up.

Thanks. So uh essentially walking through this process of automation, standardization and visualization, right? So you we need automation. We need to reduce the uh manual

intervention. We need to standardize a lot of this which we've we believe we've done for at least two or three states. Um and of course then build interesting tools that are usable not just tools

that look at past data but perhaps modeling tools and predictive tools that look at what the power sector might be in the next 5 years. So extremely crucial from a policy perspective. So

that leads us to the India energy stack and uh I'll I'll talk very little about this because we have people uh who are leading this initiative. Shwetta my colleague is here. So it's an initiative

uh built or rather led by the ministry of power the RAC and FSR global schwa is here. It's essentially the digital public infrastructure for India's energy sector. Very similar to the UPI country

this but I is for is for power what UBS UPI was for banking in India unlocked uh you know a trillion dollar2 trillion dollar economy something like this. So can we do something similar for the

Indian power sector where you know someone from Tamil Nadu can sell electricity from their rooftop power plant to someone in Ladak. If this is possible, I think our work as

researchers, you know, is is really uh would come to fruition. So, we we can certainly take questions on this uh in our panel discussion, but I'll wrap up here and I thank you very much for your

attention. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much for that. Thank you so much for that. You've heard some great presentations about what's possible with data, but remember the data is about the

people at the end of the day. Um, so there are many more such climate and AI solutions that in innovators in the room will be able to share. But for the next segment of this session, I want to

invite my colleague Priyank Pani, director of capacity building at data.org or to explore the enabling conditions to accelerate the climate and energy data ecosystem for sustained

public impact with an esteemed panel of global experts. Priam, &gt;&gt; thank you Kiki and thank you to our wonderful speakers. Uh we're going to be quick on this one. Uh we're running out

of time but um I quickly want to uh bring on uh key experts so that my talking is minimal on this panel and you get a chance to listen from listen to these um global visionaries. Um so let

me first invite u Dr. Shikanta Panigraha. So please join us um Mr. Shinas from Wasuda Foundation, Dr. So Priya Donty uh from MIT and Shwa Ravi Kumar from FSR Global.

Um thank you so much. So um today's panel is going to focus on um not just technology but thinking about the enabling conditions. We heard

about two use cases and I'm sure a lot of you in this room are working on climate and AI use cases uh and and you have several examples but as u Kurmiki mentioned in a in an opening remarks

sort of how do we move from pilots to permanence how do we move from having just dashboards to ensuring decisions and sustained decisions with those things um and how do you help these

innovations to be institutionalized right so that's the goal for us to cover in the next 25 to 30 minutes. Um, we want to think about these enabling conditions, whether they are on the

governance side. Uh, what are the incentives? What are the digital public infrastructure needed? What sort of coordination mechanisms that might be needed? Um, and most importantly, what's

the capacity within organizations and as a country that we need to develop? So, what's the talent pipeline that we need to think about? Um, and how do essentially we start measuring these

things both quantitatively and qualitatively so that we able to track that progress. Um so with that let's begin with the big picture. My first question that I'm going to ask all the

panelists to um quickly reflect on is from your vantage point what is the single most critical um institutional shift or enabling condition that might be needed to ensure that these solutions

become embedded in both the core organizational or say government decision- making um rather than remaining as one of innovations. Um so maybe we'll go around in this order.

Shinas and please feel free to quickly introduce yourself or tell us about your organization. &gt;&gt; Thank you Priyanka and a very uh good

afternoon to all of you. My name is Shinwas and I'm from Basada Foundation which is a not for-p profofit think tank working in the clean energy climate space. Jumping straight to your question

I would say that uh they can't there cannot be a good AI strategy with without a good data strategy. Right? I think that's the prerequisite to coming up with any good um AI strategy. Now um

uh to put that in context, the the quality of data, the availability of data, the accessibility of data, data governance and the contextual um um relevance of the data is absolutely

essential uh if you need to come up with a good AI strategy that is uh datadriven uh which is datadriven. Now but having said that if you look at the at AI as a whole its ability to process vast uh

volumes of data and extract actionable insights at a very very short span of time is incredible. So we need to leverage that and that can be leveraged if you are have the data. Now in terms

of institutional and governance I would say that say let's take India today we have multiple agencies that have been tasked in compiling and collecting the data at the at the national level you

have the bureau of energy efficiency that compiles data on all efficiency related aspects you have the central electricity authority you have the ministry of statistics and planning

implementation at the state level you have the state planning board so on and so forth but then what is still lacking is the granular uh granular data collection and compilation that's

something that is still uh lacking I would say and so that's where institutions need to uh gear up to ensure that we have more granular uh collection and compilation of data at a

higher frequency of sharing. So that's how I would put that. &gt;&gt; Got it. Thank you so much. That's very insightful. Um Dr. Shikanta, what's one critical institutional shift that you

think is needed? I am Dr. Sriant K Panigra um director general Indian Institute of Sustainable Development and distinguished research fellow. uh I'm basically a policy maker

working on um scientific policies uh uh because of my um interest and um for last uh 37 years uh now I am leading this uh institute which is a public policy think tank and scientific

research organization Indian Institute of Sustainable Development. Um so coming to the questions uh in public policy when you are insurable to people and you are insurable to planet and you are

insurable to the growth of the nation sustainability uh rest in all three of them. uh you need uh you have to be very particular that analysis based decision making has to be adopted and analysis uh

based decision making is only possible when you are adopting tools um scientific tools like AI is a wonderful tool and which has the precision and it helps you the exact information and data

you are looking for. If wrong data will be fed to the uh tool, the wrong uh decisions uh will be indicated. So it's uh as it has been told by my my colleague um we need uh so far as

quality of the data, relevance of the data and all these has to be in alignment with the objective which we are looking for and um so for that uh we need uh for the right public policy we

need right data strategy and there are many examples uh to which I am not getting into And uh the in IIST we have a uh wonderful research project where we are studying epiculture. Uh that is the

behavior of bees, honey bees and these bees uh are generating um uh the the uh through pollonization they are generating honey and which is a good livelihood source for the poor uh tribal

oms. So I will explain this uh study in my later round. &gt;&gt; Thank you sir. Um so I'm hearing sort of ensuring coordination between departments and thinking about a data

strategy. What more do you have to add? &gt;&gt; Thanks. Thanks Priyanka. I'm Shwa I head FSR global currently leading the India energy stack program. So I'm going to share some learnings from there. Uh you

use the word coordination and that's literally on every slide that I have on IE which is coordination at scale. We're talking about designing systems for billions. So I think the government has

already started to take its steps in terms of this whole of a government approach. What we have done through this initiative is taken that to an whole of an ecosystem approach because we need in

such a multi- sector multistakeholder uh projects we need all of them at the design board. If we don't articulate what is in it from for me for every stakeholder from early on the question

that you asked can we move from pilots to scale would be a recurring question so to have them in the drawing board is very important and in terms of actually scaling in the AI unlock I think

inclusivity is a very important aspect we need to consider uh Akillesh was just talking about can I trade from Tamil Nadu to another place in fact two days ago in this very room

we facilitated that trade and showed how a farmer Arun from Mirit was selling to a garment owner in Lakshmi in Delhi across state borders and they did it through very simple WhatsApp based

interfaces because they didn't want to understand all of this complicated AI that's for all of us engineers who love to work with complicated things as a consumer they could talk in their local

language to a AI bot in WhatsApp and trade power it needs to be made as simple as that for those stakeholders ultimately all of the best ideas in this room need to scale uh in countries like

ours and beyond. &gt;&gt; Got it. Thank you. I like the phrase coordination at scale. Thinking about the billions. Dr. Priya. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Hi everyone. I'm Priya Donti. I am

an assistant professor at MIT working on developing um AI for power grid optimization and renewables integration. Um and I'm also a co-founder of climate change AI which is a nonprofit focused

on largescale democratization and coordination of skills and expertise in AI and climate. Um and so I think adding on I think everything I agree with everything the other panelists have

said. So the two things I will add one is defining what being principled about defining what success means for solutions. I think often we're building without doing that and it leads to

things like when we have let's say a a pilot innovation we don't know where we're headed. We don't know what that intermediate success is leading to a final success since we don't set up

stages for actually moving things forward. We also kind of defining what success means means having metrics that are kind of stated that are measured. It means thinking about what is the role of

the technical system versus the human who's making a decision around it. So I think basically kind of anchoring in that notion of what is success, how do we measure it, how do we get there, what

is an intermediate success I think drives a lot of really important uh thinking and and infrastructure around this. Um the second thing I would say is having um I think we've heard a lot

about coordination but I think also being principled about what kind of um crossf functional skills are necessary to actualize and measure solutions in the long term and kind of what that

means in terms of gaps in terms of what kinds of actors exist in the broader ecosystem to make that happen. Right now there's a little bit of a dichotomy where kind of you know between kind of

can we build capabilities inhouse versus can we procure externally and when it comes to external procurement often there's some sort of generic notion of there's like some notion of a solutions

provider that does generic data that does generic AI and yet in many places kind of solutions are very specific right we heard about power system related uh like uh data standardization

That kind of effort is really important but is also looks very different if you're doing that in health, if you're doing that in buildings and if you don't have kind of specialized solutions

providers that are really able to contend with this the kind of nuanced aspects of knowing the data and knowing the methods in a particular domain then I think there's often sort of a gap

where there isn't enough capacity to upskill internally nor is there actually a good procurement option. So I think from a public policy perspective kind of enabling this more diverse ecosystem of

solutions providers that are also more tuned towards the needs of specific sectors is is also important. &gt;&gt; That that's wonderful and that's core to sort of the philosophy at data.org that

we think about where it's essentially putting people at the center of the problem. Um and so thank you for rounding us up uh Priya because as as all the things I was hearing it's

ultimately about do we have the skills do we have the institutional capacity to be able to engage with these things um and that is something that we need to look at from the cross functional

skilling perspective the lens that you talked about um and that's what at data.org or we often talk about as sociotechnical skills. So how do we think of people as bilinguals in terms

of domain understanding but also a data or AI understanding and then they're able to work across. Um so continuing with that thought I want to come back to and um you talked about IES and and the

coordination that you're doing with sort of multiple kinds of stakeholders bringing everyone together. Um from a regulatory and governance perspective, thinking about this ecosystem of the

energy sector, what ecosystem design choices um it could be um sort of standards, interoperability, it could be things around incentives do you think most influence whether stakeholders

meaningfully adopt datadriven tools. The one thing that you talked about which I really love is ensuring that they are there at the table from the get-go. They're not an afterthought. U no one

wants to be an afterthought but amongst these things of standards interpretability incentives um what do you think ensures sustained adoption of tools?

&gt;&gt; Thank you. Uh I'm going to break it down through what we call the AAA framework at the India stack. So uh first is the architecture which is all of the technical specifications. I'm I'm not

using the word standards because standards means it's an authoritative stamp right. So it's it's a combination of standards and specifications and new things coming where their old uh cannot

uh sort of adapt to. So it's going to be suit of specifications and standards that allow for all of us to have sort of a common data language. Let's put it that way. So that if uh you and I want

to exchange information, we know what and how to do that. If two systems need to do as we saw in the use cases, they know how to do that. And the power sector is quite uh complicated. You have

millions of assets and millions of people interacting. So we need to have a a basket of solutions that need to come together and be interoperable at the core. Then of course the second one is

the adoption because not all of us are at the same level playing field as stakeholders. Uh there are some discoms who have certain systems built in some ready to build in which might be an

advantage in their case because you can leap frog you don't have to work uh think about integrating into legacy systems. So we'll have to create these different uh pathways for different

stakeholders to harness this uh data AI layer or digitalization wave that's coming about uh in the sector and that's being done through what we call in the accelerator the third A wherein you're

building use cases so that everyone can plug and see what value extraction that they can have and uh some discoms might uh want to focus on uh grid phasing uh use cases some might want to uh look at

market side Some might want to look at societal impact. So there has to be this uh pieces of puzzle that that could sort of fit in for each of them and it's it's not something that you you do over a

year and close. It's a continuous process of building and so the through the accelerator which is the sandbox environment we're building certain reference implementation uh

architectures demonstrating the idea into action and then it's for the ecosystem to take and scale uh with the stakeholders and that's where I said the articulation of what is in it for me and

that's where incentives come in and uh we also have the regulators on board co-designing with us uh and the policy makers in parallel uh ministry of power is bringing in a new national data

policy framework for the power sector because we're talking about critical infrastructure here. We need to uh also look at who gets to access what kind of data and what should be sort of the

safeguards we have within the ecosystem. Uh so it's truly a 360deree view on this particular project and hopefully we will have some best practices out of this learnings from here that could help

other projects. &gt;&gt; Got it. Thank you. I love the AAA framework. We're going to keep coming back to it. Um I wanted to bring in Srias uh into the conversation now and

um your your work at Vasuda over so many years has supported the NITIO through the um India climate and energy dashboard which is now adopted and institutionalized. So you have seen sort

of this coordination piece getting everyone aboard getting the adoption sustained um that the full cycle in practice apart from all the other work that all of you do with the state

government. So from this experience like what strengths did you find um in India's climate and digital architecture uh while working on that dashboard or working with the government and what um

and I'd be remissed not to ask like what gaps do you think currently are preventing further coordinated action? &gt;&gt; Um so I would I would start now by saying that the data that is there in

the India climate and energy dashboard is not new. It's there in multiple reports of various ministries and uh agencies. It is there in multiple dashboards of various ministries and

agencies. But what the ICD does it it brings together data from all these various reports all the various dashboards in in one unified manner and it actually marries uh this is from the

entire power sector and energy and power sector value chain and it marries the data with the climate data and key economic indicators. So what it actually does is it gives you a holistic picture

of what are the trends and developments in India's power sector, power and energy sector but viewed from a climate and a and a and a development lens. So that's what the ICD does. Second, what

it does is that the the visual architecture in a way has been designed that it brings out the nuances of the trends. So it's not just about aesthetics. Yes, we did take care of

aesthetics. We did want good-looking graphs, but we also wanted graphs and and and uh infographics that that brings out the key nuances that one is looking at to give a holistic picture of what is

happening in this entire sector. If you're looking at energy transition, you can actually get what are the trends. Now if you look at the kind of users of uh the ICD uh from a low of about

average of 2,000 hits per day we get as much as 5,000 hits per day uh with with roughly uh how many I would say five lakh users across multiple stakeholder groups and from 170 countries. So

virtually the entire world. Okay, we have 195 odd countries. So we have 170 countries. We have hits from 170 countries. Now that's that's the kind of impact that the ICD has had. So it's not

just in India but it's also global. Coming to the second point on the challenges, I think the biggest challenge that we still have today is that we still have

dedicated staff who uh have to do manual entry of the data. I think in today's time and age I think we should have digital integration. We should have APIs that Akileesh talked about. I think that

is something that is still lacking. Yes, for some of the data sets we are able to uh digitally scrap it but then by and large we have and Rahul is here and you can see we have a dedicated team who are

just into this uh manual entry and that's a that's that's a pain because not only does it mean that errors tend to seep in and we have to do a lot of quality checks but also means that the

ICD still remains near real time and we wanted to make it real time. So now we have a 3 to four years gap but we would like to ideally make it real time you know. Um the third the second challenge

I would say is that there is still a reluctance even for non-sensitive data to share the data right. Uh I would say a combination of reluctance and a combination of

sluggishness. Sometimes when you are dealing with getting the data it's like pushing a wet sponge. It's as sluggish as that. and and that sometimes gets a little tricky uh you know because we are

very conscious that we want to have this as a near as a real time and so when the sluggishness uh uh seeps in then things tend to get a little slow. I would like to add one other point. Um now um if you

look at um how do we avoid duplication of efforts and which I which I think I would one thing that we at versa have always been endeavoring and not just with ICD but all the dashboards that we

created at with states whether it's a Gujarat climate action tracker the Tamil Nadu tracker whether it's a Kerala dashboard or even the predecessors of the ICD which is versa power.in in or

versus the EMI. One thing that we made very clear is that the data is available in open domain. Anybody can use it. There's no pay walls and the whole idea was to reduce duplication of efforts and

also ensure that people uh can share the data. Got it. Thank you so much. I think that idea of reducing barriers to access and making any tool user friendly is super critical. Um I want to bring Dr.

Shriant into the conversation and think about the aspects of equity just transition long-term resilience. Um from your experience sort of you've been a key global climate negotiator for India.

You've been part of IIO for many years. um what operational governance and human capacity factors do you think most enable um and and ensure sort of not just technically robust solutions are

integrated but also then are leading to those decisions within those systems. &gt;&gt; Very important question indeed. uh when uh in the public policy the equity is extremely important and equity means the

entire uh planning has to be inclusive. Uh the like in UN STGS we have a slogan nobody should be left behind we have to carry everyone along with us along with us. So

the Gandhi talisman also tell the same thing. So coming to the uh very fundamental the kind of the energy transition that is taking off India is doing excellent in enhancing it

renewable energy capacity which is geometrically increasing say it's solal we are getting into wind or say other new form of energy renewable energy like in Ladak geothermal wave energy there is

a huge investment new projects are coming up so Um India is considered as one of the most serious nation who is heavily investing in renables and uh trying to make the transition rapid and

we um if you see our achievements it is also very achievement uh is very impressive so far. Uh coming to the fact when someone is switching uh from um um coal based fossil energy to renewable

energy um the kind of the workers the technology everybody goes through a transition and for a country like India where uh the use of machine is less and more and more people uh like uh laborers

and wage based laborers they work at the bottom of the pyramid. Um the those who are engaged in coal based work they don't have alternative they are not trained in renewable energy space. So

and they are very much afraid of losing their job and livelihood security. Coming to the electric vehicles also in mobility transition the similar challenges are aired in IST. We have a

separate transition research cell where both the mobility as well as energy transition um uh while happening. How the joint transition can be taken of um uh enabling the bottom uh line um of the

pyramid for giving them right training and capacity building and bringing to the mainstream of livelihood ensuring their security has been assured. Uh for all these things technology plays a very

big role and um uh we need to uh plan and does this um uh with a precision with a optimization of time um and very focused strategic approach the program has to be initiated for uh tools like uh

different tools of AI is of great importance. &gt;&gt; Got it. Given uh the time I would like to explain our B project which is extremely impressive which we are taking

up with on national onusand research foundation and this project ensures the pollonization rate of the bee uh enhances more and more honey is

collected from the flowers and gives better livelihood option to the poor tribal woman and more honey you cannot collect unless there is more greenery. So for that the more plantation

densification of forest and agriculture enabling carbon credits through sequestration. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you on on that note I wanted to

bring in Dr. Priya uh in thinking about u sort of how do we build this workforce at scale. So what are how do we get the collaborations between these different practitioners? Absolutely. And I I will

keep my remarks brief. I realize we need to to wrap up. Um and so I guess the one thing I will say is that it is incredibly important that we really think about AI literacy at much larger

scale among kind of policy makers, NOS's, industry, so forth. We're having a whole AI summit and I think the number of people who could actually define what AI is and what an AI pipeline looks like

is extremely small. And this trickles down in many ways because then decision makers who are making decisions about AI at an organizational level, at a policy maker, it's very hard to pinpoint what's

actually needed when you don't have that basic literacy. So I will make a plug. Um uh climate change AI is running a a open registration virtual summer school uh towards the end of this year uh kind

of focused on trying to provide some of these AI basics as well as climate basics to those coming from an AI background to try to spur collaboration. So whether through that or something

else kind of I would just encourage everyone take a couple of hours to take AI 101 somewhere. &gt;&gt; Got it. Thank you so much. Thanks everyone. Thank you so much to our

panelists and thank you for being here. Uh we'll pass it on to the next session. Thank you.
