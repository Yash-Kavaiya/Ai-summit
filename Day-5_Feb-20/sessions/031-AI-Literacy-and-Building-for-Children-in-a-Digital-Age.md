## 📝 Transcript

curious how it works and I think that a lot of kids are. I would love to learn how it can be used in everyday life and how it can be used as an accurate source of information. AI is like taxes. It's

unavoidable and if you don't learn to evolve with it, you're going to be left behind. &gt;&gt; I definitely want to be a part of solving big problems. We need to have a

say in AI policies because AI literacy is really important. Thanks for finally asking us what we think. Bye. &gt;&gt; Uh he breaks me every time. there. The

these were uh children that we uh brought into a school in California in December. There's no actors in there. There's just a lot of children with opinions. And the little boy at the end,

uh he just had a lot to say. Uh he is very wise. Um but these are those were the views of just some smart inspiring young people. They're not just eager to use AI, but I think you can see

they're especially eager to understand and to build things with it. And just as you saw, they have some really clear ideas about how it should and shouldn't be used in today's classrooms.

But of course, you know, excitement and confidence are not the same as mastery or comprehension. uh we do see an unfortunate trend where children do not understand the

fundamentals of the systems they're interacting with and I think you can particularly see that in younger children who often see generative AI systems as a kind of magic box that they

can tap into where you know you type in text or a question and then out come images and videos and entertaining things and and maybe even the answer to a history essay question. Um,

I think we need to be really clear that AI is not magic. It's not a magic toolbox. It's a technology um, system. And foundational AI literacy isn't about teaching children how to use this magic

box. I think far more importantly, it's like how do we give the child the screwdriver to take that box apart and really understand what's going on under the cover.

So while you know supporting children to use uh AI tools safely, ethically and effectively today is important, I think far more it's about equipping them with the the knowledge and the tools, the

confidence to build what is yet to come. So therefore our definition of AI literacy when we talk about it, it's about understanding today's technology, yes, but it's far more about

understanding the fundamental concepts. so that you are armed and ready for what is yet to be designed and actually so that you can be the designer of what is to come.

So um I I think that we have uh underestimated the role we have to play in preparing uh children today. Um we don't want them to be passive consumers of AI. Instead, we really believe that

we should be arming them with the tools, the literacies that are required to to lead, to design, to create. And our goal is not about sort of robot proofing our children for what's coming at them, but

just making sure that they are ready to build a better future and they've got the tools in their hands. So, let's talk about AI literacy as understanding the foundations of computer science and AI

concepts. that is about understanding probability, how computers sort of sense the world as data points and data sensors, sensing um algorithmic bias and understanding all

of the nuances of that. We don't want that to be an elective or selective um choice for um just the few. We believe that these concepts have to be elevated to the status of modern literacy

alongside maths and reading problem solving, creativity and collaboration. And I think it's best if we show you how we plan to do this in classroom. So I'm going to hand over to Atish and we're

going to run a live demo which is always fun at a uh a conference event. &gt;&gt; Great. Thanks Tom. And I'm also delighted to introduce AI Dancer who's on the table here. uh who hopefully will

do some dancing uh soon as well. Uh so yeah, very excited to share a bit more about how we've translated some of these principles that Tom was talking about into the product. So I'm here also

excited to shout about our new computer science and AI product which is just fresh off the press which we just announced in January and will hit schools in April. But all of this we

need to do this very responsibly. Uh we saw this kid earlier in the video talk about yeah should be safe, fair, transparent. So this is very wide scale, right? So we we really agree at LEGO

education. We've established clear guidelines for how this should work. So let me step you through some of these guidelines. So AI should be safe. We do not generate any text or any media. We

do not anthropomorphize. I got that right this time. Uh it's just a fancy way of saying we do not make kids think that AI is human. We do not want them forming any unhealthy emotional bonds. U

we we ensure that all our digital products are rooted in the principles of universal design learn uh of design principles and we are designing for kids who have neurodeiversity. We're

designing for kids who have different learning needs. So it's really important that our our products are designed in a very fair wayp all the models that we would would use

uh would would should have very clear data provenence. So it should understand where the data has come from which has trained those models and understand whether the the models have been trained

on different geographies on different kinds of kids on different kinds of adults. U so ensuring that these models have clear data providence is super critical for us and then finally

privacy. So I just want to stress that uh in all our products uh AI features run locally on the devices. Nothing ever leaves the device. Uh nothing ever goes to us at the LEGO Group. Nothing goes to

third parties. No login is collected. Uh there's in terms of the the training whether the kids are building their own AI models or they're using pre-existing models, nothing ever leaves. So safety

and student well-being is a red line is a non-negotiable for us. So everything we know about decades of education research show us that kids learn best when they are building, when

they're using their hands and really creating. uh and we do and we we've seen this very much at le education and and through years of research. So now more than ever children need to learn need to

learn together. So much of computer science and AI today is with kids sitting in front of the screen with their headphones on by themselves learning and I don't think we see this

as as a vision for learning for us. Kids should be building together, coding together, experimenting together, tinkering together and sharing together. So that is really our vision of how kids

should be learning computer science and AI. So when they tackle these when they tackle these new technologies, they also have those crosscutting skills to also deal with this in the real world.

So bringing this all together at LEGO education, we have these four values uh that govern our approach to AI literacy. So we prioritize child agency and engagement to ensure students are active

participants in their own learning journeys. We empower students with the foundations of AI literacy that Tom was talking about that remain relevant as the technology evolves. We uphold child

safety and well-being as it's non-negotiable for every AI interaction in the class. And we foster hands-on immersive and collaborative experiences that inspire creativity and shared

learning. So that is really the the four um principles that are driving all of this. So, how do we make this uh how do we bring this into a classroom? How do we

uh w with our products, how do we make sure it's hand it's hands-on, it's understandable and safe for kids. So, I I would encourage you also after the session to go to the booth. I think it's

in all three and actually see these products in in person. Uh get hands on with them, try them out yourself. So, we're really helping students to build real AI literacy by demystifying how AI

works. Through these playful features and lessons, learners explore concepts like computer vision, probabilistic thinking, classification, machine learning while seeing their ideas come

to life. The result is student agency. Uh, kids not just using AI, but actually understanding and building with it. So, what better way to show you how kids are using it than for me to try to actually

make you use it. So here we have a lesson which is about teaching kids about pre-trained classifiers. So this is in the last unit of once they've gone to some core

principles of computer science. They've learned about basics and events and loops and data structures. So at the end they are looking at AI and data and here they're learning about how you can use a

pre-trained classifier the model that already exists to bring their AI dancer to life. One thing you'll notice here when the when the code is up here that the the camera that they can use the

camera by default is off. So this is also sort of in line with the principles of AI safety. So, it's an explicit action the kids are taking. And here when I hit play now,

okay, maybe I have some I've got that's why I have a video. &gt;&gt; Okay, no worries. So, what I'm going to do, Always fun trying to do a live demo. We always have a backup.

what it does. &gt;&gt; So here you can see that as I'm lifting my hands up and down, you you're seeing the different probabilities changing here. And what the kids are learning

through this is that with traditional computer science, you've got zeros and ones. Things can be on and off. With AI, what they're learning here is there's a 80 70 90% chance that I've lifted my

left hand up or my right hand up or both hands up and then that's triggering the different events. So they've learned about events in earlier lessons and that's what's triggering those. So they

learn that AI is not always right. They're learning that the more data that's trained into the model, the better it gets gets. And they also learn from an ethics perspective that if the

AI model is not trained with enough kids examples, it will have biases in it as well. So these are very core principles of AI but taught in a very simple and playful way and and making the AI dancer

come to life. So I'll show you how this lesson also works in a in a real classroom. Ready to excite your students with computer science and AI? This lesson is called Strike a Pose. Students

will learn how to customize an AI classifier and program AI activated events. We'll kick off with a big question to spark curiosity. How could you train a robot to follow your

movements? We will explore the topic through the computer science concepts AI and data. The question is tied to a real life example. how AI can be trained to recognize images through data. This

makes it more relatable to both students and teachers. In groups of four, each student picks a mini figure which indicates their roles in the collaborative building process. The

group will build a robot with movable arms and discuss how it might work. Then it's time to get hands-on with coding. Groups will open Lego Education Coding Canvas, enter the lesson pin, and

connect their hardware. Students create and train their own AI custom classifier by posing in front of the camera and capturing pose data with simple pre-made code and their

classifier. Groups explore making the robot mimic their arm poses. Group members take turns so everyone gets hands-on. Two students develop the build of the robot while the other two iterate

on their code and later they swap. Students present their robot, talk about their iteration process, and discuss how they created and trained their class. At the end of this lesson, students will

be able to say, I can create a custom classifier. I can use pose data to train a custom classifier. I can describe how to create a custom classifier and use data to train it. This is the third of

four lessons in the AI and data unit where students explore how computers learn from data. In the following lessons, students investigate how data quality and quantity can improve how

their AI detects their poses. At the end, they apply what they've learned through an open-ended design challenge. All materials for this lesson can be found on the LEGO Education teacher

portal lesson plan. Ready to use classroom presentation and facilitation notes. No extra prep time needed. &gt;&gt; So, so you got to see how AI model is really you how the AI dancers really

used in the classroom and what you saw also in the classroom there were kids meaningful roles in the building process. as they were building out the model but also meaningful roles when

they're coding and also training the AI as well and all of this also for for the for the kids but but none of this can happen without teachers right so we we cannot simply drop new standards and

mandates on educators without the support uh for them you saw in the video briefly referenced the teacher portal where the teachers get all the resources and the and the support they need to

bring computer science and AI to kids we know that most teachers who are teaching computer science science are actually not computer science teachers themselves. They are they are teaching

math, they're teaching science, they're teaching English and so they need to be prepared to really scale this up as well. So we really see this not as a as a challenge in terms of access to tools

but an access to confidence. So I think this is a nice there's a couple of very nice quotes here but I'm also it's a nice point to hand over to Richer. I'm very pleased to hand over to

her who leads product development on the retail side and is behind the super exciting smart bricks that you see. Hi everyone. Good morning. Uh thank you for having me. So um my name is Rich

Amen. I head up interactive play at the LEGO group. Uh so we've just heard an important call to action in terms of AI literacy. So preparing children to understand and navigate an AI powered

world. Um and this matters enormously. Um, but what I'd like to do is spend a few minutes discussing the other side of this question, which is, you know, how do we prepare AI for kids and

imagination? And, you know, part of the reason we're here is that we believe our focus on play and imagination not only unlocks exciting new play experiences, it might just be the unlock to a more

inclusive and empowering future of AI. So childhood as we know is formative. It's not a market opportunity. It's a developmental window that closes. What enters that window shapes who we become.

You know our sense of confidence, our curiosity, our relationship with struggle um and creation. And very importantly that shaping can often be invisible. So this is very important to

us in what we do in the creative play lab which is the innovation team at the Lego group. Uh so what we do is we look at you know how do we create more and more relevant play experiences uh for

kids. How do we employ new technologies in service of better play for kids but always keeping in mind our DNA as a Lego group that hands-on minds on play experience that we all love. So eight

years ago um our team asked the question you know in a world of digital screens you know how how could we offer kids more interactivity in their Lego play experiences but without a screen and we

were really really committed to this and spent eight years getting there and we just launched in January the smart play platform which is a new dimension of Lego play. Um, what this is is, you

know, as the child is is playing with the smart break in their models, the play actually responds with appropriate sounds and behaviors. So, imagine you have your Star War Star Wars X-wing.

And, you know, the way you move it around, you know, if you fly with it, it'll swoosh. If you drop it, it'll cr make a crash sound. So, you know, it's really responsive to the kid. And all of

this without a screen. Without a screen. That was very, very important to us. um and also without AI and we just we didn't need AI in this solution but you know also we're not entirely sure if AI

is ready for childhood. We really believe that childhood deserves uh deliberation and that deliberation might be an unlock as I mentioned to the future of AI. So first of all AI holds

tremendous potential when you think about play uh when you think of the creative barriers that kids face in play. So, for example, I'm sitting with, you know, my brick bin. I have a ton of

bricks. I don't know where to start. This fear of blank canvas. You know, AI could easily off offer little prompts that inspire me to play. It could support diverse learning methods. Um, AI

could help us better understand a child's intent so we could offer more better, relevant, meaningful experiences. And one of my favorite aspects, which I think is super

interesting, is that, you know, generative AI is probabilistic. And in other contexts like uh you know productivity a hallucination is a bug but when it comes to play you know maybe

that hallucination is just a playful feature right so there's huge potential um in what AI could bring to offer better play but of course as you know um there are many challenges that need to

be addressed and there's three three key tensions that we think are really important uh to address when we think about kids and childhood. So first of all it's uh this this tension between

efficiency and imagination. If I can get an answer just like this I don't have to wait. I don't have to struggle. I don't have to use you know develop my imagination and you know does

that rob kids of the opportunity to really develop their imagination and more importantly develop the confidence in their own imagination. Um personalization and identity. you know,

a child at seven is not the same as who they're going to be at 17. So, if we start personalizing the experience for who they are at seven, you know, are we holding them back? Um, and then finally,

assistance and agency, you know, are we raising kids who are, you know, you know, it's very easy for them to prompt. Um, but, you know, they don't have the ability to really persevere through. So

these are some of the key tensions that we see and of course there's a lot of opportunities but we feel the responsibility to ensure that these are addressed. Um so when we develop new

play experiences we ask ourselves the question you know does this increase or decrease the choices that a child has. Does it so child agency does this expand imagination? I'd encourage you to ask

yourself the question as you develop AI solutions. uh does it preserve that healthy developmental friction where you have to actually think um and finally just would I want the shaping my child's

inner voice um as a way to really think about what's right um and I'd love to leave you with this question um that we spend a lot of time thinking about is um you know as we look at AI systems today

you know what exactly are we optimizing for and how important that choice is so if today AI systems, you know, if we optimize for engagement, what we're going to get is more attention. But what

if what if we optimized for childhood, then we're going to optimize for potential? Thank you very much. &gt;&gt; All right. Good morning everybody. Uh I'm Sadna Pandai and I'm the uh chief of

education at UNICEF India and it's a pleasure to moderate uh today's panel discussion on AI literacy and children. So we've heard a lot at the summit about the wonder of tech. It really feels good

to talk about the wonder of children and of education. So I want to thank LEGO for creating the space for this discussion. We all know that AI has brought a step

change in how we live, work and play. And there's no doubt that it is impacting children's lives and how they experience education. The problem is is that it is doing it

unevenly. For a child living in urban Delhi, AI has found its way into their education either through the home or the school. But for a poor tribal girl

living in rural Jarant perhaps not so much. Education systems are facing massive learning challenges for which governments are seeking

equitable, scalable and evidence-based solutions. Two to three decades of digital learning has yielded smallcale wins and modest impact on learning.

And yet we've seen the massive impact of AI already on health systems and that gives us tremendous hope. I keep repeating this example because I'm fascinated with it.

In the area of radiology, AI has helped the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer 438 days earlier than would have been normally expected. We were previously diagnosing pancreatic

cancer at fourth stage. We can now diagnose it at stage one and it diagnoses it with greater accuracy than any human ever can and this without touching a patient and that makes me

feel excited. We are looking for that kind of accelerator in education. something that's going to bring efficiency and quality without widening inequality and as you've said that

remains deeply human centered because we know that learning is an inherently social process. We cannot be naive about this. We are walking a tight rope between something

that is scaling so fast and evolving so rapidly. But anybody who's worked in the education system knows it's a big ship. It takes a wide birth to turn. But even when with that we are looking

for a public good out of AI because we need it. These are really tough interests to marry. But it has been done for vaccine roll out and it is being done in countries

like Estonia right now within the education space through all of this. You got it. Hang on. We've got to keep teachers, pedagogy and curricular at the center. And more

than anything else, we need to keep children at the center, matching their right to learn by multi modes, including tech, with their right to protection, participation, and privacy.

But time and again, we make the error that we underestimate the capacity of children. They're not passive recipients of education. They have tremendous agency.

They can consume tech. They can shape it. And no doubt they will lead it in time. So today's conversation is about agency. How do we build AI that empowers

children to become creative, critical, independent thinkers that maximize the potential, take out of the best of AI but offset its risks. To help us do that conversation, I have Tom and Richer.

Welcome again, Tom and Richer. And we're looking forward to a very robust engagement this morning. Okay. So, Tom, we're going to start with you.

So, you talked about AI some sometimes feeling magical that it's abracadabra and voila, something beautiful appears. And we know how children love magic.

they really become enthralled with it and they want more and more of it. Do you think that that magic risks an overdependence on AI? And more importantly, what can we do about it?

&gt;&gt; Uh, children do in am I on? Can you hear me? Good. Um, children do indeed love magic, don't we all? Um, and we all like fast results and increasingly, you know, we have much shorter attention

spans than we had uh maybe even 10 years ago. And so we're all looking for quick fixes. Um, I think we often uh, well, I think we're overlooking the fact that children have immediate access

to data and information now that they trust inherently from the get-go and they will take a question and feed it back as if it is um, the gospel. So, there is this real danger that um, AI is

indeed seen as a magic box, particularly generative AI. And I think that that's amazing that children have this inherent curiosity and the Lego group sort of celebrates that curiosity every day.

It's a wonderful thing. But I, as I said, I think it's um a real mistake if we don't teach children to question the magic and actually make magic for themselves. And in order to do that,

that's why we are um so passionate about these fundamentals of AI literacy because if we simply hand um children a box that promises quick um magical results, I think we are really

shortselling them. So I'd much rather Yeah. We hand over the screwdriver. We hand over the the kind of compass and allow them to take things apart and start to create their own ideas. Um I'm

not sure if I addressed your question there, but I think that the magic is the magic is something I would we really want children to create their own. And I don't think that we should be under um

any illusion that they're going to work this out without an education system that takes and a societal system that takes this responsibility very very seriously. And it's not about taking

this responsibility in a few months or a few years time. The time is now to maybe stop some things and actually start a fundamentally different approach. &gt;&gt; Perfect. There is no magic. It's a it's

an algorithm created by human beings and like anything that's a human endeavor. It can be managed with the right guardrails in place and anyway in the current analog era cognitive offloading

is happening right but we've been able to manage it and it requires this pedagog pedagogical stretch from teachers. So there's a lot of responsibility on teachers to say let's

switch the question. Let's do something different than just retrieving information or simply analyzing it. We really need to take it a step further. Richer, a lot of the conversation around

AI and children frames them as victims, people that we need to protect from some negative consequences. And anybody in this room who has a kid will tell you that's far from true. When

they want something, they have agency and they find their voice. So, how do we ensure that children are empowered to make the most of AI while not losing the responsibility to protect

them? Thank you. Thank you for the question. Yes. Um, it's challenging because kids have access all the time. You can't stop it. as you say, they have their a mind of their own. But I think

as we've seen even with social media that, you know, maybe we don't always understand the long-term consequences. You know, while I can have an immediate reaction and something that makes me

happy in the minute, what is that going to do in the long run? So, I think this focus on education as a filter to understand the long-term, you know, as a kind of compass of what is a better

experience, I think is incredibly important. So that's kind of our position um in terms of how we would employ AI. &gt;&gt; Wonderful.

So there's two things that we need for empowerment. One is foundational skills. The child needs to have a basic level of literacy to be able to engage with language models. The second critical web

and AI literacy. And the model you put out looks fantastic. Now let's take the model into a real world classroom, right? What is it going to look like

in rural Rajasthan where we've got multi-grade, multilingual, multilevel classes? How do we make this come alive

and have relevance for those type of settings? I I think that the best thing you can do uh and any teachers in this room will know this ask children who are looking

at you the question like what what type of conversation do they want to have and in the form of of AI we've just produced a template to to discuss AI policies with um your classrooms freely available

so we'd love to share that ultimately I think children will um assess this question question in a very very smart thoughtful way. And if we don't ask them the question, again, we are very guilty

of simply publishing something and deciding that it's in their best interest. Of course, we need to guide them and we've got a lot of information that we need to share with them, but let

them think their way through this. And the best way to do that is ask the questions. So, yeah, take a discussion around, you know, where does bias show up in their lives? What might that look

like if a technology system um lent too heavily on a false of information. Um, teaching them sort of the basics of if then concepts. I think you can do that in any type of classroom and you don't

need any type of equipment on the table. You need minds to be switched on and to do that. I think you need to ask children the questions and you need to trust that they're going to have some

thoughts and you need to help them guide that policy. So that's something we'd love to see widely spread. Yeah, &gt;&gt; maybe just uh coming in from so prior to LEGO I also worked with the the UN

refugee agency for many years and also sort of saw these applications of edtech in in quite rural or humanitarian context as well. So I think there are interesting ways to bring some of these

concepts to life even in very I think I I heard the phrase frugal uh AI being used at the conference. But one of the things I think even for us just because we have access to these powerful models

doesn't mean we need to put those necessary directly into the hands of kids as well. So even as we look at sort of education progression through the from from kindergarten right up to grade

8 and beyond the age appropriateness is super important. So even as we're looking at the the littlest ones and how they learn about computational concepts and AI a lot of where we start is

actually completely screen free. They they are working with understanding computer science concepts like sequences and loops and just doing this completely with bricks and you can imagine some of

these context it may be bricks it may be something else but it isn't even like a hardware or a screen at all. So you can teach concepts of probability and computational thinking um even without

some of these these if you don't have these resources and this actually aligns well with as as we think of age appropriate progression. Um but I really challenge the audience as well around

this need to want to put things into kids hands directly in any context. I mean not just in challenging contexts in rural India but also in other countries as well. Let's not rush to to for the

fastest and the best model uh but what is what's actually right for the kids as well. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. We need to generate a fair amount of evidence uh before we rush to

scale with something like this. Although we have to mediate the fact that smart uh smartphone penetration in a country like India is widespread. So access is there and a school is a microcosm of a

local community. So whatever is happening in the home is going to reflect in the school and if it impacts child well-being or if it impacts learning then the schooling system will

have to respond. So Tom I'm coming back to you again. Um AI can sometimes feel very passive. You put something in, you get something out. But we know that the best learning happens through

engagement. It's that journey of discovery that excites the child. So, how do we make this thing interactive? What do we need to do to support

creativity in the use of AI? &gt;&gt; I'll declare my bias here, which is that, you know, I work for LEGO Group. Therefore, I'm kind of um deeply entred in the a passion for hands-on learning

and a deep belief that kind of when you use your hands and the science backs this up, you are engaging all parts of your brains that lead to deeper engagement and ultimately a deeper

mastery of the the subject in front of you. We could joke through thousands of research studies that we've done through the Lego foundation or with any of our research partners that um you know

spatial awareness skills develop strong children are using their hands. The very basics of mathematics in primary years will develop in a stronger way when you're using manipulatives and you're

thinking through things. So this this um use of uh hands and um manipulatives is something we we believe in so deeply. So, I think artificial intelligence, it's a concept of technology. We really

believe there's no reason why hands-on learning shouldn't uh be brought in here. You saw in the video that, you know, we designed for collaboration first. So, this is not a one-on-one

learning experience. We really want children to learn together, groups of four, whatever number you put around the table. uh we want them to be looking at each other and challenging each other,

working in groups, learning the fundamentals of collaboration. It's not always easy. Things will break. Uh you'll have to start again. You might not like the role you've been given, you

know, things that that's a great life lesson. Um so I I think AI can sometimes feel, you know, the magic box, but also maybe the dark box. And actually it's about helping kids understand that there

are um really clean and to understand um technology fundamentals that underly artificial intelligence and give them curriculum that means something to them. Right? So uh we introduced a a computer

science GCSE in the UK back in 2014. Um I I went to school in the UK. It's where I live. Uh I'm I'm not too proud to say that that was a a a failure in terms of uptake by students because

there were two things mistakes that we made. One was a really lack of um teacher training. So there was no uh kind of innovation put into the the delivery pipeline but then there was

also a real lack of innovation in the courseware and the curriculum that we designed for that GCSE. And so children just sat very bored in a computer science class learning very outdated

principles. So I I think the best thing we can do for interactivity and artificial intelligence sort of education is apply this to things that mean something to today's teenagers and

young people. And that means kind of meeting them where they are and and sort of um helping them apply fundamentals of AI to the life that's going on around them. And and I think that applies both

to the child in the classroom and also the teacher. So give them curriculum that sort of applies now rather than feels two decades too old. &gt;&gt; I must say that I've seen the joy of the

Lego bricks. Uh I'm South African and I would travel to the rural areas of Quazulu Natal and there'd be nothing else there except a hut. You go to the back of the hut and you see a child with

two things. the workbook given by South African government and handme-down Lego bricks and you would see the you know that coming alive of head, heart and mind and it was beautiful to see. So

thank you LEGO for that. Um all right uh Rich I'm coming back to you. We're excited about the tech, but we're also worried about safety and we're worried about privacy. And our young

adolescents in particular who also make up the child cohort are worried about privacy and safety. So, in all of the issues that a private entity needs to think about when they're

designing a digital experience for children, where does safety and privacy stand and how do you create this joyful, meaningful experience

while reducing the risk with a tool like AI. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Um, so as you can imagine, safety, privacy, these are absolutely foundational and non-negotiable as we've

seen in the LEGO education side and similarly in ours. And just to be clear, none of our LEGO products actually employ AI. So the smart break is not using it because for all of these exact

same reasons that we have a very high bar if we look through the lens of childhood we have a higher bar that we need to meet. So there is this tension though that um you know obviously

there's so much potential for meaningful incredible hands-on play um you know developed through AI but at the same time we need to ensure that you know until that bar is met you know we would

not um put that in our products. &gt;&gt; Excellent. So for our young people of today who will be consumers of AI, you know, trust, transparency, privacy, sustainability,

and voice would be critically important that we're not just handing something to them. They get to shape it and co-create it uh with us. At this point in time, we have a couple of minutes. So we're going

to take a couple of questions from the audience. Since I'm left-handed, my bias is on the left side. I'm declaring it up front. So, I'm going to take uh three quick questions in a first round and

then I will come across. So, I'll take one from the front, one from the back and then on this side, right? Okay. Over to you quick and sharp. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Fantastic session. Uh my name

is Nikil Pawa. I write about how AI is changing the and education. Uh I'm just curious about what advice you would have uh for parents because schools are going to be slow to adapt and so do you have

resources for parents in particular about because they will I mean I'm trying to uh develop an alternate home curriculum for 4 hours a week outside of school for my kid. Just curious about

what you would recommend for parents. question to develop you need a combination of structured and unstructured play both right I want to

know your views on how you're thinking unstructured play with AI and then you know play around with also other things like self-regulation which becomes very difficult for even a

team to manage. So that's one question and the second is we are doing a research on this entire AI adoption at homes which is beyond classrooms and the initial findings are quite

disturbing because it is getting adopted and adopted just because it's it's becoming like a race especially in India. So I would also like to know if there are some recommendations

of various AI play adoption from you guys. Okay. Beyond the classroom. &gt;&gt; Uh good morning. Thank you so much. Uh my name is Asha Navati. I'm with Alliance Educational Foundation which

runs a a charitable small uh K through2 school in in Kerala. They love the Lego products, you know. Uh but what I really heard what you said earlier uh about capacity building about

including teachers um we're a a charitable school we all profits go back to the meals the child and we don't maybe have funding for training teachers on AI adoption safety practices we have

play school learners up so um is is Lego thinking about doing anything in India definitely would would love to hear more about Can I work backwards? So, we have a we

have a recommended AI toolkit to take into classrooms and that it's a facilitated conversation with children around, you know, what do you think about AI? What should a policy be for a

school in a classroom? To be honest, I think that is applicable to a group of teachers in a training day as it is to um children and a teacher. And I've seen really great examples of schools that I

know in the UK following a similar approach. I think I would maybe there's a theme in all of the questions like maybe don't worry about applying the brakes, right? Things are moving

incredibly fast. I wouldn't go along with what can feel like this very fast river or wave or current. I think it's perfectly okay to apply the brakes and say we need to hit pause and we need to

have a conversation. And the conversation needs to be about what do we want? And when I say we, I I mean the children in the in the classroom and the teacher. Like what do we want to get out

of this experience? And I think have the conversation first and don't worry too much about the tools or the software that you're worried that you might be missing out on on using. And as Richard

just said, we are we're not using generative AI in our products. And that's for a very deliberate reason because we just don't know enough yet about safety and privacy. We have

conducted uh research into that and we're following that very closely. But we're not willing to take any risks and I think this time of childhood is just too precious to make some shotgun

choices that we're going to pay very heavily for in the future. So I think empower the teacher and the child to have some really formative discussions about what do we want to get out of this

and then maybe uh look at what's available. learning of child agency versus some scaffolding. So as we bring these products also into core classrooms as

part of like education strategy. Now uh we do understand the needs for teachers to provide a scaffolding as they take them through this uh through this learning journey. So we have for example

at LEGO education we follow something called a 5e model of engage explore explain elaborate and evaluate but it's just a fancy way of saying how do you sort of get the kids hooked initially to

a a big picture question or a real life example and but you provide the educators and the students sort of a structure as you go through this process of

thinking about that question I think who said that who had that question yesterday that the distance between a question and answer and and that that that that space between that's where

magic or inspiration happens, right? And so giving that space for that to happen and then when they're building and so you're providing the structure for them to to work in groups and build this out,

but towards the end in the elaboration phase and at the end of every unit, there's something called a design challenge where the kids are are not provided that much instruction. They're

given an open-ended prompt and then they take the concepts and lessons that they've learned and apply that in a more open-ended way. Outside of the LEGO education, computer science and AI

product, we also have something called first Lego League, which is the world's uh largest uh STEM annual STEM competition as well. And there you see these it's it's so inspiring to see

these groups of eight kids uh building a robotics or challenge and then doing a science theme as well. But that's completely open-ended. So they will go beyond what a 45minute lesson what they

would do within a 45minute lesson and have a lot more agency in terms of what they can create beyond what sort of a teacher would take them through in in in a classroom.

&gt;&gt; All right I'm going to take last two questions madam &gt;&gt; come back &gt;&gt; Nikil we we have some really great resources actually available online both

on Lego and Lego foundation around facilitated play with your child and it's starting from very early years through to later years. So there are things available.

&gt;&gt; I'm I'm going to take two more questions because we coming to the end of the session. We need to close. We need to close. &gt;&gt; Okay. Now I will take one question but

really quick and Well, I I think we heard a lot yesterday that kind of we need to make sure that any tools that are made available are done so in languages that mean, you

know, something you on the ground. So I think you um there are many tools out there that can do automated translation. We hope that there the quality is going to be really strong in them. We we're

currently um producing in English language. Of course there will be localizations in the future. &gt;&gt; All right colleagues we need to come to a close because people need to move to

the next session. We're designing for safety for equity and while we provide services we need to match it with demand. And to match with demand, teachers, learners, parents need

to be empowered. Uh that responsibility rests with all of us. It's hard to do many things in an education system. Empowerment is not one of them. We can do that quickly. We can do that with

scale and we can do that with equity. So I want to take say thank you to our panelists for today for having an engaging conversation and a big thank you to LEGO for bringing us together to

have a conversation about children education and AI. Thank you so much. The session closed.
