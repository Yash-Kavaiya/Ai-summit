## 📝 Transcript

about this morning is right siding governance for the for an AIdriven world. So what we'll try to do with a pretty excellent panel as I'm sure you agree um is is talk a bit about you know

shared compute and data initiatives uh that hopefully give all nations access to AI resources. We look a bit at um how to uplevel uh the playing field for smaller and developing nations. Um, and

we'll talk about collaboration in key sectors like healthcare and education uh and climate resilience. I've got a perfect panel to do that with. I'm going to introduce them all uh first and then

um we'll we'll dive straight into the conversation. Uh so unfortunately Nina Singh from Credoi couldn't be with us this morning. She's got a meeting with the president so she's excused. Um um

but uh we do have um uh well I'll start with just next to me here uh Isabella Wilkinson who's a research fellow uh on the digital society program with the Chattam House. Uh next to her is Rafik

Ricoran. I hope I've sp I've pronounced that vaguely. Okay. Uh who is the chief technology officer for Modzilla. Uh next to him we've got Raja Nambia who is the president of NASCOM our sister

association here in um India and uh last but not least we've got Hak Shiraas Shiraasava &gt;&gt; managed uh who's global AI and public policy and regulatory affairs at um uh

Kohir uh and for those of you who don't know me I'm Sabina Chofu. I'm international policy and strategy lead at tech UK. So we are the sister association of NASCOM but back in the

UK. So um without further ado we will start with setting a bit of a global context and who better to do that than Isabella. Um so from a from a kind of geopolitical

perspective how realistic I guess is is alignment on AI governance uh across countries with fair to say very different strategic interests right now? uh and where do you

see maybe you know multilateral institutions I know multilateralism is not a very popular uh theme these days but where do you see multilateral institutions or maybe a international

players playing a role in in this space so over to you &gt;&gt; thank you Sabina thanks to my fellow speakers it's great to be here today really keeping the energy up on the

final day of the summit we can all do it um let me answer your question directly and then perhaps elaborate a little bit more in detail Global consensus on how to govern AI is

a no-go. It is not going to happen in this geopolitical environment. However, partial alignment on priority issue areas is possible and it's pragmatic to throw our weight behind these smaller

gatherings that we can then scale using the multilateral format. Now, let's take a second to sketch out the state of play. And I know that we have some great experts in the room on the panel. So, I

won't spend too long doing this. We have been absolutely covered in really optimistic summit rhetoric, walking into Barat Mandapam, going to side events over the course of

this week. But despite the optimism outside of these walls in the background, the US China AI race continues to accelerate to the eenth degree. The capabilities of advanced and

the most frontier AI systems and models, the little we know about their capabilities, mind with huge gaps in transparency, continue to advance. And global scientists only recently have

issued warnings about the state of the science and the intense uncertainty surrounding these capabilities and the impact they might be having on our communities and societies. Well, it's a

good thing we have strong international institutions and shared values. We don't, you know, it's a really difficult time for global cooperation outside of AI. You know, we're seeing, I would

argue, since the Second World War, an unprecedented degradation of the international organizations, the shared values, the rule of law that we have all held so dearly. So, suffice to say, it's

a difficult time for global governance. It's difficult time for the global governance of AI. Now, institutions in the past have very much been brokers, mediators, and scalers of consensus on

tricky governance issues. And some of the governance problems we're facing today are pretty old, right? I mean, I've encountered them in previous roles at Chattam House and other areas of

tech. I'm sure the experts on our panel have come across them. And the core governance puzzle that we need to figure out is this. taking into account the state of

geopolitics, the uncertainty around the state of the science, the market dynamics mediated by these leading labs and you know intensely intensely competitive US and Chinese AR race

dynamics. How on earth do we bring rivals and competitors around the same table? How do we bring states with a nominal or a minimal alignment of interests and incentives into the same

room? Now, you started by asking me about multilateralism and institutions, but maybe let's reframe this and talk about coalitions. In other areas of governance, what we've

seen is intense coalition building in crisis or unstable settings around a trusted mechanism, a trusted approach, perhaps in the absence of shared values and principles. And what I'm really

interested in in the context of AI is where coalition building can develop trust around a credible governance approach, adopt a state champion, get support from associations, from

builders, from leading labs themselves, and then scale it using the multilateral format. And over the past few days, I've been really excited by some of this splintering to scale dynamics that I've

seen maybe in conversations on verification, onchip hardware, risk mitigation strategies, even anonymized collection of usage data which came out of the commitments yesterday. Now,

what's the messaging that can drive this coalition building in the absence of trusted institutions, in the absence of shared values? I'll get into this later in my remarks, but I think it has to be

sovereignty and strategic autonomy. Resource constrained countries who might decide to adopt a common data governance approach who might decide to pull resources like compute have to also

consider a degree of governance alignment again at this lowhanging fruit in order to not only withstand the dynamics of the AI race but to ensure that the collective benefits of

cooperation and governance alignment massively outweigh anything they could do individually. So, I think I'll leave it there. Slightly pessimistic take. Let's see if there's some more optimism

on the rest of the panel. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much, Bella. Uh, I don't think it was that pessimistic. You did you did you did kind of I think you you made it sound very pragmatic in terms of

look the world is not what we want it to be and there isn't the level of multilateral cooperation that we maybe used to have. But you have talked about coalition building and um you know it's

probably the best we can hope for in um in in the world as it is as opposed to the world as we'd like it right now. And Reesh can I turn to you next um uh for emerging economy obviously access to

compute data and infrastructure are critical but what do you see some of the maybe the barriers um uh most pressing uh where but also maybe opportunities uh to for AI adoption uh in India and

beyond. So over to you. &gt;&gt; First of all, thank you for for having me in the panel. Uh pleased to be with with all of you and then those a few of you who showed up here as well for thank

you for coming up. Uh we wish this was the sort of the Modi inauguration last evening where where we had a little bit more than this crowd but nevertheless we'll we'll do with this. uh but you

know uh I I believe um you know we used to talk about digital divide for a long period of time and I think uh while that had uh its own uh puts and takes when you compare a smaller economy and

smaller country with the larger ones and so on I think the AI divide is going to be much much bigger than the digital divide which we saw because uh you know the the biggest difference is that at

least that uh in the the digital divide it's about you know access uh and so on whereas this is all about agency and and it can completely put you uh at a different back foot. So it is such an

important topic to talk about when you talk about the broader um you know halves and have nots and and what really goes on with the with the with the larger um smaller economies and so on.

uh and I truly believe that uh the accessibility uh when you look at the the broader scales it'll come across multiple things starting with compute one of the uh the

largest uh uh u you know uh piece of what uh you know we are talking about here right I think um as you I think you mentioned in terms of the race between the US and and China and so on so forth

but if you leave those two countries then of course we have a big uh drop in terms of where the where the real access is going And I believe to totally that um you know the the continued limited

access to the to the um uh the broader compute facility uh um is is going to be um unduly uh putting some of these smaller countries especially the developing ones into a little bit of a

disadvantage. So um I think there's a lot that can be done around it uh in terms of saying you know what is that u you know countries can potentially do in terms of pooling and so on. But I think

there is there is certainly um uh an issue when it comes to compute and uh uh you know and not just in terms of um uh accessibility but also in terms of expense and so on because at the at the

end of the day all of these are uh even if you use the purchasing power parity and then and sort of look at what it costs for people to sort of get into the kind of level of GPUs potentially or GPU

clusters one has to produce u to even have a meaningful uh language model and So one I think that's going to be a very uh very different ballgame and the second element of this whole broader uh

issue that we're talking about is also the data and then the organization of data availability of data quality of data and so on. I think the more you get into the developed world, you will find

a developing world, you'll find that the uh the data itself is very siloed in in many ways. There are, you know, different state silos, different uh department silos and so on. And it gets

into a point where uh the data uh which is such an important and integral part of everything to do with AI. uh you'll end up having uh um uh the the data which gets fed into the broader models

and eventually the AI systems will um necessarily not have the right representation of that population which is a huge concern. I mean especially when you um you know of course India is

slightly luckier in in many ways in terms of us you know playing that game a little bit you know punching a little bit above our weight in some sense but uh but when you when you go down on the

on the on the list of countries which uh do not have access to all of these I think you're going to find it even even harder in terms of solving the data issue and the data availability data

quality all of this becomes a bigger issue and there when we talked about infrastructure gap compute gap it's a little more than just the pure compute itself, GPUs and so on. But it's also

about connectivity, power, uh these are the issues which uh you know we some somehow take it for granted in other uh segments but I think you will find that power is going to be a huge uh

foundation for all of that and as you know that there are multiple layers in in building any of the AI systems and one of the u bottommost layer is going to be power uh and then uh you know what

really happens to the power and if it has to be clean power then you know does it put additional tax on the on the developing world for for making sure that that power comes out clean.

Connectivity is a huge issue even though it's kind of broadly solved in in some sense with all the um satellite options and so on. But we continue to have the kind of connectivity you need to run a a

a truly um inclusive AI system is going to be very different from those uh you know people who have thought otherwise. Um and then of course we can go on and on in terms of the the other layers of

you know skills will become a a huge issue. um the availability of skills and ensuring that you have the right skills not just to leverage AI but also to build AI. I mean there are two different

type of capabilities that you need to produce in any uh any country. So, so these are the the issues and you know how do you make sure that you have a broader um uh the opportunity itself

would be to sort of look at this and say are there other ways of collaborating other ways of partnering and so on because you know these uh especially when you go down the line list of

countries we have you know close to 200 countries or so in the world and and when you leave the top five or 10 and then you go below and then you keep going down the list it becomes harder I

don't think that everybody's going to be producing uh uh a full-blown uh large language model and and know things that they needed to sort of do it for themselves. And at that point in time,

it'll the question will be can you really partner? Can you really leverage some of the common uh systems that can be done across these countries and so on.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. I mean, you have done you've done a brilliant job at putting all the free problems we've got [laughter] uh and then saying you've got a long list afterwards uh in terms of in terms

of cooperation. But I love the touch of um touch of optimism there at the end. It's like you know if you leave if you leave two countries out of the room you still have 17und and whatever 85 that

need to figure it out. So um uh I like I I I liked a lot that framing and thanks for touching on the infrastructure. You know I think we tend to talk a lot about data and and semiconductors and all the

all the cool stuff and we forget about like the tissue that actually holds it all together. So um uh really really great contribution and talking about data access and uh um uh access to

compute I'm going to talk to I'm going to turn to Rafi um because uh you know and I'm hoping you're coming in with a hope [laughter] after the doom and gloom of not

multilateral cooperation. Uh so from a technical and open ecosystem perspective, how does um access to compute and the high quality data that Rodish was talking about um uh shape who

gets to build AI? Uh and what design choices or collaborative models could help lower barriers um obviously without compromising trust and security that uh makes this technology work to start

with. So uh over to you. I mean unsurprisingly being someone from Mozilla I'll probably go with the open source angle as the as one of the opportunities to actually align and

align the talent align the capabilities and actually do shared infrastructure. I mean maybe I'll draw two analogies to think about and then we can go more deep into those as it applies to AI but for

all practical purposes every computer on the planet runs Linux. Um you know there are a few iPhones here and there on top of it. Um but but uh the Linux the Linux model I think is a good one for all of

us to think about that like every every country every nation in the world almost every company in the world contributes to this single codebase which is then deployed across these billions of

computing devices across the planet. Um and then there are lots of derivative work that happens from it. So like a company like Google can then take that and be make it into Android. A company

like a vending machine company can deploy Linux onto a Raspberry Pi and run inside their vending machine. So I think there's an analogy here of being able to use shared infrastructure, shared

software infrastructure as a collaboration mechanism that we can all pull resources together but still have sovereignty on top of it. So we can still all be contributing to this common

core but then fine-tune our way to our own particular implementations. And I think that if we take that and then marry it with a web analogy of, you know, in the in the early '9s of the of

the original web, you know, you needed to ask for permission in order to deploy a website. And and by permission, I mean effectively you had to go buy yourself a Solaris box, you had to buy yourself a

Windows NT server, you're trying to configure an ActiveX scenario. And what what the beauty of what Mozilla and Firefox did um we're not the only ones who did it, but the beauty of what they

did there is they forced openness throughout the stack that enabled anyone without permission to build whatever they wanted. And I think we need to find a similar moment. So like in that world,

we went from the Windows NT stack and and all of IIS to the LAMP stack. And the LAMP stack has this gorgeous analogies of just like anyone can build on Linux. When Facebook needed PHP to

move faster, they did massive improvements on PHP which then trickle down to all of us. So people can contribute in different ways across it. That's not the world we're currently

living on in AI. We're living in this world where there are a few frontier model companies um that are effectively doing governance for all of us um in some way, shape or form. And I and I

agree with my colleague that that's an untenable situation. like um I I do live in San Francisco, but you don't want four people in San Francisco making government's decisions for the entire

world. That that doesn't that doesn't make a lot of sense. Um, so I do think if we can find the LAMPstack equivalent model for AI, and this is actually what I've I've turned all of Mozilla towards

of like how do we define open standards, how do we define open interfaces so that the vibrancy of the open source community can come together and actually build solutions that work for every

single person, every single community, every single government on the planet. you can sort of build upon you can contribute to the common base but then build upon it and take it in a way that

makes it more aligned with your country's values or your company's values or your individual values and you can fine-tune fine-tune your solution out of that. So I think there is an

analogy here around how open-source could actually provide digital sovereignty across all the different levels. Give us agency as a person, give opportunist opportunities for

flexibility at the corporation level and then give countries the ability to own their version of the stack. Um that could actually be quite beautiful if we can actually figure out how to do that

in in an appropriate way. &gt;&gt; So I tried to give you a dose of optimism. you have given me a dose of optimism, but I'm absolutely shocked you talked about open source. Uh, [laughter]

thanks so much, Rafie. And I did appreciate you brought up the standards because I'm going to talk to Halak and we're going to go a bit into into collaboration and and standards here. So

obviously with the myriad of AI governance frameworks I'm guessing I'm I'm going to turn to you on the question of where do you see potential for alignment on on standards maybe in some

interoperability some maybe risk management framework. So um you know uh keep keep us on the on the hopeful path please. &gt;&gt; I am here to provide the hopeful

perspective. Um let me start out by saying that I lead global public policy at Coher. Coher is a Canadian AI developer. Um we build models and we have Agentic AI. Our solution is called

North. Um so in my role I look across the global regulatory framework. That means if our startup wants to um you know do business in a certain country, I I try to understand the regulatory

landscape of that country and then I advise our company if it's favorable or not. when we're talking about governance um and frameworks that are existing I um my perspective is I think it's it's not

there yet but I have a more promising view of it I think that in in certain principles we are converging um to where we need to go and there are strong opportunities technical standards is one

of them you know there are frameworks like NIST and ISO frameworks for startups these are key the reason they're key is because they're flexible and they're evolving

if if we just go country by country, what that's going to do is price out um smaller companies, but if we have an international framework that is evolving and flexible and you know also including

industry coalition uh which a lot of the model developers are a part of um but also like other other stakeholders can be a part of as well. I think it really helps. Um the thing the second thing I

would say is around um shared practices around risk mitigation. So I think there's strong opportunity there as we come together and share documents or um you know uh evaluations around misuse or

model capabilities or impact of models. I think you know like I said we have a we have a way to go but we are we are moving closer to that. Um and then the third thing I would say is um

interoperability of shared resources. This is key key. We have a big ecosystem. So yes, there is big tech involved, but there are smaller players and every single day there's new

startups that are wanting um wanting to emerge and wanting to have a go-to market strategy. And the only way this is possible is if industry and um all of industry big and small the whole

ecosystem starts sharing documentation around you know red teaming or eval uh multilingual benchmarks and things like that to come to some sort of consensus. &gt;&gt; Uh thanks so much. I'm uh I'm really

enjoying this uh positive vibe we're going with. Um and uh and you know that combination I think it kind of links really nicely back to what Bella was saying uh around coalitions

uh you know build on themes right it's like where do we think we have common ground and what we think we can build on so um so I really really enjoyed that contribution uh Rajes can I turn to you

um uh next um because I did wonder what all this stuff means for you know in in kind of smaller and developing um economies And maybe if if you have any examples of of shared standards, pulled

resources, any of the stuff that uh that um that um Hak was talking about public private models uh or anything that you've seen that looks promising that looks um like it could deliver um

&gt;&gt; you know um as we said you know when the moment you look at uh shared um uh models um you know when you when you Yes, there are multiple reasons why you know we

want to do this and one of course as we've talked about uh the cost involved in sort of doing some of that I think that's itself is becoming cost prohibitive and hence uh the you know

the there may not be even an option uh for for many of the countries but to sort of have this shade model. Um we also find that in the uh in the regional compute consortiums that you know folks

can potentially create uh and you often see uh um examples of where um for example a standard data set and stuff like that being shared by not just by you know even within a country it could

be between government uh academia and then industry sort of sharing the same uh set of uh data set. So making sure that there is a there is uh they're able to leverage that in some sense. Um

comput is clearly uh something which uh continues to be the uh you know be shared uh resources in in many of the even in India for example you know um our our own AI mission has created this

cluster where it can be broadly leveraged by both the industry academia and the government in terms of ensuring that they're able to get access to the the right set of GPU uh um set of GPU

GPU farms and ensuring that they're able to use that uh and then and take it forward. So, so public private sharing of data um certainly the compute consortium um and then cloud credits I

think that's something which uh um uh sovereigns have been able to work with the hyperscalers especially in terms of getting a lot of you know uh cloud credits for the GPUs especially right

because uh which is needed for for even if you it's not about building a frontier model but it's even to leverage the frontier model build some reasoning models on top of it and ensuring that

you're able to build an application which is meaningful uh not that every time you need a a powerful GPU but there are occasions where you you definitely would need and

and hence you know using some of those cloud credits will become a a big um big need um and then of course when you switch to regulations um and so on and and ensuring that how do you make sure

that uh even having a policy it's something which is shared across uh you know you don't want to reinvent the wheel every single time so do you have a a method by which you could leverage the

existing uh you know look at what is what is out there in the world and then sort of leverage it and then try to reuse it because uh what you don't want is to have this um u 100 versions of the

of the same thing with with a few nuances here and there. So that's something which I think companies will try and create a model as well. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. And I'm going to kind

of turn over to &gt;&gt; key question on the title. Can I can I be allowed title of the session? &gt;&gt; So it says right sizing governance in an

AIdriven world. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You know I thought we'll be looking forward to a truth, transparency and accountabilitydriven world.

&gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It takes 30 years for epste files to come out in a place like America the developed world. Is that the speed of the system till it collapses and till we

start a new renewal? Are we resigned to that fate? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Uh uh yeah. Oh uh I can't really see the link between the Epson files and uh this kind.

&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know to the truth to come out so the system speak. &gt;&gt; It's terrible. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Sure. Thank you. Um so on uh just

to kind of build on what Rajes was saying there on um on kind of also the capability. So maybe if we move into a bit of like crossber cooperation and uh Bella if I can if I can maybe turn to

you uh just to to to build on those points because obviously what we are seeing kind of across the developing world in particular you know often it's kind of the institutional capacity

that's that's a bit of a that's a bit of an issue there uh so even if you're kind of doing all the engagement and all the you know investments and all the you know you kind of still run into what are

some of the and I saw you were taking notes uh furiously so I'm sure you have reflections on what has been said so far, but also what are some of the the resources that you've seen that actually

work for for local governance? So, uh yeah, if you can pick on that and you feel free to reflect because I saw you've got u many points. You &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. Yes. Uh my hand is

aching from taking about a page of notes from the fantastic insights from my my co-panelists. And I think the key thing that I've taken from them so far is something at Chadam House we call

negotiating dependencies and I'll get into what that means slightly in the context of building strong robust public institutions. Now, the issue of institutional capacity both at a

national level and a regional level is something that's come up time and time again, not only in the run-up to the summit, but in some of the side events we've been involved in in the summit.

You know, Chattam House a few days ago convened a dialogue on how to integrate AI into digital public infrastructure optionality for global majority countries to do so with a view to say

improving the delivery of crucial public services or building shared prosperity or strategic autonomy. And something that came up in that conversation in in our broader thinking about this

connection between strong institutions, autonomy over tech and dependence was the need to take a step back, look at the entirety of the stack as Reesh really, really rightly pointed out and

think where can we demand autonomy and meaningfully build it and where are we going to have to accept dependence on foreign hyperscalers, the US or China. And so what our work has led us to in

thinking about how to I suppose unlock autonomy in the interest of building strong robust institutions is the need for countries, decision makers, those building the inst institutions to take a

step back and figure out which dependencies are acceptable and where are they going to fight for autonomy. So our work has led us to building blocks which have come up again again with uh

my fantastic co-panelist insights on the primary level. So these are core inputs into something like technological sovereignty in the interest of building a strong institution. How much is a

country willing to give up when it comes to data? How much is the country willing to give up when it comes to compute access? And so by mapping out where existing dependencies lie, where

potential sacrifices can be made and where additional investment and focus needs to be again concentrated, countries can develop a more robust strategy again in the interest of

building strong institutions. I'm not going to sketch out what these different pathways mean, but instead I'm going to focus on one which again has come up time and time again in our work

and specifically in the context of open-source as this pathway to sovereignty, open source as applied in strong public institutions in the run-up to the summit. And this pathway is

something we call diversification. So resource constrained powers who were seeking again to manage their dependencies, figure out what they want to invest in and what dependencies

they're willing to accept, wanting to build strong institutions again that can mainline AI directly into public service delivery and as you said enable crossber cooperation

might take a step back and figure out which foreign capabilities or foreign services they're willing to accept. at some levels of the stack and where they'd like to invest in indigenous

solutions. And I mentioned open source earlier because this has come up time and time again and I'm sure it's going to be absolutely no surprise to our audience here today. An example which

has really stuck with me and Rafia, I'd be really interested in your thoughts on this is the Southeast Asian languages under one network model. So, a multilingual sea lion LLM. And this is

something we've called again in a really interesting collaboration with AI Safety Asia, open models with local adaptation. Really balancing again inputs from open-source models potentially provided

by foreign providers with adaptation to a local context. And so I think leaving the summit, what I'm really going to be interested in is I think this connection between

drawing on I guess inputs from the open source community, fine-tuning and locally adapting their contributions and then perhaps doing so not only in the service of again strong robust

institutions at the national level who are AI ready but also on this kind of collective crossber level. I hope that makes sense. It does and I'm going to let Rafie kind

of uh fit into that as well because you've uh you've seged really nicely into into his uh part but also um if you can also touch upon feel free to react to what uh Bella has said but also if

you can also touch upon on on the what you've seen as best practice in international and crossber collaboration maybe in healthcare climate resilience education anywhere you've seen uh good

stories to tell please do share &gt;&gt; I mean I do think a lot about the local fine-tuning and I think that that's actually a really powerful concept of like we can all contribute to a core and

then locally fine-tune for our values and our needs and I think that this has shown up in a bunch of different ways and I'm interested personally in all these alternative I don't even want to

call it alternative but like other architectures that enable this to be possible because in some ways we're kind of being being fed a regime that says it's not possible but I think like

architecturally it actually is in a bunch of different ways. So I love the indigenous data model like looking at what different indigenous peoples have done around data collectives for their

local areas. So there's a group of people for example in Hawaii that is doing this for their genomic data because genomic data is really useful for pharmaceutical models and so like

they've been looking for ways so that they can both monetize but also have the providence of their data as it goes through these these pharmaceutical models. So there are some professors out

of UCSD starting to build actually what these data trusts could look like for Hawaiian people and I think that that model could be replicated in lots of different parts of the world. Mozilla is

actually attempting to do a bunch of this. So we're creating something that we call the Mozilla data collaborative or collective sorry and what the collective is meant to be is it meant to

be a marketplace of ethically sourced but provenence traced data sets so that you could bring your data we'll actually help you scrub it clean it etc. and also make sure you have the appropriate

licenses on it so that people can come find the data sets that they want to train their models but make sure that attribution is given, compensation is given, etc. So, we're literally in

conversations with almost every radio station on the planet to try to get their recordings and their transcripts onto the marketplace. Not for Mozilla to make money. In fact, we actually want

the radio stations to have a monetization path for all this data that they're sitting on and not simply have it scraped by big model providers to try to soak that into their systems.

Instead, require that it be licensed, require that compensation be given. So, I think there are models there. And on the computational side, I think there's also a lot of interesting things showing

up around federated learning opportunities. For for those of you who don't know what federated learning is, think of, you know, Google did this very famously when they trained their

handwriting model across everyone's Android phones. So your handwriting is very personal and private. Your handwriting is on your device. And Google is able to train a handwriting

recognition model that didn't require them to get access to your data because part of the training happened on your phone and then the model weights are shipped back up for centralized

training. And I think something like that actually could be an interesting model for for international collaboration of like I can bring my data to the game, my healthcare data, my

values data, my language data, but not have to release it to a different company or sorry, a different country. instead allow you to do some of the training on my compute on my

infrastructure and only ship model weights back up and I actually then create bigger bigger models across across borders and across geographies that could actually take into account

different healthcare scenarios different um different value systems etc in there you know so I think that there are these interesting alternative architectures that we can actually start leaning into

that these data trust models these federated learning models that actually could be massive enablers for cooperation and allow us to build these foundational things that we can then

fine-tune and bring to our local context. &gt;&gt; Thanks so much, Rafie. that fine-tuning seems to be definitely a thing in this this conversation how you kind of built

for um different cultures and countries and um um Hak maybe I can come to you uh next because um we keep talking about kind of international cooperation and coordination but I'm wondering how do

you translate that you know chithat into actual skills capacity cap capability for emerging economies Um and you know I mean we are in a very international AI impact summit. Um so you know kind of

how do we bring that from we talk about governance to all this international policy actually delivering for emerging economies. &gt;&gt; It's a good question. Um I think let me

start out by saying um capacity building isn't just you know running workshops or um or or basically talking to regulators about you know this should be done. What it is is capacity building I think for

emerging economies especially uh is critical because um hold on let me think. Okay. So, emerging economies have unequal access to data, information, um, and technology, right?

So, what are we trying to solve for here in terms of capacity building? The first thing I would say is, um, shared evidence. So, what we need is we need players to help into this capacity

building system with documents, um, results, performance, benchmarks to lift up other players. That I think would be number one. The second thing I think is key and sometimes overlooked is um the

value of like procurement policies and I agree with Isabella. What if we had like an industry coalition like a crossber network where they're solving for procurement policies or procurement

rules and what this does is this brings in global players. So now what you're doing is you're opening up your country to different markets. Um the next thing I would say is like you know a lot of

let me put it this way. So there are developers who develop the technology and then there are deployers they buy the technology and they use it. So for example like a public sector agency why

is it Um uh whatever whatever you think is is is needed to to kind of get to that point where we can actually talk about governance meaningfully

uh and as a broad international inclusive as possible. I might actually start making a lot of sense and that aligned with governance opportunities, philosophical

opportunities makes makes me very excited like MIT there's a economist Frank Nagel has a report recently that approximately 24 billion US dollars are being wasted by not switching to open

source models right now. So the economics are starting to make a lot of sense. So I think if once all these starts align it becomes almost obvious what an answer could look like for local

governance around open-source AI models etc. So I'm really excited for that in the next 12 to 18 months. &gt;&gt; Thank you Rajes. &gt;&gt; No I agree with both of what what's been

said so far but I also want to uh give a a sense of I think it's uh when you look at AI governance and people tend to sort of lead with regulatory regulation first. I I believe that um countries in

especially uh the the the uh sort of the the countries which we talked about in terms of more from an inclusion point of view, you got to lead with innovation first mindset because I think regulation

is is is required and certainly needed but I think innovation is probably needed more in some sense and also when you look at the AI governance across all of that what we do while there could be

horizontal governance which will apply to every AI systems I think the more meaningful governance that you're going to find when you get into sectoral governance meaning when you look at the

the AI systems for healthare and you'll find there are the the understanding of a harm in in the healthcare segment is very different from financial services and so on. So how do you get into those

sectoral uh areas and then you can have meaningful governance structure and last but not the least you need to have the right talent and people who can actually who understand all of this in both in

public sector and people who are supposedly governing all of this. uh that is something which is it it's not the talent in terms of broader AI model building and people who are building AI

systems but how do you make sure that the talent in the governance space in the governments and people who are actually regulating it they don't understand the the real harm and then

it's going to be a bigger issue and especially when it comes to the uh you know the list of countries that we talked about always when you get deeper down the list you'll find that uh the

talent is going to be a huge issue in terms of understanding them &gt;&gt; thank you and uh you know as someone who lives in Brussels. I'll make sure to take that message back. Uh Hak.

&gt;&gt; Um okay. So what am I most excited about I guess in the next 12 months? Um I mean in the last few days you've seen companies really really excited about AI but what you've also seen is countries

very excited about AI. So what does this mean in governance? It means that the community and the participation is only going to increase. I don't see it going backwards. And so as technology is

evolving more players are going to have a voice in the system and um the standards and the ITU bodies or the ISO bodies. And I think because of this convergence we are going to as society

um just like increase our uh like literacy of not only AI but technology but also bring it into whatever we're in if we're in the private sector, if we're in the public sector. Um and because of

that I think um yeah I think a lot of progress will be made in the next 12 months and you'll see it as it converges. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. Thanks for the panel.

Thanks for being here and enjoy the rest of your day. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. [applause] [laughter] &gt;&gt; Great to see you.

&gt;&gt; Thank you for coming. something from the panel is really great.
