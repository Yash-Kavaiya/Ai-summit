## 📝 Transcript

show a video which will give you context of what the informal sector is. Uh what are some of the interventions that can be taken before I call the esteemed panel to have a discussion on the topic.

India a nation where 490 million people form its backbone. Who are they? They are the building blocks of our country. Our carpenters, plumbers, electricians, farmers and many more. The country's

informal work. Meet one of them, hair summer, a Delhi based carpenter. He furnishes comfort, shapes hair looms and impacts lives. Yet he and the rest of our informal workforce are living on the

fringes of India's AI revolution. Now imagine a future where AI and frontier technologies reach everyone. where Summer learns new skills through personalized AI paths, earns verifiable

digital credentials that prove his expertise and unlocks better jobs, fair loans and financial dignity. Imagine a future where AI helps India's informal workforce work smarter and safer. With

AI as a catalyst, India can leaprog systemic barriers and achieve transformative outcomes to empower India's informal workforce with frontier technologies.

Come be a part of this AI revolution for all. Let us build a vixit bhat together. So we are privileged to have a panel &gt;&gt; India. &gt;&gt; We are privileged to have a panel today

which represents industry, the development sector and the government. You know all of the ecosystem has to come together to solve for this problem. So may I now invite my first panelist uh

Miss Arunati Bachara, chairperson and CEO Salesforce India. She's the she's the recipient of the Padmushri India's fourth highest civilian award and has frequently been featured on

FOB's world's 100th most powerful women and fortune's world's 50 greatest leaders list. She's a strong advocate of responsible AI, inclusive technological adoption and public private

collaboration for national growth. She is instrumental in expanding India's digital economy uh while embedding ethics, governance and sustainability into technology ecosystems. Thank you

ma'am for joining us today. Representing the development sector, we have uh we have the pleasure of inviting Mr. Aditin Atraj, the CEO of Pyramal Foundation. He's a prominent education reform leader

and also the founder of Kyalia Education Foundation and the Pyramill School of Leadership. He's over 20 years of experience in the development sector including a significant tenure with

Ratam driving volunteer volunteer-led literacy campaigns in rural India. He's been recognized as an Ashoka fellow and echoing green fellow and Aspen India fellow. He's also the recipient of Times

now amazing Indian award in education. Thank you Adita for joining us. On the government side again I'm privileged to request Miss Manisha Varma additional chief secretary SEID

Maharashtra. She's a 1993 batch is officer who has contributed to drafting transformative regulations in India like the national food security act, the forest rights

act, the national food rights of persons with disabilities, right to education, magna and others. She's been felicitated by the honorable president, the honorable prime minister, Nitiog,

honorable governor and honorable chief minister for various initiatives and is also a recipient of Maharashtra Foundation award for outstanding public services. Thank you ma'am for joining

us. And to kick us off uh I'm delighted to welcome Rul Shetty uh CEO of Deoid South Asia to take the discussion forward. Thank you so much. Good afternoon uh ladies and gentlemen

and uh always a privilege to have a wonderful panel here. Um so maybe I'll I'll kick off uh first with you Arundati to start with uh as you know in our when we did our study obviously you and Adi

were significant contributors to that study uh we've seen that the informal workforce basically faces about five really systemic roadblocks. One is being discovered and trusted. Second is

getting some steady demand. Third is getting fair and timely payment uh and upskilling. That's sort of translates into higher productivity and of course accessing protections, insurance and

others. So how do you see these challenges playing out in the future and what or which of it must be prioritized in the next 12 to 18 months? So given the fact that ours is a very

populous nation, I don't think we have a way other than a digital way of addressing these solutions in the sense that you might have a worker uh say auh person who works as a plumber uh who

might be really really good at his job and there might be very good opportunities in his village or in the village next to his but he has no idea that it exists. So this lack of

knowledge is not something that you can manage to do away with unless you have some kind of a marketplace where people can put in not only their credentials and their experience but also be able to

access the opportunities that are there for their kinds of jobs. That's one piece. The second piece is that unless and until we put all of these people together, we would also not understand

what is the upskilling that is required for such people because more and more as days go by we are realizing that everything is changing. All of the technology is changing and the change in

technology is such that requires people to be further upskilled. Now how do you get that upskilling? How do you ensure that you have a verifiable certification that you have gone through that

upskilling? Again, you have got to come back to the digital area. Third is regarding getting payment on time as you said. This is something by the way which is a very big problem across India and

it does not only impact your uh the bluecollar workers it impacts even the MSMES andmemes and sadly enough uh I would say it is the big corporates that are the worst at this including the

government means I cannot not include the government over there because getting payments on time in India is something that is not considered to be at all important. It is one of the

things that you do last. You have to do it. So you do it at some point of time. And this is not something that speaks well for us as a country. It really adds to the difficulty in doing business

because you're not funding people the moment that they need to be funded in. And there has to be an accountability for all of this which unless if you you use a digital platform, there is no

footprint. there is no footprint about the delays that are taking place unless you put a digital uh platform to this. So I think you know in the report that we put out together and I think there

were other people especially your people deote people who did a lot of work on this who actually suggested a platform where all of these things could be comprehensively addressed. Now I was

just asking Romeil before coming in over here that India is great at putting out fantastic reports. at the end of the reports who is charged with the execution who is really accountable that

if it doesn't get executed there is a downside to it we have no such you know downsides we have suggestions we have reports and then we don't have a person who's charged with the execution I think

it's time for all of us to understand that reports are great suggestions are fantastic but there has to be an authority that will take charge of this will run with it and be accountable for

actually implementing it because there are some really really good suggestions over there that need to be implemented. &gt;&gt; Thank you Arunati and and you know why she was the SBI chairperson because

she's got a strong mind of her own and always u you know willing to challenge the status quo which I think in her own life as well as of course in the various positions that she's held. Thank you

Arundati. So Manisha a question to you now u and this is really about Maharashtra you know obviously u could you sort of share an overview of the work being undertaken by your department

for the benefit of all the delegates here and how is it working towards enhancing human capital and social inclusion &gt;&gt; so first of all thank you so much for

having me here I'm looking forward for a great dialogue with this esteemed panel panel members as well as all of you um I head the department of uh skills employment entrepreneurship and

innovation that is that is why it is written seed so it's not a very common kind of a department this is a newly constituted department in Maharashtra and uh to put it simply it is overseeing

the entire vocational education spectrum so there is a thousand plus institutes ITI government and private which are the cutting edge you know they are the cradle of creating skilled workforce for

the industries manufacturing and service sector but mainly the manufacturing and uh so all the ITI are under the department oversight but we are also looking at short-term skilling programs

through our Maharashtra state skilling society so all the government of India programs and the state budget resources for skilling then we have a state board of vocational education and training. So

if you are a private provider of skill training then the accredititation and recognition of the courses is done by our state board and affiliation is also given because today you know that there

is lot of duping of uh pe people ordinary people there is no information as to whether the courses which are given in the market are actually accredited or have a value. So this uh

body does the independent assessment of the training institutes and gives affiliation and recognition and then to complete this spectrum of because you know that the students from ITI or from

people who are doing vocational education they might have aspirations for higher education and independently also. So we recently constitute um you set up a public state skills university

ratantata state skills university in Maharashtra. So that is also doing pretty well now I mean in its infant stages and then we have a Maharashtra state innovation society which is under

my department which is looking at promotion of startups and incubators. So this is a whole spectrum of the work that we are doing but not to miss out the vulnerable groups for social

inclusion. We are also partnering with agencies to do skilling for jail inmates, prisoners in jail, uh people with disabilities, women, tribal areas and all. So that in brief is the work

that you are doing. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you Manisha. Uh Aditya, one of our core insights from our study was that uh productivity gaps often come from sort of inefficient workflows and

tooling deficit rather than any work effort. So as we look to increase productivity 10x for for to really realize Vixbarat aspirations, what guardrails do you think should be in

place so that technology augments workers, improves their safety and earnings and does not really replace them all together? Yeah. Uh, so thank you very much for

having me on this panel. It was great fun to be part of the committee at NITYog as well which put this together uh thanks to Deoid's efforts. I think when we're talking about this informal

labor force, we're all imagining this electrician who's coming to our house, right? And so we're imagining an upgrade of that. Uh we at the Pyramal Foundation are working with the bottom quartile of

India. Okay. Largely the top quartile is sitting in this room and driving the growth. The next quartile sort of supports that growth by being drivers, electricians, plumbers. The next

quartile is just about surviving. And the fourth quartile honestly first of all you have to tune into it to even understand uh how badly off there are. There are still as per official

statistics over 200 million people in India in poverty right. uh so the areas where we focus which are the five eastern states for example I mean so when you're talking about productivity

deficit just I'll give you a few statistics right because we're imagining this is a plumber who's coming into my house and how do I increase this thing but what about the women 50% of India's

women right and uh the states where we work with jar kanda sam chhattisguur bihar these states today the number is at 36% of women getting married below the age of 18. What is going to be my

productivity gap? I got married before the age of 18. My productivity is measured by how fast I produce the first child and the second child and all my energy is going into just taking care of

children. What is AI going to do for this girl who by the age of 20 has two children and at home, right? What is it going to do for the tribal who's still in the Dandakaria forest in South

Chhattisgarh? So that group of people has lower growth rate than the median of India as it is they were lower and they have lower growth rate. So really increasing productivity for that group I

think is going to be key because it's not about taking the top quartile to $29,000 right that is going to happen or it's going to happen because there are automatic mechanisms in place in the

market to uh to incentivize that productivity gain. The bottom quartile is not yet plugged into the market. Right? These are the 70 million people who are in poverty in these five states.

Uh out of them the statistic is not having 40% of those families don't have even one person who has had six years of education in the family. Six years we're not talking about 10 standard. So a lot

of our programs are designed on okay 10th standard. You're going to do it. You're going to do this thing. So this bottom quartile really needs I think productivity gains are going to come by

us understanding why the bottom quartile is not involved uh in the market and what do we need to do three times four times as hard so that they're not pulling the median of India down.

I mean and you know as as as consultants when you know we look at these reports and I can tell you from the the niti one was I think these kind of inputs because it's very easy sometimes just to be far

off and sort of uh give recommendation but when you realize the nitty-g gritties as well uh I think you realize that there have to be different solutions and I think this report was

where really different sets of people came together to contribute. Uh Arunati back to you in terms of you know we created this persona led you know the carpenter the you know the cultivator

and and we chose this because challenges differ right so cultivators face sort of volatility and information gaps artisan face sort of market access middleman dependence textile workers face skills

and technology gaps and trade workers of course face income insecurity migration of course pressures as well so how do we balance a centralized approach while ensuring each person's unique challenge

are solved more. &gt;&gt; So basically again you know there cannot be a cookie cutter solution to all of this uh because the persuasions are so different, the challenges are so

different. Uh you necessarily need to solve for people uh in different ways. There are certain fundamental issues that bother all of these whether it's a issue of access issue of health issue of

you know basic understanding and literacy these are all basic issues that need to get fixed at a very low level in the sense at a very early level in their lives. But if you are looking beyond

that and if you're looking at vertical wise the different kinds of people and the different ecosystems that they work for you necessarily will have to come up with different solutions and again here

I think this is where the stakeholder which is the ma major stakeholder which is the government the government has a role to play because it is the government that is going to enable the

ecosystem to help these people to grow for them to grow on their own like was being said by him. The upper quartile people can help themselves. The people who are absolutely at the lower quartile

they actually need help. And I remember one incident where you know we used to run this youth for India program in state bank of India where we had people taking a gap year coming and serving in

the villages. Now one such guy was serving in one of these villages of Dong tribals who work with uh bamboo and he discovered that the equipments that they were working the bamboo with were

basically stone age equipments literally stone age equipments. Now just by changing the nature of the equipments that they were working with and again nothing very fancy nothing with

technology or AI but just changing those equipments improved the quality of the product so much that it had a much better purchase in the market. So you know solutions may be something that's

very simple but it is something that has to be innovated there by actually getting knowledge of what really is holding them back. So I think again this is something that needs a lot of work

and it needs a lot of work by people at that place which again has to be partly the government and in fact the the platform that the committee recommended in some sense was to also help to

uberize to create demand to also build skills also so a simple as long as you have a simple phone you could actually use it. So I think that was actually done as well. So Manisha coming to the

sort of the startup ecosystem and you know and obviously Maharashtra has been doing phenomenally well in the startup ecosystem. So could you share how you are driving societal impact through this

startup ecosystem? &gt;&gt; I think honestly startup ecosystem is something that is organically grown and government should not be taken

too much credit. It's I I was just sharing with Arunati G with you before and we were entering that you know some things are on autopilot and government should just

catalyze or facilitate and not obstruct the growth. I think uh that is but nevertheless I would like to say that we have been trying from the government Maharashtra government side to

really uh kind of catalyze this ecosystem which is there in Maharashtra. You know Maharashtra has 35,000 nearly 35,000 uh startups currently registered by DPIT and it is the leading

state and some of the things that we have been doing actually is to create this pen get this culture penetrated across the state initially we saw that their startups were primarily centered

around Mumbai because of the ecosystem and Pune but today I'm Happy to share that every district in Maharashtra including Gioli has minimum of 25 startups registered. So can you imagine

that? So, so we've tried to do it through multiple ways like having hackathons, grand challenges, startup yatras, involving the college students and the rural areas as much creating

district level committees uh you know led by collector but having a entire ecosystem of stakeholders including principles, ITIs, uh the district industries officers, the MSME clusters

ers then we also give some support of financial because not all startups are capable of prototyping and then you know getting the quality testing done. So we do some reimbursement for IPR for

domestic patents or uh you know international patents. We are helping them to obtain quality testing and certification. But a very unique experiment that we

have done I think and which we can you know take uh genuine credit of is our very unique program called startup week. We invite startups uh from across the country. We get nearly close to 3,000

entries every year and they are shortlisted by an independent jury of domain experts VCs. and then we have their pitching done before second round of independent jury. Now these are not

startups we you know we are looking at startups and their technologies and innovations which have a large social impact. So just to give you an example the sectors are actually clean energy

mobility uh agriculture health education fintech these are the kind of sectors so I'm happy to share some examples like there was a startup and then we give them as awards direct work orders up to

25 lakhs in recently we have increased from 15 to 25 so otherwise startups are stuck for procurement policies of the they are not able to compete with the tender systems that are there. So we

give them a direct work orders as winning prize and then we connect them with the domain departments to rule out their innovations and that has been very helpful for our startups to gain

visibility and even g uh gain international you know markets and investors. So some of our startups have really grown up like this Saga defense now today it's called Saga defense we

started with their you know now today their technology has been upgraded for marine surveillance and Indian Navy has also placed orders and they have created a manufacturing plant near NASC we have

uh we have new dogs recently it was our winner from IITi and IIT and other people who have created a very beautiful um you know uh home diagnostic app uh on phone you can have more than 30 health

parameters at a very low cost. We have pad care which has done the entire thing of p menstrual hygiene management and disposal of sanitary pads in a in a um in a sustainable way. We did their

pilots in Mantra itself to do the you know see the proof of concept and give them the work order. So uh we have uh I think it is new motors. I remember very interesting for physically challenged

people that uh their uh their wheelchair converts into a battery operated two-heer when it uh for the disabled person. So I can cite lot of examples and I would say even in the areas of uh

agriculture and clean energy. So these are uh kind of some efforts that we have been doing and uh hopefully we'll take it to the next level with the help of such uh experts.

&gt;&gt; I think it's it's fantastic work and on a lighter note of course Manisha G we also struggle on the tender side &gt;&gt; so &gt;&gt; so maybe It's a skill in itself.

&gt;&gt; So Adita, I mean from your experiences, where do digital or sort of AIEL interventions for the informal force sort of break down and what what are some of the learnings from the past? So

like you said this bucketed into four categories as well. &gt;&gt; So we've done a lot of digitization work. uh in fact we've showcased it uh even at the expo and uh we work with the

government to uh digitize government health systems digitize government education systems agree water any space digitization normally adds value but here when we are talking about the

informal labor force I think we have to look we have to look at the mental model here uh when we're talking about white collar workers right like deote or a lawyer firm they got aggregated

more than 40 50 years ago Right? If you went back a 100 years ago, you had an individual chartered account, an individual lawyer, an individual banker or an individual consultant. Now you

have firms. Now, as soon as you've aggregated, you get lots of benefits because you get specialization and then you can reintegrate to offer a more complex service, right? Or you get more

uh skill capability growth for each person. You can get quality standards. The customer knows what he's buying, right? So in the white collar workforce this has already happened. In the blue

collar workforce on the other hand, tell me where you will go for quality of electrician, right? You'll land up asking your neighbors. Uh what about a carpenter?

Right? We've not yet organized the bluecollar workforce in a way in which the customer can choose quality predictably. Right? As an urban consumer, I will face more than 80

brands a day. Even my salt is branded. It's catch. You walk into a village today nothing is branded right. So the need to aggregate is very critical to improve quality of service

and this is what we tried with our farmer produce organizations in order they could improve. But if you see there are multiple models for this aggregation right you can have the fab India type

model right the fab indas and the uh type model where it's a private sector fab India high design highs helped the entire supply chain in leather fabia helped in the entire textile supply

chain right you can go in that private sector type model the second model is that you can actually go in the ammul and the sava model which the firm itself is owned by the farmers today when I buy

Amul milk 90% of what I pay goes back to the farmer, right? When you buy Nestle milk, it doesn't go back to the farmer. So when you buy SA, when you buy legit papa, 90% is going back to the last

person because it's organized as a cooperative. And the third is then you've got the urban clap model, right? Which is saying, okay, I will certify the person and he's got a 4.5 rating. So

therefore, you choose him. You choose this physiootherapist, you choose this carpenter, you choose this plumber. All these are aggregating in different ways and distributing incentives in

different ways. I think unless we think of but for the artisan who's 45 years old and doing a traditional kalam curry you're expecting that someone's going to come and choose this particular piece

without having branded that as a whole. I think actually his productivity is quite high. The problem is his realizations are not that high. Uh what he's able to realize from the market is

not as great as the actual craft. his actual understanding of where the design market is going in Paris or in New York or in Delhi is not as high in order to adapt his design and so the constraints

I think is about aggregation of these workers which is why I think the government's uh main program of NRLM the national rural livelihood mission and the SRLM which is of course very very

powerful in uh Maharashtra Bihar I think is extremely critical for aggregating workers at various levels in order that then you can improve quality, deploy technology, create incentives, create a

common expectation of quality because otherwise as a consumer I'm not going to be willing to pay unless I'm sure of a certain quality level. So I have the last question to each of

you uh so what I'll request is maybe just a minute or two uh quick one. So Aruti um as part of the study if you remember we met about 70 personas we met 70 we had 70 stories we had 70 different

aspirations uh but they all represent a 490 million workforce you know 90% of the country's workforce these are numbers you know I believe uh these are numbers but I

believe the stories matter actually more and as a reflection if you could share a a persona which stuck with you the most during our exercise. &gt;&gt; Well, one of the personas I think that

uh stuck with me quite a lot was uh the hospitality sector. Now, that's a sector that's doing really well across India and across the world and yet it's a sector where we really haven't done

anything very much especially uh for uh the segment that is below the tier one uh cities. uh whether you talk about uh the level of service, whether you talk about hygiene, whether you talk about

the way that uh India tells its stories, you know, and there are so many stories that India can tell because this is a civilization that is 5,000 years old and there are so many things that you can

showcase over here. You have nature, you have the mountains, you have the seas, you have culture, you have temples, you have old structures. Like you ask for it and it is there. And yet this is one

well. And it's very difficult to understand why people in countries with far far less are doing much much better. And this also is a very labor intensive sector. We talk about people not having

enough jobs and why not because this is a sector that can provide a lot of jobs. There are so many wonders in this country which we ourselves as Indians have not witnessed. Okay. And this I

think is something that the government needs to take take up on a really urgent footing because not everything is going to happen on the p from the private side. But of course, you know, the

private sector coming in over here in full force along with the government should actually uh mean a great deal to us because this is also not going to be uh something that is not going to give

us foreign exchange. It'll give us foreign exchange. It will give us uh enough amount of uh um of um employment and more than anything else I think you know it will showcase what India is all

about which I think is very important. So if you ask me that was one place that I thought you know we could do a separate study just on that to see whether we could do something more for

that particular segment &gt;&gt; and I can tell you she was as passionate then also when we I remember this discussion as well specifically but it is a fact that hospitality tourism

actually is a force multiplier because it also impacts so many industries right so uh Manisha in terms of industry partnerships so really when it comes to employment an important ally is industry

partnership. What special efforts are there to sort of deepen collaboration between industry and the government for societal impact? A quick &gt;&gt; Okay, be before I go to industry, I just

quickly wanted to respond because I remember I was few years ago tribal department secretary and we used to have a small fund called nucleus budget fund which was untied. We could do some

locally contextualized responses. So I do remember one of my department officers saying ma'am tribal areas homeay and uh beyond nasi there's bandara falls

and area and there is a fireflies there is a cluster of tribal villages which have got this fireflies before the monsoon sets it's a beautiful site I would ask some of you to explore if you

haven't uh and then he uh so I couldn't I funded that time's few home stays which was just a one lak rupee for villagers to make some extra room and furnish it with a you know iron

furniture one bed and mattress and something they couldn't even afford that because they were all small marginal farmers and I forgot about it and I did it out of the way because there was no

such scheme but I designed it for them because I trusted my officer that he'll use it well and then he said ma'am business and three years ago I had left the department few years ago and I

traveled to Bandar area to catch this fireflies and he said ma'am. So around from 11 at night till 2:00 in the morning I was looking at that tract of fireflies and then I visited that

village hamlet. She cooked that jar burri and everything and she was so happy to share with me the lady of the house Maharashtana

we are giving authentic Maharashtra food and lot of people come and stay in my room so one example I just got you know some warm remembrance and I'm sure there are so many efforts

that are happening But as Ma'am was saying, we have so much to do in terms of aggregation, a systematic kind of approach to to kind of tap the potential of tourism as well as our rich culture

and diversity that we have. Coming quickly to industry, uh we've created industry has a major role because we keep talking about industry aligned courses, matchmaking for the job seeker

and job provider. that it is our industries which are the job providers whether it is small scale industries MSMES or they are big u industry associations or service act sector. So

what we have done is actually to modernize curriculum of our u ITI we have started and we have created a PPP policy public private partnership in which we are ensuring that if a

industry-led anchor partner is there we will give our ITI management to the industry for 10 years or 20 years and we will give them freedom to design curriculum to have expert faculty and

even converge resources. This is something that Maharashtra did before. Recently, government of India has also announced PM Setu scheme which is akin to this this kind of concept of

developing ITI along with industry partnership. But on a regular basis also we are trying to tap industry expertise for OJT on the job training apprenticeship programs um you know

advising our uh institutions academic institutions um another good example I would just like to share because it's a recent one we have introduced short-term training

courses and opened the ITI to nonITI students in the evening for optimal utilization so in the evening ings and on uh we can have short-term skilling programs. We are looking for

partnerships. One good partnership with we have done is with Mahindra uh tractors in Gioli for tribal students again and uh we've done the first batch of certification in Mahindra tractors

technology and with 100% placement in geroli. So some things like uh these I can give you examples of industry partnerships. Thank you. Thank you Manisha. Um

&gt;&gt; but one line this is not enough. These are we really need industry to engage very deeply. There are structural kind of issues that we are really open to partnerships but I think industry needs

to come forward. &gt;&gt; Final question uh to you. Of course, the Pyramid Foundation has really deep experience in community-led development, the last mile governance and of course

behavioral change. In your view, what behavioral change levers are the most critical to sort of unlock adoption and also trust amongst the informal workers. &gt;&gt; Uh you're asking a question about which

we spend all our time on and I'm going to try and summarize it in two minutes. Uh let me give you an example of a very basic technology right. Uh government of India has a huge uh national

digitization program uh for healthare workers. There are over a million Asha workers in India who are the last mile delivery uh for all health services. And Asha worker still in many states has a

manual register uh in which she fills up the pregnancies. She has 54 different things to track. a separate register for pregnancies, separate register for TB, separate register for nutrition,

separate register for adolescent girls in most states that was not yet. Now, you would imagine, come on, that's like the easiest thing to automate, right? Because it's a tool. She goes to each

home, there's a geo tagging and then you have the database and then you fill up what's the latest problem. So, her surveys are more efficient. uh Bihar alone and we went into Bihar to

try to digitize this and Bihar alone has over a 100,000 Asha workers right and we thought uh because we had the technology the point is the technology adoption is a

separate skill from the technology right and when you think of technology adoption again we're thinking of the white collar person in this room when we saw the people who had to adopt this we

saw that they were in four categories Category one is people who are over 50, okay, and have never used any technology. She's not even used a dumb phone. Now suddenly you're asking her on

the smartphone to collect her wage. She's saying, okay, so we have to remember that there are people who are 50 to 75 and they're in the government workforce as a

workers, right? So there's a people who don't even have dumb phone. That's about a quartile. The second quartile is people who still have a dumb phone and not a smartphone. So they use it for

call, not even SMS. You use it for call and you use it for emergency. You're not using it for work. You're not used to how will you use it for work? When I

press here, what happens? Where does it go? How does that data come back here? Who's looking at it? These are all the questions going in their mind because so there is a huge fear of this

technology adoption. Then there's a third quartile which has smartphones but is not used to using it for business. Right? that is used for you know my son watches YouTube I have prime video all

those sort of things but using it for business my business means whatever work I'm doing you're not used to because and then the top one is typically younger people who are you know young asha

workers from 25 to 35 who have a smartphone who are going out who are also selling something on the side also running some side business they're really smart so the adoption depends on

the profile of the workers inside and how far they have adopted and typically design one-sizefits-all type programs and there's a group of people who already knew how to do it and there's a

group of people who's never going to do it and I think this is very critical to really imagine that there is not one India there are at least four Indas on any dimension and to first understand

that and then tailor our programs to that I think all adoption can happen. Yeah, thank you. I think this is I mean uh you can see the the the the wealth of experience, the the depth of knowledge

and the willingness to work you know you can clearly see from industry, from the development sector, from the government. So I think um sometimes we we feel a bit disheartened of you know but whenever we

hear stories and we see leaders like this you know that uh you know India's in good hands. So thank you everyone for such a wonderful panel. Uh thank you for your time. Thank you.
