## 📝 Transcript

Next session started. is being recorded and will be made available on our LinkedIn page OECD.ai. Today's discussion also builds on the work uh of the India AI impact summit

working group on economic growth and social good which was co-chared by India, the Netherlands and Indonesia as you'll see reflected on the panel and together with our distinguished

panelists we'll explore how artificial intelligence can support the transition towards food systems that are more transparent, responsible and inclusive.

So this session is bringing together leaders from government, industry, academia and international organizations to examine both opportunities and the practical challenges ahead from data

sharing and infrastructure to governance frameworks and the partnerships needed to ensure that AI benefits are broadly shared. And before we begin the panel discussion, it's my honor to invite his

excellency ambassador fare uh ambassador at large and special NY for AI uh of the kingdom of the Netherlands who will deliver welcome remarks. Welcome Ambassador.

&gt;&gt; Thank you Sarah. Is it working? Yeah. Thank you all for sharing this wonderful moment for me because we're here with men and admiral from Indonesia together

we formed chair and co-chair six working group on economic growth and social group in preparation for the for the summit and I just wanted to to say how much I was

impressed with you how you how you managed the working group and how the outcomes were were drafted delivered especially also delivered in the plenary not to say well done. [laughter] Really

great. But thank you very much. It was really wonderful journey with you. So ladies and gentlemen, um the use of digitalization and artificial intelligence in agriculture is

developing rapidly. It offers enormous opportunities to increase the product productivity and sustainability of local food production, improve nature conservation and to foster climate

resilience um in an inclusive and sustainable way. When this is when this when this it also contributes to the autonomy and stability of countries for the Netherlands, strengthening global

food security is a strategic priority. Reliable, sustainable and affordable food systems are essential for societal stability, economic development and particularly infernable region.

The ambitions in our digitalization agend agenda for agriculture, nature conservation and food are to connect digitalization to the transition of agriculture needed for more food

security, reduction of environmental impact and climate resilience via public and private investment. Our prim focus on increasing productivity with lower environmental impact and improving

climate adaptation, strengthening the resilience of food systems for responsible use of AI and digital economies technologies. Concerning today's topic, Dutch ambition

is to enhance food security by making food systems more resilient and sustainable for all stakeholders. In my vision, digitization and AI are powerful tools for that. They have

already proven that they can significantly increase food productivity and reduce food losses. In addition, AI solutions can enhance the efficiency and resilience of food systems by supporting

farmers to respond to sustainability requirements, make risk assessments, implement sustainable farming practices, and enable them to provide trustworthy and quality data sets about those

efforts to be shared throughout the supply chain. The Netherlands has a strong AI ecosystem thanks to our technical universities and companies like ASML,

NXP and Philips. Despite it relatively small size, the Netherlands is not only a huge trader in agricultural produce, but also a global key player in agro innovation

and technology development due to the interaction between plant and animal science and technological technological knowledge systems in the Netherlands. Companies, science, and government

invest mutually in solution to societal challenges. Examples include precision farming with AI, such as water savings of up to 90% through smart irrigation, optimal crop yields with minimal input,

and predictive models for disease control. To support digitalization in the agricultural sector in low and middle inome countries, the Netherlands

facilitates Dutch ICT agri businesses to collaborate with businesses and startups there. And as you are aware in the Netherlands, the strong ICT ecosystem and highly innovative agricultural

ecosystems come together. ICT agricultural solutions combine the indepth agricultural knowledge and advanced technology development in my country. Examples are applications for

early warning of pests and diseases, optimization of water use and optimized plant breeding processes. Dutch companies and knowledge institutions are open to co-work

tailor made solutions. Every country has its own typical local challenges and requires tailor made solutions. Today, special attention will be drawn to AI powered solutions for

small farmers andmemes in producing countries in order to enhance their access to global agricultural supply chains while protecting their data. Our goal is to work together on this

through knowledge sharing, co-creation, and capacity building so that AI solutions are locally relevant, inclusive, and accessible to farmers. The need for an inclusive AI

central to our discussions in the working room, economic growth and social group leading up summit. It fits well the summit people

and progress. So I would like to thank India for it leadership in focusing on an inclusive AI future and underline that the Netherlands stands ready to contribute

by forging concrete partnerships sharing knowledge and technology while striving for measurable results in order to ensure that AI serves all of humanity and I recall the honorable prime

minister's speech in Fenry to which he alluded as well. So ladies and gentlemen, we are honored to organize this important event together with OECD, the go to

organization when it comes to AI governance and to discuss the opportunities for international knowledge sharing and cooperation with FA the university in the Netherlands and

the distinct distinguished co-chairs of the working group on economic growth and social group India and we warmly thank India for hosting this summit and look forward to continuing

and strengthening our cooperation and field of AI and agriculture both bilaterally and within the global partnership area. We also thank our culture Indonesia for continued

cooperation and we would like to highlight our appreciation and firm support of Indonesia's ambition to join the OECD and its commitment to global standards and evidence-based policy

making. International knowledge sharing and cooperation is needed to accelerate the development and application of new technologies with the help of trustworthy AI. Having AI and

agricultural ecosystems on the agenda in this important AI summit is extremely valuable and a step forward in order to make a positive impact for all stakeholders. I wish you a fruitful

meeting and look forward to our conclusions and thank you for this opportunity. [applause] sort of stories now. Sarah,

&gt;&gt; thank you, Ambassador. Um, and on behalf of the OECD, I just want to thank once again the Netherlands for the leadership in convening this timely discussion. Um, and as was just reflected in the

ambassador's remarks, the Netherlands is obviously a pioneer in advancing food and agriculture innovation and we are so delighted to have them as co-chair as well of the OECD FAO advisory group on

responsible agricultural supply chains. From the OECD's perspective, we clearly see uh this uh dynamic of agriculture and food systems today operating in an increasingly volatile environment and

farmers face a wide variety uh of shocks from droughts, floods, pests to conflicts and economic crisis uh with growing frequency and severity. And so therefore strengthening resilience uh

while also ensuring inclusion as was also stressed by by ambassador Feder is really an urgent global priority that I hope we can talk about today. AI in this regard offers significant potential. Um

we're seeing AI systems and tools being applied to optimize the use of critical resources as was already mentioned such as water, fertilizer and pesticides. um and also to reduce environmental

pressure while enhancing productivity. The OECD and GPE which also met today in a ministerial session um have been examining AI use cases in agriculture with a focus on the EU and on Southeast

Asia and we continue uh these dialogues and um what we're seeing there is that the evidence from real world deployment is really really promising. So for example, AI enabled precision

spraying um has reduced pesticide use by up to 30%. Uh and this is actually without compromising yields while computer vision green on brown uh systems can cut herbicide use by up to

half by targeting only the the weeds uh that require the treatment and thus not uh the crops. Um, and in addition, we're seeing how forecasting, monitoring, and early detection of climatic and

biological threats um means that AI systems can strengthen our capacity to respond to crisis uh before they even escalate. So, so some degree of of preeemption.

AI is also revolutionizing uh agricultural innovation itself um and supporting more efficient plant breeding that can develop climate adaptive variety in a fraction of the of the

traditional time. And here we also have some interesting data seeing in central Europe uh that researchers have identified drought tolerant traits in crops such as sorghum and chickpea uh

that boost yields by up to 25% um during endeason droughts. And in Asia, meanwhile, we're also seeing global AI hybrid rice platform, demonstrating how AI can shorten

breeding cycles um by predicting optimal parent combinations and enhancing resilience in one of the world's most vital staple crops.

Beyond the farm gate, um AI is also reinforcing the resilience of our entire food supply chains and AI enabled traceability, market transparency, and smart logistics. uh can reduce losses,

improve compliance and strengthen food safety systems. Evidence from these digital traceability initiatives across the OECD members demonstrates a growing maturity of exactly these systems. So

something really to look out for um but technology alone as we know does not ensure impact. Um and so adoption uh is where we're really looking now and that remains uh quite uneven still. Uh and

this is obviously why we're all here uh in Delhi. So while we're seeing in Australia that 96% uh of farmers are using digital tools, the the same number for for Chile is just 12%.

And this is highlighting a digital divide u that could deepen existing inequalities if we don't uh look to address it. There's also important challenges in the use of AI and this

goes back to sort of the the core work of the OECD looking not just at the benefits but also the challenges associated with AI. Um, farmers and regulators need transparency and AI, how

AI systems make their decisions. Um, but at the same time, fragmented data governance frameworks introduce complexity to the use of AI tools that support the trade, traceability, and

resilient food supply chains across the border. And this highlights the need for greater interoperability uh, which is is is also a theme uh, at the summit. So structural barriers including high cost,

limited digital skills and lack of trust are some of the things that continue to slow the uptake of AI. So bridging these gaps uh which is should be a priority for all of us

requires investment in connectivity and other digital infrastructure in skills and affordable solutions. So small holders, women, farmers in remote areas who play a critical role um in enhancing

global food security, they're able to also benefit from AI's potential. And farmers must be able that their data uh is collected, shared, and used responsibly.

So in this area, the OECD is working uh to help countries put in place policies that promote these objectives through an AI policy toolkit. Um and it will pro this toolkit will provide practical

context specific guidance to countries. The toolkit builds on our policy navigator. If you haven't already visited it, it's on od.ai. Um and it so far covers uh more than

2,000 policies across 80 jurisdictions. So this is where you can find examples of national AI strategies, but also in specific sectors. Um and we continue to update this. And for anyone in this room

representing a country not represented, we encourage uh you to visit and and to also contribute your policies. Um we're also advancing work on digital governance and agriculture. Um this is

within GPE that I mentioned earlier uh a priority there. Um where we examine governance mo models across countries and their applications for responsible digital transformation more broadly.

We also see uh strong complimentarities with the global AI impact comments um which is a key deliverable of this summit and which shares concrete use cases of AI with known impact and

scaling potential. So for the OECD advancing trustworthy AI consistent with our OECD AI principles requires a strong enabling ecosystem alongside technological progress. And

what we're seeing is that if we succeed, we're really in a position to raise productivity sustainably and also strengthen resilience in agricultural supply chains, including by ensuring

that the benefits of innovation are widely shared and existing divides are not uh deepened in the process. So I really look forward to this panel's insights uh to help us take this

conversation forward looking at practical pathways to achieve uh to achieve this vision. And with this it's my pleasure to introduce our esteemed panel. Uh many have traveled far to be

here. Um so first I would like to um introduce professor Arin Sumari who's an Indonesian air force officer and professor at the state poly technic of Malang. Welcome. And also we have with

us uh next to uh professor we have Mr. Dean Jacob. He's chief information officer and director uh of of digital FAO and agroinformatics division at FAO of the United Nations based in Rome. We

also have with us today the pleasure of of having Debjani Gosh, Mr. Dejani Gosh, distinguished fellow uh and chief architect of NITI Frontier Tech Hub. And finally uh it's my pleasure to introduce

Dr. Aron Patihast, senior researcher at bargaining university environmental research. So welcome uh to to this session and what we will see today is each of our speakers bringing a unique

perspective on how AI can help build food systems uh that are resilient and inclusive which is the topic of the session and after the the the panel discussion I'll also be giving the floor

to uh anyone in the room who might have questions. So now let's begin. I'll hand the floor over to to Dan who will set the scene for the conversation.

Dan, you have the floor. &gt;&gt; Uh, thank you very much and u I would like to uh welcome everyone on behalf of the Food and Agriculture Organization. Uh, I thank you. Thank you to our hosts

here at the summit from India but also ECD and the government of the Netherlands. Ambassador, thank you. uh when we look at uh uh agri food uh I I heard in the interventions before uh

about the agriculture and the food uh we look at uh agri food systems from the FAO perspective why because the food itself as if we look at the agriculture food is one product but not only one so

there is a whole ecosystem behind agriculture uh of products that are not necessarily food uh and they are equally important when we make considerations when we look

at for example at the water use uh transport and and many others. So in from agri food systems perspective uh AI brings us uh fantastic opportunities and if we look at our uh topic today in in

terms of inclusiveness and resilience uh inclusiveness is is a still a big issue if we just think back uh maybe two three years uh before the let's say chpt came out uh the the inclusiveness and

the digital divide was still strong and present And the key issue is that it used to be possible to exist uh outside of the digital ecosystem. We all know we could

do maybe go to the bank or but nowadays it's not. So if if a farmer or communities are outside of the digital ecosystem, uh they suddenly are outside of any ecosystem almost. And uh now with

AI it makes it even worse. So this is something we need to continue to press on uh and jointly in in making sure that uh everybody has equal opportunity within the digital ecosystems

and on on on the positive let's say note on on the AI when it comes to inclusiveness we see very encouraging opportunities with AI what I mean by that is we can in fact lower the entry

barrier to knowledge uh just uh two days ago I I've seen in here actually at this this opportunity at the event. Um uh great advancements uh the new tool

that was uh produced by government of India where farmers can with a phone call as not everybody has a mobile uh smartphone uh can get advisory uh in the area of agriculture from uh shrimp

cultivation to pest diseases and similar. So this is great uh it can the the service can be in many languages. So this is a fantastic opportunity uh example where AI can help us actually

lower the entry point to the AI. In the same time for governments it's uh even uh more so difficult uh to have the to build uh to have the capacity uh to build the AI infrastructure uh to

provide such services. So this is again I think one area and and forums like this help us consider what it takes to build it. when we look at the resilience specifically uh I'm I'm I was very happy

to hear uh uh in the previous openings uh you mentioned resilience uh in terms of and and and from ambassador we heard an anticipation so I would say this is the key word the key word is

anticipation so anticipate the shocks to the agri food systems that impacts the food security we know we have natural disasters we know we have also uh conflicts we have many different factors

that impact agri food systems. So building the systems that are uh capable of absorbing the shocks uh of these situations and anticipatory

actions to when the shocks happen what can be done to to to kind of uh go over these shocks. So this is where AI uh can be a great enabler uh where we can then with new capabilities

uh anticipate these shocks and and and with the help of uh data and and our joint work really uh uh put together decision- making tools, anticipatory tools, situation rooms uh to u be able

to quickly uh not only anticipate but when something happens uh we don't really improvise but we have tools in hand to uh address these situations. We still have about 700 million people

without food on the table today. So from this perspective at FAO and and I'm sure we share the same sense of urgency to to to actually do something. So I I wanted to say from this perspective uh we are

very grateful to be part of this conversation and and work together in finding the new solutions. So I thank you for that and I'm looking forward to our panel. Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Thank you Dan for framing both the urgency and the opportunity before us. Um now let me turn to professor Sumari. Uh Indonesia served as co-chair of the summit working group on economic growth

and social good alongside India of course and the Netherlands. Um but you also lead the cognitive artificial intelligence research group and are the co co-inventor of the knowledge growing

system a cognitive artificial intelligence framework designed to enable adaptive and evolving decision- making. So from Indonesia's vantage point, we'd be interested to hear where

you see the most significant AI capability gaps across the agricultural system and where you see the greatest opportunities at the same time for AI to make food supply chains more efficient

and resilient. Uh something we also heard as a priority. Um and we also know that Indonesia is one of the countries advancing an ambitious AI agenda. So if you could briefly outline also the key

pillars of Indonesia's AI roadmap. this is of interest and to explain how you are balancing horizontal AI governance with more sector specific regulation in agriculture. Over to you thank you.

&gt;&gt; Thank you S. Uh firstly I would like to deliver my appreciation and congratulation to the host India and also my chair miss also my uh my dear colleagues from uh

Netherland ambassador har for co-chairing our working group together and also other speakers and Sarah thank you and all audience um regarding your question about the

artificial intelligent uh for Indonesia As we already know together that Indonesia is not only the agriculture but also maritime nation. we uh we were self-sufficient in uh in

uh rice about 20 30 years ago and then uh it wasn't uh AI for uh making our country uh had self-sufficient in uh in rice but not with AI this something that uh that can

um make our program to be uh to become become a self-sufficient uh country and rise can be achieved. And uh we are much aware that the ideology is developing very very fast not only in

uh uh in America or in Europe but also in Asia especially in Indonesia and its rapid and democratic application across all agricultural potential areas uh present

a significant challenges especially given their potential location which are separated by ocean and you already know that Indonesia has 17,000 islands as separated by ocean. We only we only have

uh 36% of land uh 64 of uh uh waters and 100 air. We have uh and this is challenge for us. If you don't believe me, you can count the numbers of our island

[laughter] through the map. Okay. And and we Yes. and and and we also have another challenge. We are living uh above the ring of fire as also other challenges

for our our our people of Indonesia. And and as as I mentioned previously that this gap is further widened by lack of democratically supporting AI infrastructure sust telecommunication.

We have a three different types region um the west region, center region and the eastern region and uh as each one has different one hour one to another and also um there is a problem with

unequal distribution of AI talent as per I think problem is not only in Asia but also all over the world uh in terms of the biggest opportunities for utilizing AI I in the food supply chain especially

in agriculture country like Indonesia. Um we have we have some uh some efforts to do such like uh we can use AI for prediction of soil condition and nutrition before opening new land for

agar. Our president has a program to open almost 1 million hectares of uh new rice file new race file 1 dozen hectares in some uh big island of Indonesia in order to get the safe safency in the

next five years and and then we also use the for prediction of the most appropriate uh food crops given the soil condition and nutrition of exist is agricultural land.

We have seven dozen island and each island has different soil condition, different uh soil nutrition and you can use AI to predict what kind of nutrition, what kind of uh um

vitamin that belong to that soil. So we can we can pick we can predict the proper crops the proper uh plants plant that have to be plant in that that we planting in that uh in that area. The

second one about optimizing the most optimal fertilizer uh content to uh produce the best uh harvest result as well as optimizing the volume of water required according the

type of fertilizer given. Some of my student they did uh some uh experiment how to predict the their the percentage of fertilizer combined together to get the most optimum

uh production of any kind of crops even this it is corn uh rice or uh sweet potato something like that and then they can we also can use AI for intelligent farming we we don't say

smart farming smart is not not really intelligent. Intelligent is different. There's something that uh there there is a knowledge that has to be grown in in in any system. So this way as

intelligent farming just like a human they grow their knowledge within their brain by optimizing the seed planting in the land so that plants can grow and develop

headly to produce the best products to optimization of the harvest process and the delivery to logistic warehouses. So it's just like end to end to end uh mechanism and then we we also can

predict the weather dynamics just as S said about the flot and something like that. So we can predict the weather dynamics uh to obtain the right condition for planting seed and reducing

the level of crop failures. the crop feathers that um often happens if the farmer and they they fail to predict what kind of pest what kind of uh what the type of

the soil and everything. And then the last one optimizing the logistic transportation route. Yeah. to reduce the operational and other unnecessary cost.

You you can count how much operational cost to deliver um the the crops production from one island to another island in Asia.

Yeah. The price in the eastern area can be double or triple times in eastern area. So if we we buy rice in eastern area only $1, it can be5 $6 in eastern area. So that's why we need AI um to

optimize the transportation and logistic transportation routes whether it is from water from the ocean or sea and also from uh the air. uh regarding the policing regulation you ask about the

road map right map and then the uh about the how to balancing the horizontal AI governments with sector specific uh specific agriculture right um yeah we are proud is proud to be a leader in our

region uh exploring how a polic policy and regulation can be powerful tools for promoting trustworthy AI especially in critical verticals like the agricultural sector. This one this um agriculture is

very important to Indonesia because uh uh most of the uh people of Nissa they are farmers not only in Jafa island but also big island Indonesia. If you see there

are five big islands in Indonesia from uh western area like Sumatra and then Java and the southern area we have uh Borneo in the central also Salawasi or Celebas and then the biggest one in the

eastern area is Papua Island biggest area and still have so so so much area that can be export to become uh rice uh fields and our national AI road map is not

merely a theological blueprint. It is a strategic framework designed to create an ecosystem that harnesses AI for inclusive and resilient system including food system. So this is there

are two key words in here inclusive and resilient. Inclusive mean you can can it must be transparent. I I must be transparent. I I must be explainable. And we we have we have we've been having

problem with the uh uh neural network based system that are the black box cannot be explained in uh in plain and then the second is resilient. This very important for agricultural based uh

nation. So the implementation of AI needs a strong and sustainable national ecosystem like my uh dear colleagues ambassador first mentioned about ecosystem. The AI cannot be implemented,

cannot be applied without a strong and sustainable ecosystem that collaborate all stakeholders not only government but also business, industries, communities, media and and

also academia. So we have a concept of helix. Maybe you ever heard about quad helix five helix helix that's very important. So when we when we are developing the

INSR road map um in the government in this case is ministry of digital and information communication and digital affairs uh is open

a voluntary contribution from from all stakeholders not only government but also from industry, academia, media and uh communities. So,

so our our road map has seven pillars that include AI regulation, AI ethics that's important. The third one is uh investment

like this was me mentioned before about financing. When when I when I was uh attending the uh US forum in AI export they mention about financing financing is very important. We thought that there

is no AI ecosystem financing and investment. Yes. And then the fourth but AI data. The fifth one AI innovation and then the next one AI talent development. The last one is AI

use case. So because we embraces all stakeholders so we assure there is no one left behind. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much professor and and we can come back to those in more detail

later perhaps in the Q&amp;A but I really want to thank you for sharing the promising use cases from Indonesia. Very uh instructive I think for this discussion. And now I would like to turn

over you talked about the helix and and how we work together to to have the industry perspective from Miss Gosh. Um India as we mentioned also co-chairs the summit working group. Um and so I'd be

interested to hear now that we're seeing AI as quickly becoming foundational to agricultural productivity and food security. Um but the big question now is whether as we mentioned it will deepen

inequalities or indeed um democratize the opportunity. Um so from your vantage point uh Miss Gosh, what practical steps are needed to broaden access to AI capabilities so that emerging techn uh

economies and smallh holder farmers can also benefit and fully participate and as adoption accelerates hopefully broadly um how should public private partnerships evolve to scale responsible

AI deployment and prevent the AI divide. Thank you. &gt;&gt; That's a very long answer question. I'll try and keep my answer very short. But before I do that, I have to

acknowledge the presence of sorry. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay. But before I do that I have to acknowledge the presence of I think one of the biggest experts in this field of agriculture in this room professor

Romesh Chant who's also a very esteemed member of Niti Aayog and I requested him not to come for the session and I said I'm going to be too expert if you say too too nervous if you're going to be

sitting right in front of me but um yeah let's see if we live up to his expectations or not. uh [sighs] you know the biggest problem with AI today is that we throw AI at every problem that

exists and we expect that something will happen out of it right and as a result we generalize the technology a bit too much see the thing with AI is if you really want to unlock the technology you

have to know what exactly are you solving for what problems and then you have to go deep because there are so much that has to come together for AI to work for example is the data in place

how good is the quality uh is the ecosystem in place uh so a capabilities in place so AI requires investments and AI is a pretty deep investment overall right so it's very important to

understand what problems do you want to solve with AI and I think that's one of the biggest issues today because we are not taking the time to think through it. We keep saying AI is the magical world

for everything. Right? So now let's look at the food system and I hope I'm correct. Professor Chant, I've learned this a bit from you also. But I think the biggest issue today is

while the world is producing enough food to feed I think 8 billion people but there are still millions and millions who are hungry. So there's a paradox and I think when you start breaking it down

further to understand the exact problems as to why this exists distribution um the entire access to food do you have access to food so there's surplus and there's deficiency and then you don't

have a bridge to ensure that there's distribution happening at at real time that is needed and what this results in is tremendous amount of food shortage. age uh food wastage, right? And some of

the culprits when we think of it, of course, geopolitical, so wars are a big culprit, conflicts are a big culprit, but climate is another big culprit. Right? So this is how you sort of at

least how I because I look at everything from a tech lens. I'm by no means an expert in the domain. But when I look at it from a technology lens and I say how do I best apply the technology to this

problem this is the domain that we have to play with. So now when you look at it if I have to say where do I want to go deep the problem to solve for at least when I look at all of this is the

biggest problem to solve for in the food supply chain according to me right now just purely looking at it from a tech lens is the wastage. How do I bring down food wastage? What role can AI play to

bring down food wastage? So then you start looking at logistics. You start looking at supply the cold chains that exist globally or not. You start looking at trade. You start looking at

geopolitical um agreements because all of that will come into mind right now in terms of industry coming together to solve for AI. Again, if you want the best out of

industry, you have to ensure that there is alignment on the problem statement you'll want to solve. Otherwise, everyone will come and everyone will do the same pilot everywhere. That's what's

happening today. When you look at AI executions around India and around the world and because of the AI commons that we have built, every country is trying out the same thing farmer advisory,

right? Every country is trying it out but why is it not scaling? Why are we not solving for other problems? So again it's very important to identify what is the problem statement. How do you ensure

that when industry gets involved there is a route to market and there's route to commercialization because that becomes very important for industry. And one of the things that we advocate is

coming up with uh maybe a center of excellence, a center of innovation that is identified to solve specific problems. I think one of the problems today we have with COE's are you have AI

COE's, you have blockchain COE's. I really don't understand what that means. But what if we had a COE to say that? How do we ensure that u the cold chain problem is solved across the country?

How do we have a COE that ensures that uh climate uh resilient crops in XYZ areas can be grown right? And then bringing the industry together to say that how do we collaborate to create I

think gives you the right kind of outcomes. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much Mishkosh. And this is a perfect segue. I think um to our next speaker uh turning to the research

community and how to really bridge uh research into advanced AI to more practical tools. Uh so Dr. Pratihast I would like to turn to you now for you know some examples of you know how these

advanced AI tools can really be made to good use in more low tech farming environments and maybe you can give us some concrete examples what distinguishes those who succeed from

those who don't. uh maybe speaking also to some of the points that Miss Gosh raised. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you for invitation. is very timely discussion and of course um

always when we talk about AI we often talk about the technology how fast the model are how big the data set they can handle what is the parameters that we always talk but if you think about the

food system and Mr. Of course mentioned that you know food system have different layers and bottom of this layer is basically a small holder farmers and that farmer operate in a different

environment. If you look at it last year there's billions of euro investment has been done in the tech industry to build more models. The same thing happened to the

small holder farmers. No. So there is often there is a problem that what we want to solve in the server room or computer it doesn't work in the field. So we really need to think how the AI or

model which we are really developing that is applicable to the grassroot level and so within the wakening and and personally I have been working in Asia, Africa and Latin America and one of the

problems basically there is three problems we are facing in this whole AI domain nowadays. First is really data scarcity. Still there is not enough data. The data is not shared. As you

mentioned, there is no ecosystem. There's no fair infrastructure where data can be shared. And that hinders the model. The model works in a global scale. But when you want to work in the

local scale, it doesn't work. It doesn't provide the as input that is expected for the small hold of ours. Second is the trust. often the farmers

doesn't own and then of course the the model and the farmer's expectation is different and then there's often not much trust how to apply this in the local level that's why most of this

advisory I have is failed farmer doesn't follow the advisory because it doesn't make sense and then third thing is scalability often we think that a scale

is not only the technical scale like you process something fast doesn't mean that it can apply the same way so we need to really think differently and that's why like we started I give you a couple of

three concrete examples one example about the food security we need to understand what is the map where are the crop there is no global map that is accurate enough so with the help of um

European space agency four years ago we started the world serial project where we try to map the global croplands still the maps are not perfect because India China many countries they don't share

their data so there is no data and if there is no data we have fantastic model we have build very nice geo embedding with NASA harvest but applicability of this model is still very low in this

country second thing is about the height tech solution in low tech environment. For example, chocolate industry, cocoa, agroforestry is really suffering from the climate change and we have

established many advising but not from the researcher or tech perspective but engaging farmer perspective and that works. We build basically chatbot with their language that really understand

what they need and how we can translate their problem. They know which disease are coming. So we are using computer vision from their lens and then we're training and that works. So there are

couple of things which we really see that if you really want to make these things working you need to make sure that this solutions should work in low tech environment. Most of the things

people uh connectivity has gone up people are on social media but still data is not there. Data in fact is not there and always tech industry or like we as a modeler whatever we call so we

see always data as the input and output data should be as the infrastructure we should engage farmers in that infrastructure and then only we can achieve the impact

&gt;&gt; thank you very much um and I think with this uh we unfortunately we're coming to a close on time uh I think maybe the speakers can be kind enough to stay a little bit after if there are questions

uh we won't have much time for Q&amp;A um but just to thank you all for really providing a diverse set of perspectives for the timely discussions to the ambassador of the Netherlands uh for

framing this important discussion and I think some of the the key takeaways perhaps is that there is vast potential and we saw uh you know the the Indonesian perspective of all these very

uh concrete examples uh also Dean talking about potential for anticipatory action and you know we heard about this global and even domestic paradox of food insecurity when there really is enough

food but it may not be distributed uh enough or properly. Um and also I think importantly that to have impact with AI we need to make sure that it is problem driven that it is driven by the local

context uh and and the farmers who need to use it. Uh and maybe lastly a very important point which is uh exactly core to the work we do at the OECD that to drive this adoption uh we also need to

ensure that there is trust in in what is is produced and this requires obviously a number of factors such as explanability and transparency um and and so on and also uh responsible data

collection. But just with that uh let me thank the panelists for their rich inputs. uh please uh do stick around a little bit for some question maybe in the margin and thanks again to the

Kingdom of the Netherlands for co-hosting this event with the OECD. Thank you. [applause] &gt;&gt; Thank you everyone. &gt;&gt; Thank you everyone for joining us and

sharing your thoughtful views on transforming agriculture. On the behalf of in Paxummit team, we would like to offer a sovenir. Thank you so much.
