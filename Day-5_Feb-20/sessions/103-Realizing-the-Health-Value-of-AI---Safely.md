## 📝 Transcript

I think uh Sindura uh yeah so uh all of us here we would have visited uh doctors in some point in time or have been sick uh anyone who has never visited a doctor please raise hand

so practically everyone so so let's imagine how was your experience when you visit a doctor how do you express your symptoms how uh the doctor interacts with you and how the interaction happens

with the medical systems where your where EMRs comes in. What we are trying to show today uh and what we've built at AACare is an end to-end solution that solves three key challenges that we face

today. One is the fragmentation of information and clear delivery be it right from taking an appointment or taking a vitals. The second is how easily and comfortably you can tell

about uh your history uh rather than fumbling through lots of files and how easily it can be collected, collated and being displayed. And the last but not the least, we would want doctors to

spend time with us and not with machines uh writing uh about prescriptions rather talking to us, counseling us uh connecting with us. So the solution that we have built solves for all these three

challenges. Obviously thanks to the advancement in AI, we have been able to do a lot of this due to the capabilities that we have built in house. So I'm going to narrate a story. Uh this story

is of Niti. She's a 65year-old female has diabetes and she wants to now uh see how she can do the whole end to end care delivery. To start off uh Miti is uh quite digital savvy. She actually has

created her Abha address. Uh Abha is the digital identity that India government provides. This digital identity allowed her to collect a lot of her medical records

into the app which is her PHR or patient health record app. She has also taken taken many photographs so that the AI can read through these photographs and collects her medical history in a

digital format so that it can be summarized. Now what happens is Niti wants to talk to an AI which is a med assist or an assistant uh for Niti. She goes ahead she just uh picks up a prom

says summarize my health. What is happening now is all of NIT's health is getting summarized. You would know uh Niti would know these are the kind of things that has come up from the medical

records. Also there is a prompt that Niti would get which is very very relevant to the kind of things that NIT is supposed to uh talk about. But today NITI came for a very different purpose

and now in a local language she's talking to the bot and she's actually telling that in in English she's expressing that she has have fever and there is a wound in

her foot. What AI would start doing now is try to understand more about uh this specific condition. Where is uh the wound? Uh is uh it uh swelled? Uh are there any kind of a smell that is coming

in? And all of this is happening in the local language that Niti understands. More importantly, it is not letting Niti to only type or talk. There are these prompts that are coming in that will

ease off the interaction of a 65 year old female. After collecting more information such as mobile number, the AI would identify that this is an important case and this needs a doctor's

intervention. But which doctor's intervention with which clinic on which date? All of this information will now get collected. Uh this will be displayed. So in this case uh Niti is uh

being uh told that there is an availability of these two doctors on 14th of February but she can always say that okay I want to uh do it in a different day. Uh pick up the doctor as

soon as she picks up uh the doctor the appointments gets created. Niti can actually do all of this uh by typing or by acting on the prompts as well. So this is how all the information that

Niti wanted uh to share with the doctor gets collected gets summarized and now uh appointment is created. The next story goes to when NITI visits the doctor's clinic. And when NITI

visits doctor's clinic, this is a doctor's view where a doctor is looking at a classical EMR screen. But how this EMR screen is fitted with these AI utilities that can help uh doctor to get

the better outcome is what uh uh we want to demonstrate. If you see all the uh the current EMR and the current prescription uh for NITI is completely empty. There is nothing

there. Uh doctor is looking at the past history of NITI as well as what are the current ailments and current issues that has been listed. AI also ensured that it not only figures out the important

information for patient but here a doctor is also able to understand and get to know more about NITI that there is an uncontrolled diabetes uh there is uh so this is the kind of person that uh

he's dealing with but more importantly it would be very hard for a doctor to start filling all of these information during the consultation doctor just starts uh the audio-based AAS scribe uh

which is now uh doing the interaction between doctor and the patient recording the interaction between doctor and the patient. These interactions gets converted into medical notes and these

medical notes are verifiable medical notes that doctors would see. Again this entire thing has come out just by uh the interaction between the doctor and the patient.

Doctor has to just do copy to EMR pad. As soon as the copy to EMR pad happens, this entire information gets filled whatever has been discussed all the medication that doctors wanted to do.

But here uh we go and see that during the consultation doctor prescribed emoxiline but the patient's medical history said that he is or she is allergic to

emoxiline. The capable AI based EMR is now alerting that the patient is allergic to it without actually going deeper. A doctor can very easily go ahead now and uh change uh this

medication to provide for a better outcome as well as uh to reduce the medical errors. So uh it's changed from moxylene to clinamy. Uh as it changed the prompt also changed. If you look at

the uh information all filled the PDF view uh of the patient will have the entire uh medic medications everything created in the local language. uh there is uh a translation of all the remarks,

advices, everything in the language that patient understands and at the click of a button this information goes and sits uh into the patient's phr uh creating another node uh into her

medical history that can be used uh for the further consultation and any kind of other uh ailments. So uh that's what is the power of AI and the utilities that we are seeing today.

Uh the care process right from being fragmented to being consolidated understanding the patient's entire medical history to making sure that the doctor's time is saved while uh he's

seeing more patients and more medical data is captured. Today all of that is possible but yes there are challenges. how to build these things at scale for multiple languages, how to generate that

data so that your models are uh verifiable at uh those large scale. Who is evaluating these capabilities that are being built? All of these are challenges that we as a developers face.

Uh and I'm looking forward to building more and working more uh in this domain. Thank you very much. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. I'll ask you to uh take a

seat. And when you said is there anyone who has not has not visited the doctor in instinctively I was asking is does veterinary doctor count because I'm a veterinarian by background and then it's

only a half joke actually in the petare industry there is real value and business to be made there. Uh so just a thought and on a uh more serious note I you

could change the name of the lady and adjust age etc. That could be my mother and I deal with this personally as a caregiver has all these conditions deal with so many papers and every interface

you mentioned is a leaf out of my personal life. So thank you for uh thinking about uh building a solution here. I will invite my um panelists one by one. Uh please uh join us in the on

the stage. First uh Dr. Richard Ruquata. He is the chief uh regulator. He's the director general. Please director general of medicines control authority of Zimbabwe. I have

very high regard for regulators because I have been working on uh our regulatory agency and it streamlining and I can see how difficult job that is and uh uh the fact that you have seen this through for

ML3 recognition that's a wonderful accomplishment congratulations on that um uh not an easy job and also you are involved in the regulatory harmonization work of Africa and there is a lot of

interesting uh thoughts you will be I hopefully able to share in on this uh topic. Next, I would like to invite Professor Charlotte Watts. Last we saw was in G20.

Hopefully, it brings back memories. [laughter] Yes, happy ones. Like to keep it that way. uh she is uh she has had extensive uh career uh in uh both healthcare uh HIV uh gender- based

violence, epidemiology, uh mathematics you know uh so and a deep experience working in the government UK government which was the capacity she came uh for G20 uh meetings which I was involved in

from India side. So uh it's pleasure to have you back uh Charlotte and now she is uh working at um welcome trust as executive director of solutions uh would love to hear more about how you are

thinking about these things and uh next I would like to invite uh Dr. Monica Sharma. I happened to meet her just now and uh she is the lead uh for no one artist India foundation and uh welcome

and uh her background is also in this both biomedical field science innovation field but also has extensive experience working in putting together funding programs

whether it is Newton fund uh whether it is uh uh IRTG Germany's international research training groups or India's biioarma mission program. So all of these I'm sure will come in very handy

in your current role and uh would love love to hear from you on uh thoughts related to the topic today. And uh last but not the least my uh dear friend and uh mentor do Dr. Trevor Mundell I should

say Dr. Dr. Trevor Mundal. Uh he is both a he has an unusual background. Uh people who work with him smile when I say unusual and Trevor he did medical degree

and then he figured he wanted a PhD in mathematics. So uh and he's a rose scholar and has extensive uh experience in pharmaceutical industry as from early research to development uh and uh decade

plus experience in global health. With that we will get started. Where did he go? &gt;&gt; I want you here. &gt;&gt; I thought that questions will be only

for the &gt;&gt; No, but you have additional things to add. So love to hear from you. &gt;&gt; Um first to begin with so I think hopefully

you all have mics. For me personally coming here after having read the blog that went out very famously by CEO of uh um Anthropic. I came in with a very bleak feeling to

be very honest. It's kind of depressing. What are we creating? But I have to say last two three days has been energizing seeing all the um

chaos in terms of interactions, people talking to each other, hustle, just huzzle and people excited about the product they're building. Uh it brought me memories of vegetable market where I

grew up from. where people are like it's life there right so people are trying to sell something people are trying to buy something people are uh talking and uh the reason I talk about that as a happy

thing is it's nice to see so many human beings that's what came to my mind in this in the backdrop of that ball so I would just love to hear from you what was your

feeling as human beings I think this this uh seeing anything that you want to particularly share last 2 three days you you have been here you saw all of this what did that make you feel because I

think going forward this feeling of human beings I think will have a currency of its own anybody wants to volunteer and say something &gt;&gt; an open-ended question yes

&gt;&gt; I'm I'm happy to jump in um so I just got here actually yesterday &gt;&gt; okay &gt;&gt; so I'm actually missed I think the early start of the week, which um I

heard was fantastic because you had the youth here as well as you know older people who've been in the global health or the global sort of sphere or in the AI world for longer. So that that mix

and the drive of the kind of energy I think is what I was hearing people tell me about the start of the week. But now I've just been here um sort of last night and today and for me what I feel

quite reassured about at one level it's so you know the change is so profound and so I suppose it it you I was sort of wary because there's so much hype

um and then clearly the risks are being articulated but what I feel reassured about in going to a number of sessions is just actually we're starting to have the more

meaningful conversations about what this really means that is getting beyond that either hyper cell or hyper fear to actually how do we navigate this space and also how do we navigate this as a

global community because this is not something that's one country's problem to fix. So, so actually I'm I'm feeling that, you know, this is this is a really important conference and and we're

starting to get into the we need and and we we're starting to get into the nitty-gritty of of u how on earth we move forward in in the in the best way that really makes the most of the

opportunities but really recognizes the risks. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Anybody else want to share Trevor and then uh Monica? Well, Cindura, you know what I've heard

frequently in this meeting and I hear it quite often in the AI application space is that technology is just 10% of the exercise in applications of AI and the rest is

really around people and ecosystems and as soon as people say that they then go back to talk about technology. So I am interested in how we do more than just pay lip service to this notion

that we really need to think about the ecosystem and the people involved probably more than the technology itself and defining the actual role for humans in the loop is going to be I think you

know as important as any of the technological advances. So Sindora I don't have an experience from the summit as such because I have just arrived here but I want to share a

very relevant experience from this morning. So while I was coming here, I have a six and a half years old who just saw AI on my you know computer and he said where are you going? I said yeah I

have a meeting to attend. He said AI and I was like oh he's able to see I said so you know what is he said yeah it's artificial intelligence and I said what else you know about it? He said yeah

soon there are going to be robots robots doing everything for us. And I was like no but still you would need me. And I found like oh my god that's not a good start of a conversation like like

everybody is influenced by this. So thank you so much for bringing that human back to to this summit. Yeah that's what I thought I'll add as a you know uh conversation from my household

this morning. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Yeah. No I I Charlotte I hope you're right that there is a lot of hype there. Now I'm praying for hype after reading. How many of you have read

that? what I referred to the blog by dera Modi by anthropics here raise of hands okay okay few hands I am not even sure whether I want to urge you to go read because uh it really makes you

think uh and there were some people who are uh uh in the field they said I am choosing not to read it because I don't I don't want to know uh so it's a it's a good uh uh thing to hear uh this that

this human in the loop and the uh way we respons responsibly develop because that's the theme we want to explore especially in the con context of uh health

that I think is a good segue uh Dr. Richard, I want to ask you start with you. Job of a regulator I said is hard. The reason I experienced it firsthand having

now very closely work with uh our regulatory system etc. where you have two extreme pressures on a regulator. On the one it needs to move fast. It needs to be less like everybody wants it to be

less regulation and you want to uh speed up innovation and any every day gets counted and you're held to the metric. That's one extreme. The other extreme is

boy if any thing goes wrong who is the first person who approved this who allowed it to come out. So these are two uh extreme things and usually in a slower cycle you are able to you know

have some time. So how are you thinking about it in the age of both AI but in general in reconciling these two extremes of demands put on someone like you?

&gt;&gt; Yes. Um thank you for that insight. I have to think on my feet here but but you're quite right. It's um it's a matter of um industry wanting more results from the

regulator or less investment and also wanting to retain um or rather wanting the regulator to retain responsibility when things go wrong. I remember watching a

very interesting uh podcast. I think it was called Moonshot. And um in this episode they were saying well if all the jobs are taken by AI regulatory jobs will be the last to remain because

people always have people should always have somebody to blame right we cannot say oh you know somebody was harmless. Oh hey I did it. No that would never work. So worst case scenario I'll be the

last person there so that they can hang me when something goes [laughter] wrong. So at least I have &gt;&gt; I have that job security to think about. But really with respect to what is

happening uh in as far as industry's expectations are concerned, we see a lot of potential in uh AI. Um we're currently working with the grant from the GE Foundation on uh an application

for screening applications um for uh marketing authorizations. So I think those in our industry, the farmer industry know that this is the biggest um this is the big the the biggest

source of uh angst amongst uh industrialists that regulators take too long and uh we are seen as an impediment to progress actually. So we we we also blame industry. We're saying well

you know you you submit um you know incomplete applications and then blame it on us. So we're hoping that with technology we'll have um you know um applications in the near future that can

work for both sides of the fence, right? Um neutral applications that don't necessarily speak to one side, but they they enable all of us to at least reach a common position very quickly. This is

the beautiful thing about uh computers, right? They don't feel any type of way about you. They don't necessarily like you. They don't dislike you. So um we're hoping yeah we're hoping that this will

allow us to do &gt;&gt; I was just saying not yet. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Okay. So, so we are hoping um that um as we work more towards the development of these tools, we'll be able to see more

traction from industry so that we become a more efficient part of the supply chain, right? Uh from development to market uh and not to be seen as the barrier to entry um in in in this field.

Thank you. you know that's very helpful and also uh there is both a challenge for regulator when this AI speeds up the cycle of innovation brings new complexities but also itself a very good

tool in either summarizing a complex application or building models that allows a few people to actually have the same capability as a well-developed pharma so be on the same page there are

lots of interesting possibilities here which in India we're also thinking about along those lines. All three of you are coming from one type of uh shared uh commonality which is funding innovation

and as a funer of innovation you are also in not too dissimilar way are trying to balance promoting innovation while upholding safety and minimizing

risk etc. So I would like to hear from each of you because each of you are different kind of funders. Uh how you are thinking about balancing these two in the funding uh programs and scouring

innovation and speeding that up. Uh you can go in any order can thumb wrestle. &gt;&gt; Trevor's pointing to me but I went first last time but no I can go. Um I mean we we fund uh so I'm from welcome

trust um we fund a range of innovations um with ambition of improving and saving lives um increasingly we are um funding innovation in the digital AI space along with partnerships to develop new drugs

uh products drugs and so on um but we're also a funer of generating evidence um And so for us it's really important not only to say how do we how do we develop a technology or something that

can can really make a difference but also how do we generate the evidence around those products or the ways those products might be introduced into a system to actually help inform decision-

making and and to inform regulatory partners because for us that evidence not only for example on whether um a new AI application you know improves your ability to detect a particular disease

or condition or diagnose or so on or enables a clinician to deal with multiple sources of information. We also need to think about well what does that look like when it comes into real world

use. What does it mean? Um you know does it operate with the other parts of that health system? Does it create unexpected pressures? Does it are there underlying risks if you try and use this

application with a particular age group or or you know particular soio economic group for example. So for us you know as a funer for me it's really important that we want evidence because ultimately

we want decisions and investments to be shaped by evidence that's really tracking things through from the opportunity to actually what's that look like in practice and sort of have those

feedback loops. But I can talk a little bit more about the initiative as as we go along. &gt;&gt; You know, on the acceleration front, um we look at it uh in that every month we

don't have the next generation malaria vaccine, you know, and certainly every year we seeing hundreds of thousands of deaths in young children. Um every year we don't have the enhanced personal

coaching in education. we see a generation that is losing opportunities. So we feel a tremendous pressure I know from the fun side in terms of how do we speed the availability the access to a

tool which looks like it might be a solution to some of those vexing problems. But I think that it really behooves us here to think about

completely focusing on fast might be slow and we have to have this moment of reflection because what could derail the good application of AI. You know, you think

about it in the health area which is so sensitive, the few errors like on the regulatory front, the relatively few errors that could occur, the you know unfortunate outcome for a patient which

can be attributed to a system which was probably misused by you know the people who were using it maybe but nevertheless will be attributed to AI and that leads to a tremendous deceleration and things

not moving ahead. We take the lesson of the self-driving vehicles, you know, where they may be incredibly good drivers and better than the average human at driving, but one fatal accident

puts that whole enterprise at risk. So, I think from the funders perspective, we need to have a situation where maybe taking a little bit of a reflective and a slower approach might be fast.

So [clears throat and cough] I represent Nois Foundation and uh we support health people and planet both. So uh at this point sitting with funders global funders with yourself and I think it

sends a strong message how important AI is at the moment with respect to health. So while we are trying to address as funders different uh parts of the ecosystem

addressing health but having AI bringing evidence to this really matters. So I think I really feel that having a joint approach towards it is kind of strengthening the whole ecosystem of AI.

&gt;&gt; That's a we didn't plant it but that's a joint approach that brings me that uh that's a good uh uh reminder. So uh today morning I was told a call went live. Thanks for that. It wasn't

planted. Uh so do we have a slide? Can that slide go up? So this call on evidence for AI in health has gone up. It is $60 million funding

and uh from three funders listed there. And the QR code allows you to look at it and all the details I believe are there. I have not tried it. Uh I would very quickly like to hear from

any of you or all of you what are you trying to what are you hoping from this and uh after this you know usually panels I find panels very boring by the way. Oh, and as a person sitting there

or as a person trying to sit here and trying to give Gan in 2 minutes. So I would love to make it more interactive. So get your questions and I want there is still time. So right after this

hopefully I would like to see you interacting and sharing your thoughts and sharing questions. So I'll be coming to you. So who wants to uh say your hope from this uh call?

Um yeah. Um so I mean we're really excited about this announcement today. You'll see it's the big health research and innovation foundations coming together to jointly support what is a

major initiative. Um and essentially um what we want to do here is say how do we generate real world evidence on um what is what does it really mean and are we really seeing real world health impacts

once we start to integrate AI into different health systems. So it's you know we we have lots of exciting opportunities that are showing the efficacy of particular application but

what this call really wants to support is rigorous evaluations of where um AI systems are integrated into clinical decision- making. Our focus is on low and middle inome countries. We are

interested in really asking a range of questions. What does it mean for the health system? Are these are these uh new initiatives actually operable? Can it be integrated into what often is

quite a a big bureaucracy of a health system? What are the costs associated with that? Are these interventions actually cost effective? In the end, ministries of

health have to make decisions based on affordability. Um so how do we learn more about the costs of this transition and what are the things we didn't expect, right? um

and and and what we see, you know, if we look at the evidence base, we've got a lot of exciting evidence of interventions that show pro promise. We've only got a relative handful of

rigorous randomized control trials that are actually assessing interventions when they're implemented. So there's a massive gap there. And then we're also now starting to see in different

contexts anecdotal evidence of where AI has been integrated but it's actually buted against the system and actually that opportunity isn't realizing and and sort of is showing it's it's easier said

than done. So basically this this investment is to try and address that evidence uh gap and I just want to call out that JPAL is here and APRC who are key partners on this in in supporting

the implementation and for AP APRC um the contextualization of the work that um we hope to be supporting in Africa. &gt;&gt; Wonderful.

Uh thank you. Anything else Trevor you want to add? Well, I just want to say thanks to our partners at Welcome Nova Nutus Foundation on this uh initial effort. I

hope it's the start of even more in in the future over there because the global health world has been plagued by this lack of primary data. You know, us and others have funded a lot of modeling

simulation around global health problems. But you cannot transcend the lack of primary data at the end of the day and AI is too important for that to be the constraint that impedes

implementation at the end of the day. &gt;&gt; Great. &gt;&gt; So I thought maybe it'll be good to also add that how as we uh funders together envision this as a commitment towards

shared standards. So while we'll be working together as part of this call we are saying that the real world evaluation is not optional it is the foundation and by aligning together we

are kind of defining what good looks like so that we reduce the burden on countries and developers who would otherwise face a patch of I would say patchwork of expectations and secondly I

would say that uh by joining hands we are reducing fragmentation in a rapidly evolving ing field and now that we are coordinated we are uh getting away with the risk of

duplication the quality that we want to see in the applications or in the products and we make sure that the investments that we do are getting into the real world I mean they do create a

impact because of the coordination that is part of this whole process and I also say that when we sit together it adds uh the seriousness to the ecosystem that what we are doing is not a side

experiment. This is something that we are creating as a infrastructure for a long-term process that I would say governments have been asking for it. And the best part as a researcher I would

say is that we don't like the researchers don't have to navigate three different timelines &gt;&gt; of the funders. Okay. Yeah, that's correct to that

&gt;&gt; and no note three different criterias. we just have not like one agreed aligned criteria and I would say that no three different deadlines no timeline so it makes really life easy as a researcher I

would say so yeah &gt;&gt; I hope you get some interesting uh uh calls from it so if we have questions uh is there a mic going around I hope there is if not I'll give you

mine so I don't have to say answer your questions and please do there is one hand up there please direct your question including to Vikalp if you have questions. So uh yeah let's start with

the gentleman at the back and then uh you are up next. &gt;&gt; Thank you folks. Very interesting. Um my questions around data privacy um and data privacy by design and the

lady mentioned three different parameters. Could you elaborate more on how data privacy can be incorporated at least at a policy level? Thanks. Anyone anyone wants to take that question at

least in the context of this call I guess you can or in general &gt;&gt; maybe I can give it a &gt;&gt; yeah how how are you handling this? &gt;&gt; Yeah.

&gt;&gt; Yeah. So [clears throat and snorts] I think um uh health data is quite sensitive and uh um I mean most sensitive data rather when it comes to uh country when it comes to individual

when it comes to even uh places such as police, military etc. So um and it's a it's a pretty valid question. Some of the things that uh we as an organization try to follow is the general guidelines

that has been provided by uh the competent authorities such as be it HIPPA on uh the um healthcare data or uh DPDP which is uh the act for data privacy in India. uh and more

importantly u uh if we uh look at the data exchanges such as NHA in India have also uh created clear guidelines. I think following those guidelines and getting yourself tested against those

guidelines are fundamentally important and uh it has it has become so sensitive that today a lot of our customers they do ask us whether you have a continuous um like sort of uh applicable uh

certificates from these uh privacy authorities as well as these uh privacy based frameworks. So that's how we uh solve for it and I think it's it's a good thing uh in health it is

fundamentally critical uh and and the technology how it is growing I think there are multiple other ways as well like an end toend encryption and so and so forth where we can use it to uh keep

things private. &gt;&gt; So no I there are two aspects to it you know one is technological and another is policy there are other sessions entirely focused in people who are working on it.

So I wouldn't put uh you in the shoes to answer that but on the technological front you know both Charlotte if you want to address or Trevor on what are some of the things you know model uh

learning without data being exchanged or synthetic data so many uh aspects of it which you have been at the forefront and Charlotte whatever you want to uh &gt;&gt; I mean I just wanted to say um in terms

of the evaluations that we want to support through this funding would be very much expecting clearly on an honorinity of you know to basically for those evaluations to adhere to high

quality research standards. So the the kind of bars and the checks and controls that you'd expect if you're doing any sort of research study in the on health um and the sort of ethical guidance and

clearance procedures that you need to adhere to. So for us that's just an important part of any aspect of research um that we support and and that we'll be supporting in this initiative and that

includes issues of of privacy and other other things. &gt;&gt; You want to say anything about the technological emergence of any new technology that has been helping with

preserving data privacy but not the innovative uh learnings and improvements of the models. Yeah, Sura, you know, so I think that for us it's u there's no compromise on

um patient data privacy from the clinical trial as Charlotte has mentioned over here, but AI does raise a lot of other issues that go almost beyond that. So for instance you know

the various models of federated learning that people have introduced where you can have locally private data but you contribute to the evolution of a model which improves because it has access to

a very diverse data source. Now has that actually been regulated? We had a um uh an example of one of our uh grantees who produced a very good system for using ultrasound to diagnose certain chest

diseases. But that and it was based on a federated contribution from different groups that kept their own data local and private but they contributed to the model and you know that hasn't really

been tested and all of the policies around is that a disclosure which is acceptable now in the of the age of AI. I think it's something that we may want to encourage with the right framework.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. And um do you have the mic? Okay. Then if you have another mic you can take it to the gentleman. Uh madam and then after you send it.

&gt;&gt; Uh my question is to professor watts. Uh you mentioned about clinical decision support. U so the context uh from an Indian healthcare setting as you're well aware is majority of our health is run

at the front line. Uh so there's also an element of operational decision support as such. uh so there's a bunch of geospatial uh AI models that are we are working

with Google uh for geospatial inferencing in the tuberculosis space uh mostly active case finding and then uh diagnostic network optimization uh so my question is uh from an evidence

perspective we obviously are doing some retrospective analysis and we plan to follow it up with a prospective analysis as such although it's a it's a single unit right now in a city uh but would

this be of interest and what is what is your level of inclination to operational decision support. Uh because I I'm a physician myself. Um I'm a medical informaticist as a PhD. I can tell you

for one thing for sure is the the patients who come to into the system they for the most part taken care of. But those are all the silent system uh silent patients who are out there

undetected in the community. Uh so what's your inclination in in indeed in this uh research grant uh for such solutions? Um it's a wonderful question. Um and because essentially I come from

public health, right? So my uh our interest I think our collective interest is actually how do we in particular focus our evaluations and generate evidence where there's a great greatest

opportunity to improve health and to strengthen systems. And some of that aspect might be actually how do you are there opportunities to reach um and improve care for the underserved.

Um and so um we're not going to say you know this works and this fits and that doesn't fit but ultimately we are interested in how does that integrate within a system. In the call we

mentioned the importance of looking at interventions at a primary care level not only at tertiary care. Um and I think the things that will resonate in our interest is is really are are there

areas where actually um the opportunity is big enough that actually it merits that um assessments to say is this really translating into tangible health impacts and is the

return on that actually affordable and is it something that could be scaled. So that issue of you know how does it connect with the system is an important part of the question as well that we're

interested in. No, I do think it's a very important question because um you probably all aware of the constraints that we face now in the global health space in terms

of funding some of the exciting new technologies that are coming along um whether it be at the level of the global fund or of Garvey who both have not met quite the standard that we would like to

in their replenishments. So there's just a reduced amount of funding available for those critical commodities that could be life-changing. And when we get a TB vaccine, which we hope we might

have in say 3 years, how are we going to afford to actually put that out to the people who need it? So it's exactly the kind of targeting that you talking about in terms of risk targeting that can make

all the difference in terms of taking now the lesser amount that we can afford but putting it to where the need is the greatest and that matching which the AI systems and that geospatial targeting

that you're talking about is exactly the solution that we need to promote and understand how it works. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. So um &gt;&gt; person who has a mic and then hi

&gt;&gt; you can hand it to the person back after you ask the question. Yeah, thanks. &gt;&gt; Um, it has been like a great session. So, &gt;&gt; how do we go about building AI agents

that are uh not only intelligent but reassuring in very high anxiety environments like maternal and infant care? How do we go about that? But I would love to hear your thoughts because

we're building something on the same &gt;&gt; when you say high anxiety just so that &gt;&gt; high anxiety for paternal and infant care because uh even myself as a new mother I feel that there are a lot of

open areas where the mother doesn't know what to do &gt;&gt; right and it's an open field and the pediatricians gynax and uh the mother support system is very low when you go

down to tier two and tier two three cities how do we go about uh building there I would love to get some thoughts Take it. So I think one of the thing that we have

done while we build a lot of these agentic pipelines for doctors for users is uh having human in the loop while the development is happening is extremely

extremely important and that's what Trevor also mentioned because today u how this can go and where it can lead is not something that you can fully control uh uh and So there are these systems

that are specifically designed where uh an anonymous deidentified conversations are practically being u distilled to see if the agents are working together in tandem. Uh the

second thing uh and that's more technical that we have uh sort of figured out is uh the models are quite capable uh but when you are running them with a single goal or a single agent

with a single prompt that practically at times narrows down the whole world view. But if you are running multiple agents collaborating together where there is a grounding agent whose job is to make

sure that the other agent is not sort of going beyond what uh the boundaries are I think that is fundamental in healthcare uh if it is uh just a single agent single prompt and a very so so and

that's what we should avoid uh because it's a quite deep workflow especially if we look at maternal health uh and uh uh things where the mental health comes into being. It's fundamentally important

that we follow some good technical principle of creating a multi- aent architecture but more importantly have a human in the loop. Uh because we as a company hasn't been able to find a way

to get out of it. That's why we have like a strong 10 member uh medical team uh which is also growing where these are doctors working with uh the technologists.

&gt;&gt; Sure. Thank you and unfortunately sorry we I have been told we are out of time but uh speakers will be available if you can please come up to them and uh one very quick thing just before we go

anything you want to share what you would like to see next year when we come back to AI summit I just heard that it is being hosted in Geneva so we are all showing up there we have all these

aspirations what would could look like when we show up there to say okay this year we did something together anything that comes to your mind

&gt;&gt; you know I'd love to see the next uh iteration of Vikp's uh patientf facing agent and that would be an agent that would be able to guide you in your health pathway would be completely

transparent and that I would actually understand why it made its decisions and I would have 100% confidence that you know in that anxietyprovoking situation. It never made an error related to

guidances, drug contraindications. It was always correct in those things and I wouldn't have to be concerned about that. That's the next iteration that I'd love to see next year. Next year maybe.

Um, what I would like to have next year is instead of all of us as funders sitting up here, I would like to see some of the partners that we're funding who are doing work to really understand

what this looks like operationally and to have really honest conversations about what's working and what's not working. And so we're moving away from the hype to really actually starting to

get into the nitty-gritty of what this could be and and can be. Okay. So, quickly I I would like to see um a situation where there's more collaboration between industry and

regulators because ultimately we're on the same side. We want the same thing, better quality, safe and effective medicines for all our people. So, development in that area would be very

exciting. &gt;&gt; What to you? I think I I would still love to see that no matter how much evidence we generate from AI, no matter what we do, we still have that last uh

word from the doctor who is sitting there and never forget the human angle while we navigate the AI space. That's what I always want to see. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much or human.

&gt;&gt; Yes. Thank you so much. Next time we meet, I hope we all feel as optimistic as we do and some some more. Thank you so much for attending. Yeah. Thank you speakers. Uh thank you

speakers. We just have a soar for you from India side for this session. Thank you so much for where we stand

outside.
