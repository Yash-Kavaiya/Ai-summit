agriculture and we see that Israel is a very natural partner with IIT ROD because we have got very recently last year we got a new center of excellence which is AI for agriculture this is a

three sectoral application where ministry has set up three different center one in medicine uh one in digital health one in agriculture and one in smart cities. So, so we are holding the

AICE for agreech and we are looking forward to work with all our knowledge partner and especially the country which are far uh in the forefront of the technology how

they are adopting technology in the agree sector because India there more than 70% of population living in a in a countryside and the main profession is agriculture the food security is very

important for all of us especially in India and uh we also want to help our farmer how they can grow the or how we can increase their productivity, how we can AI can be help them uh for example

in weather forecasting or the soil testing or or even um uh anyone else health also. So there are many verticals which IT roer is working
