## 📝 Transcript

to the masses and making sure that it does improve lives. So let can I start by the first question around India? One of the things you've done and your organization has done is you found ways

of taking the power of AI, democratizing it, and making sure it solves problems that we all care about. In my speeches, I've talked about you. I've talked about uh oral reading fluency, uh the tool

whereby for less than, and if I'm stealing your thunder, sorry, but uh I he'll let you he'll tell you a little bit more, but I've been talking about it because it's just amazing. Um, I've been

talking about the fact that your TV screening you can do things that we couldn't imagine being done before. So, can you tell us more about your work in India?

&gt;&gt; Sure. Hi everyone. Thank you. Welcome. Uh, thanks for being here. Okay. Thank you for having me. I suspect the way I got over here was they needed Gay Foundation needed someone for this chat.

They looked around. They found this guy wandering around with two badges. They figured that means he's important. Let's get him and next thing I'm sitting over here. But uh thank you so much Ankur. Um

so you know my brother and I launched uh the Vadwani Institute for Artificial Intelligence here in India about 8 years ago 2018. Back then AI wasn't a thing. Chad GPT

hadn't come out. uh but I happened to be serving on the board of trustees of Carnegie Melon University in the US where I had studied gotten my masters. So and CMU was ranked then is still

ranked number one in the world for artificial intelligence research and teaching. So being on the board I could see all the billions of dollars coming into AI from Google and so on and so

forth even in those days and it always pained me that none of this money was going into AI for societal development you know 34 billion people in the world out of 8 billion don't have access to

decent healthare decent education AI could be transformative and that's what we're talking about today but at that time nothing was going in. So I spoke to my brother Romesh. We decided

let's launch this institute for AI in India. Prime Minister Modi came inaugurated it etc. So we hired a really good team of AI machine learning people

uh spoke to government identified use cases started working and nothing happened. Two couple of years went by. We were developing this what we thought was really neat stuff

but it wasn't scaling up. So we took a look at the issues etc. And then we started realizing look we're not approaching it quite right. We've got great AI solutions but there is a lot

more a lot more to actually having impact than just having a nice technical solution. So, and I'll I'll I'll uh in a couple of minutes tell you the key lessons that

we've learned. But once we started figuring out okay what we were not doing and that we needed to be doing then things started happening. So just to give you two or

three examples as Ankur mentioned we identify our problems our challenges that we want to focus AI on by working directly with government. We'll talk to the health ministry about their national

priorities for the next three, four, five years. What should we do? We'll talk to the education ministry and so on. So three years ago the uh health ministry told us that tuberculosis is a

very high priority for us. It's the largest infectious disease killer in the world. Kills close to 2 million people a year. Largest infectious disease killer in India. Kills close to half a million

people over here. And for each person that dies, there are 20 others that don't die, but they live miserable lives and they are infecting lots of other people as they go on. So the government,

the health ministry said, can you help? So we took a look at the whole cascade of care in tuberculosis. What's the patient journey like? Where are the three or four or five key pain points?

And we identified okay diagnosis is number one because in these economically vulnerable communities where TB happens you need X-ray machines you need sputum analysis and in these communities you

don't have all this stuff you don't have X-ray machines that work and are calibrated and so on problem number one problem number two sputum analysis is another way of diagnosing TB but these

samples go to 64 government labs around India where they are analyzed etc and it takes time for the results to come back to the patient. And for those that have TB, you've lost a lot of valuable time.

Third big challenge is there's a number of patients with TB who are on the medication regimen, but these are very toxic medicines. They really destroy your body while they're trying to cure

you of TB. So, a lot of people stop taking these these medicines and they develop drugresistant TB which is much worse. 40% mortality a 50% mortality rate etc. So we started applying AI to

to each of these issues. On the diagnosis, we've come up with a way of detecting tuberculosis from the sound of a cough into a smartphone. It's instant, it's quick. We don't just say yes or no.

We give the risk of this person having TB, what's the probability, etc. That is now rolling out nationally and it is becoming the national stand. And by the way, we're the only country that has

this doesn't exist anywhere. World Health is organization has told us this could be a gamecher globally. For the sputum analysis, we've developed an AI model. So now the sputum analysis

and these 64 government labs totally automated results come out within a day go back to the patient treatment starts. Perhaps the most challenging thing these patients who will fall off their

medication. We've developed AI algorithms that predict well ahead of time which TB patients are likely to fall off the medication. So then the 2,000 TB case workers in India which is

a very limited number for 4 million TB patients they can focus on the right people. This is impacting now tens of millions of people. Just in the last year the

rate of TB detection thanks to our cough against TB has gone up by 25%. You may think that's bad news, you know, higher numbers, but now we can treat these patients. We can get them on the right,

you know, clinical care protocols. That's one example. Education. Throughout the global south, there is a very high dropout rate of young children from schools. Very high in grades 1

through five. Problem in India, problem everywhere. We got a call from a very large state government in India that said, "We've got this issue. Can you help? We sent a team in and we had to

analyze what's causing this high dropout rate. We learned that the single biggest reason for this high dropout rate is an inability of these very young children 7 8 9 years old to be able to read

proficiently in their mother tongue. If you can't read, it affects how you do in every subject. Right? science, history, geography as you struggle, you start failing, you get frustrated and these

are again poor communities. Your parents say forget school what's the point come work in the field or work in the kitchen and that affects the rest of their lives.

We've come up with an AI based suite of tools that for the child that goes to the teacher. And for the child, we come out with personalized exercises, stories that

they can read at home, but which help them to get better at their specific area of weakness. Each child is different. We were in pilot with the state. They were so impressed. They made

it mandatory for all 3 million school kids in that state in that age group. State of Rajasthan saw it recently. They made it here in that age group. So that's the

kind of scale one can get. What's the difference between what we were not doing in our first two or three years versus what we're doing now? What we learned is number one, the only

way to scale is government. You have to work with government from day one. Working with government isn't easy, right? It's easy to say. It's challenging. It can be frustrating at

times, but you have to understand how to navigate it. How do you work with senior civil servants, you know, start with an, you know, u approach them with humility, not like

you have the answers, you're trying to understand the problem. You want to work with them. Secondly, things scale from day one. You can't develop an AI solution and then

say oh I want to use it on 1 million people. There are issues you have to think in right in the beginning as to how will this scale out? How will large scale training happen in the field? How

will frontline health workers or you know teachers or other governments of how will they use this? So thinking that way is very upfront and in fact with government what we do now is once we

identify a problem even before we work on the technical solution we plan that deployment to scale as to what will happen and we make government accountable for a lot of it just as

we're accountable for the technical side. The other really key learning has been that government and this relates ankor to what you were just saying has developed a lot of digital public

infrastructure. Aadhaar is like the great example that we're all aware of right up UPI united payment interface incredible example of that. So there are lots of things in healthcare in

education and agriculture where the government has developed this digital public infrastructure and it's critical. We didn't know this. This was probably our key finding. It's critical to find a

government platform that you can integrate into. So the examples I've given of TB government has a wonderful uh platform called NIKshai. It's like a case management system for tuberculosis

patients. We've integrated everything. We developed our algorithms into that platform. The education this early childhood reading proficiency each state has a platform. Rajasthan as an example

has a platform called Rakshak for you know 70,000 schools 400,000 teachers 8 million students we plugged our algorithms into that platform so if these platforms hadn't

been there we'd be struggling to scale any of this up the final learning that we've had and maybe this is the most important is all these technical solutions are great at a macro level to

bring down TB to to improve reading proficiency etc. But at the end of the day, if the person using this tool, the frontline health worker, the teacher, if it doesn't make life

easier for them, in addition to improving education for the child or healthcare for the patient, it won't get it won't happen. You can push all you want from the top that oh, you must use

this, but there's got to be pull. They've got to want to use it, and that happens only when you make life easier for them. Um, thank you very much, Sunil. Um, I do want Yeah, we're do we

have the next panel coming? &gt;&gt; Ah, okay. All right. So, we'll we'll do the next question a little bit quicker, but I do want to just um acknowledge a few things, call out a few things. One

is this journey between innovation and impact. I love what the learnings you talked about because we keep on sometimes focusing on the innovation part and we think that the road from

innovation to impact is a straight road. &gt;&gt; It's not &gt;&gt; and it's not. It's possible. It's probable, but it's not guaranteed. and we need to work hard at it and your

learnings get to it. It's also one of the reasons why we love our seven-year partnership and hopefully it'll be much more as &gt;&gt; as we think about as some of you know

the Gates Foundation yesterday announced a new initiative a new u pledge around AI for AI which is advantage India for AI and the idea is to make investments in India for the global south and we're

looking forward to partnering with you. So um one of the places where we do partner and we're talking about things in in fact earlier today we were talking about work in Ethiopia and Rwanda and

Kenya um can you talk a little bit more about how you think about your work in the context of south south partnership and how do you take the learnings you have from one place to the other place.

&gt;&gt; Sure. So when we got started our our goal was only India right my brother and I we are from India our hearts are still here so we weren't thinking about any place else but what's happened is as our

AI solutions have been scaling up in India quite quite dramatically and we are today impacting over 100 million people a year we've developed over 25 AI platforms in partnership with government

we've started over the last year getting a lot of inquiries from governments around the world in the global south saying what you're doing in India we need in Kenya or in Rwanda or in

Indonesia or Egypt or Mexico. By the way in India we don't just develop these solutions. We also do a lot of capacity building meaning training of senior civil servants on how you can use AI,

what it's good for, not good for etc. We help ministries develop data governance standards, use case frameworks and so on. uh then we do the actual solutions

development that's that's the biggest chunk of what we do but then we have a big deployment team we have close to 100 people making sure that these things get deployed so we were thinking only India

but over the last year we started getting all these inquiries and we finally said look we set up this foundation to have impact globally

uh so now we've we've have we sent a team out to Africa to meet with several countries uh we are starting starting operations this month in Rwanda, Ethiopia and Kenya. And I'm glad to see

our colleague over here from Smart Africa. We will be partnering in this work. We're very excited about that. Uh and then beyond that, we expect to be going to a number of other places.

Today, as I said, we're impacting maybe 100 million people in India. Our goal is by the year 2030 to be impacting 500 million people. We're very excited about our partnership with you uh at with the

Gates Foundation. not good. So prime the prime minister Modi if you heard him yesterday in his speech he gave a brilliant speech as part of that he said he said for the last several years I've

been saying make an India for the world he said now I want to add to that in this age of AI design an India for the world develop an India for the world and then deliver

these solutions to the world and that is what we're trying to do over here that's the evolution in our thinking And again, we're excited, very excited about the partnership with you.

&gt;&gt; Thank you, Sunil. Are we I I think we have a change of plans. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. And Sunil, if you could please stay on stage and if I can invite our panel up. Uh Shelini Kapoor

for chief strategist from the Xstep Foundation, Lucina K, director general and CEO of Smart Africa. And Shiko Gatau, CEO of Kala. for

&gt;&gt; imagining it. &gt;&gt; Oh, picture. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Yeah, good. Good to start. Okay. Thank

you so much. Thank you, Ankur. Thanks for your time. Uh and here we are. And thanks, Sunil, for you know, spending some more time with us. Uh thanks Shiko. We have been meeting bumping into each

other and thanks thanks Lucina. Thanks for being here. Um [clears throat] so we'll get into uh some of the discussions on the south south collaboration

uh that is um that is spurring innovation and that is uh diffusing AI uh into all the sectors. [cough] uh AI diffusion is uh about the roots

and the rails which need to be laid in AI the similar way it digital rails were laid in the DPI uh time. Um and now they can be they can be shared they are playbooks they can be

shared. Um and air diffusion actually concept came from um it it started with uh Jeffrey Hinton talking about it. Uh he's a professor in uh Georgetown in DC where he talked about that how actually

electricity was created in uh Germany but it was diffused across India across sorry USA where USA made so much of strides into it. So like electricity AI is a generalpurpose

technology. It's a GPT which is there and between invention and impact there's a big layer of adoption and diffusion which needs to be there so that AI gets diffused into society

and when it gets diffused into society something which can be built in Kenya can come to India something which is built in India can go to Kenya because there are playbooks which could be which

could be leveraged not everybody needs to build everything not everybody needs needs to build the entire stack. How do we learn from each other and how does that south south collaboration happens?

That's what uh is the focus. So I'll start with um the the pathways the what are the pathways to scale uh and I'll start with LSINA that you know you are leading smart Africa and you

help coordinate across lot of nations um different stages of AI somebody in pilot somebody in production somebody has solved data somebody has solved language somebody has solved voice AI

um how do what do you think are the opportunities for the south south collaboration in building these pathways together. &gt;&gt; Yeah, thank you very much for inviting

me. In fact, that collaboration first of all before we even talk about south south, the collaboration is a sense of the creation of a smart Africa because if you look at Africa through

just only Kenya which is 50 million, Ghana which is 30 million or Nigeria which is 240 million, you're missing the point. But if you look at Africa as a 1.4 four billion people but be able to

leverage that 1.4 you need a collaboration and the scale so coming from that when you look at the continent of Africa which is technically speaking the global

south I don't want to get there you global south and the south south collaboration is very important because we do not need to reinvent the wheel India has showed the world what the DPI

actually mean for 1.4 4 billion people it's working digital ID a country which is able to organize election for 850 million people to vote you have to actually kudos so so we

don't need to reinvent the wheel Africa can learn a lot from India even with the use cases but why use cases particularly because there's a lot of similarity between India and Africa in terms of

culture in terms of value that we all know we are into the AI uh we into digital transformation is not just to create uh the luxury of the luxury of the society

is be able to have a population inclusion of the populations ethical of the technology. Exactly. So that coming from that that's one of the reason to reboost actually smart Africa initiative

the creations of the Africa AI council came into play where last April on April 4th 2025 49 country came together to actually sign the declaration and subsequent to that the U

AI council came to life uh on the November 12th 2025 in Guinea After our board of directors which are head of represented by head of the state uh announced that uh accepted that we

create uh the AI council we had a first meeting already. Then the council consists of 15 members. Uh it's not only is not only driven by public but it has seven ministers coming from seven

different country and eight private sector members. Why? Because in our constitution as smart Africa private sector first we do believe that the government should be creating a

conducive environment for the private sector to excel. It cannot be dominated by public sector and underneath of the council we have of course six thematic group mainly computing. So we can look

at the collaboration south and computing power. We can look at in the data set we can look in the skills. We can look at in the regulation which is the governance. We can look into the market

and we can look at investment. When it come in terms of investment, something we need to know the investments in a prior technologies the investment cycle is too slow for the

AI. Just look back 12 months ago where were we and where we are today. So this is some of the thing we need to look at it carefully. Now we are looking at the three aspect. One, the government need

to be creating a conducive environment for private kids to to ship in. The private sector need to be executing but they can only execute as I said everyone's cry because they said finance

is the issue. I always said finance is not the issue. Finance is the last thing you should think about. You know why? Because I said financing is like the rain. For rain to fall you need certain

condition of the cloud. Those cloud are the regulatory environment the condition environment for business private sector because private sector do not like unpredictability.

So the first thing is the philanthropics. The reason why I want to speak about the philanthropic needs to serve as a to derisk the area because these are some of the things government

is the last thing to invest in the technology because they want to make sure it's is going to work but the philanthropist is a time for them to accelerate to use that as a d-risking

while the private sector can chip in and so on and so forth. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Yeah, thank you so much. Um and and you talked about DPI, you talked about the private sector, public coming together.

It's the entire ecosystem and uh on 18th um actually um Mr. Nandanda Nilikini actually announced 100 pathways to 2030 which is a clarion call if you ask me it's a clarion call for

people to join to create pathways simply because you know if you climb Mount Everest suppose Edmund Hillary has climbed Mount Everest and uh do you think he'll come back and he'll say I'm

not going to tell you how I climbed what is the route I took where did I go where did I not go what did I see he will talk about right he will talk about the so that it is easy for other

[clears throat] other travelers to come in. So pathway is like that. If someone has done the AI pathway, others should learn from it, benefit

from it. So Shiko, you were with us on the stage when you joined and you said that you know from the global south 100 pathways to scale you would like to join us. Please tell us how can that

diffusion help? How can this you know we can work collaborate to you know to get the AI use cases from pilot to production. &gt;&gt; Thank you so

&gt;&gt; can you hear me? Oh perfect. Uh thank you so much for having me. I I feel like we've been in five different panels with Shalini this week but it's all good. Um so first of all I want to say thank you

so much uh to India for hosting this amazing event and of course for the Gates Foundation for the many things you've done this week. I hear that India is trying to get the

Guinness World of Record for the biggest ever conference tomorrow with 1.5 million. I feel like I need to ask Miti to add an asterisk to have the most diverse AI summit ever. So thank you so

much and this is cues me into what what south actually means and what collaboration means. As Shalen has mentioned we had a whole day of collaboration. We had two days on the

17th we we brought researchers from across the global south Latin America, India, Southeast Asia and Africa to just have a conversation around how do we do research together? How do we build

together? What are the things like uh DG has said that we can work together as a a global majority? I know we've had this discussion is it global majority is it global south we or middle power because

you're not going to be lower power anyway we are something we just need to define who we are but we are the majority of the globe how do we work together and it it was a very fulfilling

day if I had a word for it yeah and we saw that people are able to work together oh I need to pause because of authority &gt;&gt; I can Yeah.

&gt;&gt; Okay. Um, so it's that collaboration and as I was saying this idea of how do we bring this multiplicity of of thinking together given that we have the same exact challenges. We have challenges

around we have multiple languages. We have culture and diversity. We have things that we need to be able to work together. How do we collaborate together? And for us, the biggest

takeaway is how do we make AI not just a technology but a a political and economical issue. Yeah, that was the biggest one because the people are there, the builders were

there, the researchers were there, the policy makers were there, but we need that political goodwill to be able to make this work together. And something that CV uh Maduka um from um I've

forgotten the organization uh CV said that struck really accord to everybody including myself is we need to start having a conversation on what is called the collaboration tax and it's something

DG when we were coming in we were talking about and we I'll define coalition tax as this effort resources and things that you need to put together to be able to collaborate with each

other. It's what the government should be doing. It's what um that that political part of AI should be doing to bring the collaboration together and how do we make these people come together

without the effort uh of I mean not the effort the pain of of collaboration and that's what we need to be talking about because the the resources are the people are there people are willing to

collaborate and work together. We saw it this week and as the minister said, I said while you're you're chasing the the Guinness world of record of having the most number of people also chase for the

diversity that these countries have seen. Thank you so much for bringing Africa and the world to India. Thank you Shiko. Thank you so much. Uh we'll take a small uh uh you know break in the

panel discussion and we'll have uh Mr. Krishnan come here and talk about how scale and collaboration can help in the south south and what is transferable from India. I know he's like busy and

across all. So over to you Mr. Krishna. &gt;&gt; I was just going to do one more thing which is um thank you Shallini and thank you for to the panel for allowing us this small break. Um

for those of you who don't know secretary Krishnan uh from the ministry of uh matei is over here. He's had probably uh one of the most amazing successful weeks this week. So, please

join me and give him a big round of applause. Um for [applause] Secretary Krishnan, thank you for um as a proud Indian, I'm quite excited about

the fact what happened this week. I'm also as somebody who cares about the agenda of this global south. Everything that happened in in India this week put the global south agenda

right front and center. So thank you for doing that. There were so many announcements made this week about uh how we're going to make progress uh in the months and years

to come together. Would love to welcome you to give a little bit more context of the announcements that were made and the achievements that were achieved this

week. Thank you. Welcome. Well, let me first apologize to the panel for having sort of stepped in abruptly but uh you know between juggling many things going on across

this uh the summit. Um I I think this was a very important session as far as I was concerned because if this particular summit was about one thing it was about the global south. the fact that uh India

representing the global south could actually um dare to host this event and also dare to uh host it on this scale. The one thing we were very clear about is summits thus far have basically been

about [clears throat] country leaders. It's been about CEOs and it's been about some experts getting together in closed rooms and not really having the

opportunity to do what or to actually showcase to people as to what the possibility of the technology is. And this particular event gave us that opportunity. I think we were very clear

that what we wanted to do was to let people into the rooms. We wanted to make sure that people especially youth had this opportunity to come and listen to the

best minds there are on artificial intelligence as technology and to every possible perspective on how this technology can work for everybody. And the second thing of course as you're

well aware we said people planet progress and two aspects of it were very important. One was or three if I can. One is democratizing access to AI all the AI infrastructure and resources.

That was one key aspect. The second key aspect was including those who are not ordinarily given access to this those who are excluded. And the third key aspect is putting humans at the center

of this process to make sure that this is a technology that works for people. And I think uh the prime minister was very clear in his emphatic in his address yesterday where he put people or

manav right at the heart of uh AI. So to enable this to happen of course multiple things have to happen. We have to find frugal ways to innovate in order to make these resources available. We

believe that our own AI uh mission model, the India AI mission model is one of those frugal ways in which both the compute infrastructure and the uh model infrastructure and the um and the data

set infrastructure can be created for each country because some of this needs to be on a specific basis for regions and for countries. In India, we are a subcontinental scale. There are 22

official languages and many other languages which need to be uh which need to be um taught or which need to be understood and we understand this cultural and linguistic diversity better

than any other region in the world and we can at a continental scale we can contribute in that effort. That is one key element. The second key element of course is to create compute in a way so

that it doesn't I mean people are not enabled to build modes around it that you know the the the the implication that you need the kind of resources to do this that nobody else can do it and

only we can do it is not an approach we wanted to take. So we created this model where the private sector is encouraged to invest. We created this model where access to it is something which the

government subsidizes. In the process today AI compute in India is available at a third of the price that it is available in the rest of the world. I think that has been the significant

achievement. The United Nations asked us saying would it be possible to once you build it out on scale would it be possible to share with the rest of the world. This is something that we have

committed to them saying as and when the size is adequate so that we can meet other requirements. We will be happy to share the we are happy to share the model even now. But uh and the AI kosh

model as we call it the AI treasury is something that we are happy to share even now. We are happy to share uh the fact that uh uh the models that we have uh supported in India and which have

been built out as sovereign models in India that again is technology that we are happy to share with the global south. It's something we can enable. Some of it is something we've built with

our own resources. So it is in a sense completely sovereign uh unlike in many other places. It's something that the government has paid for from taxpayer resources and we can use. And the third

element of course is the data sets and how they are shared. Now that framework is again something we can certainly share. The most important thing and I think that's what uh is also showcased

so uh eloquently in the expo is the range of applications which have been created out of this and there are close to 900 startups across all those halls who have done a variety of things. uh

even in the main hall we with the gates foundation we have set up the African village which is such a showcase even to the leaders fundamentally about applications which can work there and

fundamentally for people to see applications which have worked in different parts of the world which can be taken elsewhere so all of those are available those are resources which we

want to share these are resources we want to want to actually give and most importantly as I said I think if there is one thing that this summit reflects. For the first time, we've actually

democratized AI. We've shown you what democratic AI looks like when people are let into the rooms, when people are let into the halls and they can see um for themselves as to how this would work. So

it gives me immense pleasure that uh you know and a very very key partner for us in all of this has been the Gates Foundation right from the very outset right from the planning stage of how we

wanted to do this uh this particular part of uh uh the set of sessions on the global south is something that we worked closely with curated carefully we've put together sessions which will be relevant

to this group and we've always made sure that in addition to this of course uh on every occasion whether it is in the space of DPI or whether it is in the space of uh uh any of the other

applications we are in a position to support it under one of our organizations the national institute of smart governance we have now put in a center which is fundamentally focused on

international cooperation so that they can actually provide uh uh uh support to other countries where DPIs are to be actually implemented how to ground them and it is

it is we are We we believe that probably the most effective way of dealing with this is to actually be able to cooperate amongst ourselves so that we are able to take it out. We are able to learn from

each other. We are able to contribute to each other and that is something we are now really ready to do. India knows what it is to be deprived of or denied technology. India knows what it is to

actually try and work your way past it. We've managed to do that. We've managed to democratize it. We've managed to make it available to people at scale. We have tried to keep it open source. We've

tried to protect it in a number of ways from cyber attacks and each of those areas. So in this entire technology stack, there is experience, there is the way that we've leapfrogged different

stages. So I think if we work together in the AI space, likewise there is so much that can be accomplished and uh we we we undertake as a as a nation. I think I can say with responsibility that

we will have devices and we will have structures through which we can sort of deepen this uh cooperation. We can deepen the support. We can enable this in a number of ways and continue to stay

engaged through the Gates Foundation through the other institutions to actually make this happen. So thank you very much. Thank you to Gates Foundation for curating this particular event and

thanks to all of you for participating in this. I mean it's one thing to arrange it, one thing to organize it but another thing for all of you to actually come up here put up with some of the

inconvenience which should have been caused. India is not a very convenient country at best of times but uh India is a country with spirit and uh and and and India is a country

which fixes things quickly. So, so, so, so we've we've we've sort of I think it's just been a story of continuous improvement and we will stay together, stay engaged and the same spirit of

excitement, energy and engagement should continue. Thank you very much. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; We all should give a ching away for a great summit. I think it's been a

fantastic week for all of us. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you. &gt;&gt; We should have a picture with you. Um, Secretary of

&gt;&gt; I know. &gt;&gt; Would you mind We can stand here. All the best. Hello sandalation

congratulating successful. Thank you so much. She's a director of multilateral and senior. &gt;&gt; Okay, we have some time with us. How much? 5 minutes. Uh and we need to have

uh a question to Sunil. Uh he has been working at you know so many interesting I mean I listen to the stories of uh Vadwaning AI and uh they inspire you thoroughly. So uh Sunil I'll give it to

you. I want uh you know I want people to hear your message that how can these uh work that has been done in India how can it help global south. &gt;&gt; So as uh Mr. K of Smart Africa said uh

15 minutes ago the challenges that we have in in the global south generally Africa India other countries are similar the values we have more importantly are very similar the strengths that we bring

to the table in terms of our talent our youth etc are similar so I think it's mutual learning it's not one way it's not that we've developed great stuff in India that can just be you taken over.

It's mutual learning on both sides. It's a mutual sharing of ideas. There are lots of very good things happening in Africa, in Asia that we can learn from over here. Uh on the technology side, as

you were saying, Shalon, we've been fortunate. We've had a government that is very pro technology. uh they've there's a tremendous um range of digital public infrastructure that we can access

in India that enables that provides data pipelines. It provides digital distribution systems without which none of this AI can scale. uh there's been a very clear regulatory framework for AI

that's been developed in India that really helps and most important there's an openness in government and I think it's driven by the prime minister's vision and belief that technology and AI

can truly transform societal development. So those to me are the big things more than individual AI solutions that really make a difference and I see that happening in Africa and many

countries. &gt;&gt; Sure. Thank you so much. Um I think we are literally at the eve of the summit getting over. It's been a fantastic week.

Uh meeting the best of the people, listening to the best of the sessions, navigating the traffic. Yes. But like secretary Krishnan said that you know we fix everything. So I just want to have

one last question to each of the panelist. Uh what's the best thing you liked of the summit and to you first? I mean one moment one feeling that you will carry forward.

&gt;&gt; I will give you a counter intuitive answer. AI is making the world move faster and faster and faster. And all the traffic challenges we've had over here are

teaching us patience. You will get there. Things will happen. Life will go on. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. She's the one feeling you you'll you'll travel back with back

to Africa. &gt;&gt; I think &gt;&gt; Yeah, this is &gt;&gt; No, this Max again. I think my my best moment is and I'm going to pick and be

selfish at in the moment in Aubberai when I stood and saw this diverse sea of faces. I think about 300 people and we all celebrating like we can do this as the global south. This is happening in

our tough and this belief that the global south has something to offer into this AI conversation. So no it's no longer a two horse race it's a multiple horse race. Thank you.

For me is uh you know our vision is to transform Africa into a single digital market. Coming here this summit shows me already our future having 1.4 billion people under one

regulation. How does it feel like? [laughter] So you know what I'm talking about that's one of our obstacles says regulatory harmonization India you do

not have that multicultural you have a multicultural multilanguage you have a multi what does it feel like including the traffic in the morning as well of course

thank you &gt;&gt; yeah sure and my best moment uh for the summit was that back in Obero on 18th evening several partners across Italy Kenya Anthropic Google

um you know Carnegie Of Gates uh ast uh stood next to Nandanda and we all like came together for 100 pathways uh to 20 till 2030 and we all were together and we were not doing that non-

collaboration pictures which is going on in Insta right we were all together right so it was AI is about collaboration not competition that's that's a theme thank

Thank you. Really enjoyed listening to you. You're the guest, man. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Mr. &gt;&gt; Pleasure.

Wonderful.
