## 📝 Summary

Many countries are developing strategies for sovereign AI capabilities. Not all nations, especially LMICs, can have total control of the supply chain for their own AI stack. Such nations need the ability to have agency and control of their own AI. This panel will discuss the requirements for sovereign AI, the role private and public organisations play in delivering this, and the mechanisms that can be deployed to ensure a trustworthy and responsible AI stack.
