## 📝 Transcript

been uh an major figure in international policy for the United States uh and in education at the Belelfer Center where our objective is to uh teach, train and do research on subjects related to the

applications of science and technology for international affairs. Uh we have scholars, practitioners, students uh all working to address the gaps and the opportunities for technology, science

and geopolitics. Um I'm very delighted to have everybody here today. Uh the emerging tech program which I have the honor of of running was launched about a year ago specifically

to look at where emerging technologies are creating new policy frontiers, new opportunities to use policy to or to use technology to engage in policy and the implications that technologies are

creating for governance, geopolitics, global stability and global conflict. Um and the move 37 initiative that we're here to talk to you about today uh is a part of that program. Um as you can

imagine and a program that's relating technologies to modern issues around geopolitics that artificial intelligence is one of the major aspects of our work. Um we have a terrific panel here today.

I it's my pleasure to introduce them by name and we'll talk a little bit more about each one in just a moment. Um the missing chair um which is uh which we expect shortly is Gabriella Ramos who's

the former assistant director general for social and human sciences at UNESCO. uh Nandita Balakrishnan is the director of intelligence at the special competitive studies project in

Washington and Robin Scott is the CEO and co-founder of a political and then at the far end two of my colleagues uh researchers on our program uh at the Belelfer Center. Charlie Pausniaak is a

full-time fellow with the program research fellow with the program and Savina Aniva is a current student within our program uh an MPP student at the Belelfr Center. I also want to

acknowledge a colleague of ours who is not here was not able to get to India in time for the conference uh Conor Artigus uh who is the former co-chair of the UN uh AI advisory panel uh who has been an

integral part of starting this work uh and and the uh ongoing progress we are making. Um Conor is also the um uh Spain India ambassador for uh for AI high commissioner in Spain India for AI um

and is here with us in spirit and maybe even on the live stream that we're doing here today. So a big shout out to Carmen for all of her help. So um so why are we here? Uh we are embarking on a major new

project uh specifically looking at the use of artificial intelligence in diplomacy and negotiation. Um we are here at a conference about the use of artificial intelligence and the

implications of artificial intelligence in so many aspects of society. Uh and our work is looking at how one will engage non-human intelligences in the process of diplomacy and negotiation. Um

so we're here because this is a broadbased project. It is not uh something that is solely the purview of a small team in Cambridge where we are located but something that we are

looking for collaborators, partners and input from the community here and the community around the world as we build what will surely be a place where AI is used and surely will be a place where we

need to be cognizant and careful about AI. AI will be used in that in that exercise. Um so the work we do plays on uh an increasingly bigger role in shaping the relationships between states

and within states. Uh we want to have this conversation about the role for AI spec specifically because of the global nature and the integrated way that AI will play and more specifically how will

we use artificial intelligence tools to augment humans in what is at its core a fundamentally human process of negotiation and diplomacy. Um, diplomatic negotiations are very high

stakes. They are very different, as you will hear from our team, very different than classic one-on-one win-lose negotiations or win-win negotiations. They are very much more complex than

that. And that means they require both a unique human touch and a unique application of how artificial intelligence might be used in that process. But it's an also area an area

where an enormous amount of potential exists to tackle resource constraints to find better outcomes and to use artificial intelligence to enable a more stable and prosperous world and one for

which the followup to negotiations can be uh a subject for the tools and applications of modern technology. How we go about that is crucial and how we talk about it from the beginning is

crucial. There are already a number of tools emerging in this space but it's our belief that a more rigorous approach is needed and you'll hear some of that in just a moment. Um so what are we

going to do? Our team is going to do a brief overview of the way we are thinking about this problem and after that we're going to have this amazing panel that we will uh engage in a

conversation about views from others who are involved in negotiation andor diplomacy writ large and their views on how technology can be used be used well or be used not so well and what the

implications of that will be. So with that let me turn it over to Charlie and Savina to talk about the project itself. I think Slovenia is up first. Thank you, Michael. Um, and thank you

all for being here this morning. Uh, a big welcome. Um, over the next 10 minutes or so, Charlie and myself would like to present you with a little bit of a framing for the expert discussion that

we'll be getting into uh, right after. We'll broadly focus on three areas. How do negotiation processes currently look and the complexity that comes with them? The potential for AI to augment many of

these challenges and processes thinking beyond just LLMs and the need for responsible deployment uh of these tools. Before we do that, I'd like you to close your eyes and imagine you walk

into a negotiation, you look down at the agenda and there's 10 items on it. But as any good negotiator, you know that it's not just about those 10 items. It's a lot of other factors that are

happening both inside and outside that room that are affecting how that negotiation process is happening. So for one example, you're sitting across seven counterparts from seven political

groups, seven different countries and [snorts] behind you, you have your own team, but also 27 other countries that you're representing that you've promised a certain outcome or a certain deal. Of

course, this is not my story. It's the story of Carme Artigus uh that Michael mentioned who was one of the chief negotiate negotiators of the EU AI act and later the UN AI advisory body and

many other negotiations. But it's not just her story. It's the story of many of you. It's uh the negotiations that you've engaged in at the UN at COP bilateral negotiations,

inter agency negotiations within your own organizations. So you know very well that negotiations are complex and they evolve over time. So what might look like just two states negotiating with

each other bilaterally is actually a whole set of issues that are on the table. Could be natural resources, it could be AI, it could be climate and a whole lot of external and internal

stakeholders that are also trying to influence that process. We start to dive into some of this complexity. And more than that, there's a lot of teams that are sitting behind these

principal negotiators. the different departments and agencies that are supporting them with evidence, with documents. And we'd really like to stress that this is a fundamentally

interpersonal process. We're not looking to replace diplomats or negotiators here, but just to give them the tools to manage these complexities much better. And finally, rarely in this world do we

have just two states negotiating nowadays. Uh there's often a third state at the table. In the case of the EU, maybe 27 member states. and of course a lot of uh hundreds of uh others that

could be out there. So with that being said, what are some of the impacts of this complexity? Well, for one, there's a whole lot of information that needs to be managed. Uh there's a simple

negotiation can generate thousands of documents, transcripts, drafts. On top of that, there's a certain amount of finite resources that any team has as they uh grapple with many other

challenges throughout the day. There's a lot of strategic elements. Uh sometimes in groups you might have a group think or hurting that uh leads you in one direction um as opposed to exploring

your full set of options. And finally there's the time pressure. So most negotiations do have some sort of time element uh and handover element to future teams. So with that being said,

how can AI help? And I'd like to turn over to Charlie here. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Um thanks Lavina. So AI systems can now beat some of the best human players at

Go, at chess, at video games, at board games. Uh, language models, as we've heard, have become increasingly competent at delivering a range of sophisticated uh, legal, academic,

technical, software contributions. The pace of change has been staggering. And so what our interdicciplinary team has been looking at is we're trying to envision a better future for diplomacy

where computational methods can transform the practice of diplomatic negotiations and statecraftraft that Savina just outlined. So supporting better communications, better

resolutions and processes between states uh can augment their functions. So we're trying to chart existing technical tools, develop new ones, and provide a range of policy guidelines to ensure

that this happens responsibly, safely, effectively. So the classic question that we get in response is why can't you just ask an LLM? Lots of people are interested in trying to see if language

models can simulate diplomacy or if chatbots can guide people through a negotiation all in one step. But ultimately, language models are remarkable and their use should be

carefully scoped for three key reasons. Firstly, that their fluency isn't necessarily verifiable in this international uh in world politics. Secondly, that the opacity where you

can't tell what's going on inside a model is not always verifiable. High state is not always um viable because high stakes negotiations require um accountability both democratically and

internally to understand why recommendations shape treaties in certain ways. And additionally, there's a toolkit that's 80 years old. Here we have game theory, decision analysis,

machine learning, a great range of of theoretical developments that exist precisely to model strategic interactions under uncertainty. And so we see LLM is playing this role at the

heart of a really broad set of learning paradigms that's tying together well both like supervised and unsupervised self-supervised learning here. But LLMs provide a really strong way to um

interact with all of these different um learning paradigms and uh technical architectures that the best advances in AI have been built from. So whether that's the the systems that play chess

or go or board games, these are all pulling together lots of different methods. And if we just rely on chat bots at the heart of things, we miss out on all of the technical developments

that the last 80 years have experienced. But there are three key challenges with trying to expand these um expand these techniques into the world of diplomacy and world politics. Firstly,

representation. As Savina was touching on, the game that's being played here isn't a board game. These are things that are these interactions are fundamentally changeable over time. The

institutions that constrain the actions of states can be made and unmade over the course of a negotiation. inference. Like these are environments where there's real strategic misrepresentation

where people are lying or deceiving or trying to shape outcomes for their own advantages in ways that the current methods aren't quite well suited to handle. And finally, there's uh as we're

touching on, there's this sense of specifying success. How can you bring together all of the different counterparts and come up with a relatively set coherent set of

preferences and priorities over the course of a really massive negotiation? So these are three challenges that we're trying to embark on. And one of the ways that we're approaching this is by

breaking down the um uh the tasks of diplomacy and the tasks of negotiation um for AI applications. So just broadly one of the ways we've looked at this is saying that there are some foundational

tasks of research, analysis, strategizing and execution that build this build this evidence base with research that analysis processes the the information that you've managed to

gather. Strategizing relies on on using the analysis and the research to come up with a map from your preferences to your outcomes. And then finally in the room executing a negotiation, you've got to

be able to dynamically adapt and adjust over time. And this isn't a linear process, but a re-entrant cyclical sense of you have all of these things as they change uh feeding up through this like

knowledge base. And so you need this really strong computational infrastructure to be able to even begin to um like apply some of the really exciting and fascinating AI and ML

methods we're touching on. So with this we see a future where um research can be done with autonomous research agents and you can have source validations and again immediately generated counterpart

biographies um analysis of gaps and preferences and evidence bases strategy sandboxes red team training and trying to simulate how both the public might respond or how different parties might

respond and then in real time having transcription and um translation services that AI and ML um methods are doing a really phenomenal job All of these things we think will play a

role in this multimodel, multimemethod world of of computational support for uh diplomacy negotiations. Um and so this is just a sense of how we've tried to break down this problem and get a get a

grasp on the existing and future technical developments. Finally, we want to end on these three commitments that are central to a lot of the stuff that we're talking about. One, human

authority has to remain central. we can't have um any objection for of responsibility over decisions of war and peace. Uh we have to make sure that the tools themselves are are modular and

transparent so that you can see what's happening at each stage of the process and which parts of which computational systems are supporting um a supporting analysis and then finally making sure

the augmentation is appropriately scoped for the team the institution and the the setting that it's in. So with that, I'd like to hand over to Michael and the panel um our director of the program and

um what I hope will be a wonderful discussion on some of these issues. Thanks so much. &gt;&gt; Great. Thanks Charlie. Thanks Lavina. So just as everybody's sort of getting

settled in, so we have a a plan for a project. We have a vision of how uh one has a set of signposts and goalposts in what is essentially the ability to augment with intelligence, human

intelligence and participation. Um So there are lots of technical elements of that. Uh we'll be developing tools. We're looking at evaluation methodologies etc etc etc for all the

technical side. But one of the benefits of the approach we're taking is that we have access to a large body of people for whom the day-to-day practice of negotiation diplomacy not necessarily

constrained by the definition of diplomacy meaning stateto state to get to an answer but organization to organization people to people negotiation to negotiation. And I am

delighted then to have three people here who can talk a little bit about their their views on how artificial intelligence will be used in the process of their work that allows us to then

learn from that experience and how we map that into the move 37 project. So Gabriella, let me start with you. Welcome. Uh thank you for for negotiating all the traffic to get here.

So um so you've been at the center of international policy design and negotiations uh on issues such as climate change, international taxation, gender equality, uh artificial

intelligence, a whole list of things in in a brilliant career. You've done this through key roles at UNESCO, but also uh at the G20 and G7 and at the OECD. We're delighted to have you here. Let me ask

you just to sort of start the discussion if you would to just talk a little bit about what it's like to sit in the driver's seat as a mediator trying to bridge sides and how you would think

about AI capability augmenting you in that process. &gt;&gt; Well, thank you. Thank you so much for inviting me &gt;&gt; uh for for inviting me to this uh early

morning. uh and and I I I find this topic fascinating because when you are a diplomat and when you have negotiated many um standards or agreements, you don't

think about uh this uh taxonomy. You never think about the taxonomy. You just think that you need to get it at some day and that you need to find consensus and that you need to find where the

problems will be. And therefore, it's very interesting that you asked me something to structure better how we do things. And I'm going to refer to the to the negotiation of the recommendation on

the ethics of artificial intelligence because that was a very difficult one. 193 countries negotiating during COVID and actually it was very helpful to have a zoom where I could see where all the

countries were positioning themselves which actually helped a lot. But the interesting thing is that it was about artificial intelligence. So we were negotiating and we have to map out where

countries were and it was very interesting to see that some of the usual suspects that are always blocking the effectiveness of uh international instruments were aligning with countries

that are very supportive of those but that didn't want to see UNESCO playing a role in this field. So I have Russia and I have UK in the same position. That helped me because I called the UK and

say are you happy to be in the same position and then they just hold one second but the interesting thing is it's a very heavy document is very very because there are so many cultures we

had to almost define the step by step and the interesting thing is that uh when thinking how can AI help us organize better at the moment u it did not provide with so many inputs it was

2021 But uh UNESCO has this idea of being super inclusive. We developed the recommendation with all the regions in the world represented and all the

disciplines but then we put it out to the world and we receive 55,000 comments. Therefore, we use AI to integrate them. That was uh no. But then when you think

about how do you map the positioning of countries, I think that would have been super useful to have more AI. Uh I I used to have full teams providing me with briefings for the people we were

going to talk because you need to be conducting a lot of one thing is the negotiation in the room. Another thing is all the leg work that you need to be doing talking to the different actors

knowing where they stand. That would have been amazing just to have a repository of what is the traditional position of certain countries or certain negotiations which had to do with the

substance but probably has to do also with the positioning of that country in the international context and how much they abide by the rules and how much they support these these things. Uh and

then the what I find fascinating but this is always as uh my colleagues here said how you keep the woman the the woman in the loop. I love it. Yes, woman in the loop. Not human in the loop.

Human in the loop. It was a lap &gt;&gt; lost. It's not lost on me. My panelists here are all, you know, helping. &gt;&gt; It was a lapsu, but I like my laps. Uh the the whole point is is uh when you

are in front of a person and you're trying to convince that person that he's alone, nobody's supporting his position and therefore he should not continue blocking the negotiation. How would it

be that you can have more information about that person? What moves them? How can you no offer something that will be important for them? Because this is the kind of things that we do negotiating.

What would you want to have out of it? I know you have your bosses in your shoulder and you need to bring them something to the table, but but tell them you're alone, that you're blocking

it and and imagine you can have the information about that person. But that's also risky because it it deals with privacy and all of those things. But I feel it would be fantastic because

this is strategic thinking and using the right words to get the the countries to agree that that will bring you on some places and that's a capacity that can be augmented by AI.

&gt;&gt; Thank you very much. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Is it on? Yeah. Thank you very much for actually it's a terrific transition because Charlie was talking about the complexity of these

negotiations about how they're not dynamic. I can think of nothing more dynamic than a UNESCO negotiation. Just trying to understand where people's positions are by itself is a complexity.

Trying to integrate 20 or 30 of those positions or 190 of those positions and then trying to find what are the right levers that I might be able to pull. We do this now all the time with people

with you and the question is how can modern tools help in that process without removing or absolving responsibility for people. So thank you. So Nandida um you have had an amazing

career in academia uh the public the private sector you've been at Stanford you've worked in intelligence and uh and advisory and you've seen all sides of these negotiations both from the

government side the private sector side inside and outside. You are currently at the uh the director of intelligence at the special competitive studies project. For those of you who don't know, SCSP is

a major effort uh funded by Eric Schmidt, sponsored by Eric Schmidt after the conclusion of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence in the US uh in the way that technology

will be used in competition for economics, national security, etc. So, it's a big broad role. Every day you are negotiating. Every day in your life you have negotiating. So can I just ask you

to talk a little bit about your view both from an SCSP point of view but also from your career about how you would see this evolving? &gt;&gt; Absolutely and thank you so much for

having me and good morning everyone. Um so my career as you mentioned it sort of spanned three distinct sectors and they kind of came at different times. Academia, public sector and private

sector. Now there was a time I would say that all three of these groups would have the particular ways they would have leveraged technology would have obviously its variations but the and

adoption of it were much more similar. This is just fundamentally not true of AI. The public sector has been more in the passenger seat if not the back seat especially over the last decade. And so

what was really interesting to me is I started in academia then went to the public sector came out of the private sector and I saw that like dip in my access to AI. Now I have been in

intelligence and one important thing about um intelligence and maybe a misconception of it is that it is primarily used for military um feeding information for military applications.

It's not true. We are just as vital to diplomatic efforts because every opportunity you're looking for that something bad could happen, you're just as much looking at what are the

opportunities for something positive happen. How can you open the negotiating space? So we're looking at everything from both sides of that perspective. um as an analyst I can say personally I it

was very valuable to have the rigorous training I had to do things very very manually so learning how to write an assessment without the access to AI but now that I'm on the back end of it I can

tell you every day I I ask myself it's like if I had had access to these tools as an analyst how could I have worked much faster and much smarter because at the end of the day and this something

like Gabriela was mentioning there's a lot of data out there but a human anal is never going to be able to manually process most of that by themselves. Um, the story I always like to tell is I my

the very first time I wrote this intelligence piece, I was so proud of it. I thought the argumentation was great. The data I had used was great. I showed it to a mentor and they said,

"This is awesome." But you didn't consider this one piece of data from 10 years ago that completely negates your argument. And here's the thing, it's not that I didn't do good work. It's just

that there was no way I was going to know that that piece of information exists. Now, imagine a tool that help you not only identify that that data exists, but learn how to synthesize it.

Now, obviously, as Charlie and Sabina mentioned, human in the loop is always going to be important because you want these assessments to have a human level at the end of it. But there is a way to

move better and smarter. And this is something that SCSP is really advocating for in sort of three distinct ways. So, first, at a very meta level, we we make the argument that AI has fundamentally

changed the threat landscape and the the scope for global competition. It is now sort of the foundational way we need to think about geopolitics especially as this technology is rapidly evolving. So

you really cannot divorce AI and AI adoption um when you're trying to understand geopolitics and foreign policy. Number two, in order to have an ability to make assessments about this

emerging technology to understand geopolitics, you have to have a public sector that is actually leveraging these tools to the best of their ability. Now there are a lot of ways that AI is being

adopted at the public sector in the public sector. You know, you're obviously thinking about sort of the again military applications of drones, but you need to have your day-to-day

workflows integrating this technology. And this is something that we are really focusing on, especially of how to build up AI literacy within the public sector. not just at the military level but

within the intelligence community within the state department and even within like commerce OPM all the like any federal sector employee at some point needs to be moving far smarter and

faster with AI and third we're looking at the like specific use cases so one of the projects that we were working on last year is looking at how AI can be used for predicting geopolitical events

both for military applications but also for state department applications so and the reason we do that is because in order to convince the public that they should be using you almost need to show

them how it could look like 10 years from now as we're moving to that future. So by kind of demystifying its use and showing them targeted ways that you can use it, it actually solves your meta

problem of understanding why AI is so important to geopolitics. &gt;&gt; Fantastic. So I'm hearing a couple of things. I'm hearing this general statement that uh much of the world is

going to be about AI and much of the world is going to be AI creating that world. And that's metaphor that comes directly to the project we're looking at which is we're negotiating with AI

tools. We have to have a baseline of capability and yet the landscape in which negotiation and diplomacy are happening is being fundamentally changed by AI itself. And so that whole issue

around preparedness and around setting the ground rules. I also heard not just the thought process around artificial intelligence as a as a trusted agent to accumulate information. Both of you that

but also as an agent to help understand new pathways for success, new pathways for leverage, whether those are national security or whether those are economic vitality. The the the scope of the

negotiations doesn't really change that. So in the area of sort of preparation, let me come to you Robin. Robin is the co-founder and CEO of Apolitical. Apolitical is a global platform for

policy makers that specializes in government innovation. She'll talk about that in just a second. uh in particular you've courses in helping governments prepare their workforces for the modern

world in which they live. Your AI courses have reached hundreds of thousands of people around the world. Uh and much of what you are trying to do is to prepare the world for the kind of

things that we are talking about in move 37 obviously much broader than just that topic. So let me ask you to talk a little bit about that if you wouldn't mind. what sort of lessons you've

learned from the field uh and how you think about policy makers willingness or how you change policy makers willingness to embark on journeys with new tools and new capabilities.

&gt;&gt; Thank you so much. It's great to be here. Let me let me set the scene a little bit and then provide some of the data we've gathered which I think uh shines a light on those questions. Is

this mic working well? So I co-ounded Apolitical just over 10 years ago with a mission to make government smarter to deliver for people in the planet. So we've always been

about outcomes and we've always been at our heart a network for the public sector. The 200 million people working in core government units, 600 million in the wider public sector. So it's the

world's largest workforce. Fast forward to today, that word smarter has of course taken on new meaning in the the age of AI. What we look like is we're a network um on our core platform

of over half a million public servants in 160 countries. That spans all levels of government, local through to multilateral. It includes non-elected and uh political public servants. It

includes diplomats. And then our training and tools are integrated into government platforms reaching a further 40 million public servants around the world. So we have a lot of data and a

kind of real time pulse on how governments are adapting to the age of AI and AI is everywhere. It is kind of the water in which we we are we are the fish now. We're soon not going to

recognize that we in the water. So it we do a lot of work on climate and energy and it's for example and it's even it's dominating that too.

We have uh to today trained a little under 400,000 public officials globally in the responsible use of AI that spans fundamentals through to uh more domain specific uh applications such as uh AI

in climate for example we tend to work with leading universities such as um Stanford HAI um is one of our collaborators. So we are more text experts than content experts and we

bring the content experts into the middle. So where are we at? Let me give you some data and this is from a a 5,000 person survey that we've recently run. Overall public servants are incredibly

optimistic about AI. Um north of 90% think there is huge possibility in the public sector and there lots of paradoxes here. They're also wary of it, right?

uh there is a huge value creation opportunity. One figure from BCG estimates that there one point there's 1.75 trillion of public sector value to be unlocked if we

harness AI in the right way because AI loves bureaucracy all these repeatable processes and uh you know about a third of most public officials daily work is research

and writing related AI is great at that. So the prize is very very big and that's just the painkiller prize. When you get to the vitamin prize, when you get to what AI could do in terms of predictive

policy making and responsive policy and adaptive policy, etc. then you get into a a space that's only really bounded by the imagination. So there's lots of AI talk. There's less

AI action. Uh increasingly we're in a pilotis zone where almost everyone's got pilots. 70% of leaders say they either got AI pilots or plan to launch them this year, but only 45% of them say they

have any plan to evaluate their pilots. So that's a pretty big gap to close. And we see gap gaps like this all the time. One of the biggest gaps is leaders not using the technology themselves, which

is a real problem because you can't understand this technology in the abstract. You cannot look over your grandson's shoulder and see them using it. You've got to use it. You've got to

feel the speed of of change of the public servants who are implementing AI in the public sector globally. These are people who self-identify of AI having AI in their

jobs. Only 26% of them say they understand their own country's ethical frameworks. So approximately three quarters of all the people rolling out this technology are freestyling.

That's terrifying. So that's that's a skills and knowledge gap not even closed within an institution. It's not even getting to how do we actually understand the the basics of this technology.

Just to to close and there's a whole lot more fascinating data, but one of the things that is increasingly worrying me talking to leaders around the world working on this is that we are now

getting quite drunk on the idea of AI agency, [clears throat] but we're not talking about human agency in the process and maintaining it. So I think we risk

getting into a zero sum dynamic where and I think this is relevant to diplomacy where the agency drains away to AI and that all comes at a cost to humans. So we need to be building up

humans at the same time and the framing and heruristic I found most helpful for this overall is this idea of that's recently emerged of being below or above the algorithm. If you're below the

algorithm, you might be an Uber driver being dispatched, an Amazon packing worker being allocated to put stuff into boxes. If you're above the algorithm, you are using tools to further your

goals. We need when we think about closing that capability gap and I think in diplomacy to keep moving people up above the algorithm. &gt;&gt; Right. Fantastic comments from from all

of you. Thank you. Um, I'm going to ask Charlie and Savina just a couple of quick comments to make comments on the project because then I'm going to come back to the three of you and I'll prompt

you with the question now, which is what what would you want to be comfortable with knowing about the tools and the capabilities that that you will be asked to use or be offered to use? So, Selena,

can can you just follow on on Robin's comments? One of the benefits we have of doing this program at the Belelfford Center and the Kennedy School is a large set of people who have done this for a

living. This is what diplomats and negotiators done. Can you talk a little bit about how we engage that group and what we're trying to get from that? &gt;&gt; Definitely. So I think um as Michael put

it obviously at the the Belelfer Center we have a quite a variety of current former uh diplomats practitioners not just from the US but from all over the world and a large part of the work that

we've been doing is sitting down for one-on-one interviews with all of them uh and really getting a sense of how they think not just about the content of the major negotiations that they've been

leading but more about the process. So very similar to the the panel discussion we're having here today uh what are some of the uses that you see one day you could be using AI for? So a lot of what

we've heard so far. I mean, the position tracking that I think Gabriella referenced, we've heard a lot about historical precedent, the generating of options and strategic options and really

uncovering the the deepest interests. And I think what this ties really well to what Robin was saying is a lot of them are are also expressing their hesitancy. So, they're being very

forthcoming in that. And I think that allows us to take a really sober look at what are the risks of integrating these tools. U one of the main questions we get is if uh if you're using these

tools, we ask them what would you like to know? So exactly what what Michael's saying now. So a lot of um these interviews have really been integrated across the different work streams of our

project and we really put diplomats and practitioners at the heart of the rest of the work that we're doing. Great. Thank you. And Charlie, you talked a little bit before about, you know,

there's an obvious role that LLMs can play in helping people accumulate and synthesize a very large amount of information, but there are many more aspects of a negotiation. Can you talk

just a little bit about some of the other ways the tools are going to be used in the project that we're doing? &gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely. Thanks so much and thanks so much for the comments as well.

So far, panelists have touched on a couple of really interesting applications whether it's um uh especially as Robin was talking about with predictive or adaptive policies if

you're looking at and as well with the predictive geopolitical events. We have a really fascinating array of um algorithms that are incredibly competent at these sorts of like predictive tasks.

And what we now have with computational ability and also the ability of language models is we can process vast amounts of unstructured data in ways that makes these algorithms

even more accessible to a wider range of people. Um so I think that that's one area that I'm particularly excited about. There's also a bunch of stuff as um as Gabriella was touching on is how

do you take these vast unstructured transcripts and come up with um natural language processing um additions on top and can we represent uh positions as they track and change over time. And I

think like that is uh one of the big parts of cognitive load that I think diplomats have spoken about a lot. &gt;&gt; Great. Thank you. We're going to ask see if questions from the audience here in

just a moment, but Nandid, I'm going to start with you. I'm going to forgive me for doing this. I'm going to characterize your career as an analyst. &gt;&gt; Every job that I read and see about has

been an analyst of some kind. You're constantly in a place where people are suggesting new tools and new cap. So, think about AI in the world you've in inhabited. what what's going to make you

most comfortable when somebody shows up and says here's a thing that's going to make your life better &gt;&gt; that they can explain what the outputs are. This is so one of the things like

when we're talking looking at for example could be using AI for predicting geopolitical events a lot of people both in industry um in academia and in the public sector that are working on these

types of projects they all say the same thing which is this should be seen as a data point or a shaper of the way you should view the world not as finished intelligence. Finished intelligence

should always ultimately be done by a human who is accountable to their policy makers. Now, if you are working in policy, you understand actually how this works. You'll have your head of state or

your head of government come to you and exp ask you to explain exactly how you got to your assessment. Right now, we have a human who ultimately has to do that. But what happens when we're

starting to rely more and more on AI tools is you never want to lose that ability to explain the outputs and particularly demonstrate that you've looked at all the counter points that

you could possibly do. Now, this is where I think AI is super helpful because often times when I was trying to figure out like what especially in academia like what are all the things I

could have done wrong how could I have measured this differently you're always prepared to thinking about all the decisions that you made and how to justify and validate them but as the

scenarios get broader as they get more complicated your ability to figure out what the counter arguments are are going to just dwindle over time like you are oftentimes the argument we make is that

humans are biased at the end of the day we make our decisions based on our how we got to where we are today all the experience that you have so AI can be really really helpful in helping you

sort out the counter arguments, but you still need to understand how those counter arguments work and why ultimately you've come to the assessment that you have. So where I would feel

super comfortable is this is how I relied on AI. This is how it came to the output that it did. This is fundamentally why I made the assessment that I did.

&gt;&gt; Great. Thank you. And Robin, I I think this is the world you live in every day of helping governments and government officials and civil service workers. So project that onto an AI for diplomacy

landscape. What do you think is going to be important to get people to say, "I'm going to trust this. I'm going to work it, but I'm at least going to try." &gt;&gt; Well, at the risk of stating the

obvious, I think we should just acknowledge that the people developing these models don't even have full legibility over how they're working. So, so that's where we starting from. So,

that is the that's the kind of ceiling on on where we can get to. Now you can you can break down the the thinking process as it were but um you still have that black box. I don't think it's

insurmountable. I think some of the things I'm worried about is relates to the more psychological aspect of this and in particular sleeping at the wheel this phenomenon where we we have this

strange relationship with AI where we get false negatives too quickly. So it like does a bunch of clever things except it didn't do this one thing and therefore we can't use it for anything.

And if you check back in in like a month's time often it can do the thing. So you have that the false negative and then the phenomena of sleeping at the wheel is where it starts to get very

very good up you know creeping upwards of like 85 90% accuracy and then you assume it's 100% accurate and it's really quite hard to edit your assumptions and say no it's not and I

you've probably all found this if if they're power users of AI and I'm one of them sometimes it comes across as so smart and so brilliant and comes up with a whole lot of counter arguments. I use

it for sort of kicking the tires from different perspectives all the time on stuff I'm doing that it's it's almost overwhelmingly smart and you're like it must have covered everything. That's a

default. So I think giving us the human tools and the psychological uh sort of um counterarguments and weaponry to deal with this is really really important. I already have a

[clears throat] heristic that whenever I open my phone and I'm dealing with anything with an algorithm, I am in opposition to that algorithm because its interests don't generally coincide with

mine. So I try and get all the algorithmic stuff off my phone. It's like a starting point. But I the dynamic with AI is a bit different, but I still think we have to like you have to have

that sort of battle mentality uh with the technology. So that would be my there many other things to consider, but that's top of mind. I think that's terrific and I think you know I think

this idea of calibrating on the use like what I want from a completeness when I ask for analysis may be very different than what I want from a can you just give me some different ideas that I

haven't thought about before and different stages in a negotiation are going to require different levels of calibration. So Gabriella what do you think? Well, it's it's very difficult to

follow these two girls. But the the fact is that uh when you know a little bit more about how these things work, I'm not I'm not a technologist, but I have been looking at all of what can go

wrong, misrepresentation, uh over representation of certain cultures, certain languages, assumptions. Therefore, if I am negotiating and and

you're going to offer me a tool to improve my negotiation skills, I need to be sure that uh the assumptions that you use to build that tool are not just to beat the person in front of me, are not

just to maximize efficiency, are not just to do the kind of things that we are teaching the AI to do and therefore is much more complex because what you want to do is to open a space of human

understanding. How do you do that? And therefore, I will be questioning as Robin said, always questioning, but it's not what we do. And the other point is that the the

the AI, what is amazing is that it's just reproducing cognitive abilities that humans do. So when you go into the the the using whatever chat box you use to get information,

you take for granted what it comes out. what you would never do if you hire somebody in the first week. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; Even if you have done all the

checkpoints for that person to have the capacities that you are looking in the market. So I feel that there is this question of uh first uh really bringing to the table tools that are going to be

reliable and trustworthy and I know that these words are almost a cliche but the reality is that sometimes they're not. And the other point is that you can become very lazy and how do you avoid

just to grab the thing and say that's perfect. How do you keep that space for for ourselves to take the decisions and and be uh not only in the driver's seat but actually to think of AI as a a

supporter cast and if we get the no the the the Oscar is us and not the AI. &gt;&gt; That's fantastic. I have this I have this mental picture in my mind for those of you who done negotiations in any

kind. You know, the first thing you do is you grab a bunch of your team in a room and you say, "Let's talk about strategy and what are we going to do?" And you know, Bob in the corner says,

"Here's an option." And you you realize Bob had a bad night last night. So maybe you discount what Bob says. So what happens when the AI says, "Here's a thing. I don't just trust it, you know,

a priority. I have to apply a human judgment to what I'm hearing." So terrific points. Okay, we have time for a question or two and I see one. Just say who you are, where you're from and a

quick question. Michael, we have microphone. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thanks so much. I'm Sam Doors. I'm a senior adviser to the Oxford University

AI governance uh initiative and director of multilateral AI, but my background is in diplomacy working for Kofan as when he was secretary general and then for the foreign office and cabinet office. I

wish we' had AI tools back then. So, uh really I was really inspired. It's such a timely rich panel. So, thank you all for that. Something that Gabriella said around culture I think is

is so important and I'm I'm thinking about the positives and the and the risks with applying AI in this in this space. How can we ensure that the diverse uh

cultural inputs of different societies are uh embedded in the data sets and the models which inform negotiations? Um so is that something that UNESCO is working on long term and connects to the tools

we use? And the second question is around the flip side. Um if if AI is to be a a useful neutral mediator in disputes or an assistant to a mediator, human mediator, um then what do we do

about data poisoning and prompt injection um and those kinds of risks? Thank you. &gt;&gt; Probably very very fast on not that the question the question of culture

um culture is expressed by language. And therefore the more we can try to represent those languages in the models we use I think the best we will be

prepared to understand it. And and I'm fascinating by that. I'm I'm not a linguistic but if I would choose another life I will do that &gt;&gt; because because when you when you hear

for example there was this Namibian representative during the negotiations of the ethics of AI and she was saying I find your draft very individualistic it's always about the the human it's

always about the outcomes for people improving their welfare no and at the end what I'm thinking about is the Ubuntu philosophy which is I am because you are and we are

because is nature and we are interlin and therefore how do you capture this when the models that we are uh uh developing are maximizing individual welfare and so the only answer I have is

try to be representative and I think this is nothing new we have seen how much these uh tools can discriminate if you are just built in one language or with the representation of certain

characteristics of people or countries. Uh but but but really to be sure that you are capturing the richness that comes through language and and opening up the sources and that's the other

point the sources this is one thing that I would always ask the answer you're giving me is based on what sources and that will might help but these are checkpoints that we always need to be

testing on the ground. &gt;&gt; I think you also if I just raise one other thing I think you raised one other really important point which is you know there's a whole spectrum of things here.

There is negotiation because we have a set of interested parties to get to a common good understanding. We also have very adversarial negotiations. So adversarial negotiations open up this

whole possibility of data poisoning of training set differentiation etc. So it's a very complex word. I really appreciate you bringing it up. We have time for one more question I think.

Let's go right here. Can somebody can somebody tell me are we counting down to zero or are we counting down to five? Are we okay to keep going to zero here?

&gt;&gt; Okay, good. We're going to go to zero no matter what. &gt;&gt; Good morning. Good morning. Namaste. My name is Di Karo. I meet 300 to 600 people per day and uh I work around

different languages. So basically I'm an Indian classical dance teacher. &gt;&gt; Okay. So I have a data I have a a human connection. So and uh what we want to do

how this um cultural education can be supported by AI. So what is the step I can take further? Presently I'm actually working on a framework cultural framework which is uh India and UK uh

PCC 2025 2020. So I also interested in NEP and uh national health policy because people connected to their health and education which is a center center point. So where

I can go and what kind of uh cocreation collaboration should happen in this &gt;&gt; Robin is this something you want to jump in on? &gt;&gt; Maybe give her your email address. Huh?

I wish I had I wish I had an immediate uh response to that. I don't think there is any default place to go. But I do think this is where the conversation is evolving and there's more and more

recognition of the cultural oversight and importance. So I would just encourage you to please keep making those points. And I will just make one comment on the first question. The Swiss

have built it's kind of sort of a quasi Swiss government quasi multilateral initiative to build an LLM that is trained from the outset on more than a hundred languages and it is actually run

by a friend of mine who's a former Swiss diplomat. So she's coming at it very much with a diplomatic context. I'm very happy to make that connection. Education super complex. Don't look at

the technology because we always focus on the technology. The countries that have introduced so much technology in their educational systems didn't get better student outcomes because of

content. We go to the internet and we go to the systems and we try to bring tools to help kids and we never see if they are contextually relevant, culturally uh linked and therefore if you don't

produce the content the tools will not make it. I'll just add one last thing is I think the way to think about AI is also is is it actually solving a problem or are you just trying to introduce it

&gt;&gt; to create a new problem. I think this is where you have to think about uh the point of AI augmentation. Um I think there are a lot of ways we can think about how AI can augment the problem

sets that we have but sometimes you don't actually have the problem that AI is going to solve and you don't need to force AI to fix it. &gt;&gt; Great. Thank you very much. Okay, we're

going to negotiate. If you have a really quick question, you can ask it. No, behind you. Sorry. It's got to be quick though. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Uh my name is Arman. I'm working

for JPAL South Asia. Just a quick question on how do you think this would impact uh balance of power like given that every country had different access to the kind of data sets that they have

and as we saw there can be three states also in the play how it would look like state a knows everything about the rest of the players and the others don't. So yeah

&gt;&gt; I I so we think a lot about I'll answer this if you guys are okay. We think a lot about this in the project which is which is what's the evolution of a set of AI tools. It's like everything else

that we are here at this conference which is where will tools provide competitive leverage. Where are the kind of tools in the world we live in ones that should be dispersed actively and

offensively not defensively uh in a world where some of the negotiation is about getting everybody to a positive and some of the negotiation is adversarial. I think it is a huge

element of how it will change power structures not just because it's a thing we think about from a negotiation and diplomacy but because of general AI tools. Okay, with that we are just about

out of time. I want to thank this amazing panel uh Gabriella, Nandita and Robin. I want to thank my colleagues Savina and Charlie uh for and I want to thank all of you. We are at the

beginning of a long process. When you work at a place like I do at the Belelfur, you think about projects that have beginnings, middles, and ends, and you think about projects that can grow

into something really, really important. So, any of you who have interest in what we're doing, please let us know. If you feel like you have questions that we ought to be asking or you have answers

or you have answers to questions we have asked, we would love to hear from you as we begin to build what we think is a really important discipline. So, thank you and thank you to the sponsors and

hosts. I appreciate everybody joining us. Thank you. &gt;&gt; [applause] [applause] &gt;&gt; Sorry.

&gt;&gt; Uh ladies and gentlemen, please exit the room from your left side. Thank you.
