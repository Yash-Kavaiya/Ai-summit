## 📝 Transcript

we will explore how this synergy creates a third wave for inclusive sovereign and ethically aligned AI capacity building. So now I'll introduce our esteemed panelist uh Mr. Shriant Chandra Shakaran

country head and senior director India Dr. Vit director international neurodeenerative disorders re center INRC Czech Republic uh Dr. Lalit Patil Clara ethics and security specialist

INDRC uh Czech Republic Mr. Gokulidan Scientist Cedak. So with this uh we will start our panel discussion. So I take this privilege to moderate this session. So I have my first uh question to uh Dr.

Sri. So what is it e doing in the area of skilling and awareness especially with the focus on certification grand challenges and is there any program for children especially

thank you Romesh and by the way you didn't introduce yourself but uh uh and I'm not doctor I'm only mister uh just for the clarification uh so um I think u you know it is looking at AI

holistically right so uh Today we are looking at penetration of AI in the workforce. We are also have seeing a lot of penetration on usage of AI uh with the students and also I think the

dynamics of usage of AI with the penetration of mobile devices is significant amongst young children and I is looking at various programs when it comes to skilling and capacity building

across the segment across the society and how we can have a meaningful impact as AI is getting penetrated. Right? So [snorts] one of the programs that we have I think IT has been working on the

uh sociote techchnical standards for the past decade. We started this work in 2016 uh with a work that we did on ethically aligned design which eventually got translated into what we

call as the IT 7,000 series of standards uh which is looking at how do you embed ethical values and ethical systems as the technology is evolving right so on one hand we are seeing that technology

and the pace of evolution that is happening and uh we are already seeing systems that are already using AI in their products right so there There are two aspects when we talk about this uh

penetration of AI. One is how do you ensure that uh the products that are being built are actually following the principles right you know for making sure that uh uh they are used for the

there's no unintended use cases right how do you make sure that the governance of AI is managed at the same time how do you ensure that people are trained you know what they should be looking for

while designing these systems so we are looking at capacity building in both sides how can we train our people on standards You know we have some very interesting standards around it 7000

which is looking at ethical aspects around system level design. We have standards around AI procurement which is I 3119. Uh as you can imagine lot of procurement has embedded AI in it. How

do you how do government agencies look at these uh products these platforms which has embedded AI. So we are developing a series of training programs to train people to train individuals

whether they are from the industry or academia to understand what is going on and you know what is the standard talking about but at the same time we are also creating uh a use case business

case for being assessing systems in the market that are already available. So we have a program called IT E certified. Uh the IT certified has various layers the introductory layer and the advanced

layer where people can go through our training program and become assessors you know. So that means that they can represent it into the market and actually assess the systems uh to the uh

evaluations that are identified for whether it be data uh privacy or uh accountability, transparency or algorithmic bias. These are all very critical challenges that we are looking

at today. Next, I want to talk about a program uh which is on uh on the children's side, right? So, we just launched a program in partnership with the uh Meherare Foundation and Shik

Shana Foundation. Uh that is called AI UAL, right? Uh if you look at uh uh the usage of AI, I feel that there is significant opportunities that it provides youth, right? But at the same

time, they need to be trained. they need to understand how to use those technologies. India also has a pretty interesting challenges when we talk about uh language you know we are

extremely multilingual right so we have uh 20 plus languages that are officially considered and several dialects and if you look at rural population lot of times primary school children uh learn

in their in the language and their medium of that state right so at age of 12 when they are in grade seven there is a change you know from the local language from the regional language to

learning in English. Right? So we are looking at how do you skill these people. A lot of times people do not progress not because they are not sharp but that is because they they now have

to adopt to a new language you know which is prevalent which is probably English and grade seven that switch which happens. So this AILA is bringing these uh three uh uh organizations

together to see how we can train students uh to manage the switch between a regional language to uh to the English medium and use AI and learn AI you know from both perspectives. In fact I think

in children there are other aspects. I I know that you know even though I is not doing it. I know that C S Cedak has a program called ESAIA uh which is looking at how do you train people uh children

particularly you know who have autism you know how can AI be used uh to skill right so I think these are all quite amazing programs. uh one last uh comment I will I will probably try take it up in

the next uh round you know I want to talk about a grand challenge that we have but uh at this point of time we are focusing on skilling and I would like to stop my intervention here thank you

&gt;&gt; so uh that's a great work s uh so now I'm coming back to vit so uh vit is from Europe so I I would like to know so how uh can we combine India's ability to train millions with uh Europe's deep

tech research to build the world's best AI workforce So how we can join our hands and build a workforce? &gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely. I think we need to build on our strengths and mitigate our

challenges. So actually European Commission and European community and scientists developed a lot of training modules. Uh you can see visit website EIT campus for example or embassy of

good science and it's available and uh this could be actually leverage towards Indian communities. uh on the other hand you know such business vibe that's here [laughter] in India it's much more

accelerated than in EU now and I think we should learn more from you in this perspective and then we can really uh create a partnership which is uh based on mutual interest and benefits

&gt;&gt; great so uh going to Lalit Dr. Lalit is complaints expert in this uh direction. I have a question for you. So how can India and Europe develop a coordinated framework uh for AI capacity building

through joint research initiatives but at the same time keeping the regulatory dialogue in place. Uh first of all thank you so much for quick introduction uh thanks for expert because the field is

very new AI uh it's just not very it's just in in advance stage but we are talking about Europe and India we both are like in India with 1.4 4 billion people and Europe with uh 480 million

people uh it's a single country with so much population and uh so many countries a union of so many countries with uh one/ird of population so cross compliance uh is one of the these key uh

area that uh we need to mitigate somehow because it's when we say Europe or European Union they have a very strict uh EU AI act and if we compare with India It's we don't have any AI at

dedicated AI as of now but uh this might seems okay we are something like okay we don't have law or something but uh to be very uh practical that we are we have our own priorities and we are

prioritizing innovation over regulation because considering the very strict act UI act which uh somehow barriers companies uh from a perspective of developing some new innovation but uh

both these uh European Union or Europe and India can mitigate this area via uh AI regulatory frameworks uh exchange of researchers and regulator between two uh territories uh along with AI research

hubs where uh very technical very experts from both of these continent can work in each other's country. If I just say that okay this can be done and uh this is just a parameter and it will get

solved nothing it's not like there we have our own priorities uh we have very diverse uh we are very uh like India is very diverse we have um each state has each I mean everyone has different

priorities but considering that uh this exchange program would allow us somehow to consider okay these are the challenges for both of these uh cross compliance And it can be mitigated

through through this uh structural uh collaboration between researchers and uh uh sandbox environment where one can try some pilot projects. Yeah. So great. So hope you will take it forward. Yeah. So

uh I'm coming to my colleague Mr. Gulan who looks after um supercomputing infrared CDAC. So being CDAC commissioned lot of supercomputing infrastructure and super supercomputers

across the country 30 plus supercomputers we have deployed in last um uh six seven years. Uh however so how can uh we establish localized AI labs in tier 2 and t three cities ensure that

high-end scaling is not restricted to just a few metropolitan hubs. So how do we ensure that reach? &gt;&gt; Yeah. So if you uh I mean I I would like to give the overall context from the

national point of view right if you uh see the AI mission alone uh powering the India with uh 38,000s of GPUs which is already been implemented in the country. So which is enabling a GPU access for

common citizens right and when it comes to CDC so that is a mission is totally uh different from CX whatever work we started doing parallelly right in CDC uh as you rightly said we have around uh

you know uh 20 plus supercomputers are established across the country in especially you know uh tier one t cities Right and uh along with uh you know the big

massive supercomputing right sided also works on uh param shawak so I don't know you might have heard about it so this is a a in a box it's like a tabletop uh computer so which not only the hardware

uh like you know computer with GPUs it has the full stack of software which is required uh for anybody to you know work on the AE stacks and things like that. So that is uh been available from Cedak

quite a long time but now we are actually converging with A. So this is the right juncture that we know we are converging HPC with A because you know A gives us the advantage of uh know

efficiently uh you know utilizing the compute power right so far we are doing the raw massive you know HPC computing but with a actually we are trying to you know uh

increase the efficiency of the HPC performance right and that is going into tire three even you know any any uh even in the recent program from IT. So there has been a you know uh initiative to you

know uh uh uh know give the param shaw work on a subsidiary rate. So we have announced the you know interested institute to participate right. So there are many institutes participating based

on the evaluation we selected certain number of uh machines which are going directly into the institute based on their performance right so the and otherwise also they can uh take the

param work and uh you know earn their self-interest that is also there but these are the main initiative and one more thing I wanted to tell you because you know I was telling that you know

this is the juncture where we are enabling a into our HPC systems right so so far our uh Cedax NSM under NSM. So we are we have built almost 60 you know petaflops of system right by end of this

I mean uh by August September. So we would be having around 90 plus petaflop system [clears throat] and out of these systems there are uh one system is already there which is you know which is

a based system and the current one which is going to be 30 patlock which is going to be set up in Bangalore that is also going to be SPCA system right. Right. So this is the tire one and tire two system

available and for the you know uh tire three and any local connages we have the system param shawak. So these are the know majorly initiative from cedak to enable hpc and a for the country. So a

great summary go I think uh a in a box on a desktop where with GPU so is very very helpful solution for the uh tier 2 and t3 uh institutes. I think that's a great initiative in the country and it

can reach every town in the country. So then every town is enabled with AI. So that's a great initiative. So uh coming back to Shri um so I uh understand that it e is planning a grand challenge. So

how uh I I would like to know like how can India participate in this &gt;&gt; and also like is there any scope for CAD can partner and we can provide our compute to support your grand challenge.

&gt;&gt; Absolutely. So, Cedak is already supporting it e. I wanted to mention in my first intervention that our training programs that I talked about which are talking about scaling and scaling uh

they are actually running on CDA supercomputers. So, you know, so I think it is uh quite powerful the fact that we are having hosting our programs in the CDK supercomputer. Now coming back to

the grand challenge right so thank you for asking that question. Uh so uh I has just standards association has just launched a grand challenge. Uh uh we are partnering with several other key

organizations uh OECD, AI commons, uh UNESCO and uh I we are living in the age of AI. You know everybody's talking about AI. AI comes with lot of positives but it comes with several amount of

challenges right. So one of the key aspects that we are looking at as part of the grand challenge is uh to look at a particular aspect around it mostly focused around uh misinformation and

disinformation right so how does the grand challenge work so currently we are seeking proposals and the proposals can come from uh students uh industry bodies researchers uh they can put a proposal

together and I think the portal is open uh till the end of March where we are seeking these proposals And uh the there will be a set of experts who will be judging these

proposals and they move on to phase two where they will implement these proposals and then we evaluate them and appropriately reward whatever you know reward that you know visibility itself

is a reward right so so the idea here is when we talked about in fact we talked about you know you asked me a question how can help uh in this overall context right so uh we had a discussion with

Cedak and uh um As uh as was mentioned we are the supercomputers running. So Cedak Bangalura has come as a partner uh to this grand challenge uh you know uh uh with the permission of your uh uh

executive director uh he was you know he said uh we would like to partner with you and we are hoping that the CAD in India will also partner with us very soon. And the idea here is the students

and other participants the teams who are uh propos sending proposals and who go to phase two they will actually uh be able to use the supercomput power that is there to run their programs. But not

only that right so sometimes you are running uh you you are constructing your program in your in your desktop in your machines and uh porting it to supercomputing might require a certain

amount of handholding. So there is a commitment also to provide mentorship uh to these teams and I think that mentorship can come in different forms. It doesn't have to stop with uh just the

porting but also providing your expertise and your guidance and uh you know the phase 2 projects who are actually implementing these uh aspects right so I think this is very powerful

and we are hoping that in the grand scheme of things that uh the there's a network of alliance of supercomputers right so I think we will be able to uh exploit the uh performance and power

that that provide as we run the roll out this grand challenge uh in this coming year thank you &gt;&gt; I I think it's a great initiative creative and it's a great opportunity

for the entire uh research and student community. We look forward for great success. Uh now coming back to the another important question posing to quit. So how do we move beyond talent

migration from one country to another country uh to create a reciprocal research corridor where IP and innovation stay rooted in both India and Europe but still we work together. So

exactly the real partnership cannot be hardly just signed or bought. It can only grow from mutual trust and friendship and this is the start. So we need to trust

each other to then collaborate and maybe do a business. Uh recently we have launched wonderful opportunity program designed for Indian startups and innovators. you know that we actually

signed or there was signed the trade agreement between the European Union and India uh which actually open uh the door to uh to our collaboration. This program uh is dedicated to support

scaling up business in Europe. So for example, if university startups or innovators have business idea, they can actually apply to this pro through this program to get support not only with

visa or accommodation for free or office space and access to HPC but also to ask for preede and even seed money up to€1 million euro. Uh but we don't want brain drain or knowledge drain. Absolutely

not. Of course, they need to set the business in Europe for a while to scale up, get this money for to grow and then they can go back to India for IPO and get rich and all has some share and and

this is this is the partnership. &gt;&gt; Uh coming back to Lalit. So Lalit, how can uh European risk based AI governance standards uh influence compliance models, accountability mechanisms and uh

sector specific AI deployment deployment strategies within India? So I know like there is an initiative and lot of uh work is happening in this area. you would like to

&gt;&gt; um actually actually uh all this U AI act or regulatory structure in uh this territory European Union or Europe are completely based on structure classifications risk based

classification so initially they will ask you whether you're a deployer where a manufacturer whether you're user whether uh you are using someone's AI by other strain model and it starts with uh

classification So if uh we if we can uh rely on the same structure classification of risk for an example you cannot ask any AI model that you are a hypertension uh patient you you cannot

ask the same question for both uh patients. So it depends on how how you structure the how you classify this high-risk system and it has some impact assessment to be done. Uh for any

deployment of AI there should be an impact assessment to be done. What impact it has on user? what impact it has on uh it will have on uh their rights uh constitutional rights and uh

throughout these uh accountability can be uh uh can be uh ensured via uh proper documentation of this. So I think uh uh this answers your questions. Uh uh yeah.

&gt;&gt; Yeah. So I have a follow-up question on this. uh as of now if you look at the curriculum mostly the concentration is on the technology rather than compliance and governance. So do you think it has

to be incorporated into the curriculum from the beginning of any course in AI? Actually it is very much mandated uh in uh in the regulatory structure of uh EU that uh all companies should have their

uh ethical internal uh training to be given to the employees even if it's not they are from nontechnical background or technical background they have to go through this ethical uh uh consideration

of training and which actually gives a basic idea of how we are going to use AI safely right yes is &gt;&gt; so I think one of the things that's

happening at least I see in India is the national education policy 2020 right so uh the NEP 2020 what it does is uh it allows for students to take in take their classical education right and uh

the UN education uh while it's strong fundamentally has certain limitations in adapting to the very fastly evolving world right I'm not criticizing it's just a statement of fact right so and I

think uh the um the NEP 2020 recognizes this challenge right and the what they have done is quite amazing in the sense they have allowed for students to while they are learning the classical

education the university based education they have allowing for credits to be acquired by these other formats where you know you can map your uh classical education to what is available on the

market for changing uh uh technologies and uh there is a mapping that's happening between the curriculum and what is available to support that curriculum and taking that education and

making it practical uh in sync with how the industry is evolving. So I think that is something significant that has happened and uh I think we are slowly seeing that people are taking advantage

of the fact that they can take this credits outside the classical systems and that will include you know our a lot of times our education uh is very theoretical but we are talking about

compliance we are talking about market adoption and I'm seeing a change that is happening uh and I do believe that you know I come from uh you know I breach standards right so I feel that there is

a very important aspects about When we talk about market adoption, we should really think about how standards could be taught and integrated within the curriculum and automatically you know

standards is soft regulation right then you have a regulatory aspect which is hard regulation hard law right and we talk about compliance I think these should be automatically we are talking

to ACT AC is really looking at how to integrate these pieces together I thought I will just make that inter thank you &gt;&gt; yeah that's a great point so it has to

be integrated I think it has to be part of the curriculum. So that's a anonymous question by the panelists. So uh coming to local um so since again I am coming back to the uh provisioning infra for

the rural areas right so is it possible is there any possibility to have mobile first AI infrastructure that can bridge the literacy gap for the millions of students in rural India who lacks access

to the traditional resources. Is there any possibility technically? &gt;&gt; Yeah. [clears throat] So I think uh that is very interesting point right uh if you if you think about you know mobile

today and 10 years back. So the development that we made in the mobile for last 10 years is massive right. So uh if you if the same [clears throat] uh you know analogy if you apply it to a

also it it is going to be uh the future for you know uh I mean user user point user side uh a computing correct and it is going to be one of the you know a assistance for everybody for that matter

right uh and uh why I'm saying that you know uh today's if you see any a model or a training or infrastructure right so I strongly believe that you know efficiency of uh a whatever is

generating today is very less right so I would uh I would say maybe less than 30 20 to 30% that's what you know the efficiency of overall you know a uh you know uh which are know generating today

because the two factor to it one is that it's the AI itself has to mature a lot and the second factor is the data which we are feeding into the AI so how clean it is how uh you right uh right kind of

a data is fed. So these are the two factors ma majorly you know uh you know affecting the efficiency. So over the period uh the a efficiency will increase right so that you know your compute

requirements comes down right and uh definitely that is going to be the future uh but uh it is the today's scenario it might be you know looking very difficult but that will be

eventually we will we that is the that is the place where we will reach. Yeah. So these devices inhand devices are becoming powerful. So definitely uh we can have a grid of AI devices. Yes.

&gt;&gt; And and more importantly if you see the device the these device are the m actual data feeders. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. So and when you talk about uh

know continuous uh learning uh no models. So these are the device can actually uh give you a lot of advantage. &gt;&gt; Right. I think here we can also tackle some part of the privacy aspect. I feel

even &gt;&gt; so I think sir can actually put a thought there because these all you know which are required eventually standardizing the models

&gt;&gt; and uh I mean there are a lot of work has to go into it &gt;&gt; so I'm coming back to Sri um so when we talk about capacity building the procurement plays very crucial role so

what is uh like uh uh what is what are the challenges in AI procurement and how uh it can be addressed. &gt;&gt; Uh thank you Romesh. So uh yeah so I has been working on a particular uh program

it's called IE 3119. I made a small reference to it uh in my opening remarks. Uh so the idea here is uh you know today procurement uh the dependency on procurement and the impact of AI in

procurement is becoming very significant you know particularly when we talking about uh uh systems that are deployed in the government uh there is a lot of procurement that happens and there is a

lot of AI that goes as part of the procurement right uh so we developed a program I 3119 to address what needs to be the considerations when you have AI as part of the procurement system. But

one of the things we have also recognizing but since we are talking about AI capacity building in that context right back in the day when I was heavily involved on the other side of

the from the other side of the fence working on uh standards and developing standards uh the communities were very small right you know the people who needed to know the standard were already

at the drawing table right they were designing that standard but now talking to Gowit titan's point with mobile first uh the penetration of these kind of systems. So the impact of the standard

into the society is much more significantly felt today than what it was in 20 years. you know we don't even realize the standards that are being used in the devices that we are using

and the responsibility of organizations such as IL to ensure that we are doing the right thing right and uh we are making sure that uh uh people are able to rely on our standards and what I mean

by relying on our standards is we give them certain set of guarantees when we develop these standards right you know we are saying that we take care of your data governance whether it talk about

privacy or identity so when we talk about AI procurement We realize that there is a need for capacity building. People have to understand before they go and deploy or understand what they are

expecting. They need to understand what the standard is about. So more and [snorts] more we are recognizing the fact that there is a need for capacity building and training. So 3119 not only

is a standard we are looking at uh capacity building and also as we move forward in the supply chain as we move forward in the maturity curve we'll also be looking at compliance to what Dr.

with initially was talking about. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, thank you. So, with uh so how can uh uh for example if you take in India we always like there is a slogan

AI for all. At the same time in uh Europe we say uh we have a new AI literacy framework. So each country and continent have their own frameworks. So how can we create a shared is standard

shared frameworks for a foundational AI competency in schools especially in the grassroot level. &gt;&gt; I think we need to actually build on common understanding

uh what's these chakras or principles for AI and I think that Europe and India are very close to this common understanding. uh the three main pillars as I do understand that we share these

values is uh ethical and humanity ethics and humanity sustainability and maybe healthy critical thinking [snorts] and uh the first pillar actually uh it's maybe you know Carl Chopek and his novel

his book rur actually that this word was invented by chick writer robot bought 100 years ago and even it was more than century ago.

He at that time picked this topic and uh you know the ending of the book is that the people are almost destroyed. The robots are taking over but they are gaining some piece of humanity. Yes. So

um one century ago and uh we need to actually uh embed the ethics and human center approach in our innovations. Sustainability is also very important because um if uh the acceleration of

usage of large language models would go this this speed uh very soon we would need more than 40 nuclear power power plants just to keep them running you know so I think we should think how to

optimize the algorithms maybe how to optimize uh the usage of energy and it's very important and the critical thinking you know AI is not a dogma you know it can hallucinate you know and it can it

can go wrong uh and this we need to teach from the very young age because otherwise the kids which are actually growing with technology hands in hand might got lost and confused

&gt;&gt; yeah that's great so uh lalit um so uh we have seen lot of startups and industry are uh from from the Europe and from India working hand in hand. So how these companies uh can adopt to align

their AI systems with European regulatory expectations? uh I I will try to uh not to be more technical on this because um um um I I'll try uh to be very practical uh

because uh these companies or uh which would work in India or which would work in Europe uh both territories has different as I said uh regulator regulations but uh if I say just uh uh

the data governance on both of these companies can turn uh sometimes it happens that you you have to comply with any XY Z act and we try to get comply at the end but that's not the thing in such

a scenario like AI we have to comply from very beginning it's like a data governance from first stage and let's consider you deployed some AI agent and it has to be okay now it is being

deployed everything is done no you have to test on very each and every step if you uh encounter because if a company encounter any query any risk you have to mitigate very immediately. So so these

are the parameters I think uh are very much important and for that uh internal assessment and readiness for any compliance at any stage uh via tracibility of documents is very much

important and this can be achieved via this this uh what I mentioned. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. uh that that makes very important point. So Google uh what is CEX or MIT's road map for uh building a massive

India's AI infrastructure at the same time. So I also have another question when we talk about AI we always don't look at the applications from the science which are adopting AI very

silently. So the science requires HBC whereas AI requires traditional accelerators AI accelerators when these two are converging so what kind of infrastructure we need so how do we

enable to our country so that both can work in hand in hand uh I I'll just one more point I'll put forward for example if you take weather forecasting earlier they were using relying only on

numerical methods now the parameterization part of the weather forecasting is moving towards neural networks there is a synergy that is going very fast So even uh uh to enable

that the HPC also has to go in the same direction. So what are the initiatives uh from uh in India? &gt;&gt; Yeah [clears throat and cough] sorry right. So I think uh know in the

previous uh discussion I you know told you that we are at the right juncture where HPC and A converging together right and uh there are many applications which required really high compute and I

high precision you know requirement which will be a purely HPC kind of a requirement and a other hand required a lot of different different kind of an applications. So some applications might

require low precision, some required medium precision, right? And this is the you know uh requirement from the compute point of view right. So SIDAC is doing uh you know the road map for uh building

large scale compute resource at the country right. So uh in parallel we have the A mission. So it is also doing the same thing but we ensure that from Sedak point of view we provide the you know

complete ecosystem for the country right. So not just uh computing power right and here uh what we are doing is uh uh you know trying to uh develop uh you know very u u uh uh different or the

know uh customized you know GPUs or CPUs which required for a uh operations like let it be data processing units or tensor processing units or different types of processing even neuromorphic

computing and in-memory computing. So these are the some of the initiative that we are taking in under NSM program right. So we are planning to develop a indigenous chip. So that is also I mean

you know hand inand kind of a program right which is also will leverage the uh compute requirement of the a it's no more just a no pure uh massive HPC requirement and uh we plan to build a

couple of exascale systems right uh with uh this kind of a indigenous and uh customized chips for the servers right so these are the some of the you know road map which we have it in the NSM

program Right. Apart from NSM program, so under AA also uh different applications, it could be applications, could be a model, right? And various things are also being uh in the pipeline

in other programs, right? So these are some some areas that Cedak is uh planning to do. &gt;&gt; Yes, please. &gt;&gt; So I think uh you know one of the things

that uh we see is you know with the proliferation of AI know and you said AI in a box, right? I know while it's exciting it also worries me sometimes right like know you know you we are

doing so much GPUs we are doing so much compute right and I feel that there is also a need when we talk about research when you talk about capacity building to rethink the architecture of these

systems right a lot of time just because the compute power is there I don't want to use a GPU to do 1 plus 1 equal to two right you know and that requires a little bit of a mind shift in the way we

think about these problems A lot of the problems in the world are analog in nature, right? So a sparse matrix solution might require may not require a digital chip, right? You know, uh it

might require an analog chip for example, right? So I really want to when we talk about NSM the national semiconductor mission when we talk about research and capacity building we really

need to I think uh in the age of everybody having a in their backyard rethink what you know sometimes we are stuck to the way things are evolving we are trying to optimize make it cost

effective all that is fine uh sometimes you have to come outside the box and say is there a different way to architect these systems uh which requires a different uh aspects to be thought about

and I think that also helps in the energy consumption you know we are looking at where there is a issue of the more AI it is the more data centers the more energy consumption the more water

challenges you know and that's a ripple effect that creates downstream effect right so I think we really have to rethink on how do we address these problems uh in a different dimension

&gt;&gt; yeah I think that summarizes well &gt;&gt; yeah if I may if I may comment on that I would second that absolutely Because for example our brain is analog processor. Yeah. Neurons. So if we study these

processes with digital tools it might be biased. So exactly. &gt;&gt; Yes. True. I accept. So in the interest of time so we had very uh uh great discussion from our panelists. So now

the floor is open to audience for any questions please. So uh thank you thank you very much panelists. Uh I am Dr. Anita and I'm heading the uh high performance

computing data center from ministry of earth sciences uh which is uh national center for medium range weather forecasting. So it's NCMRWF. So we have a the high performance

computer uh 22 pedaflop machine and we are the backbone for the weather forecasting in India or machine. So with that uh introduction uh I was uh towards the last question which was aimed at uh

weather forecasting. So I would uh like to comment as well as uh uh put a query sort of a suggestive query. So what is uh towards CDC one thing like we are looking at now uh right now we are only

running on uh HPC systems which are only CPU based but weather forecasting because all the models that have been developed is it is for the CPUs. So coming to AI so all the code has to be

changed number thing and the it has not only the code we need to get into the a way where we have uh hybrid architecture where we have CPUs and GPUs. So in that uh perspective I would like to ask Cedak

uh like are you um how closely are you working with the with our ministry and uh what are the plans? Do you have any plans for that for Cedak uh so that it would be very even more uh aggressively

or the challenge might be met uh more faster and second thing for the European Union what are the plans that are going on there uh in this regard so those are my two questions.

So I will take the first question right. So &gt;&gt; uh our team also working on weather forecast applications right. So we are we are trying to work you know uh uh the

precision of uh the you know land maybe with shorter ranges right. So uh I mean the question was very uh right uh whether these applications can it run on GPU because these are all you know maybe

designed for CPUs right. So uh it is uh because you know we need to see when it comes to GPU GPU is very good at uh doing low precision applications right so it has to uh some study has to go

into it right try to uh optimize with GPUs with low precision how accurate it is it right so uh I mean we'll have to do initial uh set of uh code conversion and then maybe you know we can actually

uh put into a again to uh generate all the entire code so that you we are ready for a models right so maybe uh know it's a very good thought so we need to uh I mean I will try to uh put this question

to our team who is working on the weather forecasting right so uh I mean uh I don't have the clearcut answer to you because I come from an infrastructure background yeah thank you

&gt;&gt; maybe uh I'll add on to the goal because in my initial career I worked in weather forecasting for 8 years uh so maybe I'll put my thoughts very clearly. See when we started with the SFM seasonal

forecasting model, right? The core at least the core part the spectral model which is part of it we tried to um enable to the GPU. The fundamental problem is it was the algorithms were uh

designed in a very tight way coupled to uh CPUs plus high memory uh um compute kind of a thing. So it's not like it's not a direct conversion from CPU to GPU. uh when it comes to the second there is

an effort for uh paralyzing these codes putting on these codes like WRF uh there was a lot of effort from Nvidia as well as CDC to put it onto the GPU I think we are partially successful but not fully

uh when it comes to the climate focus system again third experience what I had is traditionally it was designed for AX operating system it was working on beginning machines IBM large boxes and

our team ported it onto the little machines onto Intel I think still that is being used the CFS which is hosted on uh IATM website today even that porting from beginning to little Indian it took

an year for us uh literally because it has 25 modules millions of lines of code written by someone else. So it is not a straightforward uh thing to directly port them onto a GPU straight away. So

one possible solution is why can't we look into the hotspots in the entire model and figure it out which part can be ported there. So that identification itself is a huge task that has to be

done by the domain experts and look this is the part which we can try it out first then go in deep. The second part is coming to the AI. So the numerical methods are well proven in weather

forecasting. So suddenly if we make a shift we don't know about the stability of AI there. So probably initial results are wonderful but when the drought comes whe the way I withstand and it's able to

predict there is no answer for that because until that the situation comes we can't really prove its capability a's capability to uh uh predict abnormalities like drought or severe

flood it is not very easy to do that so in that case I think we should have a large simulation labs and we have to put forward these ces and abnormalities into the current models like uh either WRF or

CFS then we have to look into it and see uh which components can be moved to AI, which components can be moved to GPU. I think we should have a separate discussion in detail. CDK is very happy

to support NCMRWF and we can work hand in hand. We are ready for a a larger discussion. Ma'am, yeah, &gt;&gt; maybe just short comment for your perspective. Times up. But uh I'm not in

weather forecasting but what I know I can say that Europe European Union pays really great attention to this topic and is a pioneer uh in earth observation. So copernicus data a great resource

actually of that big big data and um &gt;&gt; yes couple of minutes please. &gt;&gt; Okay so thank you. So I think this is great resource and Europe would actually uh prepare new funding opportunities uh

for climate change and climate change the disasters mitigation. So there could be actually opportunity how to collaborate uh and uh use this data. &gt;&gt; So I understand ECMWF is already working

I think we are working with them. So probably we can take it forward and uh even uh UK met we can take it forward I think. So I think uh in the interest of time I request Sri to summarize the

discussion very briefly and crisply. So I know it is 5:30 all are eager to go home. &gt;&gt; Well one summary is we saved the best for the last right. So uh I feel that uh

you know my uh one minute summary in the end is it is a global organization. We develop global standards. uh there is lot of exciting work that is happening contextually in the regions and uh it's

a great platform where we can bring this contextual standards run it through the IT process and uh that's a way to scale these work uh globally in a open fashion right so and along with that scaling

we'll build capacity also that exposes our researchers our students our industry to a greater market acceptance &gt;&gt; so thank you so much for staying back all the audience and it's really uh I'm

very very glad to see all of you sitting here in the Friday evening. So thank you so much. We are excited to see you all and I thank all the panelists for a great discussion. We look forward for

collaboration. We look forward for greater discussions and dialogue. Thank you so much. Thank you all. [applause] I can give it to you. &gt;&gt; Why not?

&gt;&gt; We are partnering.
