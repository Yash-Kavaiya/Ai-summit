## 📝 Transcript

perspective of the UN uh development program. Uh certainly we see a concern with what is happening in in the development and adoption of AI in that there's no question and we are very

convinced that AI can have such a powerful impact on uh sustainable development in a positive way. It can help us really close some of those gaps that we see in persistent development

challenges. However, we know that the way that it is evolving now is not equitable. And if we do not have a kind of commitment to responsible use of AI, we fear that the

AI equity gap could actually get worse or inequality could get worse. Um, and more so it also can be harmful in some cases if we're not applying AI responsibly. So we want to get into then

the the point about how do we actually address some of those challenges. How do we get some of the um measures in place or the kinds of commitments principles that we need to have as an overall

community especially in the uh international development community but beyond in terms of private sector and others as well in terms of what are our commitments to making sure that we are

deploying and using AI in a responsible way and building AI ecosystems. So um this does tie in with a process that has been a feature of previous AI summits as well as the Hamburg

sustainability conference that is hosted every year in the city of Hamburg and sponsored by uh the government of Germany with other partners like UNDP and the city of Hamburg. Um and as part

of that process we have introduced a uh declaration on AI for sustainable development, the Hamburg declaration. And so we'll talk about that a little bit in the context of this conversation

after um exploring some of the kind of opening thoughts around multistakeholder uh partnerships in general. So I'm going to uh start off and introduce our panelists and then we'll go through a

couple of rounds of questions. be thinking about your questions as well because I think that we'll have time to go to you as well for a Q&amp;A and so happy to get your thoughts um and get some

interaction with the panel as part of this session. So with that um I have a very distinguished panel um to introduce to you and it's a real pleasure to have them here uh today. Um I would like to

introduce sitting on my left uh Dr. Barbell Coffler, who's the parliamentary state secretary at Germany's federal ministry for uh economic cooperation and development. Um she's a long-standing

champion of human rights and development, a member of the Bundustag since 2004, and she plays a key role in shaping Germany's global development agenda.

&gt;&gt; Page turn here. &gt;&gt; Yes, exactly. Um we are also honored to have Ms. um Miss Arundati Batacharia who's the chairperson and CEO of Salesforce South Asia. Um a

transformative leader with over four decades of experience. Um she uh made history as the first woman chairperson of the state bank of India where she led one of the country's most significant

digital transformation journeys. Um she oversees a huge part of Salesforce business um in this region and beyond. shaping how technology partnerships drive innovation skills and inclusive

growth. Um we're also joined by Nakul Jane who's the CEO and managing director of Wadwani AI Global. Um uh Nakul is a missiondriven technology leader. He works to advance AI solutions for

underserved communities across the global south. um and his team has done 40 deployments of AI reaching more than 150 million people in in use cases such as healthcare, agriculture and

education. Um and we're also joined by Dr. Sachin Looda who's the chief scientist and head of research at Tata Consultancy Services. Um he's a leader in cyber

security and privacy research. He heads Tata Consultancy Services work on trustworthy AI, quantum resilience, um cloud de-risisking and privacy by design and that is all about translating

cutting edge research um into real world real world award-winning innovation. Um please join me in welcoming our panelists. Okay. So let uh start um Dr. Kofller,

I'd like to start with you please. Um you know you represent the the government perspective uh here on this panel. Um what do you think are the distinct roles of government but also

some of the other players like private sector, civil society and international organizations um the roles that they play in building AI ecosystems that are both innovative

and inclusive? I use I use this one in the meantime. Um yeah uh thank you for the question and thank you for having me also as a representative of a government. Uh but

I'm very happy to be on a panel with scientists with academia and with private sector because at the end of the day uh artificial intelligence and how we shape really the future with that is

depending on multistakeholder engagement. There has to be an engagement from all parts of society and also including civil society because it's a broad outreach in our societies

we have to undertake. So that's why I think it's very important to discuss it. You were pointing out uh challenges and and uh advantages of artificial intelligence. Um and I think there is

the role of governments coming in because yes there are tremendous uh advantages of artificial intelligence. Um in my sphere of politics we discuss about how we can use that for detect uh

diseases better through AI cancer in various topics. We discuss about climate change and how we can make prediction applicable for everybody on the ground. We discuss about administration and the

advantages in administration uh AI could offer. But at the end of the day, all those hopes will all come into reality if we shape that in a framework in a legal framework in a framework we

coordinate with partners around the globe and within society. uh which makes all those advantages uh accessible for everybody for all parts of society for any citizen to address it

its government through AI conversation in its own language for example to uh small holder farmers if they got the chance to make use of it to doctors in remote areas who can really then detect

with the new techn technology um diseases or whatever. So we have to close a gap and I would say it's not an innovation gap, it's a power gap because innovative people are existing around

the globe. Ideas are created around the globe in all spheres of society. I've been here on a panel or at a session this brilliant young Indian uh startup uh

yeah how would I call it people I don't know I forgot the English word sorry this brilliant people who uh we're creating startups and that uh is possible all over the globe but the

environment has to be there and if you look uh how venture capital for example is distributed and we know that uh I think it's uh 17% of venture capital only is in those parts of the world who

are presenting more than uh 90% of the people. So we feel a power gap at the end of the day. If you look about where you have data center resources, it's even worse. Uh global north uh it's

almost all the data centers available uh capacity and only 1 point uh uh 0.1 percentage is somewhere in the global south. So there is a big gap and we have to overcome that gap. We have to close

that gap and I think that's something uh governments have to do also and where they utilize to create an environment uh if it's coming to energy consumption if it's coming to an enabling environment

for research if it's coming to skill training uh for everybody. I learned in one of the sessions that we should change our mindset and everybody should get a become a creator of uh not only a

user of artificial intelligence but to do so we have to invest in the mindset and in the skills of all users. We have to uh work on vocational training and university training

um to make research uh education and the needs of even small medium-sized enterprises heard and linked together to bring small medium-sized enterprises into the position to participate also

from that new technology not only the big uh players. So all those things need framework and need governance and um we have to make sure that the outcome the research the results the data sets are

available for everybody that's why we are also investing in opensource it's something we very much are alive with the Indian uh ideas uh because uh if we don't do so the first things the

advantages are not for everybody but sorry I have to say only for a few tech millions And that's probably not what we all um are expecting from that technological

revolution. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. So uh okay, now it's working. Um so framework and governance uh important uh factors to have in the the multistakeholder partnerships. Uh

Arunati maybe let me turn to you with a very similar question. Um but taking this from the the private sector perspective. Um how do you think the responsibility should be distributed uh

between the different stakeholders and what does industry or you know private sector companies, tech companies in this case uniquely bring to the table and where is partnership essential?

Uh thank you and uh good morning everyone of you. Uh I have been very fortunate in the fact that you know I have worked with two organizations. uh the one that I worked with initially uh

was the State Bank of India which is the largest bank in India and also the bank that really and truly spearheaded the financial inclusion program of the current government which is the PM

Jandhan Yoja and while doing that I realized that any uh improvement in technology if it is not really democratized then it doesn't really have an impact

If you want it to have an impact, you need to democratize technology. That's the first thing. The second thing is currently I work at Salesforce and Salesforce uh again you know it was set

up with the intention that business is a platform for change. We have what we call a one by one by one um mission which is uh we contribute 1% of our profits or equity uh 1% of our uh

products and 1% of our time to the community to the nonprofit community. Of course in India it is 2% of the profits because that's what the law demands and while doing that we ensure that it the

nonprofit sector not only has access to our products but also knows how to use them and use them to the best of their abilities. Along with that we also do a lot of work in skilling uh various

people. So we uh call people who uh basically are trained in uh the Salesforce technology as trailblazers and India has 3.9 million of them the second largest after the US and this is

a community that has been literally nurtured by us. So it's not only a question of ensuring that we are getting our products out to the community to the nonprofit sector to the various

enterprises where we obviously you know we um obviously market our products to them and then help them implement it in their organizations but we are doing a lot of work on the skilling front as

well because we feel that is something that's very very essential without that India will not really be able to take the advantage of all that technology brings to it. But one thing is very

clear in our heads and that is that a populous nation like India can never really have the standard of living that it deserves unless technology is a part of the play. We tried this financial

inclusion uh initiative for 15 long years before we actually were successful in 2014. And the reason for that was technology because by that time the unique identification authority which

gave us a biometric uh you know uh marker to enable us to get the unique identification number that helped us do the KYC and second the the spread of the mobile networks enabled us to actually

approach the 600,000 villages which is India. Okay. Before this we never had that connectivity. Now it was because of this that these people then got accounts. 97% of these accounts were

without any balances. And a lot of people asked us was this merely a ploy? Was this merely you know some kind of uh some kind of action without any meaning. But very soon we found that those

accounts started getting money because the government could then target the subsidies they were giving to below poverty line people directly to the c to the it citizens without having to go

through any middlemen. In fact uh some politician at some point of time had said that only 13 pes after for every one rupee of subsidy actually goes to the person who needs it. here when the

money started flowing directly into the account the whole of the rupee was going to the person who needed the subsidy. Now over and above that we then had the UPI which is the universal payment

interface. And what did that do? That enabled even small customers and small shopkeepers to start actually taking money in a digital form. And because they were taking money in the digital

form, these accounts of theirs which had been opened started showing a cash flow. And the moment an account has cash flow, bankers then become interested in lending you money because they know that

there is a cash flow to sort of back it up to enable you to repay it. So here is a person who was taking a loan of say 2,000 rupees paying 10% a month suddenly becomes eligible for that 2,000 rupees

at 7% a year. Imagine the difference it can make in the life of that person. And this is all on account of technology. AI is not going to be anything different. AI is going to solve a lot of problems

which otherwise in a populous nation like ours cannot be solved. And in order to solve it, we therefore need to understand people are eager to take it. They will take the technology because it

improves their lives. But in order for them to take it, it's up to the policy makers to make those interventions to ensure that they are not being taken for a ride. that whatever is being offered

to them is being offered in an ethical manner that we are doing the right we are creating the right kind of infrastructure to enable them to actually be able to access it that the

right to privacy of their data is properly maintained. So I think the policy makers, the people who are there who are conducting all of this, they have a far bigger responsibility because

adoption is not something which is a problem in India. Adoption will happen as soon as people realize that it's helping them in their regular lives. Adoption is not going to be a problem.

There's not going to be any pessimism on adoption. And if you go to the floor where the expo is, you'll actually see people how interested they are in finding out how it's going to improve

their lives. Okay? But it is people who make the policies, people who make the infrastructure available, people who actually make the the initiatives available, who need to take the

responsibilities and companies like ours. We need to take the responsibility as to how we skill the people enable them to understand what is good for them and what is not good for them. Make them

understand that there is both good and bad and they need to choose the better. they should not be you know uh they should not be taken for a ride. So all of us have a role to play and I think

you know we need to be aware of those roles and we need to play them well. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. So actually the those two answers complement each other so

nicely because um as you were saying uh Dr. Coffler the there's the governance and the framework and this is key to the Indian experience as well. government sets down the framework the the rails

but then private sector has such an important role in skilling in innovating in helping people be successful and interact with that um so I'm going to turn now to uh knuckle um and

a question now because you know your Wadwani uh AI global has done a lot of work in the space of multistakeholder uh partnerships and the uh rollout of of AI for uh specific use cases. Um from your

experience, where have multistakeholder partnerships already demonstrated tangible impact um in terms of advancing responsible AI for development? Um and what are the conditions that helped

ensure these collaborations translated into sustained impact rather than just remaining stalled? &gt;&gt; Thank you for that question, Rob also. Thank you for having me here.

&gt;&gt; I hope this work. &gt;&gt; All right. Okay. Yeah. No, thank you everyone uh for being here. So, you know, my answer will be from my experience of deploying some of these

solutions on field and what has worked for us, what has not worked for us. Now, what we have realized that building technology at least for an application organization like ours is the most

easiest part of the entire spectrum. It's everything around it that becomes you know tedious for us to sort of get done which essentially means that there is a need for a multistakeholder

ecosystem that can bring in their expertise who will take care of everything that sits around the technology. The ecosystem that works is the one that

ensures from day one what will be the institutional mechanism of getting something done. How will the solution, the use case be institutionalized in the ecosystem? How will it be embedded

within the framework we are speaking about within the department ministry we are talking about within the uh problem area and the people who will be using it. That's that cannot be an

afterthought. That has to be something that needs to come in from day one. And I'll give you a few examples you know some of the solutions that we were able to deploy at scale and you know what

helped them work. So we built a solution in education around oral reading fluency essentially to assess uh students on their reading abilities right technology part like I said not very difficult to

do but this is not something that Vadwani global could have done alone right this required a collaboration between government ownership from government and what also mentioned that

it is required for policy makers to own this problem we as an organiz organization came in as a facilitator but the government of Gujarat was the one who led this entire initiative who

made sure that data is available who helped us find the right partners who could then be leveraged to annotate some of this data. The other thing rather than trying to

create this solution in silos, what we also started thinking about is where will it get embedded right tomorrow if this has to be used and there are tons and tons of applications that are

already you know being pitched to government for education pitched to teachers. How do you ensure that they actually get adopted and one way to do that was to understand how is government

currently running their programs. So we started working with government and their uh technical partner to work on this together. So rather than thinking about this as a solution that we have

created and we'll give you an app, we started figuring out how can whatever we develop plug into the existing system does not create a major change in the workflow of how teachers were already

using technology in classrooms wherever they were. And then how do you ensure that there is a monitoring mechanism established so that the government is now fully capable of not just following

up on the adoption but also to figure out if there's a genuine impact of technology right all of this was only possible because we had this collaboration between the government

with the technical partner who government was working with us being you know the AI partner and the partners who were working with government at school levels to help them programmatically to

help teachers build capacity on this to help teachers understand it to also counsel teachers because there's also you know a constant threat about AI trying to replace jobs right so there's

also that handholding that is required at field level and as a tech organization we could not have done that right so you need that partner as well moving to a slightly different example

around healthcare and we have done a lot of products in tuberculosis and you know some of the things remain common around um your government partnership, data collection through them and you know

your programmatic partnership but what additional support we got was from ICMR. How can we start thinking about evaluating this from day one because health being a much more sensitive area

right directly impacting the lives you know when some of our decisions give outcome uh some of our models give those decisions how do you ensure that evaluation and the success criteria is

not an afterthought so you don't just work with the government you also work with the agency who will eventually evaluate it so you are finally following from the first day itself how you should

be optimizing for what parameters and what results. So these are some of the examples Rob that I can think of where you know technology government ecosystem partners played a

role came together and delivered something. &gt;&gt; Thank you Nicole and just a quick followup on that. So Wadwani AI global is how would you describe the the space

that you occupy in that you're not government you're not Exactly. Private sector. You're kind of an integrator, right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. No, absolutely. I think what we

would like to call ourselves is a convenor of technology especially for social good. So our role essentially is to ensure there is an impact leveraging artificial intelligence right who all

need to participate is something that we work with partners along right. We work with governments whether it requires capacity building whether it requires advisory to the government whether it's

require requires actual product development. We help government with everything because what we have also realized is you know while government is well intent

it there is a need for a lot of handholding right because they have priorities right and artificial intelligence while now it's become a buzzword they still need a lot of

handholding in order to make sure that some of these solutions just don't end up living in labs and you know some of these uh rooms like this but actually go on field. So our role becomes even more

important to make sure that everyone who needs to participate comes along participates and ensures that there are there is a actual impact on food. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Thank you. And the reason I I

asked that is because also to to go over to to Sachin um you know there are uh you know kind of the the roles of you know private sector innovation and there's the government role the

international organizations like UNP have also bring a kind of multilateral and and global perspective on some of these things but you know uh companies like Tata Consultancy also serve kind of

in the the middle there as well. And I'd love your your perspectives on that same question which is you know where are you seeing multistakeholder partnerships resulting in tangible impact and what

are the conditions that really help to make those successful. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Hello. Yeah. Thanks Robert. Uh thanks for having me on the panel and good morning everyone. Uh great to be

part of this panel. Uh I'll start. I'm a lifelong and a very proud uh Tata family member. Uh I just want to start by stating uh the philosophy of our group. Uh as was you know uh stated by our

founding uh chairman you know Jamshi G Tata. This is almost 170 year old group and right back then he has stated that in a free enterprise the community is not

just another stakeholder in business but is in fact the very purpose of his existence and I think it's quite well known about you know the overall philanthropic community facing nation

building work that Tata group companies have done over the years. I'm part of TCS. I head TCS research. As you know TCS has uh TCS we bring technology live uh for our customers. Uh in fact we have

been very proud partner of ASBI uh what Arundi has stated and uh lots of nation scale initiatives in India uh where we could really bring some very interesting solutions on the part of on the top of

digital public infrastructure that uh that has been that has come live in India. uh so we have a very unique vantage point as I said in terms of you know uh

what's happening around the globe and the kind of problems that are been faced you know uh across different industries uh especially when it comes to sustainable development

uh so I want to sort of uh focus my response on three lines you know uh as you stated that we need to build a very sort of uh robust and human centric AI ecosystem uh for global south. I think

the three challenges and uh Barbell just mentioned this you know about governance and the gap between global north and global south. So I want to focus attention for of everyone on three

aspects one is posity of data and fragmentation of data and overall you know availability of data that's a big challenge. The other is compute you know which is very essential and along with

that also comes energy uh which is very critical you know for us to uh sort of meaningfully exploit the potential that AI offers and the third is talent uh which is also very critical. So now I'm

just going to share some perspective on this. I'll also talk about you know what we have been doing as a company in this space. uh just one sec. Yeah. So I think when

it comes to data I think uh as you can imagine and Nakul just mentioned the health domain uh lot of model building work has been done but that's based on western data

sets and uh that probably is not readily applicable let's say to India or other countries you know uh so fundamentally data collection is very critical you have to contextualize it's not just true

for It's true for any domain you look at and and yes data is fragmented siloed that's true even within enterprise it's of course true for at a bigger scale I

personally believe that bringing this data kit together is important uh to create open data ecosystem but I believe problem is lies somewhere else the problem lies in the sensing

infrastructure that you need to put together to be able to have high quality, high volume, high velocity data. Uh take example of for example, I mean air pollution

monitoring, right? Just think of that. Uh you probably could do a much better job if you had sufficient number of sensors deployed uh across the region of interest. uh

probably they are going to be enlarged in number. You will have to think of you know how do you make it cheaper, faster, better and having done that it will also depend on you know how you could analyze

process and sort of derive insights that's where AI will come in right so I think government can play a very big role in sort of catalyzing this and enabling sort of you know putting

together a great sensing infrastructure uh could be thought of you know part of the digital public infrastructure. On top of that, private and public entities could innovate. Academicians

and inventor community could innovate. Uh so what are we doing here? Right. So we are so Indian government actually has been very proactive on the overall responsible AI mission.

uh I was part of the task force that was set up by principal scientific advisor to Indian government uh professor K Vijay Ragwan on responsible AI. uh this happened about 8 years back and we kind

of tried to study the implications of AI and the responsible facet of AI in Indian context then and following that lot of mission projects were launched. Uh so as part of that I have seen now

there are different AICOE uh supported by government. So we are part of AICOE for sustainability in collaboration with IIT Kpur and it's going live. In fact some of you might

have attended a session by IIT Kpur team yesterday on this very same topic. Uh where we are looking at lot of interesting problems in overall sustainability domain. So that's just

data. Uh I just will make yeah &gt;&gt; yeah just I'm just watching the time. So if you just mention your other two points super quickly. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. So I'll just mention about

compute uh which is again a very important facet. There is a big gap between what is available in global north versus global south. I have just two ideas to share. One is we should

think of how we could repurpose the legacy hardware. Okay. And you would see that lot of high-tech companies have innovated along that. uh it's not necessary that you need to have current

latest hardware. You could do a lot of innovations around it. Two, of course, you should in you should explore the new hardware that is becoming available. So, TCS, IBM and Anra government have come

together to create a quantum valley in India which could open ways for that. So, I think these are some quick remarks I thought. &gt;&gt; Great. No, I mean and and the the depth

is incredible, right? um the and you're you're talking about these very concrete collaborations that are making this, you know, um a possibility. Um okay, I think we'll go straight into just a a quicker

second round and then we're going to go for uh some comments from from you. And I want to bridge this now into you know we we've been talking about multistakeholder um partnerships and um

how the there are different roles across different parts and stakeholders um that uh have different roles to play but what's clear is that we also need collective action and so I wanted just

to kind of uh think about okay how do we move to kind of getting overall kind of collective action in these spaces for responsible use of AI. um that kind of gives that sort of

global framing around it. Um and as I mentioned at the beginning um one of the things that we have been doing um with the uh as part of the the Hamburg sustainability conference and the

Hamburg declaration on responsible AI for uh sustainable development um is really looking at this space of collective action. So a couple years ago um we we did the first Hamburg

declaration. Um we have about 50 uh organizations that have endorsed the declaration. It has a number of principles uh related to it around responsible use of AI. Um and Dr. Dr.

Coffler, I'm going to turn back to you to to ask you a question especially about that process, which is um since the adoption of the Hamburg AI declaration, what tangible progress have

we seen and what are the concrete actions that you think are now required to move from the higher level principles into sustained and scaled impact? &gt;&gt; Well, thank you for mentioning the

concrete action because that's actually what really is it is all about. We were coming up with that idea on Hamburg sustainability uh conference and on that paper uh not because we want to create

another paper or we want to create or invite to another conference. We really want to come up with commitments every stakeholder has to undertake when they are signing that memorandum. And uh so

my ministry also was signing it and we had concrete tangible uh measurable uh duties we have to fulfill commitments we have to fulfill. I would love to give you a few examples in sake of time and

try to be very short and very brief. Uh for example one of the commitments was training people. We were committing to train 160,000 people within one year. um we fulfilled that already and that's

very makes me very proud because we were trained already 190,000 so that is the first step we were committing we were committing to open up AI building blocks 12 AI buildings blocks especially for

using AI to climate action we are now by a number of 15 uh and we were also committing uh 30 AI data sets available uh as digital public goods and and we achieved 55 data sets. So, and that's

what it's all about. We are not signing something we don't want to do and then we have another year of time and applauding ourselves for signing something. We want to come up really

with concrete steps and that's what my ministry did until now. Um uh there are examples all over the world we are working with partners. We're working for example in Kenya there is about

analyzing satellite data which makes them available for uh farmers. We are working with Cambodia where it's about medicine that cervic cancer for example. We are working with the Indian

government. Your government is doing a fantastic uh project including including languages of the subcontinent analyzing we were just talking about it analyzing the data sets for many languages which

have to be included in the overall AI framework. So we are supporting Bashini by nine data sets. We we were supporting the collection. So that's what it's all about at the end of the day and that

will be my last sentence. I invite everybody in the room and maybe you spread the thought to join Hamburg declaration because it's a we started that and it's continuing government

should be part uh private sector should be part civil society should be part academia should be part of that and come up with concrete measurable tangible commitments which could be fulfilled or

can be fulfilled that so you're all invited next conference is in June 29th 13th uh this year &gt;&gt; I'm glad you mentioned that because uh the the QR code that you see on the

screen here, it gives you more information. If you would like to uh endorse the the Hamburg Declaration, just go to the the website there. Um we're getting short on time for um

audience interaction here, but Satchin, really really quickly, TCS endorsed um the Hamburg Declaration last year. What what progress have you seen since then? Yeah. So, yeah. So, I'll just uh quickly

point out uh to some activities we have been doing since then. Uh so, as I said, uh we are uh part of responsible AI deliberation in India and elsewhere. Uh and we have launched a big program

around it. uh where Carnegi Melon is now our academic partner and uh we are also talking to some Indian academics as you rightly said that these are very hard problems and this requires you know uh

significant collaborations across sectors uh we are also building our own technology uh to be able to evaluate calibrate and sort of help AI engineers

build more responsible AI uh it's called trusty platform. Uh more details we can share offline. Uh we are also very keen on greening of AI and that requires a lot of resource aware AI work. Uh so

this is again very significant and that's something we are on. &gt;&gt; Fantastic. And you just mentioned greening AI that's uh one of the the the key principles of the declaration.

Aruni and and Nak, I'll turn back to you now for some quick thoughts before we go for some Q&amp;A. Um, you know, where do you think uh as we look ahead, you know, we've talked about the Hamburg

Declaration is one sort of platform, but where do you see the strongest opportunities for new types of partnerships um going forward that things that maybe don't exist yet, but

that should or uh what you think is the next wave of this? Uh well you know as an organization Salesforce from 2014 has had an office of humane and ethical use of technology.

So this is something that I think you know most large corporates have to have a self-regulatory feature. Uh this is uh important because unless you self-regulate uh you will have

regulators coming down with a very heavy hand at some point of time or the other and that is not something you want. if you want to keep innovating. So that's something I think everybody all of us

should look at and having said that uh the other ways in which we can actually take part with uh the stakeholders is uh you know to continue to co-inovate with many of our customers those who are

interested uh to take forward uh our participation in many of these forums that are there. For instance, the national skilling mission. Uh the skilling mission that is taken that is

undertaken by NASCOM which is the IT industry body. Uh we also do internships in partnership with AICT which is the all India council of technical education. So there are very many apex

bodies that are willing to give us space uh for the private sector to come in and be part of the initiatives. And the advantage of going through them is they have far better reach uh to the colleges

to the communities uh that enables us to actually bring our products right directly to them. So I think you know if we look at all of these uh taking them together that really makes a story much

better and much stronger. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much. Knuckle same question to you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So uh you know in interest of time I'll try to be quick. two things that we

feel is missing in the ecosystem. One is this global repository of solutions that we're trying to work on and this is not just like a DPG platform or a DPI platform but even that can include

private sector if I am a startup in India I've built a good tool how do I sell it deploy it in Ethiopia it it becomes very difficult right now so is there an opportunity for us to create a

marketplace of sorts that has shared solutions uh shared playbooks shared governance EOS you know uh frameworks has a talent pool that would be leveraged who have worked on these

solutions. So I think that's one thing that is currently missing. The other is around AI assurance. So is there an opportunity for us to create regional evaluation hubs which are you know for a

given particular region because I see a lot of organizations struggle within country to get solutions evaluated. Now imagine a situation where we are trying to take solution from one country to

other but there is no clear guidelines around how the evaluation you know yard sticks would differ from one country to another. So that could be another area of collaboration between you know

various organizations who can set this up. &gt;&gt; Great ideas from you both on very concrete things. Okay. So we have time for a couple of questions um from Okay.

All right. We've got a lot of hands. Um I I'm going to try we're going to take uh a couple of questions um at the same times and and then we'll just go back for one more round from the panelists

for answers. So I think we'll start here and then I saw another hand here. Maybe we'll we'll try to do three quick ones. Okay. So one, two, three. &gt;&gt; My question is to Mr. Robert and Nakul.

So I want to ask is in comparison to LLMs your chat GPTs Geminis what is the value being added in comparison to LLMs versus traditional ML your improve classical improvements over functions

etc. &gt;&gt; Okay um then there was a question over here there are two two questions there yes gentleman in the blue and then beside him

&gt;&gt; my question is to you talked about bringing together people. There are fragmented initiatives, there are fragmented enabling services, but they are competing some. So, how do we bring

them together for a purpose uh and uh to create a bigger impact? &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Uh hi sir. Hi ma'am. I'm current undergradu student of economics at

University of Delhi. My question to you ma'am Bhachara. Uh first of all I would like to understand from your perspective having served in the private and then the public sector. Uh how do you see all

this debate that is around that SAS as a service will be dead as a result of all this but the context window the context you have will actually be the most beneficial. So what will actually happen

might one might say that the valuation will be doubled by all these companies who are actually in the space. So in that context if I ask you that how do you create value for small enterprises

that's happened for TCS for example the valuation is around $100 billion cursor which is a very new company the valuation is $30 billion so an employee count of 300 creating so much value and

that's at 600,000 employee count is creating that value so if in in that context will the democratization of software tech actually happen or is it just the big tech that benefit out of it

there will obviously will be the uh you know the benefit of people here and there but in the larger context who will benefit &gt;&gt; okay so some very technical questions

here um Arundati do you want to start with that one first about how to create value for small &gt;&gt; yeah so you know over here I don't think we are talking merely about the value

something creates on a particular day and by the way those values they keep sliding up and down nobody really knows who's the winner in the case till the race is over and the race is far from

over. Okay. So to towards that extent I would ask you not to be too uh you know not to be too um pressured or too influenced by uh things like SAS is dead and uh the entire valuation will come to

only these few companies and things like that. End of the day if there are no users what valuation will this company have? You need users. Now who creates users? Users are created by many many

processes and methods and only just having an LLM is not going to give you all of that. So a company when it actually works there are workflows, there are governance rules, there are

auditability requirements, there is observability, there is everything in in over there. And therefore, you know, just to think about one particular development by some particular company

making that kind of a you know uh uh statement. I think at this point of time is a little too ahead of its time. Things will shake themselves out. Having said that, it's also true that whether

it be TCS, whether it be Salesforce, whether it be State Bank of India or whether it be any other company, the ways in which we do our work is going to change. The ways in which people take in

technology and that influences their lives will change. And companies that will be amanable to the change, companies that will take advantage of the change are the ones that are going

to sustain, are the ones that are going to go up in value. But my sincere uh request to you because you're a youngster is don't try to look at market cap while trying to create your company.

Do the right things. The market cap will follow. Okay? It's not market cap that makes you want to work. It's your work and your satisfaction and being able to get something that really and truly

helps people improve their standards of living, improve the way they actually stay in this world. That is what should drive you, not the market cap numbers. Okay.

&gt;&gt; Yeah. I I think you just got an MBA. Um so Sachin, you wanted to add quickly to that? &gt;&gt; Yeah, I just want to add to that. Uh think of LLM as something that is

worldwise. Okay. And that's a great advancement of AI. But you need something that is industry-wise, something that is companywise, something that is context wise, task wise. Right?

We are far from that and there are lots of challenges. I mean just before this Arundati and I were discussing the kind of data silos that exist even within an enterprise, right? So we are looking at

AI and agentic AI in particular is something that is going to bring more connectedness within enterprise. There is significant amount of work to be done. But you imagine now this combined

intelligence right where you have different agents coordinating and working together will probably help us get more. So sum of parts could be more than whole. It's very likely scenario.

There are challenges to get it done. Okay. But nature of work may change but there is plenty of work coming at us and LLM has just solved part of the problem. &gt;&gt; Yeah.

&gt;&gt; Um Knuckle there were a couple questions uh about how do we bring uh people together for shared purpose and specific question I think it was LLM versus ML. Is that what you were saying? Yeah.

&gt;&gt; Do you want to take this? &gt;&gt; Okay. So &gt;&gt; and just sorry we've got just two minutes before we have to close the session. So just

&gt;&gt; yeah so LM versus you know traditional ML in our experience what we have realized is in a lot of places spec specifically because we work in impact sector a lot of work we do is with

ground level users uh resource is a big challenge right you're talking about situations where the mobile phones are very basic internet is a challenge uh adoption is an issue in those scenarios

we have often learned that traditional ML models have worked much to serve the purpose and large language models have not been able to serve the purpose and in a lot of cases not even

deployable right so there are genuine technical issues because of infrastructure because of low resource settings which have not allowed LLM to sort of reach where we would want them

to reach right second in such cases small language models or small AI is what we've been now moving towards to have it serve very specific purpose rather trying to give general

intelligence to you know uh some of these users on field right so that's a very quick answer I could have just gone on u to answer your question sir &gt;&gt; I don't think we are trying to eliminate

competition I think the way we should be thinking about this that there are different ways organizations can collaborate right some of them could collaborate based on geographical

synergies some of them can collaborate bases on expertise uh you know synergies some of them can collaborate bases at what part of the life cycle of this entire AI uh deployment they can

collaborate on that and absolutely there will be consorcia that will be created who still continue to compete with each other and that's that's a good thing to ensure that there's also quality in the

market but the idea is to foster collaboration where those synergies are possible at least we start with that &gt;&gt; sorry sir we're going to have to close the panel because we have literally 10

seconds left on the counter um I just want to say uh thank you very much to our panelists we have gone from you know highest level government frameworks to uh questions about competitive landscape

and how small companies can exist. But the or or can prosper but the uh you know throughine to all of this is that it doesn't happen in silos. It cannot happen with only one stakeholder uh of

society. This has to be multistakeholder and we have to commit to collective action. So I again refer to the QR code if you're interested in the Hamburg declaration that has more information on

how to uh endorse that. Um please uh join me in and thanking our panelists for the excellent insights. And thanks to all of you and and good rest of summit to you.
