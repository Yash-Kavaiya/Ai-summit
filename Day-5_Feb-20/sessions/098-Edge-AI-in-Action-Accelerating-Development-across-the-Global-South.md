## 📝 Summary

As AI evolves, the shift from centralized cloud computing to edge AI is transforming how data is processed and acted upon. By moving intelligence closer to data sources such as sensors, mobile devices, and IoT systems, edge AI reduces latency, bandwidth usage, and energy consumption while improving real-time decision-making, privacy, and security. Real-world applications will be highlighted along with emerging lightweight and generative AI models designed for resource-constrained edge environments.
