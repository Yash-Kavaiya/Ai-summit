## 📝 Summary

AI impact depends not on pilots, but on sustained adoption across institutions. While innovation is abundant, diffusion capacity remains limited, leaving organizations to repeat costly experiments. This session introduces AI Diffusion Infrastructure as a shared foundation of standards, playbooks, and trusted pathways that reduce operational and compliance risks. Leaders from technology, government, and development will explore how to scale safe, repeatable AI systems across sectors and geographies, turning isolated successes into equitable population scale outcomes.
