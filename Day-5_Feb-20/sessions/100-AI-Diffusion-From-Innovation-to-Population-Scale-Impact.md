## 📝 Summary

AI impact depends not on pilots, but on sustained adoption across institutions. While innovation is abundant, diffusion capacity remains limited, leaving organizations to repeat costly experiments. This session introduces AI Diffusion Infrastructure as a shared foundation of standards, playbooks, and trusted pathways that reduce operational and compliance risks. Leaders from technology, government, and development will explore how to scale safe, repeatable AI systems across sectors and geographies, turning isolated successes into equitable population scale outcomes.

## 📝 Transcript

Um so if I can request uh all the panelists along with Mr. Shankar and Mr. Sorab for a picture please because everyone has different schedule so we just want to get a quick photo of this

moment before we move ahead. Yeah. Content first. All right. Thank you so much panelists. You can take your seat. Um to take us forward, I'd like to invite uh to

deliver a keynote um Mr. Sor Gar who is the secretary of Mosby India. If you can take us forward. Thank you so much. U good afternoon and u great to be here on this session talking of diffusion AI

diffusion um I'll uh just speak of one or two aspects of it because I'm sure the panelists uh would lend a lot more color to this topic

on uh just to take off where Shanka left um sometimes uh he's talking about use cases and that's very necessary because AI is perhaps something like a solution in search of a problem.

&gt;&gt; So uh until until we don't find use cases for that it will not be able to give the value that it potentially can and I think that's really really important.

Um we talking of uh AI being a possible DPI a digital public infrastructure and I suppose for that some steps would be needed to ensure that it becomes uh uh trusted interoperable and sharable. I

think those are aspects uh which a DPI like Aadhaar or UPI has and I think we are still in early days but we the mechanisms for that how we can ensure that it would be possible and given that

we talk of four resources as foundational AI resources uh compute data sets uh talent and models [snorts] uh apart from obviously the framework works that

would be necessary for this. And I mentioned this because I had the privilege of chairing the uh democratizing AI resources uh group working group of the AI summit and uh

various options that we discussed with other countries on how we can ensure uh democratization of these four foundational resources. Obviously each of them would have a different uh uh

mechanism. uh but one thing I would just go down in slightly greater details is on the data sets part part uh which is also something that we are doing uh within

the ministry of statistics across uh different ministries and uh and states and why I'm saying u data sets is also because perhaps uh data is also the raw material for AI models so it's it's a

very foundational resource in in that sense and U compute is perhaps something that we can acquire and therefore uh we have discussions around

models whether they need to be more efficient. They are right now extremely power both computer and energy intensive how we can make them lighter going forward. That is something uh which is

work in progress. I think it will take some time before the small and domain uh small domain models come in. human being which will perhaps improve diffusion but uh data is something that would need to

be AI ready going forward and in AI ready I would probably make four things that it needs to be one is discoverable how do you ensure that data is easily discoverable and that's perhaps by

ensuring that the metadata is is is understood by everyone and that makes it easier for any models also to understand second on the trustworthiness of the data and that's the quality assessments

that we have whether it's it's trustworthy and it's credible and that would determine its use. The third is in its interoperability with the two sets of data sets. How how interoperable

there are. What are the kind of unique identifiers it has to be able to identify what is it uh uh how to link different data sets and the fourth is its usability across systems and that

would be dependent on the standardization and the classifications that we use uh which are internationally similar so that uh different conclusions don't from the same uh data set and

obviously the focus would have to be on access and dissemination so that uh it's available uh for uh use while keep preserving the privacy of the data uh the safeguards that would need to be

built and why I'm saying about data is uh because uh this uh would be also where a lot of the uh uh local context uh linguistic context, cultural context will come in and that will come in from

the data sets there are we talk of uh ensuring that uh it is locally relevant the the inferences and the solutions and I suppose the data would uh would would determine its local relevance and and

ensure that it's uh useful at at at different levels. Um so I'll I'll stop here apart from the fact saying that uh for democratizing AI resources uh the working group uh discussed with the

others and a kind of a platform has been suggested going forward which has been named as METRI uh metri in Hindi means friendship for those who are not aware and it's a acronym for multi-stakeholder

AI uh for a resilient and resilient and uh I'm forgetting what's the T for now that sorry trust [laughter] so and infrastructure so uh that's the

that's the acronym that we hope to be able to but what the concept is that on a modular level on a voluntary basis level on a non commitment level how we can develop on the foundational AI

resources of availability of comput data sets models and talent and I think uh the way we are able to develop this and move towards a DPI for AI resources I'm sure diffusion would become all the more

uh easier so thank you for this opportunity and thank you and look forward to [applause] &gt;&gt; thank you thank you everyone and We will

carry on. Um we don't have enough panels in which all of us are women. So three cheers for that. Uh don't look at each other. You guys get had a great contribution. [laughter]

Yeah. So [clears throat] couple of weeks back uh some of us got together and we said invention has happened in west impact has to happen at

each one of us. What's the gap between invention and impact and that's where we came out um and thought about we we thought about adoption and then we said isn't it

and why did we pick diffusion? We actually read a book. We read a book by Jeffrey Ding. He's a professor in um um it's in DC. Why am I forgetting the name

of the institute? It's uh DC Georgetown sorry Georgetown in DC. And we read about AI diffusion and that GPT the general purpose technology like electricity

it diffused into the society over several decades. It was created in Europe but actually diffused in US quite a lot. US capture cap captured on it and also chemical engineering which shanka

talked about that chemical the chemical engineering creation if you see if you remember chemistry bore model you know all those were Germans but actually it's us who capitalized on that AI is like

that invention happened in the west we all know that but it's the global south is going to have use cases who are going to diffuse it into sectors into the into into the and the horizontal enablers

have to happen across these sectors for us to benefit for us to have more more economic benefit out of out of AI. So that's when all of us said that yes we will do uh 100 diffusion pathways to uh

by 2030 and one of the partner in crime was Kizome she's here with us and kizome my first question is to you that that tell us about how you think because you know

Kenya comes in you are based in Italy and we did a tripartite with Kenya Italy and India how do you think 100 pathways to 2030 pan out for you and what does it mean for you? How how do you think it'll

happen? &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Uh Shani, how long do I have to answer this question? &gt;&gt; Um &gt;&gt; short version, long version, short

version. &gt;&gt; As long as people are okay with stories, you can carry on. Um well I mean as Sorab G uh the chair of the working group for democratization of AI

spoke about there are some fundamental resources or inputs AI need in order for it to actually work uh uh in a way that can help a common citizen or a small business owner. And some of those

foundations that he spoke about are AI ready data, compute. And those were the things that I in my role at the United Nations Development Program working in Africa, in parts of Latin America, uh in

Asia discovered that there is a constraint on access to some of these foundational resources. And so this G7 AI hub was created to address that um that constraint by one unlocking

additional resources from of course the friendly G7 countries that wanted to focus on parts of Africa but also as we do that to think about what is the business case for data centers for GPUs

on the continent. uh how do you break data silos even though the global south is so rich in data uh as well as how do you orchestrate talent especially since we saw that much of you know let's say

Microsoft's or big tech's uh talent pool on the continent of Africa and in uh in other parts of the world were actually coming from the global south countries um and over the last one year

or so I've seen this tremendous momentum of many of the African uh uh people who worked in big tech or large companies moving back to the continent because they actually don't

want the continent to be left behind. They want to be co-architects of the future. this fundamental shift that our the humanity is going through and this is where you know when we talk

about 100 AI diffusion pathways it is about co-architecting pathways where we look at how do we bring not just language data but voice adoption into solutions that a small

holder farmer can use that a women entrepreneur can use and not just as pilots but to think about it from a infrastructure perspective a dig public infrastructure perspective where we can

scale to millions of farmers go across uh uh um national boundaries and be able to look across borders either as digital public goods or as expansion of you know private sector innovations or public

private partnerships. So as Shankr said, diffusion pathways could be many uh and it's for the world to figure out and I'm very much part of the the the group the early group that's been trying to think

about this and figuring it out for the last couple months along with our partners at XTEP and and many other partners. &gt;&gt; Thank you Kizoom. Um I'll come to you

Janet. uh you lead global development for AI across uh multiple geographies uh but most of the pilot most of them are stuck in pilots right it doesn't uh how does AI become production scale and

do you think it's funding that they lack only or uh are there more diffusion pathways that we can create so that actually AI pilot moves to population scale

Hello. Hi. Um, well, I maybe I would first start by saying the problem of pilotitis is actually one that sort of predates AI and we have many technologies that are enormously

beneficial for humanity that I think are currently still stuck in uh not having diffused. But when I think about the positive examples, the places where I think as a global community we've had

tremendous scaled impact, right? having um or reducing child mortality by half uh since 20 uh 2000. Um 170 million people out of uh extreme poverty. The you know common threads are often that

we've managed to figure out how to get both governments and markets to really focus and work for the most vulnerable populations. Um and so you know if it whether it's vaccines that we're talking

about or instant payment systems um often it is really just ensuring that government is uh there at the design phase uh at the table in the driver's seat not brought in after the pilot

results come in. Um it is uh very much focused on making sure that um we make it easier for local innovators to be able to enter markets. So whether that's you can aggregate low margin demand, you

can streamline market entry um but really making it easy to lower the cost to serve for for the most kind of vulnerable uh people at the edge. And then um it is very much also building

institutional capacity uh and making sure that you know it's not there's playbooks and training and all of that but really shared infrastructure uh that allow sort of all boats to rise

and and making that that infrastructure is uh trustworthy, is inclusive, sort of creates I think a really positive feedback loop because the I um I loved what uh Nandanda Nilani expressed which

is that we um you know really rely on institutions for trust not on algorithms. And I think one of the ways that institutions become trustworthy is by being inclusive and making sure that

they actually serve um the the people that otherwise would would be last to benefit. &gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely. I think that's that's a key that how do you trust the

institutions and AI output will you know suppose it's coming out of a AI advisory application do you trust that or do you trust the institution which is giving in a physical or will

the institution adopt this AI advisory so that you know there's more trust on the advice itself being given that's a that's a quite um hybrid and risky manner and institution utions have to

understand AI and adopt and first trust the AI output before they say that this is ours. I think that that part is uh is key on AI adoption. Uh be tell us about uh Brazil that you

know um a very different perspective. Um just let us first let us understand that how is the AI adoption in that region and are you also stuck in this pilot to pilot to production and is

there a gap and how do you see that being bridged? &gt;&gt; Perfect. Um so I think there are many different ways and perspectives to think about AI in the Brazilian government. We

chose to to establish a vision for um one government for each person. So that means we're going like fully on the personalization and even like in the agentic state uh vision right. So for

that uh we need to be thinking about some some shared infrastructure and shared capabilities. So what we did was starting with the with the data um we we have a project now to uh not just

catalog but also prepare the the data sets for training. Um we are also building um some shared platforms uh for for personalization and u to understand citizens characteristics.

So it's within our state-owned enterprises. We're making them collab. We have two large IT state-owned enterprises and we're making them collaborate on a shared platform in

which we have some canonical data sets about citizens and every ministry contributes with different characteristics and we're creating different labels for for every citizen.

Um and then one different way in which we're trying to break the data silos which of course is a very big issue is to think about the uh the data ecosystems. So we we came up with this

concept and it doesn't mean that we're doing data lakes. It means that we're thinking about interperability from aatic pers perspective. So one example is the child early childhood um

ecosystem data ecosystem. So we we know that a lot of policies related to early childhood uh they have different uh data requirements and they need to use similar registries. So we we created

this ecosystem. We brought together five ministries ministry of health, education, social development, uh management and human rights. um and we cataloged the policies and what kind

of data would be needed and then we started creating the standards for that specific ecosystem. So we prioritize early childhood um and um environmental and land

ecosystems u land environmental land and climate it's in the same group um so we are starting with that and it seems to to be an interesting approach it seems to be working the other thing is coming

back to the DPI discussion um it is very helpful for us to have the digital ID and authentication to implement this vision So um what we're doing now is we started a well a lot of people in the

government want to do genai right and uh um because I think it's the the easiest and maybe most famous type of AI implementation. So a lot of government entities and ministries wanted to do

their own chat bots. So it was being spread all over. Um so what what we did was also to try to centralize uh that capability and we started withformational chats. Um so what kind

of policies or information would be helpful? Uh now we are just starting the transactional um part of the the chatbots. So the idea is that a citizen will be able to

actually complete a service request or get their service uh done through the chat. And that's only possible because we have the gov.br PR authentication. So we know that the person is is is

actually the the right person. And then the third step which we're going to we still haven't entered but that's the vision is the agentic state right so the to build the agent specific for that

that person and that will only be able to happen once we have the data platform infrastructure. So that's more or less how how we're thinking about the plan. Okay. Uh and thanks for bringing uh DPI

into the picture because my next question is on that. Uh Nandan announced uh yesterday 2000 pathways to 2030 because it comes back comes from a lot of experience on DPI and Kizo my next

question is to you that you know you were also in the DPI journey working with India. Do you think in AI there are rails like you know DPI lays down rails, roads

which then other countries can take? Do you think in AI how do use cases cross borders? How do use cases what are the pathways? What are the playbooks that that different countries can benefit of

uh benefit from benefit from? How how do you think that can happen? Shallini, great question. And I'm assuming this room is fully aware of or is a user user [clears throat] of

digital public infrastructure. Raise your hands if you're not. &gt;&gt; Oh my god, one or two people. [laughter] It's probably one of the reasons why I don't

Okay, we're not going to get into that right now. [laughter] &gt;&gt; You use up UPI, right? You use Digi Locker. You are you don't use digital but you digatra.

&gt;&gt; No. Okay. I think you should &gt;&gt; but you use you use UPI. Okay. So he's a DPI user and that's the beauty of digital public infrastructure. You actually want to be invisible.

And one of the one of the one of the sort of design one of the ambitions that we have as part of the AI diffusion pathways is that we actually don't want AI to be

this noisy chaotic technology. We want it to be so invisible because it's actually part of your life part of not just our life because obviously for us it's very convenient for English

speakers. Um you know we and so we are at this summit but for a small holder farmer for a small micro entrepreneur business woman who's crossing borders between Guinea and Selon for example. So

to go back to your question uh Shallani um one as you know Beia was already starting to say as she's seeing in Brazil and as certainly we're seeing in many parts of the world including in

India when you have uh data that's already interoperable uh and public rails such as identity uh payments data exchange then the power of AI is much more uh easier to bring to

you know that same service that you wanted to reach out that's now an AI chatbot to a farmer on those rails. So that's fantastic. But then we're also seeing an emergence of additional rails.

Uh for those of you who are from India, you are probably have heard of someone using Bashini uh which is built on AI for Bharat and and sort of the Indic language stack. So

that is definitely public rail and I know that in different parts of the world there are many such rails being created and you know our I hope that we see the emergence of rails but also the

convergence of rails because as the French president yesterday was saying along with honorable prime minister uh Modi that it's not that we need to do more it's that we need to do better

together so this is where the public whales really need to come together and then I want to recognize Selena from Zindi here from Africa. She runs a public infrastructure. She runs a

network of 100,000 data scientists across Africa. And that's that's already infrastructure. It's public interest, public value. And we're at a place where we're trying to figure out what is the

business case. How do we still make them sustainable by creating those innovation layers on top of the public rails that are also emerging on AI? But it's not like you have to, you know, compete

between DPI and AI. It's like the DPI principles of interoperability, modularity, reusability, becoming a digital public good, those still remain quite intact. And this is how we might

see population scale, the scale towards impact. &gt;&gt; Yeah, thank you. Thank you, Kiz for explaining it so well. And actually that's happening because not just the

language the multilinguality voice AI that is becoming a DPI because you should be able to interact in voice and the voice stack is something which should be available for most of the

people to build on top of it. Safety the guard rails they are DPI in itself they can become DPI in itself that how do you do safe conversations in agriculture? How do you do safe or a aggregate uh uh

conversations if someone is calling up as a per patient care in healthcare and can those conversations become a playbook in itself? So these are the playbooks which can get created. So

thank you so much for talking about it. Um I'll come to you Janet that you know the frictions which are there right I mean do you think there could be certain programs or investments to be done where

such frictions because everybody is building like the full stack hey I'll do language translation hey I will do compute I need data I need so how do you remove the frictions and do you think

some programs and investments can help this um you know I was thinking about um this question and the example that kind of came to mind that might be kind of

illustrates it really well. Um I was thinking about the the MOSA program which is uh really kind of an open- source platform. It's inspired by the ADAR program. Uh but it uh is part of a

larger effort with World Bank and many other partners to actually try to take that open-source you know vendorfree lock in uh national ID system

uh and bring it to many many countries. Um and when I thought about the the components of that um the programming components I know a lot of it was around ensuring that there was sort of an open

production ready reference implementation frame and if we're going to continue on the road analogy I was trying to think of like what what would that be and you still if you have a road

you still need to pick sides of the road and agree on which sides of the road everyone's going to drive in. You have to agree that a stop sign means stop and that red means stop. And so there are

still I think a set of um programmatic standards and norms that really makes it easier not only for the adoption but for those that have adopted to be then able to benefit um from from that adoption.

Um and then you know a lot of when I think about programmatically what has happened in in something like MOSIP is in addition to the technical implementation there was a lot of

operational support a lot of just uh examples countries visiting each others and you know I think India has sent many delegations to many countries to help um uh explain their story share their

pathway um there's uh training that needs to be had right you still have to get your driver's license and prove that you know how to use it Um and so you know I think even after building the

rails there's still uh plenty of program implementation work to actually really help facilitate and and lubricate that uh adoption and of course financing as well um which which kind of came through

uh the World Bank program. So you know it is a it's a bit of um um no sort of single bullet. Uh even after I think after having the rails set there's still I think a lot of work to be done program

implementation and uh operational support. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Um be what's the hardest challenge? I mean this all sounds very easy have diffusion pathways go and

build it. uh but it has to be like operational it has to be adopted they're people right the human in the loop is the most important in AI we we can never ignore that uh what's the hardest

challenge that you see in this just one &gt;&gt; just one oh we are lucky um maybe I'm going to talk about some some institutional challenges and and how we are thinking about those uh so obviously

it's not just creating applications. You've got it's the same old story of digital transformation, right? It's just at a different level, but you've got to change the processes um the way things

work. So, what we're doing uh I think maybe three interesting things that we are trying to do al also I'm not trying to sell it right everything that we are doing is we're testing. So, let's see

what works and what doesn't. Um but one thing that we are doing now is in the ministry of management uh we have a secretaria for shared services and they didn't used to work with AI. So the idea

is that we make it very very simple for any ministry to to use um a a service that is um centralized in the ministry of of of management. Um so for example uh with these chat bots that I was I was

telling you about um we came up we've centralized the the procurement and we chose one vendor to to help us build the solutions and each ministry was doing their own. So we said, "Hey, if you buy

it through the the centralized service, you only need it it takes just a few hours. You just need to sign sign um um a document and transfer some money digitally to to the Ministry of

Management and you can use the service. So you don't have to go through any procurement." Um so that's that's one way that we're trying to to overcome the the problem of multiple solutions and

difficult implementation. Um we also came up with an interesting I think uh institutional arrangement which is when we're talking about AI we're talking about innovation and new capabilities.

So capabil to the ministry of management which means that they're building the whole process of like how you came come up with first like a policy goal like

what's the the AI project is going to target how do you experiment they build the process for experimenting they have analysts looking at the data and seeing if things are working so that's uh

something that seems to be working well and and we think it's going to it's going to be good um the other challen real challenge that we have I think is the with the vendors uh and I'm using my

development hat here from my previous background um I think there's um everyone is talking about AI and how um every agency and and ministry needs to be doing something on AI and obviously

there are some big vendors who are saying yeah like you government you don't have the capabilities we have the capabilities we can do it very fast we do it at scale and if you start making

these decisions day after day you're not going to build any capability if you just outsource it. Um, and I use an analogy with, for example, the army. Um, no one thinks that it's reasonable to

outsource your army to a country that has a a stronger army or a better army. But in terms of digital, we're doing it every day. Like for every decision, oh, this country, this company does it

better, so we're just going to outsource. And there are some essential capabilities. It's not just an AI tool or something like we are playing with national data. We have some very

strategic goals also. So I think if we don't think about building these capabilities even if you start small and and it takes a while to build the muscles, we've got to build the muscles.

Um so we're trying to incentivize also the the agencies to to test and experiment and don't buy prepackaged solutions because we've got to build our own muscles.

&gt;&gt; Yeah. I think um you brought in a very valid point which is what lot of people are scared of is the vendor lock in right and um you would have seen Amul AI which got launched by the prime minister

and um we as astep foundation made it possible and the one key thing was there that how do you keep it multimodel like multiple models should be able to do it why why just one and that's been a key

thing that how do you give choice to people how do you give um you know not logged into the system because that's where the diffusion works diffusion is not about like concentrated

western LLMs altogether and just deploy it it's about actually walking the path give choice replaceability have domain knowledge have data with you because data is there with us in our enterprise

systems and we don't want a uh you you know learning from them how can you separate that so it's it's about actually and now this knowhow that we have got we want to share with with

everybody and that that playbook is a diffusion pathway that's exactly and that that gives an example for that um kizum you and me co-authored a paper which is up in Atlantic Council and uh

we also talk about the use case adoption framework would you like to you know tell people about the use case adoption framework and how that can be a friction remover.

&gt;&gt; Uh absolutely and I'm looking for the key author that I saw of the use case adoption framework Tandi Lal director at uh people plus AI at XEP Foundation. Um

so you know when we when we were preparing for the AI impact summit many months ago which which feels like many years ago. We started with this

idea. We started with this idea saying adoption is proving to be a challenge. What are we learning from our experience? And this is where XJEP looked at Mahavistar its work with AI

for Bharat its ongoing conversations with entropic and other uh private sector companies on safety tooling and I did the same uh across a number of countries and I think together we

consulted about 20 plus countries uh had convenings in South Africa to New York uh to I don't know many many more places along with the Gates Foundation as well. And what we learned was that

the the impact of what technology like artificial intelligence can do sits in sectors. So, education, health, climate change, but its ability to move from pilot to scale depends on the horizontal

unlocks. So this this 100 diffusion AI diffusion pathways underpinning that is this framework that's we call the AI adoption framework the use case adoption framework where we see impact in sectors

where you need contextual data contextual knowledge process workflows things that have to change in a department of education to you know department of health and so on. But then

the horizontal unlocks are the language data um compute um generally how do you make AI AI uh data AI ready or how do you make data interoperable because a farmer is going

to be buying things selling things you know getting public services so we can't you know sort of we have to think about it from a user life perspective so this is really I think a bit bit about the uh

use case adoption framework uh that we've done together with countries Gates Foundation uh with XEP and uh we hope that this helps us ground our 100 AI diffusion pathways because as Shardani

was saying this is not about just going and saying I have this solution you adopted because we're not going to see that impact with that approach we'll have to co-design some pathways we'll

have to fuse verticals and verticals and horizontals and this is where at least when I talk to many innovators private sector companies in the global south I see them saying aha this is how we

co-architect the future this is where when we develop a voice optimization uh solution as a public good that goes out to the world we are builders of the future too so this you know it's just

such a powerful u uh kind of learnings that we've put together into this hundred AI diffusion pathways towards impact act. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you, Kisum. Um I'm uh

looking at the time and I would like to uh ask the audience to have like two questions. So uh please raise your hand if uh yeah uh I saw yours first and Okay, then yours.

limitations Would anybody like to take it? Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I was so distracted by the crowd that's coming in. [laughter] We're getting kicked out, guys.

Um, so I think your question was how to address diversity and diffusion. So, so &gt;&gt; yeah, but if you can't read, can you

hear? Because this is where I think voice adoption is something that is key to the inclusion agenda and the impact agenda of AI. So, I would say to answer your question,

voice adoption. Yeah, actually that's why AI becomes more equalizer and it actually bridges the um bridges the divide right so um there are inequalities and

uh how do you bring in new language today bringing a new language into a model has become fairly easy fairly right so bringing a new language which we can talk about yeah that's that's

that's available there is data which is logged in PDFs into various regions and people are not knowing that today that's become easier So that's that's how it is a it is a

leveler. I'll &gt;&gt; that's a trusted source. That's that's a trusted source. So I'll I'll I'll maybe talk to you later about what Mr. Sorabberg talked about that how evidence

Yeah. One last question. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Uh I think you're talking about a pivotal moment, right? Uh one like you know I'm not a fortune teller, right? But I but what I can do is I do
