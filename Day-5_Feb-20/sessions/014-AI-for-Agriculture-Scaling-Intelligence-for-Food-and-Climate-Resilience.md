## 📝 Transcript

May I invite Dr. Dvish Chhatravei, Secretary Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare. Sir, please come on to the stage. Our

honorable chief minister Shri David is here. Good morning sir and welcome. May I also invite Mr. Johannes Jut regional vice president World Bank onto the stage please.

Honorable Chief Minister of Maharashtra Sri Dendra Fernavis GI, Honorable Minister Sri Ashi Shellar GI, Sri Nitesh Shan G, our distinguished guests from India and

around the world. Very good morning. On behalf of the government of Maharashtra, I welcome you to the session on using AI for food and climate resilience. Agriculture is at a turning point.

Climate change is making farming riskier. Resources are limited and markets are changing quickly. However, there is an opportunity. Digital tools and AI are advancing fast.

Our goal is not just to use AI tools. We must build intelligence into our public systems to help everyone. For India, the change is essential. It is the it is the key to food and

nutrition security, higher farmer incomes and a stable economy. India has shown that digital systems work when they are open and well-governed. Our next step is to bring

AI into this framework in a responsible way. Under the leadership of honorable chief minister of Maharashtra, the state has launched the Maha Agri AI policy 2025 2029.

This policy uses AI for farmer advisory services, market information, data exchange, product traceability, innovation and research and creating capacities of stakeholders.

We are moving beyond pilots to projects at full scale. Mahavistar is the country's first AI powered network and information and advisory services. Today Mahavistar is being used by more

than 2.5 million farmers to get advisories in Marathi language and recently the first tribal language in the country bili has also been integrated into Mahavisttar.

Agri is helping farmers to get seamless access to various schemes and services. The Maha Eex which is an open federated and consentdriven architecture for data exchange. It is helping us to

bring diverse data sets together to get us a big picture. Agriculture is now a key part of India AI mission. We are proud to work with the government of India to lead this change. I want to

thank the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, Ministry of Agriculture, Extra Foundation, the World Bank, MS Sominatan Research Foundation, the Gates Foundation and all our

partners for their support. It is now my duty to invite our honorable chief minister to the stage. He will share his vision for using AI to strengthen our food systems and protect our climate.

After the address of honorable chief minister, we have a panel discussion with our distinguished panelists. Welcome [applause]

A very good morning to all of you. Dish Chhaturvati G Rajeshal G Vikas Rasto Gonis Jet Shrimati Swami Swaminatan Shankar Maruara

my colleagues Shashi Shayar gi Niteshani G all the dignitaries present here namaskar and good morning to everyone.

It is my privilege to address this distinguished gathering at the India AI impact summit and this important session on AI in agriculture. We meet at a very defining moment

across the world. Food systems are under strain. Climate volatility is intensifying. Water tables are falling. Soil health is deteriorating.

Supply chains are fragile and global markets are unpredictable. For countries from the global south, agriculture is not merely an economic sector. It is livelihood, social

stability and national security. India understands this very deeply and under the visionary leadership of our honorable prime minister Shindarendra Modi GI, India has placed digital public

infrastructure and responsible AI at the center stage of national development. The India AI mission is about using technology to deliver inclusion, transparency and scale. Today,

agriculture must sit at the heart of this mission. Over half a billion Indians depend directly or indirectly on agriculture. Yet small holders face fragmented information, rising input

costs, climate uncertaintity, and limited access to credit and markets. Traditional extension systems, however committed, cannot match the scale and the speed required.

Artificial intelligence changes this equation. AI can provide hyper local weather predictions, early pest outbreaks, warnings,

precision irrigation and fertilizer guidance, credit scoring based on crop intelligence, transparent traceable supply chains,

realtime market advisories. But let me emphasize AI is not a magic. As honorable PM said in his inaugural session, AI must be built on a trusted data, ethical

governance and public accountability. Without trust, scale will not happen. Last year, Maharashtra made a very clear and decisive strategic decision. AI in agriculture must not remain

confined to demonstrations or pilots. It must reach millions. Under our Mahaggree AI policy 202529, we adopted a policy-led ecosystemdriven model built on openness and

interoperability. Allow me to share what this has meant in practice. As rightly told by our secretary Mahav Vistar,

our AI powered mobile platform delivers multilingual personalized advisories, market intelligence, best alerts and access to government services.

more than 2.5 million downloads acting as digital friend to all these farmers. This demonstrates one thing very clearly. Farmers are ready for AI. When AI is designed for them, AI based best

surveillance crops app integration is our mantra. By integrating geospatial analytics with post surveillance, we have delivered early warnings to cotton growing farmers, reducing crop

vulnerability and finance risk. This is predictive governance in action. &gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Agriculture data exchange is also

one thing which is defining this step. We are building a statewide interoperable agriculture data exchange based on open standards and strong data governance. Data must empower farmers

not exploit them. Traceability digital public infrastructure in today's global markets the transparency is a mantra we have we are unveiling a blueprint of for a

traceability DPI that will ensure end to end visibility across value chains enhancing food safety export competitiveness and consumer trust and this is not propriety

proprietary. It is being designed as a replicable public infrastructure model for India and the entire global south. In partnership with India AI mission, the government of Maharashtra, the World

Bank and the Vadani AI, we launched a global call for AI use cases in agriculture. The resulting compendium of real world AI applications in agriculture was

released in Delhi on 17th February 2026. This compendium documents successful AI deployments from Africa, Asia, Latin America and beyond. India is convening global knowledge for the benefit of the

global south. As we move towards AI for agree 2026 in Mumbai, our vision rests on four pillars. Responsible governance. AI must be transparent, auditable and explainable, open and interoperable

digital infrastructure. Innovation cannot scale in silos. Investment and scaling. Technology without capital remains just a theory and inclusion and gender equity is also

a mantra. 2026 is the international year of women in agriculture. AI solutions must be designed with women farmers, not merely for them. Maharashtra today presents one

of the most compelling agree innovation ecosystems globally. 150 lakh hectares of cultivated land, diverse agroclimatic conditions, leading agriculture universities and AI

research centers, a vibrant startup ecosystem, a clear regulatory framework and single window facilitation for investors. We invite

venture capital funds, impact investors, multilateral development banks, corporate innovation arms and philanthropic foundations to partner with us.

And in this partnership, we envisage scaling AI advisory platforms, co-developing tracibility DPI modules, investing in agreech startups, supporting digital literacy specially

among women farmers, building capacity in the rural AI ecosystems. When you invest in Maharashtra, you invest in scalable solutions for engaging economies worldwide. Food

security, climate resilience, and AI governance are deeply connected. Countries that master AI enabled agriculture will secure farmer incomes and strategic stability. India has the

scale DPI and democratic governance model to demonstrate how AI can be deployed responsibly at population scale. Maharashtra is proud to be laboratory of that ambition. Friends,

this satellite session is a declaration. We will move from pilots to platforms, from fragmented data to interoperable systems, from experimentation to execution, from intention to investment.

The government of Maharashtra stands ready to collaborate with the government of India, with states, with global institutions, investors, researchers and farmer organizations.

Let us ensure that AI becomes a force for food security, climate resilience, women empowerment and shared prosperity across the global south. With this, I would like to thank you all for

listening me patiently. Thank you. Jin J. Maharashtra. Thank you sir for your visionary address. You always continue to inspire us to aim higher and achieve better. And

under your leadership, I can assure you the agriculture department will rise to the challenge and serve the aspirations of more than 15 million farmers of the state of Maharashtra. Thank you so much

sir. We will now uh start the panel discussion in a few moment. Hey, hey, hey. Hey.

Hey. Hey. We'll now start with the panel discussion as the second part of this session. We are fortunate to have as us with us a

distinguished panel representing national policy leadership global development scientific expertise national AI architecture and digital public infrastructure innovation. Let me

introduce the panelists once again. Dr. Dves Chhaturvedi he's a secretary ministry of agriculture and farmer welfare. Dr. Chhaturvedi leads our national effort in agriculture and

farmers welfare. Mr. Johanes Jet, he is the regional vice president World Bank. Mr. Jet brings a vital global perspective on development and finance from the World Bank. Miss

Swamia Swaminatan, she is a chairperson of Dr. Ms. Swaminatan Research Foundation. Dr. Dr. Saminatan is a global leader in science, a champion for sustainable research and a strong

advocate for mainstreaming women farmers role in agriculture. Mr. Shankar Maruara is a co-founder and CEO of Xstep Foundation. He's a pioneer in building digital public

infrastructure that empowers people at scale. And I am very proud to say that the government of Maharashtra and extra foundation together have brought out Mahavisttar which more than two and a

half million farmers are using today to get the advisories and information that they need on a daily basis. The objective of this panel discussion is to move from vision to

implementation. Specifically, we will deliberate on how to institutionalize AI within agriculture systems at scale. How to ensure inclusion especially of

women farmers and small holders. How to build interoperable, trustworthy and sustainable AI governance ecosystems and how to strengthen collaboration between the center, states, global institutions,

industry and academia. The session is also an important precursor to AI for agree 2026 global conference. We will where we will continue these deliberations in greater operational

depth with governments, investors, innovators and development partners. AI for agree conference is being held in Mumbai on 22nd and 23rd of February at Geo World Convention Center.

With this context, let's begin our discussion. My first question is to Dr. Dr. Dish Chhatuvidi sir under your leadership the ministry

has taken significant steps in advancing the digital agriculture mission and operationalizing the agree framework. You are laying a strong digital foundation for the sector. As we now

look at integrating AI more systematically into agriculture, how do you envision the central state collaboration framework specifically to ensure that AI

deployments are aligned with national architecture while allowing states the flexibility to innovate based on local agroclimatic and socioeconomic context. And finally, how can we institutize this

collaboration to achieve population scale impact while maintaining interoperability and data trust? Sir, &gt;&gt; thank you. A lot of questions in the same question. So what I'll do is I'll

just uh first uh take you through the initiatives. First of all, we deeply appreciate the uh leadership taken by Maharashtra under obviously the leadership of our

honorable chief minister and with the agriculture department. They have done exceptional work in digital agriculture mission by developing farmer ids and digital crop

survey and also they launched Mahavistar as a precursor of Bharat Vistar and recently on 17th government of India have also launched the one of the first integrated AI based system for the

farmers which is uh Bharat Vistar which presently is uh uh undertaking providing services both through the app, Android based app as well as through uh telephone mobile telephoning on weather

advisories uh ICR based crop advisories, pest advisories uh market information regarding various uh agriculture produced traded in the Mundy's and lastly the government schemes of

government of India. Now why is this important? AI is important in agriculture like we did a lot of we started with digitalization of services different services. We had DBT we had

online systems of uh applying for various common person applying through the common service centers or through the mobile apps. But what was felt was that while we had nit this process to

ensure that there the bureaucratic red tapism is removed. What we were moving towards was a sort of digital red tapism because within our ministry different schemes had different apps and they had

different uh ways of selection and within the state also horiculture had a different database of farmers. Uh agriculture had a different database. Animal health bundy has a different

database. Crop insurance has a different database. So basically a farmer who has to avail so many services was we felt that he was he or she was getting lost in list or it become more difficult to

uh uh to avail the services through online systems or to get advisories than to go to a person and say so the whole idea was that once we have this AI based system we have a same

platform for different uh applications and different advisor at a click of the button or maybe just as a voice. So that is the whole idea of shifting towards AI best solutions. So

now uh what we have initially in the first phase in the artificial intelligence system the bhat vistar or the mahavistar of Maharashtra is that the advisories the crop advisories the

weather advisories schemes uh information know uh information about the how to apply and what is the status of that application and also the Monday rates all these have been put in the one

platform you can just make a presently it is working in English and Hindi but in next 3 to six months we'll be taking it towards uh all the bhashani related languages and the next step is as you

mentioned that the states are working together with us for the digital public infrastructure. So close to 9 crore farmer ids have been developed. So what is a farmer ID and you must have read

the statement of honorable finance minister that uh farmer DPI is the new UPI. So we what is the basic uh uh this agree stack which is the part of DPI is that for agriculture is that we have

each farmer has a unique farmer ID with the back and the back end all the crops uh the person has shown what is the land available to the person all the data with the share of the land and the crop

sewn and the soil health card details if the soil health has been given. So with these basic details available on the on the system it empowers the farmer through that ID to avail services

because it is already approved uh by by the relevant authorities in the government. So the person does does not have to or the authorities who are aail giving the services are not required to

crossverify the uh in the credentials of the farmer based on those those uh uh based on the record of rights or or maybe the gdavry or whatever it was in the different states. So every state and

Maharashtra is one of the leading states here. We are working together to have saturation of farmer ids and crop survey and once this is there then this AI will further transform into a very very

tailored advisory. So a person calls or gives the farmer ID or radar and at the back end we will based on the consent access the details of where the farmer is from what is the crop being grown

what is soil hand conditions and very targeted advisory scheme will be given which will be made operational in next 3 to 6 months. So instead of pushing data which may not be of interest of the

farmers very specific tailored data for that uh farmer will be available based on integration of digital public infrastructure with the Bharat Vistar and the third aspect will come when we

do the predictive models and we tried that and you must have remembered in the inaugural session when Google CEO mentioned about that predictive model which we did about 3.8 100 cr farmers.

We use a 100 years data of IMD and a a model to predict a monsoon for the next one month and for next week. And that prediction was fairly accurate and farmers we got the feedback to farmers

did take that decision to sew and to irrigate based on the predictive model which was sent and now we will expand that predictive models to ensure that we get more uh advisories of the market

situation of the weather situation which will help improving the decision- making of the farmers and so that they can increase their productivity reduce the cost. So that is the whole idea of AI in

agriculture and we hope that more and more farmers will adopt it and it will be a not exactly a replacement but um a sort of additionality to the human u we can say extension services which we find

is not able to reach to the farmers because of the because of resource constraints of each state the extension machinery the KVKS or our state extension machineries it's very

difficult to reach each and every farmer because of the fact that we can't have a person sitting in each village reaching to each farmer but AI along with digital public infrastructure along

with the mobile and internet penetration to the in in in in in in the various rural areas will ensure that that uh gap is removed and we get more and more uh access to the farmers on services and

advisories that is the whole idea of uh having center and state interface interoperability but I I hope I have answered more most of the questions which you had asked for.

&gt;&gt; As you rightly mentioned, uh AI systems are acting like a digital friend of the farmer. So they are available uh at any point of time through multiple channels and in a

language they understand. In fact sir with ministry's um uh assistance we were able to get access to multiple images of pest and disease and with IoT Bombay we have been able to develop models where

farmers can take a picture and they can find out what pest and disease is it and then ultimately what is to be done based on the knowledge created by agriculture universities and ICR institutions. So I

think there's a great uh opportunity for us. The the national government has the scale and uh the states have their own specific uh skill sets and knowledge together if they combine I think we can

reach out to each and everybody uh uh in the farming sector. Thank you sir. Uh I'll move on to uh Mr. Janes Jut now the regional vice president of the word bank. Uh the word bank has been a

long-standing partner to both the government of India and the government of Maharashtra. We have uh multiple projects uh going on concurrently as well as we have had uh in past as well

and these projects have been aimed at strengthening agriculture systems, climate resilience and institutional capacity as we move into the era where AI technologies are evolving at

unprecedented speed. How can development partnership adapt to remain agile and responsive? In particular, how can we structure programs and technical assistance model that provide just in

time support to central and state governments enabling them to experiment, iterate and scale AI solutions responsibly. &gt;&gt; Uh thanks very much for those questions

and thank you also for the invitation to be here today. Um so we're we're on the cusp of a major revolution in how uh support to farmers and agriculture is happening. Um, I I actually grew up on a

farm. I worked on a farm from the ages 10 to 21. I think every hour I wasn't in school. Uh, that I was actually at home, I was working in a farm. In some ways, it feels paleolithic because, you know,

we didn't have computers. We had telephones that were connected to wires. And our ability to get information about what was happening uh around us was was extremely limited. We spent a lot of

time trying to find out the things that today you can find out very very quickly using small AI for agriculture and that's truly revolutionarily empowering for farmers. Um but you know to make

that work for farmers there's a lot of things that need to go right and I think it's worth reflecting a little bit about on the different roles that different actors in the ecosystem have. Um

starting obviously with with government my colleague uh mentioned a number of these things earlier the government's responsibility is principally on foundations

um things like um the governance uh of of uh AI the interoperability obviously um ensuring that um uh educational programs uh include appropriate types of skilling in the use

of dig digital services. This is a big challenge in countries like India where frankly there are still people who don't have sufficient literacy to read what comes over a basic uh smartphone. Um

ensuring that the research and extension that is provided through these small AI platforms um is credible is trustworthy uh is backed by um science. I think that's also extremely important. Of

course, farmers will find out if they aren't, but at high expense, right? So, we want to make sure that um they're not being advised to do things that are negative for them. Uh and then also um

uh looking at um uh the costs of service, uh the the connectivity, the what what does the farmer actually need to be able to link into these different types of platforms

that give information? Because of course we're often also talking about uh farmers who have very very few assets and who may be essentially uh unable to stay permanently connected or even

easily connected to the internet. Uh they're going to have very basic u smartphones etc. So the government has a lot of work to do in all of those areas. Then you can look at uh what can the

private sector do. Now one thing that the government needs to do is encourage crowd in private sector capacity and capital but once we turn to the private sector what is the private sector's

principal advantage I think that there's a lot of creativity in the private sector so the actual applications that are being developed are being developed by individuals in the private sector

with a passion for specific sorts of issues that are constraining farmer uh success And you know that create creativity will result in a number of different um applications that will be

aimed in most cases to help farmers overcome certain hurdles that they face. And um you know we can kind of let a thousand flowers bloom there um and see what actually takes root and it's

amazing what you start to see. Um just yesterday I was learning about an application in Morocco developed by a tomato farmer who was able to give advice about how much water tomato

plants need simply by taking a picture of the current tomato plant. Take a picture and it tells you how much water you actually need to give this uh plant which obviously in a water stressed

environment is vital vital information. And then you know there are uh roles for um uh institutions like my own the World Bank Group uh which can help to um uh provide some of the financing that helps

develop these applications and also the foundational backbone for artificial intelligence and we can also play a role in at the advisory end where we are helping to um truth test if you like the

information that's coming through uh different applications that are coming out of the AI sandbox in different contexts to make sure that it's actually providing information that's uh useful

to the end beneficiary and enhancing from a a productivity perspective at the farm level. Thanks. &gt;&gt; I think you have rightly pointed out the role of innovation and research. Um and

what we see is uh we require uh highquality robust data to actually build upon that and as honorable chief minister mentioned Mahaex is one step in that direction wherein we bring diverse

data sets and made them accessible to researchers, academic institutions, departments and also startups and in fact many of these startups we will uh see they are showcasing their uh

innovations in uh AI for agree conference in Mumbai. So we'll request all of you to uh please come there and uh see for the themselves what kind of excitement uh they have and what kind of

solutions are embraced. Uh I have one uh supplementary question to you. Uh how do you see a platform such as uh um AI impact summit as well as AI for agree global conference contributing to deeper

global collaboration and south of knowledge exchange in this domain. &gt;&gt; Thank you for that additional question. I mean obviously India is in a great position to lead uh the development of

AI particularly among uh for for developing countries uh where there are still significant challenges helping uh poor people to escape poverty permanently. Uh India has demonstrated

digital innovation for a long period of time already. It's got an enormous population with a huge variety. The challenges of bringing um farmer appropriate data to the farmer's

fingertips in India are uh I was going to say India is a microcosm of the rest of the world. It's hardly a microcosm. It's so huge. But because you have so many languages, so many different uh

regions, so many different types of crops uh and and the starting conditions at the farm level are so incredibly varied. figuring out how to make AI uh at the farm level work in India will

automatically have a large number of spillover uh learnings for other countries around the world and um because India after China and the United States is the country in the world that

that is best positioned actually to push all of this uh work forward and because it is itself a developing country it's very very clear that it will have a central role to play in south south

learning for those reasons. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Thank you so much. Uh I move on to Dr. Swamia Swaminatan. Uh Dr. Swaminatan, your father, Professor M Swaminatan played a historic role in

shaping India's agriculture transformation during the green revolution, ensuring food security at a critical juncture in our history. Today, as we speak of a new phase of

transformation driven by AI, we are again at an inflection point. You have consistently championed science-based policy, sustainability, and the empowerment of women farmers. With 2026

being recognized internationally as the year of women farmers, how can we ensure that AIEL agriculture transformation strengthens women's agency, knowledge access and climate resilience? And what

institution safeguards and designs principles must we embed today so that this new technological revolution becomes equitable, farmer centric and grounded in scientific integrity.

&gt;&gt; Thank you very much uh for that uh question Vikas G. Um not only is uh this year the international year of the woman farmer but we know that agriculture itself is increasingly being feminized

with uh many men actually uh leaving farming to the women and migrating out to the cities for other opportunities. So it is really essential to put women at the center of all that we are

discussing. And I think the chief minister today gave us a wonderful vision of what can be the future. Uh provided of course like you said that there are the guard rails, there are the

institutions, there are the safeguards and the design principles that we think about from the very beginning. So my father professor Ms. Swaminadan used to say that the green revolution was not

only about the seeds. Of course the seeds played a very big role you know the high yielding varieties but it was about the entire ecosystem and the institutions that were developed at that

time which included the uh outreach the uh you know later on the krishi vigan kendraas of course were developed but also the access to credit the water the fertilizers the education and the

empowerment and ultimately became a success because farmers realize the potential of it and took it on. So what he used to say is that you know every technology uh no technology

is pro poor or pro- rich or pro-women or against women. It's how we use that technology. So it's really like you said the inflection point today is how do we use this very powerful technology that's

um that's come to us. So I think there are a few points here you know to make sure particularly that women farmers are not left behind. Uh the first important fact is that women um in India the

minority of them who have their name on the on the land document. So mostly it is in the man's name and DHG was telling me today that this is improving and that the latest census shows that perhaps at

least a quarter of uh the properties are also in the name of women either jointly or but that still means that you know 3/4s of them don't have and uh a system that operates uh basically on publicly

available data will then leave out those whose data sets are not available. So I think it would be really important at the early stages itself to think about how women's data can be incorporated

because the algorithms are fed by the data we have. And so all of these advisories may be very suitable for a man who's operating a tractor on a on a farm but not at all relevant for a woman

who's still working with outdated instruments and trying to you know till her land. Particularly when we look at more remote areas, tribal areas where women do a lot of the agriculture like

millets for example, mostly it is women who grow millets and there's still a lot of mechanization which is absent completely. It is all still very much done using traditional methods and tools

and it involves a lot of drudgery. So I would say that you know one of the benchmarks that I would look at is is it reducing the drudgery and the workload on women farmers? Is AI helping to do

that? So I think we also need to look at certain indicators for success and you mentioned science. I mean I am a a medical researcher and the way that we evaluate products is by doing clinical

trials by examining the data and the evidence and then recommending it for wider use. So again a note of caution would be to as we roll it out we need innovation certainly we also need to do

the evaluation looking at inherent biases looking at who's being excluded looking at are there unanticipated risks or uh side effects that we didn't know about but

most of all it's this inclusion uh I think we don't want those who are already left behind to be further left out so I think the ongoing research and data collection and feedback loops and

most importantly having the voices of those for whom we are developing all these I think in the room I don't think we have any farmers or woman farmers you see so we are all discussing from what

we know but if you're the farmer like u you were saying u working there and you know the constraints under which you are working so I think the women farmers and farmers in general must have a role they

must be part of uh these committees that evaluate or make recommendations or make suggestions on improvement It has to be an iterative process. I think any technology is as good as the

application for which it's developed. I'll give you one example of an app that the MS Pominatan research foundation developed for fisher women. We had very successful app for fisher men called the

fisher friendly mobile app that won the UN tech for nature award uh last year. But fisher women were as usual left out. And so the women connect app actually gives gives them on a tablet information

that they need to sell because once the fishermen have come back from seeds it's the women who have to do all of the posth harvest and the same is true for crops or fruits or vegetables as well.

So that connection to the market, the of course the information about pests and pathogens and when to buy what and what inputs to use, but also being able to organize themselves and I think women

there are many FPOS's now and FPC's and SGS made of women farmers empowering them and giving them the knowledge and tools and the last thing I would say is we still need humans in the loop. I

don't think we should think that completely uh making everything [clears throat] run by machines is going to solve our problems. I think it's it's risky there

and in a country like India we also need employment and so we should think of and this I don't know how many of you have seen this film called uh humans in the loop but it's a tribal woman from Jarant

who actually raises questions about the algorithm that is it's a very thoughtprovoking film so I think humans in the loop is going to be important we have our sakis and so on. We need to

empower them with these. So I think AI and all these digital tools if they used in addition to the traditional knowledge and wisdom that people have and augment it and give them at the right time at

the right place the knowledge they need I think we can go a very long way. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you madam. You have rightly rightly pointed out the need to be uh

more sensitive and uh while developing systems for inclusivity and to ensure that for whom they are being developed and uh they are in the loop and they are being consulted. Uh in fact uh the

feedback mechanism that we have developed in Mahavisttar takes care of those requirement. I'm also very happy to share that government of Maharashtra and uh Dr. MS Swami Nathanas Foundation

are working together on some of these issues in terms of how to bring uh women's uh right in farming uh at the at the center stage. Uh how do we create biohappiness using our universities and

educational systems and uh what kind of uh nutritional security we must look for because we have food security but it's the nutrition security that we must aspire for. So we are happy to have

support and assistance from uh uh MSSRF uh in that direction. Uh my final question is to uh Mr. Shankar Maruara. He Mr. Shankrstap has played a foundational role in shaping India's DPI

and land DPI landscape through open-source platforms such as Sunbird which has powered large scale systems like Diksha Mahavistar and open network initiative built on Becken protocol.

These efforts have demonstrated how open standards and interoperable architecture can enable population scale transformation that we are already seeing today. As we now enter the era of

AIdriven public systems, how should we think about standardizing AI based ecosystem in a similar spirit? How can we bring DPI into AI? And what architectural and governance principles

are required to ensure interoperability, trust and sustainability in AI deployments across sectors such as Again, a whole lot of questions, but let me make my best attempt to answer those.

More than 100 years ago, the world faced what was known as a Malt Malthusian crisis where Maltus the economist predicted that if we continue to grow in the same way, we'll run out of land,

we'll run out of soil. We were a billion and a half then. We are 8 billion. Most of us may not even have heard of the Malthusian crisis. What happened? Someone called Habber and someone called

Bosch created a miracle. Haber synthesized ammonia using high pressure and temperature and Bosch put it into an industrial process. That phenomena is now historically known

as pulling bread out of air. It took a lot of effort and as Somia said creation of a massive ecosystem. Germany which pioneered this lost that race to us because US did a better job

of diffusing the technology safely to the farmers. They created the discipline of agriculture engineering. They created institutions like the

fertilizer development center. They held technology demonstrations to farmers to show them how synthetic ammonia could be used. By the way, 50% of the nitrogen in our body comes from synthetic nitro

ammonia. That's a fact. So we have a lot we owe a lot to Fitz Herber and and Bosch. China then took it on in 80s by buying 10 big plants from Kellogg, training 300

million farmers, showing them how to use synthetic fertilizers and they went on to be the global leaders in agriculture. India is at a point where if we learn the lessons from such past things, our

green revolution, our DPI experience, we are at a pivotal point where the equivalent of pulling bread out of thin air is pulling intelligence from the earth and providing it to the

farmer. This is again not science fiction. Mahavistar the pioneer along with Bharat Vistar have taken the first steps to this.

So when a mahavisttar was designed to build off what Swam said it was designed using inclusion in mind inclusion diversity was not an

afterthought because to solve for not just Maharashtra's problems for India scale and diversity we need to think of the last person the most discriminated in the remotest part of India and design

systems that work for We call that DPI. Now let me give you a specific example of this in Bharat Vistar. Right from the beginning the design

specs was we need an illiterate farmer to build off John's point about digital literacy with a feature phone not [clears throat] a smartphone to be able to talk in his or her native language

and native dialect. Marati itself has many dialects right talk on the phone like the way she is comfortable talking to another person ask the question have a conversation get a bunch of answers

that process took us the better part of 9 months why because it's not just AI it's data it's processes it's training the farm extension workers it is having trust on will this work what about the

costing will I blow up my entire state's budget on a model right? Do I have autonomy? Can I switch models out in and out? These are very very difficult questions. It took us in partnership

with uh a whole lot of people. I mean government of Maharashtra led the effort but India mission, Bhashini, IIT Madras, Triple IT, Hyderabad,

World Bank, Google, many other providers, everybody chipped in with little part of the uh solution. Now, here's the best part. Because we all collaboratively invested

in figuring out a solution there. That solution could be deployed in Bharat Vistar with more confidence easily. Again the same challenges that Secretary Chhaturve talked about. Do we

have the data? He used a very nice phrase digital red tapism. Right? Our data is in different formats. What matters is the intent of the government of India which triggered the

process which allowed Bhatisttar to be launched day before. It's a start. Data will get better. The systems will get better. Usage will improve that will generate more data and then over time

years the ecosystem will be built. This we know from our experience. What makes this happen? What is that secret source? The design principles it is the same as DPI. What worked for

DPI? We are taking those same principles. One open interoperable systems. Think networks and not just portals and platforms and siloed and fragmented

systems. What's the best example of this? The railways in India. We have such a vast landscape but the rails are common. Every state can decide what it wants to

move private, public, defense, farming. The Indian railways is just providing a backbone that allows everyone to do this. There was a time when we had different rail gauges.

Right now that sounds so silly but there was a time like that. India is showing that we don't have to repeat those early mistakes in digital also by creating interoperable

networks based on open protocols like beckon by collaborating with each other one of us is bringing in data somebody's bringing technology somebody's bringing

in policy somebody's bringing in research these collaborative open networks and the with the launch of Bharat Vistar puts India in a very unique and respons

responsible position. Unique because we have these open rails. We have the experience of DPI responsible because it is a start. Unlike the technologies of the past

where you perfect a technology and then deploy AI you deploy something minimum to start and then evolution models get better, data gets better, usage gets better and

then it gets better and better over time. That is the unique junction we are in in India. What will that mean? When IICAR plugs into this network with its weather

and pricing data, that network makes it available to any state that wishes to turn on the supply from IICAR. when a private sector comes out with a very innovative app like say the tomato

example that John talked about any state can say I like that I think I will have that made available to my farmers for the farmers they are they anyway trust the state

they can go to the same app and now see this also there if the tomato app person wants they can go directly to each farmer very very expensive so shade rails allows us to spread innovation,

diffuse it very quickly through society, keeping in mind both inclusion and rewarding innovation because innovation has to be rewarded. And I want to end with a very simple

analogy. When Edmund Hillary climbed Mount Everest, he might have he made a lot of people believe it is possible. When Mahavisttar was launched, it made

the country believe that it is possible to make a AI serve the farmer and to that extent the responsibility that Mahavista Maharashtra government and government of India has is to create

these pathways for the rest of the country for the other states. At XEP Foundation, Nanda, we made a declaration two days ago. We would like to see a world by 2030 where there are hundred

such diffusion pathways each created by different set of people in different sectors in different countries and continents but each inspiring different AI pathways to safe impact at scale and

it's a very exciting vision. It's a very collaborative vision. If you all get together we can also create miracles in our own lifetime. Thank you. With that profound thought, we'll conclude today's

uh panel discussion. I thank all the panelists. Uh they have really opened uh a new vision in front of all of us and we'll invite all of you to AI for agree conference in Mumbai on 22nd. Thank you

so much. &gt;&gt; We don't have question actually time question. The next session is about to start. You can still get some
