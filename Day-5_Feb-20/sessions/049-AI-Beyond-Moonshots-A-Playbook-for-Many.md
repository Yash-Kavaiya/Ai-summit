## 📝 Transcript

uh from the abstract ideas to how AI can actually benefit people in their lives, their homes, their communities, and their businesses. The second point that keeps coming up is that it's not a

one-sizefits-all model. Uh I think we do need to be flexible. We need to be inclusive when we look at different AI approaches. uh I would say for all parts of the world uh

no matter where countries are in terms of their development journeys, India as we see is a leader really showing how to get from AI ambitions to real results. uh and of course in doing

so keeping people keeping that human centered approach f in in focus as we heard from the prime minister yesterday uh the bashini platform uh that we've also heard about delivers government

services in 22 languages I would say as well similar AI powered digital public infrastructure solutions in areas from health care to financial inclusion are really working to better serve all

Indians regardless of their economic status, their skill level, especially in rural communities. I would say inspired by um these efforts, I wanted to quickly offer three observations and you've

actually already referred to them. three observations about how we can move beyond um moonshots uh from policy to actual practice here in the Asia-Pacific region and beyond. Uh and they all begin

with S and you said them already solutions, skills and of course standards. So solutions is about building the infrastructure and the platforms that make artificial

intelligence accessible because we cannot achieve AI for many. We can't achieve AI for all if we still have a third of humanity that is offline. Without connectivity, there is no AI.

And that's why efforts like our school connectivity work with UNICEF called the giga initiative to connect every school is so important. Our work in terms of our partner to connect digital coalition

which is about connecting the hardest to connect. Uh we have a target of achieving a hundred billion this year. So far we're at 80 billion in commitments and pledges to connect the

hardest to connect. So we need to tackle that basic infrastructure component. The second element that we need to make sure that we diffuse AI globally in practice is skills. The fundamental importance of

skills. Yesterday I was speaking to a young leader uh who actually likened connectivity to people feeling that they have digital agency. Skills are that engine of agency.

Countries can learn directly from India's experience of investing in people namely through its future skills program that's providing upskilling to support thousands of students at all

levels. ITU is also taking a similar approach and my colleague Fred will be staying on for the panel today. uh we have a skilling coalition that's very exciting with some I think 70 partners

uh so far uh bringing more than 180 different learning resources in 13 languages and coming to my last S is that standards piece ensuring that AI systems work effectively together

standards complement solutions and skills not only for interoperability but also Alo for embedding trust. As Prime Minister Modi mentioned yesterday, deep fakes and misinformation can destabilize

entire societies and people must be able to distinguish between real and AI generated material. And that's why the ITU together with our partners from ISO and IEC, we created the AI standards

exchange database that has over 850 standards and technical publications including multimedia authenticity standards that prioritize traceability to combat deep fakes. ITU standards are

voluntary. They are developed through an inclusive multistakeholder process. So ladies and gentlemen, AI diffusion isn't about everyone using the same technology. It's about giving everyone

the same bridge to opportunity and refusing to let the digital divide become an AI divide. So today's playbook is going to help us really build that bridge as will our continued cooperation

and collaboration on AI solutions, skilling and standards. In all of these areas, you can count on ITU as your trusted partner. Thank you. [applause]

&gt;&gt; Thanks, Doren. As you can see, Dorin has spent her career in ensuring every country, every community has access to or is part of digital economy. Could I just invite Dorene, Fred, Rachel,

Brando, Dr. Bunny, Selvin on the stage as we launched the global south AI diffusion playbook. It's a framework built around uh five interacting dimensions infrastructure, data and

trust, institutions for procurement um and market skills and market shaping. It's not designed as a strategy document but more as an implementation guide because the next phase of AI is not

about moonshots. It's about how do we ensure AI works reliably, inclusively and productively for many. This is I think the photo op you guys were waiting for. So all yours

there &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Dorian, I know you have to leave. Thank you very much. Thanks for Thanks for the a great keynote as well. Thanks, Dorian.

Thank you. just uh if diffusion is about move from capability moving from capability to

real economic impact then startups are obviously the transmission mechanism uh and a few people understand India startup ecosystem as deeply as Dr. Pane Silva Madan Gopal CEO of Miti Startup

Hub. Under his leadership, Miti startup hub has become a key platform connecting government policy with entrepreneurial energy enabling innovations to move from lab to market and from pilot to scale

over 6,000 plus startups. Right. Uh so he brings over two decades of experience and at a moment when India is positioning itself not just as an AI adopter but as an AI innovation

diffusion hub his perspective on enabling startup to scale responsibly and globally is particularly valuable. Dr. could I just have a few minutes for you?

Thank you uh access partnership for having me this afternoon for this conversation. And I think uh it's an important element of how do you you know there's uh there's so much happening in

the last four to five days uh in in in Delhi in in Barat Mandapom. It's it's it's important to get a grasp of what's going on right and uh and and what are each of us have to kind of take take

away from this and how each stakeholders in this ecosystem can help us and and and startups become a very very important uh player in this game and uh essentially for two or three key reasons

and you know um one they they have the they come in as AI natives they come in with a significant understanding of the technology and the talent Talent is kind of kind of already there is there and

then second they un they are here to the agility that they bring in the capability they bring to kind of transform businesses is becoming a very very important need for small and medium

enterprises and even to large enterprises. Just prior to this, I was having a conversation with a large corporate and and how how they can actually use uh startups as a as a

catalyst of change and transformation in in in their eco in their large corporate because the corporates are designed for for systems and processes on scale and and what need of the hour is actually

agility, adop, adaptability and more importantly uh you know ability to change and and bring ch uh innovation into uh into a mainstream of any any enterprise. So startups play a very very

critical role. So we we at Matey startup hub are primarily driving the you know the the push to kind of ensure that startups have the wherewithal and the capability to drive and and back this

change that is required by the corporate uh you know ecosystem or the large enterprise ecosystem. Uh briefly what do we do at MI startup hub? We are the custodians of the deep tech startups in

the country. Uh this this whole uh uh event has been put together by matey matey and of course ministry of external affairs being phenomenal partners in this. So our role in matey startup is

essentially three M uh mentorship market access and money right this is essentially what we provide for startups. We provide uh mentorship support to the entire uh journey from uh

from almost at an ideation stage to to series A up to series A level and we we have them uh we provide them with market access. uh I'm a firm believer that uh your customer is your best investor if

you're a startup and and finding customers for for startups is more important than finding investors right so it's important for me to find give them the right market access support so

we work with large corporates across the board across the country and internationally we kind of drive uh market access support and last but not the least money we we provide

significant amount of so there is absolutely no dirt of capital in the Indian market. Uh you know I through my agent through my organization I'm MIT startup we we fund almost up to a,000

crores for startups and and the India AI mission has another almost about 8,000 crores to be funded for funding for startups. So there's absolutely no dirt of money in the market. Government fund

is available you know private capital is available. So that's what we support and and we our endeavor is to ensure that startups are at the heart of this renaissance of this change that is kind

of happening in the the ecosystem and how how startups technology can can power uh help this small and medium enterprises and large enterprises transform in their in their technology

journey. So that's what we have been driving at and conversations like this help a lot. Uh and and enabling them uh to drive this change. Uh we have three things. I mean there is obviously a lot

of challenges. It's not easier said than done in in some cases you know I was reading up in a way with medium enterprises we call a technology overshoot. the technology has actually

overshot the need and now the the ability of the intermedium enterprises to cope with this technology and say how do I understand what is my need? How what is how do I integrate this into my

uh uh business need and how do I ensure that this business uh my business kind of uh is realigned with with uh a new workflow a new uh way of you know doing business with with this current techn

with AI or AI based you know supported technology to kind of drive. So there is there is while there are huge uh uh challenges but there is al any every challenge is an opportunity. So I I you

know and we we and startups are very well placed to kind of bridge that opportunity because they understand technology and and they understand business. So we are hoping to create

this what I call the AI bridge now which is uh you know you know kind of bridge the technology and the business need uh and it's going to be a huge opportunity by itself to kind of drive and startups

are is what we are hoping will build that bridge and drive the change. So at matey startup hub we uh our endeavor is to nurture build and enable tech and deep tech startups in the

country and uh we partner with all uh we collaborate with all stakeholders uh domestic and international to ensure our startups get the right uh uh opportunities and we solve problems uh

and we enable capability uh through through building capacity. So that's essentially in a nutshell what we do and uh you know again once again I thank the access partners for providing me this

opportunity to briefly share my thoughts with you and uh we are in a cusp of you know the somebody called this an AI earthquake happening in Barat Mandapam. This is a tectonic shift and and and

this is some lay is laying foundation for something big and better coming our way. of course with a lot of responsibility also because everything has uh two sides of its own. So we need

to be extremely responsible in what we are doing with the technology. Thank you once again. Thank you for the opportunity. As doctor said, this is really the

earthquake of AI and we are at the epicenter. And as you can see, I'm after 5 days, we are all very very tired. We started late, we'll end on time. That's my

promise to you guys. Uh where is the next chair? U so let me let me introduce our panelists very quickly. Rachel uh Dr. Rachel Adam. She's the founder and CEO of the global center on AI

governance, a leading research and policy institution focused on ensuring that AI development and deployment advance equity and human rights globally. She also advised these

governments and she was a key contributor to the African Union Commission's continental AI strategy. I have Fred Fred Werner. He is the chief of strategy and operations for AI for

good and chief of strategic engagement at ITU. He's based in Geneva but through as a co-creator of the AI for good global summit which is happening from 7 to 10 July. That's correct.

&gt;&gt; In Geneva. Yes. Uh he brings together a global hub for collaboration standards and actionable AIdriven impact. And I also pleased to welcome uh Brando Benfi who is a member of European Parliament

and he was a co-repit of the EU AI act which we all love so much. Uh the world's first comprehensive AI regulation. He is an Italian MEP since 2014 and he has played a key role in

shaping European digital and AI policy. Welcome all of you. &gt;&gt; Sorry this [clears throat] quick one. Yeah. Uh I start with you Brando. Uh in this case u we talked

about concrete gains can that AI diffusion can unlock in global south over the next 3 to 5 years. How do we move from pilots to scale deployment? I want to understand a bit more from you.

It's been a while since we have had the EU AI act. There have been some implementation obviously, right? So, how do you see the AI diffusion being unlocked and how do you see European

partnerships with with the global south uh there? Well, first of all, I apologize for my voice, but it's the um I don't know work of these days. Maybe we are producing a

lot but this is the also the impact. So I apologize for that. But uh to answer your question, um I um I think that the EUI Act can be an interesting um reference point to reflect on what um

we can uh um um do to uh um implement the idea of a global diffusion, especially looking at the global south because in fact even the so-called global north or global minority we can

use different terms is still struggling with the diffusion of AI among different actors if you look at the data for example on the diffusion among small and medium-sized enterprises most north of

the world um countries they still have very low um numbers because of lack of trust because of lack of AI I literacy because of lack of systems that um facilitate understanding on how uh the

usage of AI can ailate the activity of a business, a public organization, a civil society, reality etc. So the AI act is uh a legislation that doesn't create a comprehensive framework

that is vague comprehensive but confusing maybe instead it chooses to identify a series of um high-risk areas of usage of AI and lets instead all the non included

uh use cases to not be regulated further than the u existing legislation. Why I'm saying this? because I think that to um overcome one of the issues obviously when we look at the issue of diffusion

there are many uh [clears throat] elements infrastructure as I said literacy but on the issue of trust and of risk management I think uh the EUI act is an interesting uh reference point

on having clear boundaries where we do not Think we need more regulation where we let the systems be used freely where we want um checks and balances to be in place where we even

choose to prohibit certain use cases and where we need transparency which is still a lacking element in many of our experiences with AI. So I think that in the difference of the contexts these

elements are quite relevant for uh even a a context that is clearly different from uh the uh average um uh European uh country. uh but I think that uh to build uh trust we need to clarify where we

want uh governance and uh limits to be in place and send a clear message to the population that even when we concentrate on uh use cases on action. This is the topic of the summit. We can also build

in a smart way, in a clear way, not light but clear clarity uh um elements of protection of guarantee that can create more trust in the adoption.

&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know I know why your voice is like that because people want to hear more from you. So that's why you know you you will have to you'll have a busy day today as well. I'm sure people want

to talk a lot to you. Rachel coming to you I I think Brando talked about an important point about the trust and clarity and you have worked a extensively with global south countries

right so how do you see how crucial do you think a trust and ethics for diffusion how do you see that actually getting implemented in practice &gt;&gt; yeah I think it is going to take far

more work than perhaps we we feel it might so you know Brando I think you mentioned some very important points around public awareness and understanding in South Africa The center

I I lead, the global center on AI governance, conducted a very comprehensive public perception survey in the country. We interviewed over 3,000 South Africans from all walks of

life, all demographic groups. We interviewed them in their own language. We have over 11 official languages in South Africa. And twothirds of South Africans do not have a meaningful grasp

of AI. So onethird of South Africans have never heard of AI and another third of South Africans have heard of it but could not begin to tell you what it meant at all. So I think if we're

thinking about the relationship between the largecale private investments we're seeing in AI diffusion, the large scale public plans we have around AI adoption in relation

to where the public sits, what their kind of levels of understanding, awareness and literacy is. This is going to create this is creating a very significant democratic gap particularly

where a lot of these um adoption pathways are around the use of AI in the public service. People don't know about these technologies. They don't know about the risks. They don't know about

the opportunities. They're not able to contest it. They're not able to participate in decision making. We have a real problem. So diffusion cannot be something that is only about putting in

place the infrastructure that sees forward technical delivery and access. It must be scaled with governance efforts. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Now I think Brando we had that

whole discussion separately where you talked about that getting technology in the hand of people doesn't matter if you're using it for a lot of autocratic tools like for inance know social

scoring right so I think maybe going to you Fred on this point um looking at the positive side of the story you talked about that day AI for good or AI for good so how do you some of the use cases

and standards that you think are are really setting the stage for helping drive the diffusion &gt;&gt; yeah so I think there's no shortage of high potential AI for good use cases,

especially now in 2026. That maybe wasn't the case in 2017 when we created AI for good. But we've really seen things go from the hype, the fear, the promise, mainly existing in fancy

marketing slides to the advent of Gen AI, the rise of AI agents, and now the physical manifestation of AI in the form of robotics, embodied AI, brain computer interface technologies, and even space

AI computing. Right? And just to give you an example, we have an AI uh startup, Innovation Factory, that runs all year. And there was an Estonian startup that had a very interesting

application that can basically tell how much sugar is in your blood based on the sound of your voice using a mobile phone and detecting voice patterns. Right now, this could be a gamecher for diabetes. I

mean, it's a it's a nasty, you know, global disease. uh taking your blood sugar is expensive, inconvenient, sometimes painful. It it's a real pain. Uh right now it's still a pilot, but you

see the potential for scale. But on the other hand, if it can tell how much sugar is in your blood, what else can it tell about you? Uh how late did you stay up last night? What did you have for

dinner? Are you on medication? Did you have too much wine? Are you paying attention? Actually, are you paying attention? Um so you can see where it goes, right? Um so you can't take it for

granted that these applications will develop in the right way and we'll be mindful of a lot of things we were talking about here all week. Are these solutions are they safe? Are they

secure? Uh do they have ethics baked in? Do they respect human rights? Uh are they designed with uh participation from the global south of the table? Um are they sustainable when it comes to energy

and all types of things? And one way to I guess bake that in could be with standards. It's not the only solution. But when you look at these fast emerging governance frameworks uh popping up all

around the world of course you have the AI the EU AI act uh you have different frameworks from around the world I think one of the tricks is you don't have a one-sizefitit all and AI is moving very

very fast but there are many practical things that that can start to be implemented. So how how do you take these ambitious words and text and turn them from principles to implementation?

Because the devil is in the details and standards have details. So I think we're we're at the point where these products, services, companies, applications, you know, even hardware, all these things

need to start to interface and interact interoperably. Sorry, they need to interact internationally and sometimes internationally as well. you're going to need standards uh to to basically make

these things work. Um and that could be one of the way of baking in all of the common sense things into standards. Um now I know the words lightning speed and standards development are not often used

in the same sentence and and uh that that's probably a fair fair statement. Uh but I think in the case of AI uh for example when the global digital compact uh launched its call I believe two years

ago in the fall it took ITU and its partners less than 3 weeks to respond to that call for international AI standards coordination by launching the international AI standards summit series

and actually the very first one was held in this venue in 2024 as part of WTSA our treaty setting conference on standards and we also launched the international AI standards exchange

database which Darin mentioned mentioned a few minutes ago, but more importantly, when you're looking at the standards gaps and what people should be working on, we're working with our partners ISO

and IC on a multimedia content authenticity standards development. That's a fancy way of saying deep fake detection standards. Um, I'm not saying we've solved the puzzle, but there's a

lot of uh energy and work uh working with industry C2PA, different bodies there. I think another major gap which is not only standards related is of course the skills gap. So uh when we had

our governance day in Geneva last year with uh ministers from over 100 countries uh there's a lot of things they they couldn't agree on but one thing they all agreed on is how to

address the AI skills gap and democratize access to skills globally and that didn't matter if you were a developing or developed country and then of course the other was how do you

handle the epidemic of of deep fakes. So I I think I I'll pause there. Thank you. But hopefully that gives a kind of picture of how you can go from AI use cases to high potential looking at the

dual nature of AI and how standards can be one of the tools to help address those issues. Thanks. &gt;&gt; Thanks Fred. I mean if if that app looks at me right now I think it's going to

tell me that I'm very caffeinated and sleepd deprived. But on on that point I think standards are obviously the physical manifestation of governance. I think we did talk about that. That's

very important. Uh and Rachel maybe I'll come back to you. I think uh we do talk about policy tools are important, financing mechanisms are important, governance approaches because there are

many different approaches to AI governance throughout the world. How do you see that the the participatory whether the governance is actually participatory today?

Some of the frameworks from global north do you think that's that's getting imposed on south or south is coming up global south is coming up with their own frameworks. How do you see the situation

on the ground? &gt;&gt; Well, I think we're at an interesting time globally. We obviously see the EU having this kind of rights focus, regulatory focus. We see the US moving

very far away from regulation and wanting to really focus on innovation and markets. And we see China having a more kind of state coordinated approach to AI governance. I think what we're

seeing across the global south and countries like India are a very good example of this is starting from a a different place which is not around how do we build the biggest most powerful

technologies but how do we build AI that is safe and fair and useful for our particular context. How do we use it to help advance developmental outcomes or or public value? So I think we can see

from those kind of three regulatory or governance approaches from EU, China and the US there's this very kind of pragmatic adoption of different elements of that within different global south

regimes. I know with the African Union's continental charter on AI, they're very very deliberate to include the word regulation and there was a huge emphasis on on human rights and on gender issues

and on children's rights. So I think that what we want is to have maybe less of a focus on global consensus than than than I think we're often talking about. Partly because interoperability can

often mean the dominance of one particular region or world views regulatory regime everywhere else. And we've seen with the GDPR for example that that has had a limiting effect um

on the African continent. So I think we rather want to be seeing kind of a global consensus around a set of principles, accountability, transparency, safety, and human

oversight. And of course, a set of standards, but noting that different regions are going to need to adapt those standards in different ways. Sometimes those standards might be a kind of gold

standard, and sometimes they might need to be a minimum standard. and we want to be thinking more about the capacity building approaches to try and meet that standard. One of the things we are

worried about from a global south and and an African perspective is that standard setting processes in the past have always been dominated by those with the time and the resources to really

participate in them. as you said, they're they're slow and they're deliberately slow because there's a lot of expertise we need to bring to the table and once they're concretized and

and finalized, they become binding in their own way, particularly on particularly on the technical side. So we really want to ensure that as we're building out these standards

particularly for generative AI and agentic AI which is still information and that is a sociote techchnical technology and it devolves and and and uh it evolves at is as it is used in

context but we have representation from Africa from Latin America from Asia that is meaningfully included in these stanzas processes. is through deliberate funding through leadership on committees

through through co-authorship of these standards. So, so I think that's very important to stress. &gt;&gt; Y I think that's that's a interesting point of view because I I'm based in

Singapore. So, we have 11 countries in the Southeast Asia region and everybody runs at their own pace and everything we talk about is how do we go from starting point a lot of it is about where do you

start and then talk about where do you end and what's the process along the way. I think that's what you are effectively talking about but Brando I'll maybe let you respond to some of

the points she raised about uh the regulatory experience that you have had you have talked to people here obviously you you would have talked to other people there is there's always tension

between local adaptation versus harmonization should we have a single set of rules throughout the world what are some of the what what are some of the aspects or highlights that you want

to maybe highlight in that sense &gt;&gt; yeah well um first of all on the standards I I think it's uh its effect that we need to accelerate on on that and um that we have seen some um

voluntary delaying. I have to be very frank because I look at the implementation of the AI act where we didn't need standards. So when we decided that some use cases you

mentioned social scoring but I can tell you um predictive policing um emotion recognition in workplaces and study places these are use cases including if I may also mention

manipulative subliminal techniques that are prohibited and they didn't need standards guidelines on application of these prohibitions were sufficient and we are already implementing that. Why

other parts of the of the law for example adequacy of data for training or levels of cyber security that are deemed sufficient. These are elements

parameters for the high-risk use case applications where you need standards otherwise you can't apply these rules and the standards are being in my view based on the elements I I got from those

in the standardization process sometimes deliberately delayed because there are some private sector actors that don't want these standards to be there and and so We need to build mechanisms. I will

not delve into that for time reasons, but mechanisms that we are building also in the European context to make it sure that there is a a a time limit for the standards to be to be in place because

otherwise um certain aspects of the governance will not be possible to be to be implemented. I want to pick up briefly on also what you said on the risk of

AI being used for um in fact non-democratic uh developments in fact to restrict uh participation spaces freedoms I think this is especially important when we

look at um fragile institutionally fragile contexts which are often countries of the global majority, global south, how you want to call it. Um, we need to be um aware that AI can be used

for mass surveillance easily for repression of uh freedoms and to put people under uh a pervasive control even without them fully understanding it. I think that we we should uh know that and

at the same time and I I fully share the spirit of this summit concentrate on what we can do for for good as to mention the the summit uh because a lot of things the example that was just made

but yesterday I was meeting with a company from my own country from Italy that is here that deals with systems to um anticipate um uh physical status of drivers uh to

prevent uh accidents due to physical fatigue to make it easier to identify earlier this kind of of situations that would lead to to actually an car accident. So uh even in very specific

areas we can we can find uh uh in a [laughter] myriad ways how we can use AI for good. But my point is that um enthusiasm for u diffusion should not be uh in uh a

substitution for u uh building frameworks that I insist on my previous point are precise and not generical ethical appeals which to be frank are not very useful if they are not pointing

to clear uh deliverables. I want to conclude on this point to be clear that I I think an ethical approach is needed. Without ethical approaches, any uh rule will not be able to

function. But if you substitute um regulation, governance um of all kinds, it can be more binding or more uh I would say uh co-leisation co-deision processes. But if you

substitute this completely with mere uh voluntary ethical frameworks, I'm not sure we are getting anywhere. Especially I insist in contexts that might be more institutionally

so socially fragile. &gt;&gt; I think AI for good always starts with AI not for bad. That's always the the starting point and that's as important consideration. I did promise you guys

I'll leave you on time. So I'll just do very quick two questions. I just need 30 seconds to 60 seconds responses. Fred I'll start with you. If you had a billion dollars to accelerate AI

diffusion across developing economies, where will you start? I think education skills I think that's really the the starting point. Um actually I was in uh Johannesburg South

Africa for AI for good impact Africa and I had a there's a lot of conversations about you know using the whole mobile payment revolution of East Africa leaprogging decades of infrastructure.

Could the same thing be done with AI in Africa? Um I haven't made up my mind on it yet. Um depending on who you talk to, you might be convinced or not. Uh I think the opportunity is there but also

you can't take it for granted that even if that did happen it would go in the right direction and I think that sort of basic understanding whether it's for children for diplomats from grade school

to grad school that skills gap is massive and I I think that would probably be the best spend of money to start there. &gt;&gt; Brando what will you do with a billion

dollars? I I would say I subscribe to Fred priority because I think that literacy, understanding, build consciousness, building capacity also among civil society actors is extremely

important when we see a big acceleration of development of of AI as it it's happening around us. Thank you. No, I completely agree on the digital literacy because I think one of the

biggest risks we face which we haven't spoken much about is labor displacement which I think is going to become significantly more serious. The other thing I would do is invest in building

the capacity of our state institutions, of our independent institutions of democracy, our competitions commissions, our gender equality commissions, our human rights commissions, our

information regulators. Those are the bodies that will be able to champion the rights of citizens in the face of big tech monopolies. &gt;&gt; I would have personally bought the

shares of all the company CEOs who were here yesterday, but thank you for that. Quick question Rachel while I have you. Uh you have spent this week in India. You have seen the entire thing. Do you

have seen the energies around this what is one lesson you learned from India which you think we we should deploy globally? &gt;&gt; I think India has made it very very

clear that AI isn't for everyone. I think compared to any of the other summits I've been to, I think it's wonderful that there are children from schools here that we have so many people

that are local that have come to the summit and feel included. I think feeling like I am in India at the Indian summit has been the biggest kind of heartening and exciting thing for me.

&gt;&gt; Fred. &gt;&gt; Yeah, thanks. Um yeah, I've been super inspired to to hear the story of how India was able to through a billion plus people create digital ID, financial

inclusion, digital payments. So there's a track record of let's say technology diffusion at scale, but in a way that's beneficial for everyone. So that could be a good model for AI diffusion. I know

there's still a long road to go, but if if you can do it in India for a billion plus people, I think it should work in in smaller places as well. Brando with whatever is left in your voice now.

&gt;&gt; Well, I I think we can learn a lot from uh what we are seeing here in these days and I'm convinced that uh we uh need to um be determined in building more global cooperation. I don't think we can uh get

the best out of uh AI uh diffusion um if we u abandon the path of building a more common understanding and learning from each other. I think this summit can be u a a moment of this process but this is

something that must happen uh during all the year. &gt;&gt; Yeah. No, I think thanks thanks to all of you. I mean my lesson was obviously shake hands with your enemies even if

you are that's the only way to do do diffusion in in across the world. So thank I like to thank all the panelists. Thank you very much. Uh and Brando especially with your voice giving away

you I hope you you have a good stay and thanks thanks for enjoying the and joining the panel. Thank you very much. Thank you very Yeah,
