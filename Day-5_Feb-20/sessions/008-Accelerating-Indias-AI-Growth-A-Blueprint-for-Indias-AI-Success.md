## 📝 Transcript

trusted governance. So this conversation here and the couple of conversations we are going to have over the next 1 hour or so are aligned with the summit's goal of bridging the global AI divide. So AI

drives economic growth, social empowerment and of course global leadership for India. This is not just a presentation, it is a call to action. I'm your host Midu Bandari, senior

anchor and consulting editor at Network 18 with brands like CNBC and Forbes India and I'll be guiding you through this next 55minut journey that we're on. To set the tone of this morning, we're

going to begin with framing the execution pathway of AI adoption and scaling it up from an industry vantage point. Our leadership keynote theme today is architecting India's AI

leadership a blueprint for transformation. To deliver this note, please join me in welcoming on stage Dr. Vive Mohindra, special adviser to the vice chairman and COO of Dell

Technologies Global. Dr. Mohindra, please join us here. Thank thank you Mu and thank you everyone for joining us uh for the unveiling of this important uh

blueprint. uh as we have heard over the most of this week uh India is at the cusp of uh very significant changes uh and progress on the back of AI with very bold aspirations which are not only bold

for India but they're very bold when you put it in the context of uh global aspirations that lots of other countries have. Uh Dell has been uh had a presence in India for over 30 years. We have

partnered very closely with uh several government uh uh agencies as well as companies and the broader ecosystem to bring the broader set of capabilities that we have which are uh across the

board covering server, storage, networking, PCs uh and we are the number one AI infrastructure provider to enterprises globally. Um so leveraging our global presence and leveraging our

deep knowledge of India, we have uh put all of that thought into putting forth as Mizu described an AI blueprint which is a practical guide for what we think not only the country but also companies

need to do to be able to take advantage of this particular opportunity. The growth in terms of compute expected on the back of AI in India is expected to be well greater than 10x flops and that

is a significant amount of growth and the AI workloads in India are growing at over 30% compound annual growth rate over the next few years which is extremely significant. So as we step

back and look at what are the key elements of what a country and companies need to do there really are three key elements. Um the first element is investments and the investment really

goes at the heart of the compute infrastructure that a country needs to put in place to ensure that everybody has access to that infrastructure including uh FM MMEs who sometimes do

not have the capacity to be able to put their infrastructure in place. investment also uh includes uh energy infrastructure because without energy uh there is really no compute

infrastructure you can put in place which can run on that. So those are some of the key areas of the invest pillar of that and there are other several other areas that I will encourage you to read

through our blueprint that you will see uh both from a policy perspective and practical perspective that we think needs to get done. The innovate side really comes down to areas like skilling

which I know when Minister Chowri joins us uh we will get into that in quite some detail but uh innovating around how the skilling occurs all the way from schools to colleges to um workforce

entering employment and employers themselves. what role they play across a whole spectrum of mediums to dis uh deliver that skilling is a key part of uh uh the innovate pillar and then the

last one evolve revolves all around governance aspects of that uh and governance covers multiple areas. One of the key areas within governance is uh fundamentally the regulatory framework

that needs to exist and that countries need to put in place. The pace of change is so significant with AI and how rapidly uh the technologies are moving that one of the fundamental balances

that countries need to strike visav regulations is striking the balance between innovation and responsibility uh while anchoring it to responsibility. That is one of the key uh uh regulatory

principles that needs to be in place and the regulations have to be agile because the technology is moving at such a fast pace that you cannot anchor the regulatory framework to yesterday's

technologies and at the heart of it I hope what you'll take away from our blueprint is rec real realizing sovereign AI potential for any country uh including India is really about the

public partner public private partnership and it's really about marrying the public resources with private innovation and that really is what the key to unlocking the full

potential of AI and sovereign AI is in this country. So again I would encourage you to read through the blueprint and uh we look forward to your feedback and we look forward to partnering closely with

Indian ecosystem to help India realize its uh aspirations with AI. Thank you very much. Thank you so much Dr. Mahindra. I'm going to request you to please stay back

on stage. I'd also like to invite Manish Gupta, president and managing director of Dell Technologies India to join us here. This is the big moment ladies and gentlemen. We are ready for the

unveiling of the Dell Technologies blueprint to accelerate India's AI growth. Yes, that's that's a photo moment for everyone.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you so much gentlemen. Thank you Dr. Mahindra. Thank you Mr. Gupta. Well, this blueprint advances India's vision of Vixit Bharat 2047, positioning AI as a foundational engine

for productivity, modernized public services, opportunity expansion, and strategic autonomy. It centers on three pillars that we've been discussing. Invest, invest in sovereign, scalable

compute and data foundations, innovate with collaboration, and with a future ready workforce. and evolve evolve into a responsible agile security first governance structure. So our next panel

today will go inside this blueprint and India's AI future to unpack how to convert this ambition into nation scale execution and that's quite a mean feat for a country as diverse and as huge as

India. So let's welcome the panelists for all the tough questions this morning. Raj Gopal as managing director and chief executive officer of nextgen cloud technologies.

Bhaskar Chakravarti dean of global business the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tus University. Please have a seat sir. And once again on stage Manish Gupta,

president and managing director of Dell Technologies India and I will be moderating this session for you. Welcome gentlemen. We are here this morning to really translate the invest,

innovate and evolve pillars into very actionable steps that we all can take together to grow India's AI ecosystem. So I'll begin with targeted questions to each of you. Um and of course you are

free to jump in to add thoughts to each other. It's a candid free flowing conversation. Um Mr. Raj Gopal if I can start with you. Startups and MSMES they are the engine of our economy. They are

also the engine of our innovation especially as far as AI is concerned. But access to very reliable affordable AI compute and cloud at scale continues to be a barrier for many of the small

and medium enterprises. Now in your opinion what are some of the policy some of the infrastructure some of the market interventions that we need today uh to really unlock this access at scale?

Yeah, actually I think across uh many other countries and that we have seen India has got a much uh comprehensive uh approach to this. I mean in terms of uh actually they started this India mission

which is uh across seven pillars. uh I actually don't see many startups actually using the facilities that are there uh in the sense that you could apply for GPU infrastructure and you

would get it at a subsidized rate and some of them even got 100% of the GPUs that they need. So um so I think from India side we've got little um less number of GPUs uh that um uh compared to

what we really need. Maybe we need about 200,000 GPUs now and we have about 40 50,000 now. So we all need to really uh invest more and then deploy more. Um but most important thing that you should see

is that there is a good ecosystem there is a system policy available for MSMES and startups to leverage this. So there are a lot of innovative uh AI solutions being built. Uh most importantly um I

also see that government actually setting pace in terms of actually leveraging some of these um we ourselves I mean we did one job for uh government which was very very unique uh like u we

serve election commission of India they came to us and said can you dduplicate and look at um all the photographs that we have this is like you know 90 cr pictures right I mean so humanly it was

not possible to dduplicate you can't check one photograph with 90 90 grow others. Um we did that um in matter of 51 hours and then we responded to them as to whether they had applications and

all &gt;&gt; that deserves some applause that's that's a humongous task. So the what I see in this country is that I don't think we will be pure play this chatbot

mean the uh generative AI the way it has been envisaged I mean will be the primary use case I think we are going far beyond um what AI can be applied um in terms of actually improving the

productivity of citizen services and also um give use cases that these small and medium enterprises can actually use um in terms terms of uh actually enabling more GPUs I think um we have uh

so we need a lot of money I mean this is we are investing about 100th of what US is investing or even less um so for us to do more I think we need to remove certain bottlenecks that are there one

of the things I believe that can be done is um I'm sure everybody is familiar we all pay GST but basically when we import servers when you pay GST on it and then when we deliver service I get that as an

input and we do the I mean we only pay the value added piece back to the government but the government gets the GST either way and I get an input. So the way to um one thing that we could

look at is whether we can wave off the GST up front and just take the GST when the services are being delivered. What that would do is it'll deliver it'll reduce my uh upfront infrastructure cost

to by about you know you know 18%. um you know I don't have to fund that up front and then uh pay interest on it uh you know uh or raise equity and you know pay more expectation on that I mean um

these things could really help I mean there are some of these things that government should look at and actually facilitate this piece the last point is that um they've given um tax holiday for

delivering services to the world but I think India has got a lot more to do within India um and then just look at world market but and um I believe that we should get Indian service providers

should get the same benefits as the uh um global providers would get when you know they host services in India. So um maybe a GST waiver and u some income tax benefits could be good.

&gt;&gt; Okay, GST waiver, income tax benefits uh demands from the industry coming in. Uh uh professor Bhaskar if I can come to you now. You've often argued that nations need to compete not just on

technology but on trust on institutional strength and of course very very inclusive digital participation and that's very critical for a country like India because we are a country of many

countries uh the rich poor divide is quite huge there are a lot of bridges to gap here uh there are a lot of gaps to bridge here my apologies now as India accelerates AI what do you think are

some of the biggest non non-technical bottlenecks that we should be looking at addressing which you believe could really uh you know limit this momentum that we are on currently and if we need

larger societal good what are some of the non-technical barriers that we need to immediately resolve &gt;&gt; yeah so thank you thank you for the question and thank you for the

invitation to join this uh uh you know terrific panel I think the u uh the issue of what are the non-technical elements uh it's great that you have included that question in this

discussion because uh in all the excitement around the technical infrastructure which is of course uh enormous that's happening right here in India uh it's no secret that uh you know

this is one of the biggest talent pools in the world uh growing very very fast years one in three developers are going to be in India uh the largest mobile data pool anywhere in the world uh the

third largest data pool you know anywhere in the world once you take mobile and everything else together. Growth in compute, growth in energy, growth in workloads, all that is

happening, you know, which is fantastic. Now, when you think about what are the other elements that drive demand, what we have found, we study 125 countries uh and try to understand the role of

technology in shaping lives and livelihoods across 135 countries. the single most uh important determinant of what keeps a country on trajectory in terms of both the momentum of growth and

also the state of their digital evolution is the demand side. So when I think about the demand side obviously the core infrastructure uh which uh has been uh talked about is enormously

important and uh is going to continue to be a major contributor. A second part which has been talked about a lot in the Indian context is the distribution infrastructure with DPI and uh all the

different platforms associated with it. We know that there's a very powerful distribution system. Now there's a third infrastructure which is the non-technical part and that is uh what I

would call the trust infrastructure. Now when you think about trust that's a it's a bit of a slippery concept. It's very hard to define. Each one of us in our heads uh has an idea of what trust is.

But if we force somebody to define it, we'll struggle. Uh I the best thing about trust is I know uh what trust is when it is not there, when it is missing. And then you have to ask the

question from a human perspective, what really is trust and how do I bake that into the policy systems, into the technical systems, into the marketing systems, into the narrative around uh uh

uh the India ecosystem which will then you know keep moving uh uh the uh uh uh demand going and trust ultimately has to do with um do people have confidence? people who are the granters of trust, do

they have confidence that this uh uh you know invisible uh uh transaction that I'm uh engaging in whether I'm putting my data into a system or whether I have entered uh my financial information and

I'm expecting something on the other side that this is this whole thing is going to be completed and it's going to be completed in a way uh that is reliable that is repeatable and will not

take advantage of me. So when you think about that whole trust ecosystem, uh India starts in a great place relative to where I come from uh the United States. India is a far more trusting

country in terms of trust in digital systems overall and certainly in terms of AI. There's a tremendous level of enthusiasm in terms of embracing all things AI and we've seen this right here

just the sheer numbers of people who have attended the conference. It shows a level of trust that is probably unmatched anywhere in the world. Now this is a tremendous asset to start

with. The challenge is that the institutional side of trust is still in the development process in India. So if you think about data governance, privacy, security, we making progress

but we need to uh be much further along. Other aspects of trust has to do with the fact that say the India AI mission uh that is developed at the union level at the center level but the actual

exercising of trust the granting of trust happens at the at the uh district level uh and the district varies depending on whether I'm in Telangana or I'm in char and at the union level the

principles that I've got in place need to be sensitive to how it's being experienced from the ground up. So there many different facets of trust uh that we need to uh work on and put in place

including transparency which AI is you know we are facing a challenge regarding transparency across the world so this is an issue and then uh you know an approach to having redress and grievance

systems and then literacy you know people need to be able to understand how to use uh this exciting technology uh and also protect themselves I'll I'll pause and we'll have a conversation

absolutely uh thank Thank you for that wonderful perspective professor. Uh coming to you Manish now the Dell Technologies blueprint really calls for tighter alignment between policy makers

between industry academia institutional capacity. How can frameworks like this one really uh ensure growth that is both globally competitive for India but also locally inclusive because uh there is a

lot of regional growth. there is a lot of you know geography that needs to be taken into the fold of AI when we are talking about being globally competitive as well.

&gt;&gt; Absolutely. Thank you Midu for that question and you know just before I go in there I would just add or maybe you know um talk speak on a couple of topics that professor just spoke about you know

trust while he spoke more from a non-technical standpoint he also brought in a technical aspect to it you know around the entire governance and it's not just nontechnical in today's world

it's driven by data privacy and all of the things around but equally on literacy there's also explanability you know that trust comes really inherently once you have got explanability and

people are aware on what uh outcomes are coming this is that explainable and do they understand that right so it's a very very interesting world that we are in now uh back to the blueprint that we

were talking about and u uh Vive articulated that beautifully well across the three pillars of invest invest in in data center capacity invest in energy infrastructure invest in people which

goes back into the innovate side of it because like we like like we just discussed uh we've possibly got the largest pool of engineers uh around AI and that's that skilling on innovate

part is what's going to differentiate us what's going to make it really real and practically doable within the industry and would differentiate us versus u other nations

uh equally make it make it make it more democratized and ubiquitous across the nation and lastly it's really about how do you continue to build in the guardrails how do you build the trust

like uh we just discussed to ensure that there is the the ecosystem system knows that this entire that this entire process can be trusted and can be built upon. Um we've also got to remember the

sustainability aspect of it you know and which is where um as you look at the blueprint you will talk you will see us talk about the fact that energy efficiency sustainability on data

centers and new u uh architectural models are becoming super important and that's something that uh nextgen uh under Raj Kopal's leadership has demonstrated in building highly

sustainable more energy efficient data centers that will allow us to use our energy resources in a in the best possible manner while democratizing the access of uh of of compute capacity

while democratizing the access of uh data center capacity to organizations and verticals of various sizes. Uh so that's going to be a be be be the critical uh pillars around which midu we

really believe that there's practicality in adopting and differentiating ourselves on the AI arena as we go forward. &gt;&gt; Right. I'm going to pick up on that data

center piece uh and come to you Raj Gopal. Now given the scale that India will really need for competing globally, what would it take to truly build sovereign costefficient AI

infrastructure that's not just available to large enterprises but is also very very affordable for the longtail of innovators that we have in this country. Yeah, if you see uh the data data center

industry, it's been uh pretty concentrated in Mumbai and little bit in Chennai and you know the other markets didn't really take off as much uh as they should have. Um so what we are

trying to do is to have um I mean current our current plan is to put about 100 megawatts of data centers in about six states and what I see is that going forward I mean this could be the model

that can be built upon where uh each state has got a capacity because the states itself have got uh so much of consumption that can happen u primarily because if you start looking at applying

uh AI into um elevating the quality of education in India um which which will be one of the first things that will get rolled out at scale in India and uh also um the healthcare aspects of it and

citizen services. Uh these things can be um require lots of computing capacity. Uh so we are working with few state governments to actually see if we can um bring a total transformation you know uh

actually consolidate their applications um bring I mean bring about a data lake and then apply data to it u sorry intelligence to it and uh take it to masses. So the way I think it will

evolve is that there will be many more regions where data centers would spring up and u uh and and then when they distributed they need to be interconnected. uh we have very good uh

interconnect system um and not just the telos but you have things like uh you know we have railway networks we have uh power networks which can actually assist the good connectivity between them when

these things come into play actually we can have a pretty distributed um a good amount of compute in India that can actually serve this uh this aspect but you must uh be aware that you know this

game is actually um I mean if you see my context I mean I have four diamonds to work on. One of course is geopolitics. I mean there is uh quite a lot that is happening. Um we need to ensure that we

have access to uh the technologies that we want to bring to India so that India actually works on the best available infrastructure. Um it is slightly better now uh but um uh but you know there were

restrictions before. Uh the other aspect is the amount of money. I mean so um I I think we it requires multiple billion dollars uh of investments to do uh and um that should be facilitated um that

should really come into the country when we have um uh the money piece sorted out and then we build the infrastructure. Um the good thing that we can leverage is open source. I mean when we leverage

open source we can actually combine uh the infrastructure and open source and bring down the cost of compute so much that it is actually palatable for the Indian citizens to use because it's not

about serving this 2% 3% of the population which pays the income tax it's about serving the 90% others &gt;&gt; the moment we succeed in in doing this I think the talent also the good talent

that we have we have um access to good talent in India but we don't have good talent um the quantity is missing. I mean so we have good people but you know you need

many more good people. Uh they're going all over the world. We want to bring them back. these things these people can come back when these uh money and infrastructure fall in place

&gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; um that would ensure that India is playing a a role which is um actually pretty balanced leveraging the global technologies and leveraging local talent

um and actually sets a blueprint for all the other countries which don't have uh which other countries which are which may miss out this revolution right and become digital colonies of uh the uh top

two countries that are investing heavily in AI Okay. So I personally believe uh we have a good blue blueprint and the blueprint can be applied to multiple countries uh and we are well on the path

and um I would prefer a distributed um development of data centers uh across the country so that we are closer to the users and um we serve the other 90% or 95% of the population that is not being

served now. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Absolutely. Um well professor coming to you next. Um studies on digital competitiveness have consistently shown that institutional

capacity often determines whether technology adoption really translates into economic value or not. Now u in the Indian context what do we really need to do to really strengthen institutional

muscle here that ensures that AI drives very very inclusive growth rather than you know deepening the tech divide because there are already many divides that we are battling with.

&gt;&gt; Yeah. So when you um when you talk about institutions um the institutions need to be fit for purpose. So um I think it's helpful to break down this thing called AI that we

are you know we all know that it's not just one thing uh it is a general purpose technology that's finding its way into many different uses and uh when you think about the uses we talked about

u uh small and medium businesses of course the backbone of uh uh uh the adoption uh of AI in the enterprise level but if you think about some of the biggest uh use cases in India uh

agriculture, skilling, uh healthcare, those are the three uh biggest ones just in terms of sheer numbers of people affected and the impact that you're going to have. It may not necessarily

have the same revenue impact but it has a much larger societal impact. We just think about agriculture if 40% 40% of uh the crops grown in India um primarily among uh you know small holder farmers.

If 40% of those crops are destroyed by pests and if I can fix that problem get that 40% number down to 30% or 20%. Suddenly I have improved farmer uh well-being and income by an enormous

amount. So if we just think about that one transformation using uh uh essentially very simple AI it doesn't have to you uh involve uh complex uh uh access complex databases.

Uh the compute is done at the edge. uh you you are dealing with people who have intermittent uh access to the internet and and you can you can make it work. Now in that context the question is what

is the institutional capacity the institutional infrastructure the trust infrastructure I need basically the farmer needs to start from the point of view that I can use my phone as a tool

for farming which is something completely new I mean people have learned farming from their uh from earlier generations. How do I think about the phone as a tool for farming?

Just crossing that chasm requires a couple of seasons of using the phone and then seeing the outcomes that my uh the uh impact of pests has gone down and it has made a practical difference to my

life. Now then you ask the then you have to ask the question from a farmer's perspective what's preventing them from doing that and that's where the institution becomes uh relevant. That's

where the explanability aspect also becomes relevant for a farmer to understand how the system works. essentially my p the picture I take of my crop needs to match up with

an image database uh that is uh out there and essentially in a very simple uh uh interface I can match the pest and I can then end up with a solution to the problem. So the same thing for health uh

for for skill building literacy if I can see uh my ability to speak my ability to read in multiple languages improve you know suddenly my trust goes up so what is the minimum amount of institutional

safeguards I need to provide that then I come to something like healthcare when people have a much bigger chasm to cross that's where people have a lot of concerns about you know should I be

putting my information into the system how is it going to be used should can I trust the phone where I've relied on a doctor or I've relied on uh you know uh a wise person in my community. I've

relied on my mother you know for maternal uh uh healthcare advice. So how do I cross that chasm and you know being able to provide the foundational trust uh elements is going to be important. So

the answer to your question long answer is it depends. It depends on the usage &gt;&gt; as is the case to a lot of questions about India. It depends right. Uh well Manish you know globally we are seeing

nations tie AI strategy to strategic autonomy. Now whether it comes to the semiconductor ecosystem or the supply chain you know the strategic autonomy is becoming extremely important for

countries for India what are the two or three foundational capabilities that you think we need to build uh domestically in this decade to ensure that we are true creators of AI value and not just

consumers. &gt;&gt; Awesome. Great question Midu and you know we as a nation have proven ourselves to be phenomenal adopters of technology you know and uh the best

example in my mind comes on UPI or or digital payment 10 years back 11 years back we were just not there and today we are by far the largest uh consumers or the the number of digital payments and

the value of digital payments within India is multiple times of the second economy that does this right so that's a great example of how we have been able to localize, democratize and u and and

proliferate the use of technology. So within that I would really put on uh three hats here. The first and just you know inverting the pyramids not starting with technology but starting with

people. We've really got to think away from the users to the uh uh to to the developers. You know it's got to move from 1 billion users to 1 billion or 1 million or 10 million uh developers. And

that's the skill set. That's the IP that we are going to bring in because we've got that largest talent pool residing within the within the within the country. Uh the second and again I heard

you talk about semiconductor and and supply chain. I think we've got to adopt the best that's available there there globally but equally we've got to move not we've got to not just think about

made in India but talk about trusted in India and which is where work with organizations such as AISI artificial intelligence uh safety institute to ensure that we are putting the right um

guardrails putting the right governance policy and the entire u institutional framework to ensure that the AI that we are building here is trusted And lastly goes back to the same thing

and maybe I'll use the same example. You know we had the UPI of money we need to have UPI of AI where we are we we we are building that at scale using the data sources that we have. We have the

largest ones and some of the initiatives that the or that that the government has taken India AI mission but equally think about AI kosh there are more than 7,000 data sets that are now available to uh

available to organizations of all sizes. use that to ensure that we are developing for the country at the population scale through academia through private sector through startups

through MSMES all coming together and that really requires a consistent API layer that's bringing theoretically maybe even all of the data center and the compute capacity that we are

creating as a part of AI mission to be one single layer that can be consumed by anybody and everybody uh across the nation to start to innovate on that to start to develop on that uh so going

back I know a long answer but if I were to summarize three things there UPI of money to UPI of AI you know made in India transitioning to trusted in India and you know from a developer users to

from a billion uh users to maybe a million or 10 million developers &gt;&gt; made in India but made for the world &gt;&gt; absolutely &gt;&gt; right all right so um I'm going to ask

each one of you for a few concise takeaways today now the blueprint that we are talking about that you know Del technologies has just unveiled talks about agile trusted AI governance with

sectoral baselines test beds strong institutional coordination yet globally what we've seen is that speed often beats caution um and we are seeing u you know some of the scary stuff coming out

with AI as well uh a lot of the experiments a lot of you know agentic AI experiments that people are doing across the world um some of them call for caution Now in the Indian context, how

do we stay globally competitive while also operationalizing very very stringent safeguards? Um and where should we really draw the line between the speed of innovation or

innovation velocity and regulatory discipline? So uh Raj Gopal if we can start with you please. Um if you take the birth of geni I mean it actually um I don't think none of those those rules

and were actually followed and you know uh it was built on every data that was available in whatever form. Um personally you know in most places I'm actually trying to tell people just uh

it's not about ignoring the um uh the risk factors of it but I think the regulation should not curtail um the innovation in the uh thinking that you know we should be uh restrictive about

whatever we are working with and um so one of the most important things is I think we should have less regulation in in this place because uh I think overall the benefit you should look at AI like a

utility I mean you will have more good with AI than uh with bad. Uh yes there are things that can be handled as we go along. If you see what we do in cloud today, we haven't been able to sort out

our security and you know data protection postures even today. It's an evolving uh journey and I think we will continuously catch up with um uh the bad factors around the uh AI adoption. uh

and and that's a journey. It cannot start or stop or um it can be implemented at a point in time. So we should keep looking at uh those aspects and keep putting whether regulations or

technology interventions to ensure that we handle those pieces but we should go uh fast forward uh with uh implementation and adoption of AI and I see a lot of Indian enterprises really

reluctant in in terms of adopting it especially the larger ones. But if you see um in India, I think government will set the pace uh and uh the startups and the MSMES will actually uh catch on from

there and the large enterprises will actually um struggle to catch up with the amount of innovation that's happening in these two spaces. &gt;&gt; Where does that reluctance come from?

Like what are the top three reasons large organizations are reluctant? One is of course the fact that it's not easy to to adopt and transform a large organization and perhaps startups and

thememes have the benefit of the agility and the small scale that they are at. What else? &gt;&gt; So I think the first uh issue is not about um security and all that. I mean

uh about these aspects but most importantly I think a lot of people are struggling to imagine where to apply AI and I think the moment we can understand that you will start seeing that um the

benefits are far outweigh the um the negative aspects of it. So I think um that's the first thing that people should look at is to not just look at uh leveraging the uh genai in its chatbot

form. I mean but actually really look at where you can deploy. Um I I talked about that dduplication piece. There are uh like we are working on more than 150 projects and not all of them are you

know bot- based. So that imagination is what is important and one that once that imagination comes you will um out I mean the benefits will outweigh the um negative aspects of whatever we are

seeing. &gt;&gt; All right. Uh professor final takeaway from you on u you know speed versus caution. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So if you think about speed I like

to uh always like to use the analogy of a car and a road. uh you can think about the speed uh that you can build into the car the velocity of the Ferrari and the a lot of the conversations that have

happened not necessarily in this room but in other rooms is about the Ferraris whether I'm talking about agentic AI or AI optimized for certain applications and the technical aspects you know

really really important now if you take the Ferrari and you bring it into the Indian context maybe it's a marauti or something else that I need to be talking about but then the question is what's

the road on which uh this Ferrari is going if it's a dirt road full of potholes Even a Ferrari is not going to go very fast. &gt;&gt; So much of our conversation here is

about that dirt road and what are the things what are the potholes that we need to fix. There's one elephant on the table that we did not address and I'm just going to leave it at that which is

when we talk about trust there's a whole bunch of things you can do from an institutional standpoint to build trust, transparency, explanability and so on. There's a huge issue that we need to

think about which is what is going to be the impact on jobs. What's going to be have the impact on jobs? This is the youngest major country in the world. It's also one of the least employed

country in the world. And now with AI coming in, is that going to help boost jobs or is it going to take jobs away? If we don't fix that problem, get ahead of that all the trust we are talking

about all the institutions you build could cut uh could come down. So part of the policy infrastructure here is to figure out what is the post AI jobs picture.

&gt;&gt; Absolutely. Manish, final word to you. So you know I honestly don't think that these are opposing forces agility versus security and you know particularly in this in in in this side of technology

you cannot have them act as opposing it's really about building the frameworks that are going to take both of them together. uh this is fast evolving as a technology but equally as

as as um uh institutions we'll have to be faster that than that in evolving I think the government has done a phenomenal job in in in building some of the frameworks around that you know um

and the and the institutions AIS one example but on the privacy side DPDP or DPA all of those acts being there uh are good frameworks to start with and I'll just uh index back on the question that

you had asked Raj uh Raj Gopal earlier on what is the hesitation from enterprises and adopting I don't think it's necessarily about security you know it's really about saying how many how

many of those have real use cases while the real use cases are exist how many of them are able to monetize or are able to see them scale from experimentation or pilots into production and I think

that's a job that we as uh as industry folks who understand the technology who are innovating in this space really need to bring to the table so that we can bring this to the for across the across

across the nation and enterprises and organizations of all sizes and and and academia and and and public. I think that's where uh uh this will get practical but equally these are not

opposing forces. They go hand in hand. &gt;&gt; Right. Well, thank you gentlemen for that absolutely incredible conversation. Um you know the the takeaway is clear that investing innovating and of course

uh innovating by expanding skills pipelines and accelerating AI deployment is going to be key to India's uh sovereign AI infrastructure and uh appreciate you joining us here and

taking the time today. We are also very delighted to now be joined by honorable Shri Jayen Chri Minister of State for Education and Minister of Skill Development. Huge round of applause.

We are going to have him up here shortly. Thank you gentlemen. Thank you very much for joining us. Um so if we can have you up here for a quick photo op and we will then continue the

conversation. Thank you. Thank you everyone. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you gentlemen. Um Manish if I can please request you to felicitate our speakers.

&gt;&gt; Mr. Raj Gopal &gt;&gt; let's have a huge round of applause for our panelists here today. &gt;&gt; Professor Bhaskar Chakravarti. Thank you so much for joining us here

today. Uh if you all can just get off the stage for two minutes. We are getting it ready for our next conversation. Thank you so much.

Well ladies and gentlemen, time to move on. Now if India's AI ambition is to translate into real economic growth, it's obviously not going to be any one entity's job, it is not going to be

driven only by the government or by the industry alone. It'll be driven by partnership. India has the talent, the digital backbone and the momentum. The real question though is how do we scale

AI responsibly, securely and inclusively. So our next fireside chat conversation will explore what a powerful public private model regarding AI could really look like and for this

I'm delighted to welcome two very eminent leaders who are instrumental in shaping the journey both from policy and industry perspectives. Uh we have of course honorable Shri Jayan Chadri GI

minister of state for education and minister of skill development and entrepreneurship independent charge government of India and we have Dr. Vivec Mahindra special adviser to the

vice chairman and COO Dell Technologies Global if I can please have both of you up here for a quick conversation. Thank you so much. Thank you very much.

Thank you gentlemen. Uh well it's quite clear that public private partnership is going to be critical to AI scaling and adoption in India. Uh you know Chadri G if I can start with you. How can PPP

models really accelerate large scale AI infrastructure? What have been some of the onground experiences you've seen so far? And of course uh the government has been moving at breakneck speed when it

comes to uh deploying more technology sort of you know giving a more philip to innovation in India. Uh how are you really ensuring trust resilience and wrong long-term national competitiveness

as AI becomes very mainstream with this event in India. uh in the Indian context as the audience is aware we had a lot of catching up to do and uh it's fair to say that a lot of

what we are seeing around us in AI has been uh facilitated by creating an ecosystem in a short span of time perhaps we may enjoy a second mover advantage with regards to this

technology uh and that has come about only because of a strong top-down down emphasis and push. The only reason why this event is

happening here in India is because the leadership at the top understood very quickly the the value and the potential of this new technology that we should not view it as a disruption but view it

as an opportunity to leapfrog legacy problems, deficit problems and provide access and equity to our citizens and dignity to our workers. And that's why prime minister you know the last event

in France shared that leadership space every opportunity he gets he talks about skilling about young people about the potential for AI and the enunciation in Manov that this technology needs to be

humanentric uh I think that has given us a real uh emphasis and a push for the academia for our industry for our vibrant startup systems to really think about what they

are doing in this space. I think that is a background to the event that we are all witnessing thousands and thousands of people casual visitors apart from those who are already entrenched in

technology. Uh and this message that goes out is that 1 billion strong young people in a developing country are already thinking about what AI means to them and what they can do in this space.

not just be consumers but also be producers and innovators and thinkers and creators. Now PPP in this domain for me and when you think about manav being humanentric

citizencentric the P that really matters is the people and in that context it's important that you have the broad architecture which is open. This is something that India has

stood for from the beginning when there was a lot of debate about uh what is should be the policy that enables AI. But there was also a lot of fear around AI about trust factors about privacy

data sovereignity multiple issues about a human interface the augmented human worker what this means for education for the future of jobs. A lot of those issues were being

discussed and debated and India said that yes it's good to have a strategy and out of that strategy and experiences will evolve a robust policy. It is essential to have guardrails but it is a

starting point. currently we don't want to infringe upon the possibility of innovation and India took that approach and uh we had open uh access to whatever compute you know India AI mission was

set up with a target of 18,000 GPUs and in a short span they've surpassed it it's about 38,000 and a road map is by the end of this year it's going to cross one lakh threefold

now think about it all of this compute facility that has been created is a model PPP it has to be housed in educational institutions so that real research can

happen in our premier educational institutions. This is the great time when academia is more important than it perhaps ever was in the Indian context. In the Indian context, academia was

partly separated from industry and the real economy in our minds. But now every Indian citizen is realizing the value of research and innovation. Every family is saying that no this is important we must

value it and every educational institution is saying that we are not diverse from the market and needs of our community and society in nationhood building. So that engagement with

nationhood building and concept of technology is deeply immersed thanks to the efforts of India AI mission. And here I'll just leave one data point to you. What is the cost of this compute

facility? It's being provided to for startups for researchers at 65 rupees. for an hour. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; You pay 300 rupees for a couple of hours

PVR cinema ticket. &gt;&gt; So it's probably the world's cheapest compute facility which is open. We're celebrating server. Let's not focus on forprofit not for

profit cuz everything has to be for people. If you look at server that's also in in my mind a PPP. It's been incubated by IIT Madras. It has been supported by AI mission. So that's

another example because you're right, government cannot invest in from data to energy to compute to innovation. It really has to come uh from our our citizens, our researchers, our directive

mission that it is. It is &gt;&gt; absolutely well uh Dr. Mahind Mahindra getting your point of view from you know from a Dell perspective. Now if we look at PPP as far as job enablement is

concerned because that's the big concern that citizens have that what's going to happen to our jobs uh and of course skilling is part of that journey. How can Dell partner with you know uh

ministry of skill development and entrepreneurship what are you all doing from a future skill labs perspective? How are you accelerating AI appren apprenticeships uh so that basically the

jobs also move beyond the metros because tier 2 tier three towns is where uh you know we are looking at a lot of talent sitting there but we are looking at a lack of access of sorts when it comes to

scaling. &gt;&gt; Yeah I think that's a great question and I think uh honorable minister good to see you again. It reminds me of a discussion we had back in last time we

met in October of 2024. I know we missed each other in in Austin and we covered very similar ground. I think at the heart of it it does come down to and I commend India on the progress it's made

in making uh access to all these GPUs available. It is an it is an um industry academia partnership working closely with with uh the minister here and our view is when you think about skilling

there are three different levels. You have to think about schooling, you have to think about college level and you have to think about employment. Uh people entering the workforce are

employed today and you think about delivery of this through online in-person incubation. So those are the two big dimensions and in our from our perspective we are very excited to

partner on extending it to tier two tier three working closely with uh the minister and other uh institutions in India and the core of it having accessibility to this GPU at such an

amazing price point really unlocks the potential and I think as Minister and I talked about last time we met and I predicted the rise of Agentic technologies it will lower the bar even

further in terms of being able to provide the skilling. So those are some of the ways that we have been working and we look forward to partnering. &gt;&gt; Right. Well, finally to both of you now

as we embed AI into all our critical sectors whether it's BFSI or telecom or agriculture, healthcare, education. Now governance has to move from intent to very very strong operational safeguards.

What does zero trust AI architecture then practically look like at a national level? Minister if we can start with you. Well uh zero trust it's it's an

interesting terminology what that for me the way I look at it it means that you have to be able to verify each and every protocol in your design and uh in India we generate a lot of

data everything and Indian citizens are uh quite open about access uh globally privacy has been a major concern And sometimes it becomes also an impediment for governance because that

those data points aren't being collected analyzed researched in in the Indian context citizens are okay about sharing their data and I'm saying this with the knowledge that you know kores of apar

IDs have been formed created using consent but we have not received any blowback in a way from from students families saying that why are you because they understand

that if we are able to with technology customize and tailor a experience in the classroom for every student where no student can get left behind what that means for the employability for the

knowledge acquisition for that student for the quality of their educational experience is immense so I think but once you're collecting the data there is a lot of effort that needs to be put in

so that that trust is maintained from zero trust to 100% trust in in the public mind. Uh so I think our data sets need to be segmented. There are protocols in in within government of

India. In education, we're thinking of creating a complete AI stack which means the anonymized data sets will be made available for researchers for the creating the value for the layers of

innovation for enabling startups to engage with that data that government of India and the citizens have shared. Similarly in skill we have skill India dig digital hub which is also looking at

creating those data sets which can then uh really help us unleash the next wave of innovation and requirement that we have in scaling. So I think once you have that system design in place it can

be achieved. The prime minister spoke about a label for content that you know that it should be verifiable and legal this technology and consumer awareness is a big aspect of it on how we engage

with these tools and how we understand what the outcome of our engagement. How true is it? How is it verifiable? Where are these AI models trained? Is there any bias in that data set? All that

knowledge needs to be out there uh for the consumers. I feel also that there needs to be an audit trail really for for our new AI models. &gt;&gt; Maybe in the future you could have CAG

come out with an audit report of all the AI models, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; So it's a it's a brave new future, but it's a balance for partnership at scale.

You need an architecture with trust. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Final 30 seconds to you Dr. Moindra. &gt;&gt; I I I think uh the minister said it very eloquently. is I would extend the notion

to zero trust uh should extend to start with data go into AI models the usability the cyber security elements and the identity and access management those would be the ways I would extend

it and practically it means beyond the governance framework having things like a national risk registry observability being able to report whenever there is an infraction and auditility

auditability but minister you said it very eloquently and I think our AI blueprint has more details that would be worth uh looking at. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Thank you very much. Thank

you, Minister Chadri G. Thank you, Dr. Mohindra. Well, clear takeaways from that conversation. Public private partnerships, future ready workforce

pipelines that reach much beyond the metros and of course zero trust guardrails that we all need for uh a very very uh defined AI future for India. Thank you very much for joining

us here today. appreciate you taking the time. Dr. Mohindra, if you can please &gt;&gt; felicitate the minister. &gt;&gt; Can we have all the speakers up on stage please? Can I request you all to stay

back? U sir and professor Chakravarti Mr. Raj Gopal he's not here please we'll have a quick photo op huge round of applause for all our panelists today for these incredible

conversations. Thank you very much. Thank you for being here at the India AI impact summit. Hope you enjoyed that conversation and uh you can of course download the Dell

Technologies blueprint by scanning the QR code right here. Uh it's got a lot of interesting insights. So go ahead, scan that QR code and take a look at the blueprint.

Thank you gentlemen. Thank you everyone for being a an im immensely participative audience here today. I'm sorry we could not have any time for audience questions but appreciate you

joining us here today. Thank you very &gt;&gt; Thank you. However,
