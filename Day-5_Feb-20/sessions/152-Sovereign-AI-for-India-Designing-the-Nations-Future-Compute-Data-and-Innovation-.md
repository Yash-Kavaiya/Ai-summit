## 📝 Transcript

Starting second and let us [cough] question. &gt;&gt; Waiting for him.

&gt;&gt; Uh, he said he'll be 5 minutes late. 2 minutes later. &gt;&gt; No, no, no. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, we'll start now. &gt;&gt; Hello and good afternoon everyone. Uh,

thank you for joining us for this session on sovereign AI for India. Uh before we begin the panel discussion again we are happy to announce that there will be a launch of the sovereign

AI research report by Amrit Vishu Vidyam. May I invite the following representatives to kindly join us on stage first for the release of the report from Amrita. We would like to

invite pro vice chancellor Dr. Manisha Vira Romesh. Um and okay uh and uh if available head of the AI safety research lab Dr. uh Shiva Ramak Krishna um and any other representatives from Amrita

that you would like to invite on stage sir. All right. Um &gt;&gt; All right. Uh Professor Suresh and uh um if you we could please have you on stage. Um I would like to invite Mr.

Ankit Bos head NASCOM AI on stage as well. No, please please please. &gt;&gt; We will. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much.

&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. &gt;&gt; You can take the seats, sir. &gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you everyone. Uh we now move into the panel discussion. Um to

guide this conversation we are joined by Mr. Dr. Ankit Bose, head NASCOM AI. Joining him today are our distinguished panelists, Professor Ganesh Ramak Krishnan from IT Bombay and Bharajan. Uh

Mr. Sunil Gupta, co-founder, MD and CEO of Y, Mr. Bhaskar Gorti. Okay. Um okay, Miss Mr. Bhaskar Gorti, EVP Tata

Communications, Mr. Kalyan Kumar, CPO, HCL Software, and Mr. of Renault Melo founding GTM executive Genspark. Ankit over to you. Professor Ganesh will be shortly joining

us in 2 minutes. We have been on the stage. &gt;&gt; So, so hi everyone. I think we had a good launch and we have a very strong

panel. So, Gesh was on the way and and he's still stuck on the traffic. he's walking in. So meanwhile we start the discussion. I think uh you know uh happy to have a very strong panel. So so so

why don't we do this? We we start with the introduction right. I think uh uh I think Kalan we can start with your quick introduction and then &gt;&gt; yeah hi Kalan Kumar call me KK. Uh I I

run the software product business for HCL HCL software. Uh we are the largest India headquartered enterprise B2B software company with about 10,000 customers and about $1 and a half

billion dollars of revenue and very intrically involved in building software products which are sovereign by design. &gt;&gt; Hello good afternoon my name is Sunil Gupta I'm co-founder and CEO of Y. So uh

we run data center campuses. We have built sovereign cloud in India which is running uh whole lot of mission critical government of India's applications. Recently we migrated Bhashini from a

hypers scale cloud to our sovereign cloud. uh our claim to fame in the last 2 years is that we have got thousands of Nvidia GPU chips in India and all the models which you are hearing getting

launched in this summit server model I uh Bombay's bhat gen model or socket model they all have been trained on our GPU cluster and now they are being made available to public use thank you

&gt;&gt; hello good afternoon uh my name is Brena Melo I work for gensparkai Palo Alto based company. We've been around for about 10 months. Uh we are the largest growing AI company right now

in the world. Uh we just broke $200 million in ARR. Uh our solution has been incredibly well adopted in the market. India is our third largest market. Uh and our solutions here to drive adoption

from the bottom up uh by bringing agent AI to the knowledge worker. Uh thanks for let me be here. &gt;&gt; Great, great, great. And and hi folks I'm I'm Ankit Bosa head AI for NASCOM.

to what does on something I'd support that I lead that right uh and and we will be joined by Ganesh uh who is from Bharaj Jin he's uh leading the you know so AI model building effort in the

country right so so I think meanwhile you joined let's start I think sil let me start with you right uh uh the first question I think I would want to ask after five day of uh immense uh

brainstorming around you know uh AI for the country AI for the world right uh you know uh what is what is the top can you say which uh you know India has to do right to build its southern uh

capability not only for the for the country plus for the global south &gt;&gt; uh Ankit if I take everybody [clears throat] just 2 years or maybe two and a half

years down the line when chat GPT got on scene basically AI capability came in consumer hands uh a big debate happened in India's obviously government circle industry

circle telecom circle technology circle everywhere that while India has got everything uh which is needed to succeed in AI like we have been uh software and services leaders for last three decades

we have a uh startup ecosystem on skill set index of mathematics science engineering we are always the best as a market we are literally close to 1 billion people carrying smartphones

creating consuming content AI ultimately result into most of the cases you know some apps which will be giving some productivity to us so both on the demand side as well as supply side including

data sets like India will have the best data sets available. So everything India has but what India was not having at that time was compute because AI does not run in regular data centers or

regular CPU computes it require the specialized GPU computes. So I would say that the biggest problem and of course you have to take care of the entire stack models data sets applications

everything but the core problem to solve for taking AI to the masses was that how do you make uh compute available in a abundant way so that we don't think of that that should become just a hygiene

which is always available and that's the problem we tried to solve uh you know way back at that time Jensen was in India I happened to get to meet him and he says we as Nvidia are too committed

to India We can extend your priority allocation. We can give you engineering support everything but somebody has to take a step forward of not only putting your data centers and power and

everything but you also need to put in chips and we will give you everything. And uh from there to now today we are running almost 10,000 chips u you know as I said majority of the models which

you are hearing uh sovereign models getting launched in India uh you know they have been trained on our GPUs. uh but the real thing I would say will start now. Uh many of these models are

great. You must have heard server model are beating you know Gemini and uh uh chat GPT you know on on many of the benchmarks and they are making them absolutely for India use cases like OCR

you know the handwritten notes and all the things how do you get converted all the stuff so these are real India purpose-built use cases and models when they start scaling when they start

getting adopted by masses we have seen one UPI changed our lives imagine we have UPI in 50 different sectors in the country and 50 UPI movements will come into India at that time the number of

GPUs required will be millions. Today we are happy as a country we have x thousand of GPUs but if you as a single company like us SpaceX or like a meta can have 1 million GPUs India as a

country require multiple million GPUs. So while we are working on the all the upper layer of stacks and Indians are very good at that models, data sets, applications, we need to solve this

infrastructure problems. We are taking care of railways and roadways and airports. We also need to create this digital infrastructure. We take care of that. Make it available abundantly to

every startup, every uh you know I would say academic community. We make it available at a very low price. Government India AI mission is doing a humans role. On one side they have asked

people like us incentivized us to invest into the GPUs but they are taking GPUs from us putting their own money putting their own subsidy and then giving it to servers and IITs and sockets of the

world and they saying now you make you don't have to bother about money just go and make India's specific model and result is to seen in 2 years India has come a long way and we have a long way

to go compute problem has to be solved &gt;&gt; great thank you thank you Sunil uh uh same question to you KK uh you know uh what is the one thing you feel can add the edge right the whole

&gt;&gt; see when you look at sovereign and I think um uh minister of electronics and it van g he was mentioning the hi talking the five layers layer stack right and

that's where if you what sunil mentioned is for a easier way I say I use the word infrastructure which can combine energy G or the ping power uh cooling the whole stack. So that's that's providing that

layer and then you explain the whole model piece. I think as you train and when you start to deploy at scale couple of things are becoming very interesting. So you need to start to also build a

data stack. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; Data platforms. &gt;&gt; Vector DBs, edge vector. I I personally think you can do as much centralization

the way the data consumption model is going is going to highly get distributed going to go down into the edge. Correct. So you need a very different kind of inferencing and those capabilities. So

you need a data layer &gt;&gt; something which uh which we are doing is very interesting outside of Oracle and IBM uh the only other company which has all

the patents for databases is because we acquired. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So act is owns the original patent of ingress &gt;&gt; and every derivative today whether it is

postgress or every one of them is basically an ingress query processor derivative including SQL server and others &gt;&gt; like that we also acquired a asset from

uh CWI &gt;&gt; in uh Netherlands. So we have a vector DB the original vector engine. So we've been building a lot of those asset portfolio edg releasing a in April we're

going to release a localized vector AI engine which again can run on &gt;&gt; because as the AI PCs become more and more edge becomes more and more. So

building that and building the data disciplines I think that's a very important layer. A lot of times what happens is we worry about infrastructure and then we think about model and then

app the data platform is going to become very important because enterprise will only scale if you get your data centric approach data products data contracts

data catalogs and those kind of things because all the finally the AI use cases going to be built around how good quality your data is. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Great point. I think uh

compute data data stack for the country I think very important. Let me come to Bruno uh again the same question right if if India have to build a certain AI for the country uh and global south

what's the top one thing you will say which will you know help the whole cause &gt;&gt; yeah so uh it's interesting uh MIT last last year ran a a big report uh and they they said that 95% of uh uh uh AI pilots

actually never made it to real production. Right? So in my point of view, this is never really a tech problem. It it's it's really a production problem. Right? So uh in my

point of view, uh actually like when I look at uh our solution, right? Like we are able to deploy over a thousand sol uh companies in only eight weeks, right? So uh when I look at that, there's uh

really it comes down to three reasons why uh this is happening in the industry, right? The first one is uh what I call ROI invisibility, right? So when you look at companies right now,

it's it's really easy to get uh budget for a pilot, &gt;&gt; right? So but when it comes to the reality is uh can they get a a budget to get the project done, right? So uh the

data that I have to share with you guys uh the which is astonishing is uh a third of CFOs really nowadays can you can they cannot quantify uh AI ROI inside of the organizations

right and uh only one out of 10 can actually have tools that can actually measure ROI right so what what that ended up happening is uh whenever you talk to those organizations right uh

companies uh and you ask like how are you actually going to measure productivity gains or how you going to uh like they don't have the answer right like so ends up like uh

what's the baseline it like they don't have the answer right so whenever you bring to like the CFO uh to get that project approval ends up on the project never getting approved and ends up on

that cycle of like uh uh it ends up getting stuck into a pilot right so when you when you look at uh what you Number two is like I think it's data and uh trust and compliance friction right I

think there's a huge red tape in terms of what happens inside of organizations right uh uh I think that it's very departmentalized where like each part of the uh organization is trying to solve

for each part of the department right so when I look at uh uh it is trying to solve for it uh procurement is trying to solve proc for procurement So uh because no one's really trying to solve as as an

organization like uh the project kind of ends up stalling right so something that can essentially take [snorts] six uh like a few months to resolve ends up ends up taking you know 6 months to a

year right and like uh I say in sales like time kills every deal right so uh last but not least right I think my my third point is uh is the champion problem right like uh uh I think there a

severe issue with like uh within organizations nowadays is uh there's really no uh executive sponsorship and then whenever you don't have ex sponsorship especially for AI

opportunities right uh deals never get approved then uh people especially at the bottom uh bottom tier they don't understand uh what's going on and when there's no clear alignment within uh the

uh middle tier management deals never really progress. &gt;&gt; Great. I I I think I think let me summarize probably uh the three points that you know you need a cross

collaborated teams right with a single point of view with executive sponsorship. I think I think that will solve uh the adoption piece at least at last right uh let me come to you uh

professor uh Gdesh right Gdesh I think what we are discussing uh is the we've discussed a lot on AI for last five days for India for globe uh you know uh and then we had three point of views I asked

them give me one top thing you heard probably from Renault and KK and then [snorts] from uh you know Sony loss compute what is that your top one take which India should do so that we can

lead the summon race for the country and the globe. &gt;&gt; Um I would suggest interoperability at every layer. I I think it is all also alluded to by earlier panelists.

Interoperability encourages participation and in the words of our PSA uh if you're there in our Bahin session he said meaningful participation right um

interoperability also helps you present alternatives because there's no one size fits all and you need to also ensure that um in the trade-off between fidelity

right and uh latency or between sensitivity and specificity, you're able to find that right sweet spot which is suitable for you. You can pick something that is appropriate. Um just on a

lighter note, I was walking from I mean I was driving from the PSA office and there was such traffic jam which most of you experience. So I exercised my sovereigntity and I started walking. So

you you find alternatives when you think sovereign [laughter] right 3 km that's why I was late. So, so there are alternatives and and that also provisions for human participation much

better. There could be places where AI could be substitutional but many other places where you may want it to be just supplementary or complimentary. So, alternatives uh is another thing that

interoperability provides for. Um and I think the very key is scale out. I mean &gt;&gt; we are I mean if if by just by scaling up we could cater to everyone

great I would say that at least matches one checkbox which is people being catered to right but even we are not there scaling up is not going to cater right uh the capabilities and they're

there but even if it were hypothetically I think participation would also ensure that people are part of the process it's informed I mean Bharaj and one I I take pride in one of our consortium members

at IM Indor. a consortium of nine academic institutions and Indian Institute of Management what are they doing right they do a fabulous job in going to many of the second tier cities

going to people who have data and and engage in conversations education right that data is an asset and you could actually transform that asset into IP generation and not just source data so

that dialogue right uh and and informed decision making is where participation is encouraged when you have interoperability &gt;&gt; I just want to add That's what he said.

He made a very interesting point. How do you monetize data? Right? And and this is something which needs a very different approach because today what happens is you are sourcing

data and I think PM yesterday made a very amazing statement. Correct. He's saying data. Correct. Very very interesting.

&gt;&gt; Yes. But if you look at what he's saying is the creator of the data, the producer of the data, the consent provider of for the use all have a role to play and that's where

I've been using this word called data product or a data catalog. So you need to catalog first. They need to build a data product and then set up a data contract which is which which is which

is the fundamental for interoperability. I just wanted to because if that gets solved &gt;&gt; absolutely &gt;&gt; I can choose my own personal data and

say my data catalog you can have five things to access. &gt;&gt; I think India has proven amazing way of identity payments. So I think we can actually set up an environment where you

can really build this &gt;&gt; yeah and the data benefactor is also the same person right. So, so great point uh professor. I think uh interoperatively means uh definitely you know removing

the you know the or optimizing the various layers and taking it to the last uh you know person in the rank right uh and it will help scale to the 1.4 4 billion what we need right I think thank

you for that let me let me ask you again a second question right I think uh this is a very very direct question right I think as as country I think we are building our foundation models you are

one of the uh you know uh person who is building foundation model of the country and you have and as at large we have built sub 500 billion parameter model and globally we are going to 5 trillion

right or plus uh the the the comparison is so huge right uh what what do you think India's moat can be when we are really you know in such a position where we are at a disadvantage though uh we

have to aggressively you know handle that yeah so the other important takeaway which probably you know addresses some part of what you're saying what you're asking is cooperation

right collaboration and collaboration honestly is not just a transactional uh process it's it it begins here right the the will to understand the other side u just published a book uh you know

informatics and AI for healthcare. This is with my colleague Jada and what we did in the entire book was I I try to I mean I empathize with all the the entire life cycle of a healthcare

practitioner and we tried to map every ML example informatic example parsing to healthcare right and and vice versa there was reciprocation from the other side as well. It was very very

interesting exercise. I think that's how core design also happened. So collaboration is actually to do innovation and again uh China has shown in many ways right in in in contrast to

the US ecosystem that code design can lead to very innovative ideas. U I and code design often is even lacking at the level of algorithms and in architecture. Right. right there new algorithms can

come up but all the way to application layers. So collaboration also comes by creating ecosystem where people can participate. Since you alluded again to Bharajin, we

have a consortium of nine academic institutions and the whole collaboration is through a section 8 company a not for-profit company which engages with for-profit entities but also with the

academic institutions. the um 60 full-time employees work with 100 plus researchers you know master student it's been a very profound exercise in a very short span of time I mean we may say we

are late now since you brought up also the the landscape outside which is 1 trillion plus parameters and that's also our northstar at least from the India mission that is the uh our goal to get

to at least 1 trillion parameters but even the 17 billion parameter model that we have released is there's a lot of research due diligence that has gone into the architecture choice and

actually we're very proud of whatever model we release because um making ensuring that you know if you have two shared experts one of them is actually catering to languages and mixed code the

other is catering to domain due diligence that was actually done based on Indian context right the fact that we covered 22 languages in in our speech model like the the

texttospech model again all of that is raised we explicitly captured the common phonetic vocabulary of Indian languages and that's only possible through this process of empathy. I mean a linguist

has to empathize with the computer scientist and vice versa. Um if you do that we can actually create magic. Believe me you can create magic. We just have to break our silos and the biggest

silos sitting here. Uh [laughter] I mean in fact an endorsement to this was when we actually built our LLM enabled speechtoext model. We had a projector layer which actually projected from

speech to text and we used a mixture of experts right for the projection it was VERY INTERESTING THE EXPERT FOR HINDI and Maratti performed very similarly I mean there was the same expert expert

got shared whereas for Telugu there was collaboration between Hindi and Tamil experts so data um domain knowledge all of them actually are uh you know reinforcing each other

so this is actually a time where we and break the language barrier. In my interaction with the honorable PM uh on 8th Jan, I gifted him a book from our consortium called Sanway. Sanway stands

for you know uh bringing all languages together and he said we we need to use AI also to show the strength of India. It's not just AI for India but AI by India.

&gt;&gt; Great. Great. I I I I think uh uh the point of collaboration right and and and you know uh the story what we all have heard right uh single stick versus a bunch of sticks right I think uh is very

true and and and that's what is a you know mode for India collaboration building that you know uh collaborative effort between different universities bring bringing nine different unities

together to work right and and and uh it's a gigantic work right and the mesh what you've created is amazing right &gt;&gt; also we very happy that 3 days back We also announced an MOU with our heritage

foundation sitting in the US. We've got a lot of support from people in the Bay Area. So once you open up for collaboration, you'll find there's support from around the world, right?

Votam. &gt;&gt; Great, great, great. Thank you. Thank you, professor Ganesh. So let me come to Sunil Leu, right? I think uh we all agree that you know uh compute is one of

the biggest player and pillar, right? Uh and then government is doing their bit, right? I think I think they're doing their bit. uh but again I think uh in terms of compute for the country for

stability can it be a shared commodity can it be you know uh some community which uh different uh you know factors of the country or probably ecosystem come together and build right how to

solve that problem because as you rightly said uh few thousands versus few lakhs right that that's something yeah very high &gt;&gt; so I would

I would say that is the framework which India AI mission has adopted. See uh again coming back then two years back when government was thinking about how to go about solving this problem.

Hello hello can you hear me? Okay. &gt;&gt; So government had got three pass options available with them. One is government

intervenes. I will build the data center myself. I will procure GPUs and I will basically serve the rest of the country completely. It's a UPI model, right? UPI is completely completely supported by

government owns infrastructure, right? Second model was American model. Leave it to private sector. Leave it to capitalist economy. Private sector forces will make the supply and demand

match. People will invest, people will consume. Government should only act as regulator. What government did was adopt they adopted the middle path where government said we are not good at that

this is technology this is complex it requires service mindset it required lots of tools let private sector invest into this and not one or two they said we'll have tens of people right tens of

people can invest into this what you're talking about shared compute facility government will obviously act as a gatekeeper that you should have good quality you should put the right price

for is you invest into these services government but at the same time made sure that if we are investing millions of dollars government assured us that they will take up these GPUs on cloud

from us at a defined price so that our business models become feasible because I also have to raise money from a bank or from a private equity and then government said I will take it I will

take it to IITs I will take it to startups and we will give this GPUs to them that you don't bother about compute you get into what you are supposed to do which is actually building India's

sovereign models. So this model is so democratic and what government also did that's why I always keep on saying this India mission thought and framework should be we can export the thought

itself to 40 countries not the not just the you know what we have done but the thought itself is very innovative because number one they said you all come and panel with us at a right price

point right quality and you declare how much GPUs you can give they were not forcing us they said okay you decide how much you want to give we all got empanled we contrib distributors GPUs

which were made available to startups. Then government said every quarter we will come and we'll encourage new and new providers to come up with the facility and even existing players can

also top up their capacities and every next time because the market forces when the quantity start increasing supply start increasing the pricing also will start reducing government say okay if

new player comes they can reduce the price existing player will have to match and they keep on empaneling more and more capacity and that is something which has resulted into that 38,000 GPUs

which government is talking about the shared computer facility which is nothing but a uh you can say combination of the compute capacity created by multiple providers like us and now

yesterday prime minister announced that 20,000 more are being added to this facility. So I would say both as a concept this is proven that last 18 months is doable and both as a

technology right while technically it's possible that the same model can get trained like and GG I'm sure can can talk very authoritatively on this subject technically also you can train

on multiple different clusters of course inferencing you can do in multiple different places but even if you don't do that you are actually what government did very democratically okay IIIT we

will put you into this service provider okay serum we will put into this service provider provider. Okay, GAN we'll put you into this provider. So government is democratically making sure that they are

encouraging industry to invest into this creating this capability which is required and we because we are getting business we are scaling up now we are investing more and more now and then

they are making it available to people because India needs its own models we may use frontier models for certain purposes but as minister was saying that 95% of the use cases of the country can

very well be done by a 20 billion to 100 billion parameter model right of course Ganesh is carrying a mandate to created trillion parameter model also and which country required as much sovereign we

can for all those things why anybody else can do right their success bajan success and serum success is proven that India can do it right so I would say that shared compute uh framework which

has been done it is proven we just need to scale it up and my request to government which I think they're doing is don't limit it only for training of models because models training is one

step done now these These models will be going to masters for adoption and you'll require millions of GPUs. I think I'm repeating myself but that is where government need to fund the first cycle

of inferencing on these models when users start adopting let's say agriculture use case or a healthcare use case or a education use case or whichever use case which come multiple

UPI equivalent use case will come up it will take time for users to start adopting it start accepting it making it a part of their lives at that time probably user will be happy to pay 10

pesa per transaction or maybe a 50 rupees per month subscription for that time these models and use cases will become self-sufficient to generate revenue also then they will need

government support but at least for I would say first cycle of inferencing maybe one year or two years government not only support the funding of the training of the models but also they

support the first phase of inferencing on these models so that adoption happens revenue models emerge and after that government can say okay let private sector invest and government will come

back to their original role of regulator Great sol I I I think I think uh probably let me augment and and put few more thoughts right. So uh &gt;&gt; the India mission has really created the

single fire right and this fire is going to every state in the country. Yes. &gt;&gt; All 28 states all eight union territories they building &gt;&gt; AI COE's and the mandate for each CO is

to give compute right. I I I think that's like in small wildfire it will spread all across the country. It will be phenomenal but again I think at the same time we have to keep up the pace

right I think one thing is pace &gt;&gt; absolutely Ankit just and this is something which I know two years back when we said that I'm putting 8,000 GPUs everybody started laughing because we

were starting with the base when India was not having any GPUs right today we comfortably say okay India will be going to 50 60,000 GPUs but even today I can tell you India require millions of GPUs

in US just three or four deep tech companies are collectively owning millions billions of GPUs. India has got 1.4 4 billion people out of which 1 billion people are carrying smartphones

creating consuming content every single minute and as Ganesh G will talk about they all are creating voice- based AI because India's AI will be voice- based people talking in their own native

language or a mixture of Hindi English everything and they'll be comfortable doing that instead of writing in their native language or screen which is not so easy when you're doing that and

actually innovations are being done that even from feature phone or regular telephone line not using smartphones you will be able to talk to a a model at the back Right? When you are basically

talking about 1.4 billion people coming in the AI fold for multiple use cases, just imagine what type of number of GPUs will be requiring for inferencing and how many GPUs will be caring for

training multiple models for secting all these things. So you're right Ankit what we have done in last two years is kudos to the whole ecosystem to government and everybody all of us but we need to keep

on building for next 7 8 10 years sorry just to give one or two more data points India is creating and consuming 20% of world's data 1 of the world's data is created and consumed by India only 3% of

that data is hosted in India today that shows the upscope of the infrastructure both at a physical data center level and also in terms of the computers GPU level India need to build because we don't

want any single country or any single company start dictating our digital destiny. We need to be as much sovereign as possible. Correct. Thank you Sun. Thank you Kalian. Let me come to you. Uh

so Kalyan I think uh I think one big base for the sovereignty is the skill set the capability to research develop deploy right uh and and do all of that responsibly. Right. I I I think uh

being you know one of the uh companies who have done that right in the last 2 three years what will be your nuggets right I think uh how how other companies other other players in the country other

countries can do that right so if you look at see if you what is India known for India is known for capability historically NASCOM right but that capability is was

historically and for a majority and most of the business capability for hire. You basically are building capability to build things for others and that's been the core business. We've

now become pretty much if you really look at if some other country thinks sovereignty pretty 50% of their global tech engineering services development operations talent is sitting out of

India you see those &gt;&gt; GCC so &gt;&gt; but where is the pivot the pivot is I think was uh professor was talking about is you have to pivot towards build we

are always been more towards service so building research development ment build your own IP and how do you make India for the world and I think it's very important I think that's what our

journey has been so what we did is in 2015 16 because we have one advantage we are a single majority shareholder run company Mr. Another had a very ambitious vision. He said we building products for

others. You should start building for yourself. It's a 2015. It's a very conscious strategy and he realized if you want to play in the global market, you need to have access to

market permission and market access because people would only buy if you if you are a software product company. So that whole idea of going acquiring intellectual property

&gt;&gt; because if you really start to see the underlying of these pieces &gt;&gt; you could build on open source and other stuff but suddenly what's happening is some of these open source companies are

getting acquired and suddenly it's becoming closed sourced &gt;&gt; right this is becoming a very interesting plan and then there are and suddenly some of them are getting

classified as dual use suddenly they'll say oh this is dual use tech so I can only release this so what we seeing from a skill standpoint &gt;&gt; you need lesser smarter people so I'm

making a very controversial statement &gt;&gt; you need less SER people, smarter people. You need engineers more than coders. See what's happening is that we're building coders. You need

engineers, people who think, systems thinking. You need people who are research bent. I meet students and I ask MBA students, what did you do? I did engineering. I

said, why the hell did you waste four years of your life if you wanted to go and do an MBA? &gt;&gt; The things like why are you not doing deeper? Why don't you specialize in a

domain? But those are things like even fundamental things I would say the big leap is going to be I think India can solve something very interestingly and as he's referring to the PSA quantum

because I think the kind of compute needs you have and looking at energy GPUs you could completely change the computational paradigm so there so hence but that needs fundamental science

research physics like no one wants to study physics like if you go back 20 years back in this country everyone wanted to go and do coding so those are the fundamental skills so what we doing

in a very small way we acquiring we are building talent and research pools. So 50% of HCL software product business is in India engineering. &gt;&gt; But my second largest engineering center

is in Rome. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Third is in Israel. Then I'm in Perth, Austin, uh Chemsford outside of Boston. Why? Because like if if global companies

can come to India and acquire talent to build and research and and then build that IP and take it to us, I'm doing the reverse. So AppScan which is a code security product.

&gt;&gt; The security huristics is built in Israel. The SAS UX is built in Boston but the core engineering is in Bangalore but the IP is registered in India. So which is where we are moving a very

different way. We are now tapping global talent to build for us. So we still a billion and a half. We are not big but we've got 130 countries. So we we are a step in the change. It's a long journey.

It needs to get away from short-term thinking. Hire people to get them build. I think you have to go to a very different model. So I think that's what we are starting within the larger scheme

of HCL but I think we're walking the right path. I think we are acquiring assets continuously and going and building that. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Great. So let me add probably you know

what what I'm seeing at the skill level right. I think uh uh the persona at least what DASCOM is focused on as a developer right uh and and and the way we code is changing. So NASCOM has done

con concentrated effort to help developers learn the new way of coding rightefine the whole SDLC uh as as as a target what I have taken my team has taken we have taken a target of uh

enabling 150k developers across the country next 6 months make them AI enabled AI ready help them change the whole you know uh or unlearn and learn the new way I think that's what is one

thing right but parally I think uh which which I should uh make everyone aware I think there will be announcement sometime soon but with with the mighty and you know the education ministry we

are rewriting the whole uh you know technical BTE uh MTech MCA BCA curriculum right I I I think we are writing more specialization as rightly said because we need specialist we don't

need journalist as an engineer he studies 48 subjects in in four years at the end what is he specialized on it is his luck right the group he gets the project he takes somehow some job he

gets right so so I think that's what we we are changing soon there will be announcements happening Uh but again I think that's what is happening at the background. Uh coming back to Beno

Beno uh you you have a product which is so simple uh anyone can use it and build agents through that right and and get uh you know benefited from that. Uh let me ask you this. I think the one big piece

of AI uh to really be mature and and impact is adoption right and you started with the 95% project uh fail or probably don't go to production right so if we have to really do adoption at scale what

are the top issues you see right and and and how uh do you suggest you know uh the companies or folks here can take some pointers to mitigate it in their life function

Yeah. Uh so I'll give you three and one is very specific to India actually. So uh so and those are relatable to our solution but I think uh those are real use cases because uh the proof is like I

said the proof is on the pudding right uh one is like you got to solve a real use case something that is actually changing in uh people's life. Uh so uh AI is complex and AI uh people still

like trying to figure out AI. So uh it needs to be something that uh is into people's everyday's life. Uh so in our case for example uh if let's let's go back uh so if you look at cursor or

lovable right uh they changed the life of uh uh you know vibe coding right uh software engineers in our situation here uh Genspark uh we we looked at people that were producing uh office work right

so people looking at uh producing uh uh Excel PowerPoint and essentially just like any mechanical work on on the everyday office work, right? Because if you think about every time you a office

task, all of that office work is very mechanical, right? And that's why we realize all this massive growth in our solution, right? So to your point I I think uh uh the adoption comes from like

something that is uh something that can change people's life and something in a very simplistic way right uh I think the second uh the second thing should be consolidation of tools right I think

from the time that we wake up in the morning I think most of us pick up our phones and we have we inundated by messages and apps and then we go to our office work and And uh we have probably

100 tools that we have to touch. You know actually we we looked at you know through our our research at work you know where people waste in average 2 and 1/2 hours a day right just uh you know

flipping between different solutions right uh so uh and that causes context uh loss of context right so uh if there's a way you can consolidate tools right uh that also drives adoption right

uh so I think the third one is especially in India is the fact that there's a lot of different languages in this country which you brought up right so I think uh in in this country

especially LLM I think really struggle uh with uh be able to drive uh the right language especially with all the different dialects that this country have. So be able to really naturalize uh

and be able to bring the sovereignty here uh I think is very important. And I think last but not least, right, people are very scared about data, right? And and how the data that data once they

bring data into AI, how is that data going to be treated, right? So I think the solution is to bring that that sense of security how that data is going to be managed.

&gt;&gt; Great. Thank you, Beno. Uh I I think with the last segment uh last question in 30 seconds each, right? Again, uh starting with uh probably starting with Beno since you have the mic, right? uh

you know uh so so AI is not a short game it's a game for next 5 years 10 years decades probably uh so century right uh you know uh what what what is uh the challenge with as a humanity we have to

mitigate you feel that you know we don't uh you know align with something which is hazardous to us uh yeah &gt;&gt; 30 seconds &gt;&gt; so

I I think it's uh you Actually, I was having breakfast the other day and actually the person I was serving asked me the exactly same question. I and I think that it's how human beings

interact with AI. &gt;&gt; I I think we're still trying to figure out how to properly interact with AI and and I and I think that uh the speed of AI is evolving. Uh I think we're still

uncertain how to manage that. I think the line on the sand moves moves so fast that we can we can't really catch up to that, right? and uh the interaction of AI and us uh no one really knows how to

do it yet. So, so, so I'll map the earlier part in this part, you know, uh a very specific use of AI for self to you know uh make uh you know uh your life simpler will adopt AI at scale and

and we have to build that certain you know that processes to interact with AI in the long run because AI is changing things are changing. Thank you Beno. Coming back to you uh uh professor

Ganesh right uh same question 30 seconds what's the challenge you see if we make uh something you know not aligned um I think the big biggest challenge in not

making AI aligned is that we will become products not even consumers right um we still want to be in the steering wheel I remember my very fondly my first uh machine translation paper I called it uh

you know machine assisted human translation obviously I can't I that will sound too regressive but the key is provenence right I mean how can you leave provenence at every step in the

stack whether it's data aggregation which is again aligned with ecosystem I mean you need an ecosystem to leave provenence on the data part whether it's metadata refinement data curation

provenence at the level of trading tokenization provenence at the observability is other keyword right at the level of the way the model performs. Models are glass boxes because that

gives you enough breathing space. Where do you &gt;&gt; where where should you actually eve your practices versus existing practices? So I think if you don't view if you don't

have that view the recipes if they're not made available if the education isn't there I mean as a prof I always focus on the education part I think we'll become products.

&gt;&gt; Great. Thank you. Thank you. uh Gadesh uh Sunil Leu and then Kalyan. &gt;&gt; No, I think I I conquer with the views that at the end of the day we should not do AI for the sake of doing AI. It is a

means to achieve end purpose and the end purpose is benefit for the masses. I remember I think I was seeing on a YouTube video when Prime Minister S met all the startups and professor Ganesh

was there and I think Prime Minister S said to everybody don't create toys don't use make AI to make toys &gt;&gt; right and uh use AI which benefits the masses in their real problem which they

face in their lives. So that is something that that is where the name of this event also has come as the impact summit &gt;&gt; right that and I think yesterday also

used one word that unlike the previous summit where we are too much concerned about security governance which are things to be done but at the same time AI

so how we sort of uh create a impact we benefit the masses and also machine should not end up dictating our lives As I again I would say okay we should not end up becoming product itself. Uh as

much AI makes improvements. It possibly will never reach a stage where it start acquiring humans emotions. It start acquiring our sense of gut. It start acquiring our sense of

culture. It start acquiring our what we speak our body language not just with our words. So I think human in the loop and human remaining the master of AI is something we'll have to guard against

all the time. Yeah. Yeah, interaction uh don't become product have uh humanentric development. Kalyan, &gt;&gt; I would say break this into four key areas. Uh professor mentioned I think

the consumer AI. So I would I'm going to break into consumer, enterprise, government and critical national infrastructure defense. So let's the reasons all fours are going to play in

just like 10 seconds. Consumer AI you are the product. Unfortunately, &gt;&gt; you now have to use data control to decide how much of what you give to get. It's a give to get mode

currently in the consumer AI &gt;&gt; because the day you click I agree on an Android phone on an Apple intelligence suddenly you are the product and you're getting something back. But the gift to

get balance and that's where the role of the regulator in my opinion has a far more play than in the enterprise. regulation enterprise [clears throat] god made world in 7 days

because he had no installed base [laughter] enterprise CIOS you go and talk to CIOS on the ground their reality is that they've got a big problem architectural problem the their data

landscape is broken so they have to pivot from process workflow to data first big shift so they need to start about lineage metadata most of these companies don't have metadata create

metadata discovery use techniques like knowledge graph to understand your metadata and then you organize your data for so that AI can be benefited. I think the big plays in govk government citizen

engagement G2C massive but that's where I think that sovereign AI play comes in where the work which serum is doing or or the whole baraj important because that's

where you can host citizen services platforms and the last is for critical national infrastructure air gap networks private AI and defense so I think we need to also have a very broken up view

of this whole thing rather than trying to have one brush to paint all of them but I think asked is sovereignity is all about choice &gt;&gt; making choice like he walked here it's a

great choice I can run on hyperscaler a b I can run on yota I can run on cifi I can run on any other or I can run on my own infrastructure then I need to have choice of it's all about choice and

second is please AI exists for human good so put the people back into the center human because we suddenly have made human someone in the side and everything is about AI it's about people

using AI surrounding them so that's part of my thought was &gt;&gt; great thank you Ken I I I think we have had a lot of good nuggets from everyone right I think we'll continue this

conversation after this uh as a part of NASCOM I think s AI is a big initiative for us I think we have been uh driving it since last three three and a half years GDH knows that sunil knows that

right uh services companies we have worked enough with them right to keep it on I think it's not a you know end point we have to think about the sovereignity and we have to think about how India

India builds it you know uh Asia capability quantum a capability I I I I think that's the journey we are on as NASCOM right I I think we are writing you know uh a current uh policy you know

document for government uh you know uh on on sai and AGI road map uh and and I think the QR code is there the QR code will be here and and I I I I want all of you to have a look it's a daft one

please please work on it right I think uh that's that yeah Ganesh &gt;&gt; I mean the potential is so immense we have not even scratch the surface, not even the tip of the iceberg we have

touched. Sovereignty is critical because the the amount of inefficiency in that entire stack needs to be done away with. GPUs were never designed for building these models, right? It's legacy and how

can we use even the large work we doing workload to actually do better design. How can we use it to have better model serving engines? So there's so much to do. I think everyone should get

inusitive about the entire stack. That's where sovereignity comes. &gt;&gt; Correct. Absolutely. Absolutely. I I think we we are trying to do that uh in a collaborative way with you know all

our you know contributors. Please be a collaborator. Uh we will have a you know QR code and get repo. Please respond to that. Give your inputs and and with that uh thank you to my panelist. Uh I I

loved it. Uh and I think hope you also loved it. &gt;&gt; Thank you again. Thanks. Hey, [cheering] just one thing I want to just say watch on 21st the PM is inaugurating a new JV

which HCL has is announcing with Foxcon. Uh it's called India Chips Limited. Uh it's I would call it a patient capital. It's about 16 and 32 nanometer fab which are creating basically it's like a OSAT

unit. It's it's going to come out after 5 years. It's a long you build the whole thing but also building that skill correct is a big important thing &gt;&gt; and we have to start now. We cannot wait

for 5 years down the line. Right. So &gt;&gt; skill set building for that is another thing. So &gt;&gt; sure. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Thank you so much to our panelists. I request the I request the panelist just please stay back for a group photo uh right now. You can also access the report uh that

Ankita has been talking about in the QR code uh displayed on the digital background uh before um and leave feedback. Um I'm also happy to announce um thank you

thank you to our panelists. I'm also happy to announce uh an MOU uh being signed uh with Amitita Vishwa Vidum and NASCOM uh right now. Um,
