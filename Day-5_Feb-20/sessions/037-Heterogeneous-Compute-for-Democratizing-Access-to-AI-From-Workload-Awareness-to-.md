## 📝 Summary

This practitioner-led session will discuss how to address critical challenge of making AI economically viable and globally accessible by moving beyond the "GPU-only" paradigm to strategic, workload-aware compute architectures. Featuring technology leaders alongside government stakeholders, panel will demonstrate how matching AI workloads to the right hardware mix—CPUs, NPUs, TPUs, and GPUs—can reduce costs while maintaining performance i.e., maximize RoI. The discussion focuses on practical deployment strategies, from edge-cloud orchestration to real-world placement decisions.
