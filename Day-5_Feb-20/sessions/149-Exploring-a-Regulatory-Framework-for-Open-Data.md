## 📝 Transcript

and Mr. Arun Prabhu partner and co-head digital and TMT practice Sil Amachan Mangaladas we also have the distinguished presence of Miss Asha Jadeja Motwani founder of the Motwani

Jadeja Foundation so before we begin um I intend to invite Dr. Dr. Shashit Taru to deliver a keynote address. But given the extraordinary significance of the discussion today we are having, I

quickly created a scenario where uh this global AI summit is expected to be attended by many individuals and many have attended. I have created a scenario where I transport you back to the prime

minister's office in the United Kingdom. Imagine Jim Hacker, PM of UK, uh Sir Applebee, the cabinet secretary of UK, as well as Bernard Hulie, the principal private secretary are here to attend

this. So, I'm going to create a scenario for 3 minutes. Bear with me. So, uh Hacker, the prime minister says, Humphrey, I've decided this is the most important session at the entire global

AI summit. And Humphrey says, Prime Minister, with respect, there are panels on frontier AI, sovereign computing, and semiconductor strategy, hacker. Exactly. All terribly glamorous but this one is

about open data. The plumbing without it the rest is just PowerPoint. Bernard. Yes, Prime Minister. They are discussing whether India should move from voluntary open data initiatives to a statuto

regulatory framework that actually requires government bodies to share standardized aggregated data sets. Sir Humphrey says requires hacker. Yes. with safeguards, incentives, accountability,

coordination between ministries, even defined economic models for access, free, paid and restricted tiers. Sir Humphrey replies, "Prime Minister, the beauty of open data policies is that

they are aspirational. Once you introduce statuto mandates, you risk consistency." Heck, hacker, that's the point. They're arguing that without a legal backbone, participation is uneven.

Some department share, others don't. No uniform standards, no enforcement. Investors get nervous. All developers complained about unreliable data sets, Bernard. And apparently high quality

public data improves evidence-based policym, targeted welfare delivery, and even capital formation. Humphrey replies, "Yes, Bernard, but also improves scrutiny." Hacker Humphrey,

they're not just talking about dumping spreadsheets online. They're debating architecture, secure envi environments, anonymization protocols, synthetic data, interoperability standards and burn and

ensuring privacy and copyright protections don't clash with open data objectives. Sir Humphrey says, "Prime Minister, when privacy, innovation, geopolitics, and economic growth are all

mentioned in the same regulatory framework, one usually convene a task force to study it indefinitely." Hacker replies, "But that's precisely what they are avoiding. They're asking the real

question. Should there be regulatory teeth so that government data sharing isn't optional goodwill but institutional obligation? Hacker replies, they're also discussing

geopolitical standards and safeguards, access restrictions. In other words, minister structured openness rather than chaotic transparency. And Humphrey replies, structured openness is merely

closeness with better branding. Hacker Humphrey, if AI is the future, the data is it raw material. And if government holds the richest data sets, then refusing to regulate sharing properly is

like building a digital economy and locking the warehouse. And hacker replies, Humphrey, that's why this is the most important panel. Everyone is discussing what AI can do. They are

discussing what governments can do. I want to stop here and invite my dear friend and mentor Dr. Shashit Tarud to deliver the keynote address. [applause] Thank you. That was delightful. Raj, I'm

I was terrified for a minute that you were going to get me to place Humphrey or something. [laughter] But uh this is this is a a pleasure to join you all this evening at the India

AI impact summit 2026 and to share a few reflections on the subject that Raj has so cleverly animated for all of you. Uh exploring a regulatory framework for open data. When artificial intelligence

is no longer a distant frontier of innovation, it is rapidly becoming the operating system of our modern society. What was once theoretical is now embedded in our markets, our governance

systems, and increasingly our personal choices. A nation's digital footprint, a sort of triad of three C's, commerce, communication, and cognition, is now its primary source of wealth. We're often

told almost as an article of faith that data is the new oil. Yet, as Chris Miller reminds us in his compelling account in Chip, the real constraint of the AI age is not the volume of data,

but the power to process it. That single sentence punctures a convenient myth. It is, excuse me, it tells us that abundance alone does not confer agency and that openness without capacity can

entrench inequality as easily as it can enable progress. The decisive question therefore is not how much data exists, but who controls its use, who extracts its value, and who is left behind. Seen

in this light, the regulation of open data is not a technical footnote. It is a question of power shaping sovereignty and surveillance, innovation and inclusion, freedom and fairness in our

digital age. It's a privilege to share this platform with such a distinguished and accomplished group of colleagues under the stewardship of my good friend Rajumar whose intellectual leadership

has shaped conversations on law and global governance. I'm honored of course to engage alongside Shiv Schroth Ashja Motwani Arun Prabhu Mama Vedu Shri Arena Goo and my parliamentary colleague

though in a different house suspra individuals whose expertise across law technology policy industry and democratic institutions has profoundly shaped the very debates we're having

today. To speak in the company of such authority is both an honor and a responsibility. And so how let me ask might we craft a regulatory framework for open data that is equal to the

ambitions we all have and the anxieties many of us are expressing about the AI age. So to begin with we must be clear about what we mean by open data. At its most

basic, it refers to data that is made accessible for use, reuse, and redistribution with minimal legal or technical barriers. Yet, in the context of the IIA, open data is far more than a

question of access. It's a statement of intent about how knowledge is shared, how power is distributed, and how societies choose to govern the informationational foundations of

innovation. When designed thoughtfully, open data becomes more than a technical tool. It becomes public infrastructure. It strengthens transparency in government, levels the playing field in

markets and creates genuine avenues for citizen participation. But when released without clarity, safeguards or purpose, as Bernard pointed out in uh in Raj's uh play, it

risks becoming little more than symbolic. a sort of symbolic nod to openness. It can turn into an unguarded channel through which value, agency, and even sovereign control quietly drift

elsewhere. We all know that open data can be genuinely transformative. We've seen how making government data publicly accessible can strengthen democratic

accountability. Whether it is citizens tracking public spending, researchers analyzing welfare delivery or civil society organizations flagging gaps in implementation, India's own open

government data platform has been used to track welfare coverage and expose leakages in implementation that might have otherwise remained invisible. But the value of open data extends beyond

transparency alone. When the United States chose to re to release meteorological data freely, they did more than increase transparency, they laid the groundwork for entire private

ecosystems in weather forecasting, logistics, insurance, and risk assessment. What began as public infrastructure became the foundation for commercial and technological growth. Its

importance becomes even clearer in times of crisis and during the COVID pandemic. openly shared health data and public dashboards, enabled faster responses, improved coordination across agencies,

and supported more informed public debate. So we take these examples, the lesson is consistent. When data is treated as shared infrastructure rather than as a guarded asset, it lowers

barriers, improves decision making and enables societies, particularly in the developed world, I'm sorry, in our developing world rather, to turn information into durable capacity.

And yet, my dear friends, openness alone is not a panacea. Open data poorly structured can generate new vulnerabilities even as it promises transparency.

Without safeguards, openness may devolve into tokenism, data sets released without context, quality control or enforcable standards or worse into asymmetrical extraction.

There is a trilmma of digital governance, digital ascendancy, digital capitulation and digital sovereignty. Today, most of the world's large cloud servers and advanced artificial

intelligence systems are owned and operated by a small number of technology companies based primarily in the United States and parts of Europe. This is digital ascendancy. This means that data

generated in developing countries, whether it's mobility data from ride sharing apps, digital payment transactions, agricultural statistics or health records, is often stored,

processed, and analyzed on infrastructure located abroad. When that data is then used to train AI systems, improve algorithms or develop commercial digital services, the

profits, patents and technological advantages tend to accumulate where the platforms are headquartered, not where the data is originally generated. Put simply, the location where data is

produced is not necessarily the location where value is created. This is where the question of data sovereignty arises. If countries do not invest in their own digital infrastructure and regulatory

capacity, the benefits of open data can acrue disproportionately outside their jurisdiction. One-sided concessions on digital taxation and digital trade are a form of data capitulation. Indonesia and

Malaysia have succumbed in their trade agreements with the US. We must not. This dynamic is increasingly playing out in real policy debates. It is visible in digital trade negotiations where

restrictions on data localization or limits on source code disclosure can narrow the policy space of developing economies seeking to nurture domestic digital industries. It is also evident

in the market concentration of hyperscaled cloud providers whose global dominance shapes where data is stored, processed and ultimately valorized. The issue is not crossber data flows per se.

digital cooperation depends on them. The concern is whether openness is reciprocal and capacity enhancing or whether it systematically positions some countries as suppliers of raw data while

others capture downstream gains in artificial intelligence, advanced analytics and platform governance. An instructive example, when the US sought to compel the divevestature of Tik Tok,

its demands included mandatory data localization, majority US ownership in the restructured entity, and US control over source codes. This is data sovereignty on steroids. And it's

exactly what the rest of us seem to be only able to aspire to. The answer therefore is not to retro from retreat from openness but to shape it deliberately. If openness without

strategy creates imbalance then openness with guardrails can create resilience. A credible regulatory framework for open data must begin with clarity of purpose. Why is this data being released? For

whom and under what safeguards? It must ensure strong anonymization and privacy protections so that transparency does not come at the cost of individual rights. Closely linked to this is the

principle of consent and control. Individuals and communities should have meaningful agency over how data derived from them is used, shared and repurposed, particularly when data sets

are combined, commercialized or deployed in AI systems. Consent must be informed, revocable where possible, and supported by accessible grievance mechanisms. The framework must also build accountability

into the system, clear standards for access, independent oversight, anonymization, and remedies when misuse occurs. And critically, openness must be tied to domestic capacity building. Data

sovereignty has little meaning without adequate capacity. Public data should not simply circulate globally. It should strengthen local research institutions, startups, digital infrastructure and

technological expertise. Domestic digital law should prevail over foreign commitments. At the same time, none of this implies that countries should isolate themselves

digitally. Crossber data flows are essential to research collaboration, to trade, to financial systems and technological innovation. Digital ecosystems simply do not function in

silos. However, enabling data to move across borders should not mean that countries give up the ability to regulate how that data serves their own development priorities. Interoperability

should facilitate cooperation, not erode policy space. This balance between openness and sovereignty is already reflected in recent multilateral commitments. The G20 New Delhi leaders

declaration in 2023 placed digital public infrastructure at the center of inclusive growth and emphasize data for development linking data governance with trust, security and domestic capacity

building. The message was clear. Data must support development not undermine regulatory accountability. Similarly, the global digital compact adopted by the United Nations calls for

safe and trustworthy data governance, stronger digital capacity in developing countries and international cooperation that respects national regulatory frameworks. Together, these signals

suggest that the emerging consensus is not about unrestricted flows or digital isolation, but about structured openness where innovation and cooperation coexist with sovereignty and institutional

strength. If we widen the lens, what emerges is not a contest between openness and sovereignty, but a conversation about how different regions are navigating

that balance. The European Union has demonstrated how strong regulatory architecture through instruments such as data protection and digital market rules can shape global standards. India by

contrast has shown how digital public infrastructure can scale inclusion at population level. India is putting innovation ahead of regulation. These are not competing models. They are

complimentary experiments in digital governance. And increasingly the global south is not merely observing this evolution. It is participating in it. India's experience with India stack

illustrates what this participation can look like by building interoperable layers digital identity through Aadhaar realtime payments through UPI document exchange through Digilocker. India has

created a a public digital backbone that supports innovation while remaining accessible and adaptable. Crucially, this architecture has been offered as a template for other developing countries

seeking scalable and affordable digital solutions. In doing so, India has reframed digital infrastructure not as proprietary leverage but as a developmental public good. Of course,

much remains to be done. Questions of data protection, enforcement, AI governance, cyber security, resilience, and equitable access require sustained attention. But the direction is clear.

India is not approaching the digital future as a passive market. It is shaping it as an architect. As conversations advance from G20 to the global digital compact and now through

initiatives such as this India AI impact summit, the emphasis is increasingly on responsible innovation, capacity building and inclusive growth. Our trade agreements must not promote digital

dependency or virtual vaselage. We must emerge as a digital sovereign empowered to protect our own giants and capture the wealth generated by our own data. Friends, the task before us is not to

choose between openness and control, but to design systems that honor both. If we succeed, open data will not be a source of vulnerability, but of empowerment. And in that journey, India alongside

partners such as the EU and our fellow countries of the global south has the opportunity not merely to catch up but to help define the rules of a fairer digital order rather than subject

ourselves or submit to subortant status under a new extractive digital Raj. Okay Raj, [laughter] thank you and [applause] All right.

Thank you Shashi for setting the tone for this. Um so we u as you can see um of course uh prime minister hacker and humphrey and others are sitting here and then after hearing this speech um

Humphrey is remarking prime minister if we start to believe what Shashit Tarud is saying we may end up in a situation where governments begin doing what they must rather than what they prefer. We

may be entering a new administrative era and prime minister replies hacker says good and humphrey replies terrifying and Bernard says prime minister shall we remain in this panel they are about to

discuss statutory mandates and Humphrey replies I do hope it's only exploratory with that word may I now invite uh our distinguished panelist miss rama may I request all our panelists to keep it for

3 to four minutes so that we can hopefully have another round. So, uh, Miss Vedeshi, you've had a long and distinguished career uh, pretty much designing these things and providing

leadership. So, my question to you is that when and how did the idea behind the national data sharing and accessibility policy and the open government data platform essentially

germinate? Take us through the journey and also the challenges that you face uh, through this. Sorry, I'm here. I I'm sorry, I didn't notice that. take us through the journey and help us

understand how the concept moved from its formative phase to a reality. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Uh thank you. Uh so actually this open data movement was it was a global movement in India actually it was former

colleagues of cabinet colleagues of Mr. Tur Mr. Capilibil and Mr. the Sachin pilot when they were in the ministry. It started then and then the national uh data sharing access policy I think

around 2012 and uh industry also contributed to that entire draft and that policy. At that point of time I think the entire focus was on opening up government data and maybe some

development data right so it was mainly government data and then the data.gov.in platform came what we need to uh you know take stock of is that entire open data movement and our own NDAP policy

and data.gov.in in platform was built where to open up government data probably for research and other policy making innovation I mean opening up this for innovation and our startups was not

really a primary objective because it was in the pre- startups era and the preai era and that's where I think now we need to really revisit that and uh make sure that we just not locked down

by the old paradigm of open data Because right now you need open data but which is also AI ready open data which is extremely important because when you look at an LLM or any other lang small

language models there there are end users there are professionals there are researchers everybody using that prompting it and they're expecting the data so and in in the past when the open

data movement started I think we were happy if government opened by giving us a PDF or uh CSV file and we would figure out download put it in a spreadsheet and do our analysis. Whereas now the data

needs to be truly open always available and most importantly I think metadata and its standards are extremely critical for the interoperability of the data and we need to revisit how different segment

of users of this open data are going to consume that data. We are now also in the nobody wants to download and do something offline, right? They want to be able to consume the data through APIs

and through apps and then of course the entire AI systems. And we need to make open data available where not only end users like you and me can consume but both apps and AI systems can consume. I

think that is where we have a challenge and I having spent 35 plus years in the industry I beg to submit that just opening up government data is not enough. There is a lot of institutional

data which is getting locked and siloed. I would like to call it dark data because nobody's using them even in commercial enterprises and with regulators and nodal organizations like

cert. So when you look at cyber security startups they really don't care about what is there on open data open data.gov.in they need lot of data which is there

with the nal institutions of government. Similarly for with regulators fintex want data that is residing with npci. So we need to look at how do we open up this data.

&gt;&gt; Thank you so much majestry that was clear concise and even compelling especially coming from a regulatory standpoint. May I invite Miss Arena Ghost the managing director of Anthropic

India. Uh so Miss Ghost, my question to you is that uh as Anthropic deepens its collaboration and presence across India. Could open data sharing frameworks help drive trust first innovation and

development in the Indian AI space? Is this relevant at all for AI developers such as Anthropic in making the AI models more secure, trustworthy and well suited for complex, dynamic and rapidly

evolving markets such as India. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. It's indeed a pleasure and a complete honor and I really love the analogy and the followup thereafter as well. Um let me first

begin by saying that I think all of us totally agree that AI for India is a generational opportunity in the context of the data the demographics and the culture. Having said that it can it's

not the question that is it the AI moment for India. It's a question do we trust and do we want to make it the AI moment for India and trust for all of us needs to be a verifiable outcome. Do we

trust the data that we are putting in every click, every transaction, every decision which is triggered by the AI? Is there an invisible filter or are we trusting it? So two parts to that in my

mind. One is the data that we're collecting, how are we using it and making it available for many more experimentations and innovations there. If the model is only being built on a

western data or for financial institutions which is serving a different segment or a sector, it won't be communal useful for all of us. So few things that we need to do is make it

contextual to the local language and the domain in the local language legal agriculture for the languages which are there in India. That's the first thing. Now how do we ensure that it goes across

at scale that's the second there are three things that we're doing first of all we are doing an economic impact survey index survey by which we are ensuring that we are really making data

available for the way people are using it in India and a big round of applause to everybody out here because the highest usage of claude which is the two philanthropic users is from India so we

have a great way of knowing as to what people are doing and we share it completely contextually as to what people are using it for. That's the first. The second, people will want to

use the data and the context collect it once but don't rewrite code. The analogy to that I would say is that when you had a mobile phone world, you did not want to have a charger for different mobiles,

right? The universal connector came across that solved all the problems. So when you create look at a farmer when he's wanting to use things there are three four kinds of data the market

index the the soil data the irrigation data if you try to pull in data every time and make it work it's going to fail so a model context protocol MCP as we call it was created by anthropic in 2024

and we've put it across to the Linux community anybody and everybody can use it so that once you create an AI layer on On top of that people can pull that data. Why is it contextual for India?

There's a lot of data which is lying across in agriculture, health, education and like Rama called out in institutions and we are working along with the collaborations of all the players Google

Anthropic Microsoft everybody else put together and when the honorable prime prime minister called out the manifesto we're ensuring that we make data transparent transparently available. We

are also committing that we will build it across for use cases in the sectors which mean the most to India so that we emerge and make it the AI moment for India. Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Thank you Miss Gos for really giving that perspective. Uh now may I invite Mr. Sil Shro who's of course uh the convenor of this panel but also managing uh founding managing uh partner of Sri

Lach Mangaladas and the benefactor of the Silhou Regulation. Uh Mr. Sh in your view might a clearer regulatory framework be necessary to ensure more consistent

effective and systemic data sharing by government bodies? The clarity that we need from you is that the role that a regulatory framework can play in institutionalizing incentives and

accountability and putting in place necessary safeguards, procedures and protocols. I say this because of the fact that most of the time lawyers come to the party very late. the technology

is so fast and things get done and when hits the roof to put it bluntly lawyers are asked to clean it up. Should we do it differently? &gt;&gt; I think the short answer to your

question is yes. I think uh and and building on everything that has been said so far and sort of taking Barard's brief a little further I think the short answer is yes that we need regulation

uh even in with the best of intentions government departments have different you know they're siloed they have different uh incentives they have different concerns and coordination is

always a challenge so unless there is an overlay of regulation on top of it it won't happen I think the reality that we'll be just having these conferences but the actual data sharing and making

it to uh quote ma'am AI ready will not occur. Uh so I think the only answer to this is that when problems become so large as this one and at population scale the only way to deal with it is to

come in with regulation. Of course we don't don't need to go as far as Europe did with GDPR and all the other stuff because they overdo it. They kill innovation. So we need to find that

right balance between uh you know innovation and regulation and the regulation here is intended actually to to create the foundation stone for innovation if data were systematically

available uh in a usable format AI ready format that would actually spark a lot of uh uh innovation and create the foundation uh for it. So I think that the short answer as I said is yes and I

think just to build on Dr. Dr. Tarur's point on data sovereignty. I think the prime minister said it well and I think he had probably the you know the saying uh when he actually said that data

and I think as India we need to assert that right uh of uh all the data is largely in the global south and all the the companies and the private sector and the usage is largely in the global

north. I think we need to assert ourselves. Uh and I think that's exactly what Dr. Taru said and I'm a great fan of that and it partly kind of explains why on a personal philanthropy level I

created this uh this center because lawyers come late to the party but some lawyers don't. [laughter] Yeah. So uh [applause]

so I think this is what I expect from your center Raj and [laughter] so I'll stop there. I think we have a lot to cover. &gt;&gt; Lawyers have another quality. Put the

blame on somebody else when things are not happening as much. &gt;&gt; That is known as good management. [laughter] &gt;&gt; I know.

Thank you so much um sir for that because I think it's important for us to recognize that while we are indeed attempting to frame regulation we also should not stifle growth and innovation

because that's the biggest death nail that we can sound towards a lot of entrepreneurship that's emerging may I now invite Dr. Dr. Sasit Patra Smazb you are a distinguished member of parliament

and of course you have stled across the world of policym and even academia. How can greater availability of reliable public data lead to stronger evidence-based policym and more

efficiently delivering public goods? In fact, the real question is the criticality of data in identifying relevant areas of policy intervention by the state for designing public policy

instruments and frameworks so that targeting to the relevant stakeholders. How do we do that? &gt;&gt; Thank you Raj. It's a very important question because I'll take it in two

parts. The first part is whether data is important to policym. Yes, it's a no-brainer. Second is in a federal structure the problem is data is in silos. Let's say I come from the state

of Orisa. So the data of our farmers in our local kalia yoja would be in a different format and probably kept differently than probably the PMIAN data that is there by the federal government.

Secondly, how can this be useful? I'll come to the second part. Let's say crop loss. Pradhan Mantri Fasal Beimma Yojna is something which is a crop loss uh provision that is given for

reimbursement or compensation for crop losses for farmers. In this scenario what happens is if the data is readily available with the government the government can predict that over the

next 1 to two years which are the districts which are the tales which are the blocks which are the panchiads where crop losses have been happening over a period of time. So predictively AI can

bring about solutions to probably A try to find out the reasons for crop loss b try to mitigate the losses c try to strengthen the farmers for crop diversification and d try to generate a

new form of mitigation plan that can be implemented by the government in those in order to do that you need data without that data it is not possible I'll come to the last part where the

government will actually have a problem it's a political question the political question and I'll play the political ition here. The reason is when the government says I'm going to share data,

it's a data of 140 billion 1.4 billion people, right? How many of you sitting in this room here are willing to share your data through the government anonymized data?

I that's the question I'm trying to put to you. Let's say tomorrow government comes up with the regulation and says I want to share that data a trust and verifiable data my citizens data not the

farmer's data who was nameless and faceless at Bharat mandapam the movers and shakers of Delhi data is going to be now released for training of LLMs and microlms are you happy sharing

that data that's where the catch is that's the political question the regulatory question is yes there has to be the data B the policy question is the data is needed for better policies but C

as citizenry how many of you sitting in this room are comfortable sharing the UPI transactions that you do that even if in an anonymized question will always remain so the answer starts with you and

ends with you as a citizen &gt;&gt; thank you so much Suspend for that very important question I think it's important to recognize that the heart of it is about to what extent citizens are

prepared to trust the government and trust factor becomes critical here. Let me quickly move to Miss Vedesh. We're doing very well on time. So, thank you for all the panelists to respond with

short responses. So, Miss Veshi, why in your view have proposals such as India data accessibility and use policy and the national data governance framework policy well-intended policies but have

not really moved forward? Why it has been the case that these government interventions being one of only at the policy level lack regulatory enforcement?

So the first thing I think we need a supply demand gap assessment because maybe government is opening up or throwing up some data on the data.gov GB in platform who are the users who are

consuming it and the ministries who are anyway overloaded with so much work and if they need to manage this and regularly submit all the data sets in an open format they need to see what will

come out of it which means we need to tie it up with researchers we need to tie it up with in with you know inventors and innovators I think that did not happen so far whereas now if you

really look and a ready data sets. She talked about the MC there are open standards so that interoperability. She talked about the protocol MCP protocol. I think we now need to look at what data

sets are needed for research which could be academia and research students and for industry which could be all the startups unless we map that and revisit what is the necessary policy and

government data will be useful development data which even world bank throws up a lot of data in the open data sets there those development data is also equally important for policy making

but if you're looking at it opening up data repositories or dark data as I call it for innovation purposes. I think we need to look at how do we open up commercial data in a secure you know

anonymized way where there have been some steps for example the payment systems directive in UK now EU who's always been about you know extreme of protecting data is now come talking of

FIDA which is a financial data access where they're saying at a sectoral level how do we open up the data access payment systems directive and open banking initiative was that similarly

healthcare data Hopefully the Ashman Barat mission will open up. So I think we need to look at the supply demand gap. What data will be consumed by which segment of users and open up those data

sets? Otherwise I don't think we will move anywhere sir. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much Miss Vishi. I haven't forgotten you Arun. Uh you're of course our own. Arun if um Arun of course is a

partner at cirin mangadas. If India were to move towards a more structured legal framework for open data sharing, which core principles and safeguards could shape its design? Is it all about design

thinking so that government bodies requiring them to share the data have aggregated data data sets on a free paid or restricted basis with voluntary private participation on the supply side

and of course safeguards to prevent misuse. &gt;&gt; Thanks Raj. um what I lack in the eminence or erudition of my fellow panelists uh I will try to compensate uh

very inadequately with a certain radicalism uh not the radicalism of rhetoric but the radicalism of making bold suggestions as to the minimum viable

proposition of a sustainable open data law and by positing that the lack of open data sharing that several of the key panelists including the keynote have called out has arisen due to a lack of a

durable legal architecture. Today in India despite having a digital personal data protection act uh episodic intermediary regulation as well as several policy and practical initiatives

on the sharing of non-personal data. We do not as the world's largest democracy have a clear identified anonymization standard, clier identified public data interchain standards. We do not have a

clear recognized purpose for the processing of open public data sets for public good and public improvement. This means that any initiative particularly large complex init

initiatives like large language models and their deployment which are multi-deadal multi-billion dollar investments are open to the travails of both judicial storms, executive weather

patterns and perhaps most importantly legislative climate change. A government official who creates an open depository open data repository has to risk that in 5 years his action may

not only be frowned upon but be downright illegal. A founder betting his life on creating the next generation of open data inter architecture and applications has to risk at some point

that his business becomes fundamentally unviable. I submit to you that absent these four key important elements which work coherently not only with existing architecture but also the constitutional

principles which have been laid out in the Putaswami judgment which continue to pervade our democracy until that architecture is enacted in legal legislative form in a way that does not

rub up against the various pieces of isolated sectoral regulation we have across individual regulators. we will not have a sustainable open data ecosystem. Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Thank you so much Arun. That was fantastic. U spoke like a true lawyer. Um Sirill uh quickly uh we have few minutes left and we have a concluding remarks as well. From your vantage

point, how can greater availability of reliable public data influence investor confidence, efficiency of markets and long-term economic growth? In many ways, this is also a moment for India to

showcase its potential for attracting investors to believe in both the government and their investments to have the right results. &gt;&gt; I'm going to answer your question with

an analogy in one of the hats that I wear is also as a capital markets lawyer. uh and I've seen how the growth of India's capital markets from a very restricted basic kind of uh you know at

a very fundamental level to what it is today as one of the uh most vibrant capital markets in the world last year uh India had 25% of all global IPOs even more than the US and why did that happen

that happened for a variety of commercial reasons but also the fact that we have a a very vibrant capital market regulatory system in place. It has taken 25 30 years to get us to this

point. But a lot of it is about having regulatory clarity. It is about having the right enforcement. It is about having uh good accounting standards. It is about uh uh you know just uniformity

in regulatory language uh that is used at least the same vocabulary which is if you can just substitute the word capital market by the data the data and the digital world I think you get to the

same answer. So I I think the answer the answer uh lies therefore in that if you want to uh create trust in the community, if you want the multi-billion dollar investments, if you want data

centers to be set up here, if you want us as a country to move from a servicesbased tech sector to a product based tech sector and it may be different parts of the the digital

world, I think you first have to create trust and a trust cannot happen without transparent information and a reliable able you know legal and policy system. Now

one of the things that we get periodically hit on the head with is the fact that your dispute resolution system is too slow. It take 30 years to enforce a contract blah blah blah and something

which we take disproportionate stick for. But I think a lot of it ultimately comes down to can you trust your legal system and I think the answer is if we are able to create that right regulatory

uh frame policy and enforcement framework for this which are kind of answers your question I think we would have solved it. It's not going to happen otherwise. There's no point having a law

which you can't enforce. All right, thank you so much Sil. I have enough sign language indications to say that we have another 10 12 minutes so I'm proceeding forward. Sasmith quickly to

you. Are there any geopolitical concerns that need to be addressed if open data sharing practices by the government are to be scaled up in India? Should that be something that we need to be concerned

especially because you're sitting in the parliament and there are of course opposition parties you know really coming forward to question and challenge the government on this matter as well.

You know in fact when recently the US India uh trade deal happened then you had a lot of energy being seen in the parliament and outside. So sharing of data and the method by which we share

data is of course a geopolitical concern for the country. So maybe we can look at data as madam just said that one is the data that is for the public good and the humanity. The second data is restricted

and probably national security and the third data is something that can be monetized and commercially useful. So therefore instead of probably putting the entire data set within one silo we

can probably look at the usage and thereafter tag them to the respective so that the multi-billion dollar innovator also benefits the regulators also benefit the citizenry also benefits and

finally the policies for the farmers the anganari workers the asha workers also get done last point and I just want to put that on record because I'm on the parliamentary oversight committee on

communications and IT and Dr. Taru was the earlier chairman and my distinguished colleague there as earlier. One of the critical areas that we at least are discussing and debating

is not a very hard strong EU AI act. I don't think that's happening anytime soon. We'll have a regulatory framework and the key word is soft touch regulation. Where does that take us has

to be seen. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much Sas. We're very fortunate to have both Shashi Tarur and Saspit Patra former chair of the same parliamentary committee and Saspit now a

member. Uh may I quickly invite um um Miss Vedas Shri to do a oneliner concluding uh response especially as you look at from this vantage standpoint how do you think the the future is going to

evolve especially the light of India wanting to play a global thought leadership role. Yeah, I think uh this summit is demonstrating that our aspirations of positioning ourselves as

uh you know the AI leader of the world we are working towards that. So I would say when you link it to the topic I think we need a very concerted data strategy at a government level. There

was some efforts when the uh personal data protection uh bill was being de debated upon. There was also a parallel one around non-personal data framework. So I think we need a national level data

strategy because now we need to look at it from the current to the next 5 years. How do you open up? Sir talked about uh you know that data needs to be different segments. I also believe that we cannot

have one centralized open data repository. Data needs to be federated. We also need to think through along with the sectoral regulators what will be the sectoral uh data opening up policies

because that's where a lot of data that can be monetized and innovation can happen. So we need to look at that at a sectoral level and at a government level and how do we create this federated open

data strategy which is a ready. Thank you so much. Uh uh your oneliner uh sir oneliner about what should India be doing as we look at the future &gt;&gt; not copying the west. Oh

&gt;&gt; good one good one. All right may I invite missina go for you to especially from the standpoint of anthropic but also the private sector which is expecting a huge presence in India.

Yeah, I think the the last mile between making AI real is the diffusion which has to happen between the frontier firm which is creating the model and the person on the last mile who's needing it

and that's the thread of trust. Now the thrust the thread of trust needs to be woven by the contextual data in the context of India and ensuring that we are making it both open accessible and

ensuring that everybody is contributing to that grid. Thank you so much Arun. Over to you. Your oneliner. &gt;&gt; The absence of a legal framework goes from being an inconvenience to an

impediment uh in the development of a sustainable data economy. Uh we are at the point where India's existing regulatory framework is making that transition.

&gt;&gt; Thank you so much. We have now come to almost the end of this panel but we have a very distinguished panelist Miss Asha Jadea Motwani. She has been silently and quietly listening to everybody but she's

at the heart of India US relations but also somebody who has been a venture capitalist investing in tech companies innovation as well as AI in India and in the United States. She has been working

hard to build that relationship but also has been a benefactor just as Sirill established a center for AI law and regulation. Miss Motwani established an endorment uh at our university where we

have established India's first Motwani Jadea Institute for American Studies. So may I invite you to share some reflections having been part of the global AI summit and of course uh this

particular panel. Over to you Miss Jadea. Yeah, thank you uh Raj for inviting me and uh uh I I I so the one thing that I want to you know stress heavily is that look we are built on an

American stack you know and uh we we we want to make sure that um uh you know I one of the things I heard in the AI summit was this question of sort of what if you know what if America at some

point becomes more of a of a of a hostile entity and and pulls its APIs, will we be stuck? You know, will we be in a situation where we don't know how to handle it? Um, I think the uh that

question is something that we must think about and and know how to deal with it if it happens. But I don't think it's likely to happen. We'll have to we will actually have to make a decision and say

that we have consciously chosen to be on the American stack from the from the you know from the chip level all the way to the top. And so if we consciously make that decision then at a policy level and

even probably even at your you know at the legal level what you guys will need to figure out is that if we've decided to work with the uh you know with the Americans on this and put our eggs in

that basket then uh have a joint regulatory framework so that we are never conflicting with them. uh number one number two also to make sure that we don't get a situation where we are

holding back data because remember this the AI revolution is all about training the new models right training these uh new entities that are going to be a doctor in our pocket for training those

things we need to make sure that the our data which is you know the health data for example Indian health data is open and accessible to those in the west who are developing these uh these programs

these models. So it's it's critical to know that this is that it's a fine balance. This is not like the internet days Raj where you know we had to worry about you know who is who is going to do

what with that are they going to pump ads at us. This time it's much more about what are these things going to give back to us once they have that data. So it's a so it's a tricky balance

uh and and I think we will uh need to make that decision about do we trust the Americans and do we trust the the American stack and if so how do we proactively work with them so that their

hands are also tied just like our hands would be tied. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much um Masha G. In fact, it's also important uh uh for us to recognize that uh it is also the bedrock

of TUS is based upon should India be working with democracies, should India be working with countries with more shared values and societies which largely you know recognize the

importance of rule of law and democratic institutions and that's where uh the India US relations lie. Uh we have of course had a wonderful panel discussion but as a professor I will not let our

panelist leave without an audience question. We have a few minutes left so I request uh if anybody let's have the mic to the lady here uh in the second row. Keep it very short. I'm going to

collect three questions and have our uh speakers respond. &gt;&gt; Thank you for giving the opportunity. I've been dying to ask this. There have been lot of sessions where we have been

talking about having a regulatory framework on AI and having uh independent asurances but uh the way things are right now even the auditors the regulators etc are heavily reliant

on AI so who would be watching the watchers is &gt;&gt; good one good one sil you who would be watching the watchers all right next question the standing people let's give

the standing person Mike mic yeah they've been standing for I am BK Patnak from Orisa. I am asking the question to Mr. Patra &gt;&gt; that you can ask in Orisa itself but

anyway [laughter] &gt;&gt; no go ahead no Mr. Patra what he has told that he will change the farmers in India with the AI data will it successful I'm asking to Mr.

&gt;&gt; Got you got you all right last question there &gt;&gt; and another to Mr. or what one is man thank you please yeah just you can raise your voice yeah go ahead go ahead

&gt;&gt; yeah so I run a metal start for men exclusively it's called health exclusively for men now my concern that I want to share on this panel where we're talking about regulatory framework

for AI is that I've seen that it's very difficult to get uh information for men specifically to work on techniques that can help them okay governments have failed to search on it companies

research on it. Even third party cookies that are shared don't really look into this specific aspect and management level is just one of them. So what do you recommend that the government would

instill as a regulatory framework to ensure that such precise data is given into the right hands and ensure that it's not exploited. &gt;&gt; Got you. Let's have Miss Ves answer that

question. But uh Sil and Sasmitha &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. Yes. that question. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So I think you rais the right question. So this is where this we are not actually discussing regulation of AI

this was around open data just to clarify. So I think the sectoral data that you when I talked about when it's healthcare data you're talking about mental health

data but it's very rarely that personally identifiable data will ever be opened up. I don't think it will ever be opened up and that is important but this is where I think for example in

Germany there is some healthcare act in which they have given a provision where patients can choose to share ask their healthcare institution to share some specific data that maybe I will let's

say I had some critical illness I'm willing to share everything anonymized so that it goes for research right so I think we need some progressive regulations and also education and

awareness only regulation will not open up this data &gt;&gt; the reason I said regulation is because I'm actually working on an AI pilot system right now where it can analyze

the chats that take place between a man and the confidant that works for us so after analyzing this chats we have a very procured list which is nonsensitive data that can be shared so what I'm

asking is as a government what is the framework that can be put into place so that this data can be shared. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So there is some discussion going on the guidelines came from ministry of

electronics and IT around AI right so we can expect some movement around &gt;&gt; this could be taken offline as well yeah please &gt;&gt; Dr.

Yes, &gt;&gt; lovely shades. Uh as far as uh AI is concerned, I think yesterday when the honorable prime minister inaugurated, he said we are looking at humanist AI. I

think that is the cornerstone inclusive and humanist. if it doesn't solve the problems of the farmers, doesn't solve the problem of uh the healthare workers, doesn't solve the problems of the

tribals in the state of Odysa and elsewhere, then how is AI going to benefit humanity? So therefore the Indian AI thought leadership so to say comes from the Indian concept of vasu

devaka kutumbakam. The whole world is one family. We are humanist, we are inclusive, we want our AI to help everyone. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. Over to you sir.

[applause] So I'll take your question. Question was who's going to mind the watchers or who's going to watch the watchers? And I think the answer lies in our constitution. The answer has been

there for the last 75 years. The courts and the rule of law we are actually I think we have the best rule of law system in the world. Earlier I used to give credits to to the United States for

that. Everything that has happened in the last 18 months has shown that that's not true and their legal system can be arm twisted, can be pressured. I mean lawyers can be pressured all of that.

That can never happen in India. We actually have a much better democracy and even though we may be clumsy in the way we sometimes go about it and it may be frustrating there's only one answer

in India which is the courts and the second answer I think is ethics. So one of the and AI is going to need a completely different ethics code about biases about so many things. Uh it may

not be law but it is something which the industry will have to evolve for itself. There are number of uh topics around which and I think we're working on that in the center. So these two answers

these two themes will provide the answer to uh to how are you going to regulate all of this. The second one is a bit more ambiguous because ethics conversations always are more amorphous

but uh the the courts like it or not they will finally they will be the one. Put Swami is an example of uh of that and there are so many uh so many similar examps

raised and perhaps the ones that weren't raised already pointing the way to some of the further areas we need to converse about. I mean but we also have to be very realistic and anchored in what

we're talking about. When our friend from Orisa asked that question about agriculture, I like sasid patra sasid patra's answer as an aspirational answer. But I'm very conscious that even

as the finance minister announces a special budget provision for AI in agriculture that the vast majority of of our farmers can't afford tractors, can't afford tillers, don't have pumps, don't

have guaranteed sources of water, and in many cases no 24 hours of electricity. And in those circumstances, AI, how is it going to be applied? How many farmers will it reach? And how in how many ways

will it transform agriculture? I think humanist agriculture, humanist AI is an lordable goal, but we have to relate it to the reality of our own people and the and the circumstances in which we're in.

Uh I [snorts] mean I would love to agree with Sir on pretty much everything he says but with our legal system we face for example the undoubted fact that your judiciary needs AI to begin with. I mean

you've got 5 million pending cases in this country. Uh how can we celebrate the rule of law? &gt;&gt; 50 million &gt;&gt; 50 million or Raj. So how can we

celebrate the rule of law when justice delayed and that old cliche is justice denied. So again let's let's anchor all this into the real world. When you when you speak of of men's health or

anybody's mental health for that matter, it seems to me you're touching on an extremely important issue. But a lot of the stuff the circumstances that the person is confiding into a doctor in

your case into a a chat. Um how much of that can be anonymized truly effectively? How much of it can be traced back? How much of it can cause u confidentiality breaches? The purpose of

health data aggregation is ought to be to solve similar problems for other people. In other words, um let's say doctors in the west may have access to 10 instances of a rare disease and in

India there may be a thousand instances of the same disease. So if we had AI data in India that aggregated all that then certainly um the west might have the scientific technology to research it

and come up with a cure or a better cure or whatever that can be applied in India. But for all that to happen we need regulations. We need to figure out if there's monetization who benefits if

the data is given on what terms. How do we have a law that says what will come back to us etc etc etc. It'll be absurd if those thousand Indian cases are added to the 10 western cases to create a

proprietary AI software that the 10,000 people here can't afford to benefit from. So we need to create models. That's the point that I was trying to make uh when I talked about the digital

dra. But we have here a a moderating raj on action. [laughter] So I better stop. Thank you all for thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you Arun Pavu Arena Go a Shashi Taru Sra Sasit Patra and Miss

Vedri. I want to particularly thank Shashi who came for the keynote address and was planning to leave in 10 minutes but he stayed through the entire panel. So give the entire panelist and Shashi a

big round of applause. Thank you to Asha Jarija Bwani who agreed this morning. So thank you very much. &gt;&gt; All right we need to have pictures with momento. So please u this seems like

there's an auditing requirement to take photographs uh with the gifts you know. I also want to take and thank Arjun from Sri Lama Bangladas, Paridi Adani from Sri Lachan Mangadas, the entire clam

team who worked very hard to put together this panel. The entire team led by Sedat from the Sil Shrav Center, the faculty members and staff and students and all of you who are present here.

Congratulations and thank you for being part of this panel. invest learn
