## 📝 Transcript

taking it off. Good morning. &gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; So while we still wait for one of our panelists to arrive, Sanjie uh Sanjie

from the [clears throat] Bajage House, he has like all of us has been stuck in the mega traffic that we all have been observing for the last 5 days. Who all has been stuck in traffic since yeah

just three four people. That's a big smile about traffic. So when I was returning home the day before, it took me three and a half hours to get back to Gna. So today I

started like very early. I said I'm going to beat the traffic. I'll come early. So I started 7:00 a.m. and there was no traffic. So I was here far faster than I anticipated. Okay.

So uh we'll be discussing uh hyper automation in BFSI in banking, financial services, uh insurance companies. Yeah. Who all here do banking and financial services?

Everyone. That's good. Rich didn't raise a hand. [laughter] Okay. So uh we'll be talking about how we will move away from what we used to

do with automation to getting to a end to end flavor of doing transformation or automation as I call it using agentic or AI as we call it. Okay. I would we got a good panel today. We've got Dr.

Panka Digshit. Yeah. He's part of Signet One. He's worked with uh he's he set up national level AI solutions. uh national level uh tech solutions and he is now at the

forefront of Signnet. Andrew Ruchika Ruchika works for Netwest and Netwest is a mega bank, global bank uh and she has some of the most challenging roles in managing the tech infrastructure for Net

West. Okay. Uh we'll start a conversation while Sanjiv arrives. Sanjie is here somewhere. He's finding his way through the security and then walking past all the gates to come

here. So he should be here any moment once he comes. He'll take the last seat. But we'll start a conversation. Yeah. Thank you. So you have to do a group picture but

Sanji is still not here. Okay. When Sanji comes then we'll do the group picture. Okay. So uh today what we'll do is we'll focus on three key themes. One is enterprise

reality of being able to bring hyperamation and AI to life. What is the architecture, governance and trust we would love to infuse in the hyper automation or the agentic

solutions we're going to put to place and what is the future readiness of the workforce we need to establish. Make sense? So if we'll just focus on these three that should give us the

right flavor for the conversation today. Okay. Roika can I start with you if you don't mind? Yeah. Sure. &gt;&gt; So Roika leads &gt;&gt; or do I need a microphone?

I think microphone will be better. &gt;&gt; So Rika as I said is part of Netwest massive scale. Netwest is all about scale. Uh [snorts] I'd ask you from your experience

uh AI hyperammation how do you see will deliver business impact especially while you're delivering the business impact how do you ensure risk is managed? and you are

able to provide the right customer engagement. Look, &gt;&gt; first of all, thank you for having me. Uh really glad to be here. Uh it's a

very exciting summit and there's obviously um you know we waiting on Sanjie here given the uh given the crowds etc. So um uh really glad to be here at Natwist

Group. Um you know when you look at the big picture for us um AI is really helping us um build deeper and more trusted relationships with our customers really. Um and when you think about uh

the places where we want to um uh adopt more AI, it is in that deepening of the relationship. It is in getting to know our customers better. It is to meet them in the channels of their choice. it is

to um give services to them that are going to help transform banking for them today and for uh people and customers to come. Um that's really at the heart of um why right and for us um you know

through the last couple of years especially in 2025 AI has been really about scaling. We have at this point given um tools like Microsoft Copilot and our internal

LLM tools to 60,000 of our colleagues across the bank um and when you look across um our businesses whether it's in the retail business where we are um leveraging Kora um that is our

intelligent assistant for customers for 20 million customers it is um taking on almost 12.9 million customer interactions um and we've taken

um from four to about 11 customer journeys from AI to Genai in the last year um when you look at what we doing in commercial and institutional

um you know all our complaints 100% of them today are um you know summarized and uh supported by AI. When you look at our private banking in wealth, uh we've supercharged our relationship managers

um to have access to AI and therefore making them 30% more productive. um you know and when you look at the expert uh roles across the bank and you think about people who code over 12,000

of our engineers have access to AI tools and um think of it as about 35% of our code is actually generated um by AI. So um really across the customer experience across the customer life cycle um and

AIEL hyper automation for us as you've asked um is really about making our colleagues more productive. It is about generating more time, removing the manual tasks and allowing

them to spend time in places where the human connection with our customers is more important. Um so they are really now spending time with our customers um you know in money management in their

life moments in their deeper needs and understanding the customers versus AI is taking over more of the manual tasks. I I hope that helps you uh bring to life um what this means for us.

&gt;&gt; Thanks. I'll just &gt;&gt; thanks I'll I'll just extend this to ask uh in especially for banks regulator increasingly ask uh why did a model make a decision not what just decided. So how

do you balance the speed of innovation with uh getting the right governance and explanability in your systems? I as a consultant go about uh uh trying to solve this for my customer which is not

a easy ask but from your lens I would like to we would like to understand how do you manage speed of innovation while providing the right governance and explanability.

&gt;&gt; Yeah of course um it's a very pertinent topic of course for us in banking in any regulated industry. So first of all I will say that the AI opportunity brings with it a level of responsibility

doesn't it? Um and you know for us we want to be as I said a deep and a trusted partner with our customers. So it is absolutely important that um you know we are embedding responsible AI in

everything that we do. um you know every single colleague across the bank is is accountable to make sure that AI is implemented responsibly. We have a AI and data ethics code of

conduct and training that we've rolled out across the bank to all our colleagues and I'd say 58,000 or so of them have actually completed that training. Right? And you have to bring

every leader um into the development of AI. I think even more than broad tech implementations when you think about AI implementations, you have to bring all

leaders into the conversation. You have to think about um governance and actual controls at all levels and all layers. Um and that's what we have done. We have um you know in 2024 we hired a head of

responsible AI. Um you know last year we also hired a chief AI research officer um and several of these roles along with um both the uh you know the responsible AI trainings uh the policies and the

governance that we use is to make sure that anything we might implement and put in the hand of the customers must absolutely be going through those layers of governance and make sure that they

are safe and that our customers can trust this trust them. Yeah, &gt;&gt; that means that having a bank account with Netflix is the safest place to keep your money here.

&gt;&gt; Thank you, Roka. You're making our life safer. Let's move to Dr. Pankage. Pankage, you are executive director and a chief AI officer for Signit, but you've also

built national scale digital systems. you do you want to tell everyone because everyone would love to know what you have done in your past life before signet building these national scale

solutions. &gt;&gt; Thank you Prashant. Uh I would you know like to start with thanking uh the mighty for doing such a great uh event here. There's a churn you know happening

in technology and in the last five days we have actually been a physical witness to the churn in number of people coming from all over the world right and of course I as the executing agency on

behalf of mighty thank you very much and thank you all very much for being here to be part of the ch uh uh coming to your question Brashant what I would like to say is you see I've had 28 years

worth of uh as a colonel in the army I then joined IBM. I have been 8 years in GST and where we built the GST system and then as a CTO of GEM. I have seen technology evolve in

the last 30 plus years from what it was uh most of you probably the younger generation would not even imagine the kind of phones and the uh communication that used to exist and what we have

today. But being part of this journey uh building systems like GST and at GEM uh what has remained the constant thread throughout has been [clears throat] the respect for the end user.

uh my uh encounter with uh GNI happened in November 22 when I was authoring a paper for the prime minister's economic advisory council with northern members and I used that to look up some

references for my uh text in which I wanted to quote some relevant uh documents or papers from either the World Bank or the IMF and it just churned out you know uh uh documents

which were completely completely non-existent and I spent at least a good amount of time and days to get the right references. I I ultimately got them but

I found that the engine was just uh you know cooking up those references. Finally, of course, I did uh do that. Going on to my experience in Jam where I built the first public sector AI engine

for the Jam portal. What I realized was that the information has to be curated for the user. Again the user is at the forefront and we cannot have hallucinations because there were some

instances where some political names were taken and thrown into an A engine and it gives you know it just throws up unpalatable answers. So what happens is that when you are in a financial

industry numbers are very important the mathematics is very important when it's two and two it has to come to four it cannot be five it cannot be three and that's the principle that I keep in mind

always when I uh try and curate something for the uh customer and for the company to be used by the u and client. No, that has been my journey to uh put it shortly uh Prashant and across

the 30 years having faced every uh you know kind of technology along with national scale systems where we built uh where we collect you know almost 10 to 12 billion per month and uh GEM where we

have $60 billion worth of GMBB being transacted every year. uh I can say with confidence that yes technology works but you have to have the right people driving it at the helm and the right

teams. &gt;&gt; Thanks Dr. U. So two words AI and compliance seem to not sit in the same box together very easily. uh in your view what is the what are the

non-negotiable principles that we need to follow to ensure that we can make AI automation and compliance work in tandem with each other. Yeah. So what happens

now with hyper automation you have to have the principles architectural principles that make the systems very very solid right primarily being the AI the RP and ML and we have to make

compable uh compliant and scalable systems at the chief AI officer at Signet what I'm building is uh treasury management systems we are working with the e-commerce company the biggest

e-commerce companies of India we are doing the invoicing for them we are bringing ing account payables and account receivable systems. We are doing the latest what we are doing is

litigation management. So if you receive a notice from the GST authorities, we also create a response for you after evaluating your complete uh returns that you have filed. Right? In addition to

that we have the material management based systems and the tax comp. So what we are we have to ensure is data fabric and security is primary the uh unified structures right uh we have to

have zero trust security and privacy based design at the forefront then compliance by design we have to have uh governance into every STLC layer and modularity and interoperability so we

try to build very strongly and uh tightly defined systems but loosely coupled through API first uh uh modules governance and explanability. As I mentioned, you have to have audit

trails. You have to have explanability. You have to have the uh understanding when an answer or a response goes wrong for a customer. You should be able to trace it back as to what particular

layer what went wrong and then work upon it. And uh once we have all this in place, we have to have the customer feedback to understand regularly as to where the

systems are working fine and where they're not working so fine. and take that feedback and build it back into the systems. And like I mentioned the number crunching systems I use uh I tend to use

a hybrid approach. Uh I have full trust 100% trust on an Excel. I may not have that 100% trust on a AI engine to do the maths. So what I do is I put an AI layer on top of the excels. So the numbers are

crunched by the excels and the context understanding and the human interaction happens through the AI engine because these are the two best of the world's approach right somebody does something

right use that interaction conversation interaction UI layer with AI is good use that mathematics is better by Excel use that and couple them through tightly defined systems and uh uh integrated

through the APIs so that's how I go about uh building uh AI systems for numbers and for use by customers. &gt;&gt; Thank you. So uh just we'll delve into uh the next question for you but

so we just got Sanjie walkin. Thank you Sanjie. Uh we're sorry Delhi is not hospitalitable on in terms of traffic right now but &gt;&gt; few moment. [laughter]

So, we'll ask you to all stand up. There's this gentleman waiting to take a picture of us. So our friend has been waiting for a while Sanjie just for you to walk in so

that a picture could be done. So we couldn't have made him wait any further. &gt;&gt; Well, I'll get back to Dr. Pankage. Uh so we'll talk about regulated workflows. So, so most of the work in banking

industry requires quite a bit of workflows and they need to be regulated. Uh, how do you bring human in the loop in play to ensure trust without killing productivity?

So the challenge that I experienced when I started doing automation back like 10 12 years ago was if we did too much of automation the trust was killed and if we brought too much of human in the loop

the benefits of automation got killed. Now with AI I think some of this is getting solved. How do you see this transitioning and how do we build trust with humans without killing

&gt;&gt; Yeah. Uh thank you Prashant. So uh like I was mentioning in my earlier part of the response uh best of the uh best have to be coupled together. Now what an AI engine can do best I would leave it to

that but I would have to have the human in the loop to approve certain things. So you have to create a threshold a threshold based risk delegation is important

uh where I receive uh inputs from the AI engine which I where I expect it to be about 80% 90% compliant for the remaining 10% I'll put a human in the loop for example I was talking about the

litigation management system that we are creating for responding to uh regulatory notices the AI engine creates the complete notice response but who will approve the text and the content of the

notice. That's where the human comes in. He approves it after validating it. He might edit it. In addition to that, what I do is we take the feedback from that each of the responses that I created.

Was this 90% good? 95% good. And based on that feedback, we will try to curate so that the next response is better. There are certain tasks like KYC right where you have some documents which are

read and validated. This is something which can be done by automating it and completely delegated delegating it to the AI engines based on the data collected. But wherever a risk factor is

high for example to a law- based activity or for example responding to uh tax notices or uh preparing returns right if you have to file a return which has to be 100% accurate you will prepare

it through the AI engines up to the level of approval and dispatch and submission where a human will just have a fine look final look at it and be able to respond to that. So like I

mentioned we use a threshold based mechanism where certain activities based on their accuracy and that's how I increase my productivity. If everything were left to a human we would not

achieve that productivity. So the human in the loop comes in only at the last stages. So just about five or 10% of the complete work is then done by the human. &gt;&gt; Thank you Dr. Dshit. Uh Sanjiv sir can

we move to you? Thank you. uh you we live in a city of VIPs. So coming to Delhi and finding traffic is normal. Uh your business is all about customers,

more customers and it is very much all about engaging with customers at scale and at mass. Uh so from a wealth management and advisory perspective how is AIEL hyper automation changing the

advisor come customer relationship in your world? Where do you see automation genuinely enhancing trust where h must humans remain central? &gt;&gt; See I think AI is a very exciting

frontier we are at. So AI can be your biggest friend. It can be your biggest enemy. And the best part is the choice is yours. You know, so what people don't understand AI is not a tool like the

computer softwares or the tools or Excel. It is not a tool. Okay? It is it is something to enhance you. Why has Indian IT industry stocks crashed or even the global IT industry? Because

what it has been realized is that earlier the USP of India used to be that a t that Indian labor was cheap. It was 1/4 110th 1/8 the cost of what you would get in US. Okay. But if you look at the

ability to do work on your own a typical guy outside is 2 3x in Indian because there he has to do everything himself. He has to wash his clothes, wake up, drop his children, you know, and do 10

more activities. This is just a very basic. But even I'm talking about when you go and start working, they are used to doing the Excels themselves. They are used to doing the formulas. They're used

to working much harder, you know, on those things. Whereas we like to delegate. We want a model made. We'll call a guy, okay, make a model for me. We'll call a research analyst, do this

research for me. We'll call a third guy and do this. And that worked for India and that was the India's in reason for India's boom. But what AI has done is that this 2x guy today can become 10x

20x 30x by using AI to empower. So what we have to understand AI is not going to replace you. AI is going to replace those who don't adopt AI. So you have to be the AI expert because AI is not an

expert. AI is like a you know today AI is like a servant. It is an assistant. It is doing like earlier if I wanted to crunch my data I wanted some ratio analysis and all I would have to ask my

EA okay do a research on this sector compare this compare this compare this and make make this thing today I can ask it a question. Yes. Does it make a mistake? Yes. One maybe one in a 10. But

I am the expert who's able to understand and look at it and find the mistake. If somebody else was doing it, maybe the mistake would never get get found. Okay. So, so it is so but today as an expert

each and every one of you here has to become AI expert. Okay? You have to be expert at what you do and you have to use AI to enable you to be a 10X. Now when you talk about our financial

services, wealth management, it was a very people'soriented world where people were using their brains but what was restricting them is that I don't have research access to

this company. I don't have this data, I don't have that. I have asked my research guys, they are not responding in five days. I want a portfolio uploaded. You know the data entry guy is

going to take two hours. Today AI can do everything. So it's a combination of AI RPS. So robotic process automations are also huge because there are a lot of connections to pull in that data. But if

you do that and you build that yourself, you will be 10x of. So what we see our biggest challenge used to be ability to deliver service the ability to manage the number of people and that's where AI

is rocking for financial services it is the biggest boon I think financial services is going to see the massive more greatest increase in their profits okay because their people who understand

this will become much much more productive you know I very personally there is recording I tried to build processes where humans

were not involved and frankly today AI is not ready for that but processes where AI enables a human it is very much ready but there needs to be a human eye to see whether it's doing and that

happens with my also I was joking with them you make mistakes 20% of the time today AI makes only 10%. But we take that 10% mistake and we hype it up. Oh my god, there's a mistake. You

have to figure out why was the mistake. Why is it happening? As he said, you have to figure it out and eventually you know you can just write a prompt check what this guy has done. So I have made a

maker checker in my own prompt that okay everything is done should get rechecked and today mistakes have come down to maybe 0.001. Reason I'm saying 01 because I've not seen a mistake in the

last two months. [clears throat] I have not seen a mistake. I've not seen numbers getting crunched wrong or some fake numbers coming in or something. Okay. So today and the AI has become so

exciting. Earlier you had to even do the prompting. Today you can just simply ask how do you expect me to make a prompt to get this thing done. [laughter] So it'll make a prompt for you also.

It'll first explain to you do this this this is how you make a prompt. Then it'll make a prompt. So today it's becoming so easy. So guys use it to enhance yourself, use it to empower the

self. You know I keep giving these lectures to people. I spent in Dubai with 150 CEOs we did a session but one thing that you know really irked me there that most of the people who are

not Indian origin were actually doing it themselves. Their level of AI NANS or the mix and this the automation they all knew it by heart. they were doing it themselves. Whereas a typical Indian

guy, okay, can I find an EA who can do it for me? Can I find an AI expert? I want to hire this guy. No, point is even if you hire, he's not going to be able to do it. But for the youngsters in

here, it is the biggest opportunity. The people who are not ready to change, you don't get old, you get rigid. The people who have got rigid today, you have the flexibility to replace them.

Thank you. What you said about EA is what I experienced. So I as asking my EA yesterday to book my tickets to Monday and she said Prashant I'm not getting the rightly priced tickets for you. What

should I do? So instead I became her EA and I I went to the Germany and I said find me the best price tickets which fly at this this time. I got seven options. They were all within the price range uh

that I wanted it and I sent it to her. See these are the tickets go and book now. So [laughter] &gt;&gt; yeah so I have actually built myself an EA AIE which automatically will enter

every meeting summarize every meeting find out who's there what needs to be done with them what is the follow-up required with them I have created a separate email so that people know

that's my AI aftar emailing them but it'll keep following themounding them. So uh a question more grounded in on return of investments. So how do you see how do you plan for return on

investments with AI which is grounded in business outcomes because jam and consult. This is very very important. You know typically I am we made a committee we

chose 15 AI projects and then I got get a report seven are done. I say friend what does done mean? AI is never done. Okay. Once it is done one once you think you have completed it has to go into

monitoring you have to see costbenefit analysis. When I said I tried to replace human beings, what I realized AI wasn't reducing my cost. Today some processes we have put on AI like verification

calls because there some human beings used to you know get compromised. So those things we have put on AI but honestly they are costing me 7x of what a human being was doing. We have put AI

on monitoring every camera in the country and immediately flagging if something goes wrong. Today it's costing me 4x that my human team used to be doing. So point is that look AI is not

able to become cheaper than us. But but what AI is doing it can do things where people used to make compromises or people used to miss out. It will not miss out on those things. So today I

feel in financial services it is going to be where I am investing in our processes which are very compliance is very required or those processes cannot be compromised you know it is checking

something where I'm willing to pay an extra price to make sure I get this thing so this is where I am investing in today second thing I'm investing is capability building of my team those

people I have launched a program called beyond those people who are willing to change with AI Okay. So I am investing in them making them AI enabled taking to them to the next level and making it

clear that you may even replace your boss if he doesn't agree to change with the time. So this is that's the second place the AI training I think is a is a big thing and in financial services see

our data as I said used to be. So I think overall the benefit side I think returns are going to get much better. We are going to deliver much better service. Earlier some people used to get

sold a wrong insurance or some people would buy a product which was not right for them. Today that not going to happen with AI. AI is going to explain to them AI is going to sell. Please listen to

these five points. You must know them. Okay. Or today we are able to quicken our service 24 by7. We are able to give him a response then and there. We have built an AI bot to explain motor

insurance do quotes. Earlier taking making a quote used to take half an hour. Today that quote can be made in 30 seconds. Okay. And customer can be told comparisons can be done. So I think the

experience is going to go up. The portfolio returns are going to go up because a lot of people had mistakes in the portfolio. For us to analyze two lakh portfolios was a crazy task. Today

my AI analyzes 500 portfolios every day and I'm trying to save on the cost of compute but I can actually do even two lakh portfolios. It is computing it is finding out the mistakes. It's finding

out how the portfolio can be optimized. It is making a lead for the wealth manager. Okay, talk to your client as per us. This is a discussion you should have. This is what is causing or these

are the things. And what we are seeing is that where we have implemented this in the last seven eight months the portfolio returns are all on average at least 5 to 10% higher than nonoptimized

portfolios. So that's a very exciting part. Thank you Sanjep. Uh we got about 10 minutes to go. What I would do is ask one more question to all

three of you and then we'll open it for our audience to ask questions. So uh skill versus mindset and what do you see in this new world of AIE automation? Is it reskilling people

or rewiring decision making uh more important and how would you balance it? ladies always um what I would say to that is I think there's you know both are very important

um you know I did speak a little bit about uh the work that we are doing on skilling when you um the example I gave is across our 60,000 colleagues we have extended

um tools like Microsoft copilot we have trained uh 100% of our colleagues and about 50% of them have actually gone back themselves and chosen to do more deeper um reskilling.

I also shared uh on the earlier question that our AI and data ethics code of conduct and the trainings that we've developed in partnership with University of Edinburgh um as well as of course we

work with several Indian um tier one institutes etc. um you know we have developed a program that we've um uh actually all of our

colleagues uh across the bank have um have attended and certified um but it is about engaging all levels of leadership. I think in a prior question I said that um more than uh

digitization projects or tech projects I think it's really important to engage leaders at all level when you're doing AI deployment at scale especially as well as help them think about um

responsible AI at every layer of the implementation every layer of the stack um so it is going to be about both. I would also given that this group is largely I think banking and financial

services um folks. I will reiterate something I said in the beginning. For us um it is about building deeper and more trusted customer relationships and AI is helping us deepen those

relationships, understand our customers better. Um you know know and meet them in the in the places and choices and moments of matter for them. uh but also um giving them services that are going

to help transform banking for not just our customers but for banking more broadly. And I think to do that um having leaders really think about customer experiences first and think

about how do we deepen and leverage AI to develop more trust and develop more deeper understanding of the needs of our customers I think is the biggest um important um skill to have. um in

addition to of course all of the others that we may be building in areas of expertise that I that I've already talked about. So as an example, I think I shared earlier that about 12,000 of

our engineers across the bank actually use um AI for coding and about 35% of the code is actually generated u by AI. uh but they have to be um you know we want to encourage human agency. We want

to make sure that we are building systems that our customers continue to build deep trust with. So therefore engaging our colleagues making sure each one of them understands and uh

understands their responsibility in it is extremely important for us. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Sanji sir &gt;&gt; for me there is no reskilling it is only

rewiring cuz as I've been trying to make you understand nobody can teach you AI because it is so dynamic every day there's a new tool the only way you can learn AI is do it yourself or go to

YouTube at the end of the day you can watch some video of somebody somewhere in the world would have made something that's the only way but you have to rewire yourself is that how do I

increase my productivity? I understand. See, I am a business owner and AI is all about risk benefit. What what can I share? What data do I put in? I am able to take all the risks. Okay? So, I'm

able to take that call. The only person who can out outvote me is my compliance. So, at the end of the day, no, you know, I'm not going to allow that. That's fine. That's the role I've given to him.

But the point is that I'm able to do it. But and that's what I see the AI is actually getting used by the leaders. But where we have to rewire ourself is that we have to understand that we now

will have to work much harder. You know future offices are not going to be 100 people sitting. It is going to be 15 people sitting with surrounded by five 10 screens and those five 10 screens

each has 10 15 20 bots which are working. Okay. And which are doing the work work for them. today but that's but we have to rewire ourselves to accept that the world has

changed this is a moment like when internet came at that time lot of people said I will never adopt to internet or when the typewriters were people had to give up typewriters and move from

typewriters to computers and the the kind of rewiring that was required at that time so a lot of but those time that time we had time now those same changes are happening at 50x the speed.

You know what I learned today becomes outdated. The bot you make today will not work after 1 month because the model would have changed. So you have to now start doing it yourself. You have to put

your legs up. For me, my most productive days are the days I'm sitting alone and I'm working on training my AI, training my agent, training my AIE, training my AI compliance guy, what needs to be

done, how I need it to be answered, what are the things that he needs to look after, you know. So today it has become very very important like I shared my own example some of the bots I was trying to

make. I was trying to explain to others I want this, I want this. Maybe I had 50 meetings. I was not able to explain but when I started making it myself, it took me six, seven hours. I had to learn

those integrations and this thing. But I was able to make it and then I'm able to tweak it in 1 hour. So I think it is all about rewiring ourselves that the world is changing and let us change with this

time. Let us be flexible. Let us not be rigid and let us change. Let us adopt. And there's such an exciting opportunity for those who are willing to rewire. companies are dying to hire you. You

know I am today hiring people. You know I sometimes put a post if you are innovative you're this thing and I've actually ended up hiring six seven people who are working closely with me

and they're doing a fantastic job. TK my head of not the head but one of my marketing guys you know I gave it he sent me a nice presentation young MBA grad and I sent message to my marketing

has I said hire this guy and today he's doing such a fantastic job what five people used to do he's doing it himself because he knows how to master AI he's doing SEO optimization he's doing this

he's doing this he's doing that because he's been able to make bots and that was his USP And I asked him how long did it take take you to learn master these things.

He says sir 3 weeks I invested in myself. Imagine the power 3 weeks you invest will change your life. &gt;&gt; Thanks Sanjie. I just say before uh Dr. Dsha speaks is I want to be one of those

15 people that are left in the room &gt;&gt; and you have the best opportunity because you are an expert. uh I think uh I completely agree with both Sanjiv and Ruchika and uh I'm

experiencing this right uh you know firsthand so we are hiring we are also reskilling we are also relearning in our teams and the productivity increase is tremendous right right now there might

not be a percentage to put to that but in case I want to hire a new person it it would rather be an intern who has the will to learn something new and who can sit with us throughout and uh completely

understand what we need to do and do that through AI. uh and the example that Sanjiv gave right uh 20 years back 25 years back when the computers first came there was so much resistance and there

was so much apprehensions and there was so much thoughts that but look today the world is different and like one of the leaders yesterday was mentioning in the speeches given

with the PM industrial revolution which took 200 years to take place we are going through that same change only thing is that the complete change an impact and momentum that happened in

200 years is now going to be compressed in just a few years. And that is the power of technology that's happening. Anybody who's sitting in this room or anybody who's outside who says that I

will not take part in this is only you know forcibly keeping himself uh out of the playing field and uh he's going to watch the world go by. All companies everywhere whether it be directly

involved in technology whether it be BFSI or media everyone is touched by this uh power of AI and the only thing that government is doing today is enabling the complete stacks right from

the chips right up to the application layer barring the semiconductors we have the capability to do the all the six layers of the AI stack today and uh the change that will be brought about within

the country and in every institution ution and every enterprise is going to happen from each one of you and you have to learn it and today learning is so easy. You just have to go to any of the

mediums and you can reskill and rewire yourselves. You just have to have the will. So the people that we hire, the people that we have inside, we are looking at how they can re-engineer and

produce the same kind of products maybe better, more secure, more proven and trustworthy, but with the capability of AI that's built in and being in the fintech, a fintech industry, BFSI, this

is the most important thing that you can do that today you reskill and rewire and understand the AI power of AI and do that for your team, for your function, for your company. And that is the most

&gt;&gt; and let's say you know I'd like to say I truly believe financial services stocks are going to deliver fantastic returns over the next few years especially in the companies who are able

to know how to tame the AI. &gt;&gt; I have invested in you other than Nvidia and Broadcom I also have Bajage in my portfolio. So thank [laughter] you.

&gt;&gt; Last four minutes. Uh uh if there are any questions please ask. We may not be able to take all but quick one question at a time. Go ahead. for delivering the solution from market

but the main thing that comes in our issue that is uh due to we don't understand the thing that is data breaches in the fintech segment is so the data in the fintech is wide so I

wanted to ask you all that how the companies how are all companies maintaining the data breach segment that the data is protected and cyber security is ensured in all the segments

&gt;&gt; I think will answer this best &gt;&gt; you know I I'll answer the question really talking about data strategy um you know clearly AI without data would be fairly artificial um right and so for

us at Nat West group we have um really uh doubled down on our data strategy and are in fact uh there's a public partnership we announced with um AWS and Accenture last year where we are working

with them um across the data um uh that we have to to make sure that we have the right guardrails, have the right democratization and therefore are able to power um AI

through it. So um the the only thing I will say on that is that absolutely your data strategy and how you are organizing the data and how you're democratizing data across the organization

um and everything that you do and making sure that it is accessible to um AI and and therefore um is able to build the right customer experiences is critical. &gt;&gt; Yeah.

&gt;&gt; Thank you ma'am. I I would like to add because he has a specific uh query and see having built systems from ground upwards and we are also building systems for hundreds of

our clients and we have client data right what we must ensure is the client's data is secured &gt;&gt; so you might have heard of the term multi-tenant right

&gt;&gt; so when you create a product the product could be uh uni uh unique and it could be universal but the data that you use of the client has to be siloed. So you have to have zero trust security and

show that when the product talks to that particular data, it happens only for that client. I cannot be providing you your answers based on somebody else's data. Right? So ensure there's zero

trust data. The data are siloed protected whether by encryption by other means but I cannot have this happening because then you the client will lose trust.

accessibility and protect the client's data and keep it separate from other clients data methods you use would be you know unique to you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you.

&gt;&gt; One more question. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Hi. So I sit at an intersection of private credit and tech. Uh I want to know your perspective. I mean across BFS we have seen uh AI is taking over fraud

detection support and the mainstream tasks. But when we talk of the other side which is credit you know I do not have an agent yet that can handle my dispersements

what are the bottlenecks you know that's preventing this I mean sir you mentioned that any ten and make is being used extensively outside of India is it the social factors I mean what exact what

exactly are the bottlenecks that stop us doing that &gt;&gt; okay so you know one very interesting point that when we are moving to a virtual world what is going to become

the most important currency Let me ask you that question. &gt;&gt; Data is definitely going to be there. I'm talking about beyond that. For for to build a trust, you need a physical

connect. Yes or no? &gt;&gt; You want to see you get an answer. That's a you don't know whether AI has answered it or a human has answered it and who's behind it. So you want a

physical connect. So what is happening in this AI based data uh rush is is also that lot of you know the forwardthinking organizations have started investing in physical branches also so that where

people can go visit touch and validate. So you know that also has happened because today physical presence will have to be done you know people moving from compliance task checking operations

it's going to move to sales I think sales guys are going to and relationship guys are going to become much much more important their role because people will want when you when you're talking about

your money you don't want to give your money only to a computer which you can never see you want to give your money to a computer which is helping a person who you can see who you can catch who who

you can talk to. So I think that physical presence is going to be definitely there are some roles which are going to get enhanced and especially sales uh or you know any expert role and

and that that's that's the you know I think it's a very exciting place that we are living in there are a lot of exciting uh things happening and when you talk about data see as I said uh I

will answer that little bit question you don't have to put everything in AI You get you have to be very careful. AI is very very expensive. You use AI only to do things which only AI can do. Rest

you use an RPA. An RPA or data is with you. It's a robotic process. It's a pro it's a it's a software written do this calculation do this do. Why would you want to expose that to AI? It's not

required. So it needs to be the right combination. And the way we are doing it is we are protecting it by only giving very limited amount of data and not complete data to one AI agent also. So

like that's what we do with a human being that you get only very limited part of the information on which you are supposed to act not give you the whole information.

I'll have to stop here. I have to stop here. We've run out of time and we'll have the next session starting. Uh you can find me on LinkedIn. Uh send me your questions. I'll get it answered. If

there's a question needs to be answered by Sanjie Ruchika or Dr. Digshit, I will reach out to them, get the answers and send it back to you. So you can send questions on LinkedIn to me. I'll

respond to all of them. Thank you for patience and listening to us. [applause] You can come inside. I have

wonder. You need one more.
