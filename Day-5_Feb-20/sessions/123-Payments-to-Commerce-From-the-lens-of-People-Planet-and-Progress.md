## 📝 Transcript

So when we talk about bringing in government and industry together, combis has a lot of input to share to that which is required for this kind of a topic. And to top it all, this session

is going to be moderated by professor Apernna Gupta. She is the professor at RPI and she's here for us to moderate the sessions. She has uh experience and she comes from the business school at

RPI and she understands the world of finance and therefore she can stitch thing together for each one of them and as I always say there is no one better than a professor to moderate a session

because they know how to ask questions and they know how to keep us in time and they can also check our answers as well. So the panelists need to be on their feet. All right. So with that background

we are really thankful to have you all here and looking forward to your inputs on this beautiful topic of payments to commerce. Professor Aerna over to you. Thank you very much uh Nitendra,

wonderful introduction and uh definitely getting us off on a conversation that is important uh and of course uh we are gifted with uh stellar panelists today here uh who have actually made a big

contribution to this phenomenal extravaganza of an event uh the India AI impact summit. They've actually contributed to many discussions uh around the five days and in fact their

work here is not yet done. They still have more conversations to be part of. So genuinely very thankful to uh to our panelists who have made the trip and uh be part of this event.

&gt;&gt; Absolutely. And it is not always easy to have people from across the globe represented here and we would want to capture this moment in a photo. viewer call can come up to the stage then they

will take a group photo for all of you. So Caroline is coming from Belgium, Professor Aperna from US. Um Com is also from US and Rebecca from Canada. So the photo deserves you all. Thank you. Sorry

professor Ba carry on. So um as we heard this this topic is a very important topic primarily because of the the element that uh Nitendra talk about stitching solutions that

essentially is u important and essential for the end beneficiaries to actually benefit from the innovations. Um and of course uh this session is being recorded and all

the wonderful insights that we will receive from our panelists would be available for a broader audience to consume utilize including me. So I am very interested to hear all the inputs

and insights from the perspective of the Anusand National Research Foundation where I'm currently serving as a visiting as a visiting expert and we are very integrally involved and interested

in adopting uh ideas and pushing forward ideas through call for proposals that would utilize all the insights we will hear today and um look to see how the ANRFAN

research foundation can push forward. So um the the plan today is really to go on a journey from payment to commerce which really is a journey looking to the past and then uh carving out what the future

might look like and really seed some excitement in that process. So that's my first question to the panelists each one of you uh the past decades have been phenomenal for the advancements that

have been made in payment space and India in indeed has made a mark a very compelling significant scaled up mark in that journey but of course payments doesn't solve the actual beneficiaries

problems uh so looking forward to the next decade each of you if I may request what is the transformational changes and shifts do you see that will actually realize the potential of payments

leading leading us to commerce that is AI um enabled and empowered? I can start with com. &gt;&gt; Yeah, happy to. Um thank you for having me and that's an excellent question. I I

feel like I'm home here at this panel here with all of you on payments because I started my career in payments. Uh I worked uh in government on policy and especially around sort of fin

technologies and how they can better uh you know lead to safe affordable convenient uh financial products and services for people. So really focusing on on the outcome and how can we better

serve people through technology. So technology as a means to help you know reach people and payments is such a critical part of our daily lives um and and involved in every facet of our life

um and especially touching on commerce. So having had the the opportunity to work within government um on you know payments policy and and getting to see the innovations over the past decade and

two decades and you know um we're here um I see Mastercard is here you know I I um you know I want to really commend um you know everyone on stage here because I feel like you know we've each of us in

our own individual way have kind of contributed to this to this journey. you know, I I would say, you know, at its best, I think, you know, there's there's many innovations

over the past decade that have been um you know, kind of very transformative. Obviously, you know, any any innovation that has made payments more seamless, more um more accessible to everyone. Um

and you know obviously with the developments of the smartphone and you know more of the digital wallets and and more of the um you know uh innovations that allow for more people to have

access to the you know safe uh secure sort of financial system and the financial rails is a good thing. So I think you know being here um you know in India and I think you know President

Mcronone said at the summit uh was it yesterday um that you know India has activated you know uh has been kind of the leader in and champion of digital payments and bringing you know 1.2 to

was a you know bill online in um in the sort of digital in the e-commerce space. Um so it's these kinds of innovations that I think we need to encourage and promote and and there's been a lot of um

developments obviously with AI and making financial services more personalized to the consumer uh to more um anticipate perhaps their needs and be able to then um uh you know

give them guidance and advice and towards you know uh making smarter financial decisions, financial choices at the same time again thinking of uh Mastercard that does has a a brilliant

responsible AI strategy and I know we will get into further topics and discussions but you know in terms of security as well you know for AI being used for fraud detection and protecting

consumers from harm. So, there's a lot of applications and innovations. And again, apologies if I'm kind of rambling on, but I I I do think that there's a lot of um progress that's being made,

and I I I just I see there's so much um so much more that we could be doing um for the future. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. I would pick up on the personalization and the security

strengthening which really uh is important for further development. Caroline, thank you so much. So, just to set the scene, uh, in the

last era, digital payments removed friction at the moment of payment. Right now, in the new era, aentic commerce removes friction at every single step across the entire journey during

discovery, during comparison, negotiation, checkout, and then post purchase service. And that's where the agent is allowed to take multiple step actions and that's really the game

changer where AI moves from being an AI that recommends to AI that acts. Now back to your question about we can come back to the security in a moment but back back to your question about

what excites me. I think it's kind of the same, you know. I think we all hope and we're excited about the the thought or the dream that uh Agentic AI and Agentic will advance financial inclusion

so that everyone and everywhere becomes financially healthy. Excellent. So, advances in agentic AI in payment to commerce and that really creating doors for opening doors for

lots of new uh things that we will experience and enjoy. Rebecca Um, yes, agents, I was I was that was exactly what I was going to say, too. But let me begin by saying thank you so much for

inviting me to be part of this panel. It's a pleasure to be here and it has been an extraordinary experience to be here all week. And I love the framing of planet progress payments because it

really does speak to the connectivity of the all of the themes that we have touched on as they relate to AI through this impact summit. So thank you so much. It's also a pleasure to be on a

panel uh hosted by Mastercard because my very first career, my very first job, corporate job was at Mastercard and it was a phenomenal career training ground and I think about all of the lessons

that I learned there. Um that was many years ago now, but but it's still it's still a a very very uh good memory and I hold dear um all of the things that I learned. So agents I think are what both

excite me and make me yeah slightly nervous in this moment. A uh agents are and and I think this is exactly what you were saying. They're sort of the fulfillment of the AI promise, right? So

much about AI has been narrow predictive models that are able to work in very constrained and specific settings for all sorts of things like fraud detection or otherwise. Then we had generative AI

models that were able to synthesize text and communicate and we now have chat bots and we see we see operational applications of that generative AI technology. But agents are the action.

They're what takes these generative AI models and allows you to have an agent acting on your behalf. And that is all opens up a whole set of opportunities, a whole set of competitive and innovative

business models. Um that will allow for us to maybe get to that point where we don't have to spend our day answering emails all day long, right? Like all of those things that get in the way of us

being truly truly productive, whatever they may be. Or maybe they'll allow for an entrepreneur to do all sorts of things without having to first recruit a staff and team. And so there's this real

potential to accelerate the benefits of AI. And then of course as we know that also means that we need to have very very clear assurance measures and mechanisms in place about validating

identification. Um and particularly when we take agents and move into a multi- aent world um we can we can talk a little bit about that as well. But I think it is an exciting moment. Uh I am

I'm an an optimist on every level and I think uh we have our work cut out for us but we're we're ready to do it. &gt;&gt; Excellent. I like the agentic AI but so of course we will we'll discuss more

about the but part and in rest of the discussion. So with with that kind of a lay of the land looking forward uh we'll take a little bit deeper into uh getting into the strategic view of what

implementations might look like to get where we hope to be in the next decade where trust is a very fundamental issue and Caroline you mentioned security very connected and trust cannot be

accidentally built it has to be built from design by design. So what are the the the best frameworks you would suggest for building trust by design into the innovations that bring us

forward Caroline? &gt;&gt; Yes, absolutely. And as you said it's uh autonomy can only scale or agentic can only scale if there's trust. Um so and I think Mastercard uh believes that

actually we have a key role to play to really enhance trust across the whole ecosystem. And so we came up with a framework to make sure that agentic transactions are safe and secure. And so

let me give you a little bit a recipe based on four keys. First, it's really important to know your agents. We want to make sure that the agent is legitimate and not a rogue

bot or fraudster. And today it's really difficult actually to to do that. Um so before the agent acts before it initiates transaction the agent has to be verified registered trusted.

Second of course we talk about privacy by design security by design. This is and remains the foundation. And going back to security, um we leveraging our capabilities in terms of

tokenization, authentication, making sure that you are who you say you are, you know, behind the agent and also protecting and hiding basically the sensitive credentials. For example,

making sure that your card number is not visible or exposed in third party environments. A third piece relates to the consumer intent. really important to make sure

that a consumer remains in full control of what he or she um asked the agents to buy on his or her behalf. &gt;&gt; And so we have a a a fun story that happened a couple of months ago at

Mastercard is an employee wanted to test an AI agent and said, "Hey, can you are you able to buy sushies?" But the idea was just do you have the capability to do so? But of course, the agent thought,

"Oh, of course." and then it promptly uh place the order using the employee card on file. So very important actually to make sure that you have clear intent to buy and you can verify it. And then

fourth everything has to be observable, traceable and auditable. You need to be able to reconstruct how the decision was being made so that if seems something goes wrong, you can give the consumer

with address um dispute resolution and of course you need to make sure that you can make regulators happy and comfortable. And so these guards are not there to slow down the adoption of AI

but really enable AI to be and agent commerce to scale um with trust by design. Absolutely. So I'm very happy that you mentioned regulators because the

industry this the financial services systems don't function in vacuum they they function in a very complex environment so lot of infrastructural advancement to support of course with

regulatory oversight so so comb is in terms of infrastructure what upgrades and advancements do you see that will help us securely scale for the decade ahead?

Absolutely. I just But I I love how Caroline mentioned or said about know your agent. It made me think of like know your customer and it's like now we're going to have an additional layer.

But I think I mean it's absolutely correct. Um it points to I think the need for governance. Um governance should precede scale. Um organizations I think they need clarity

before they have deployment. So and the perfect example that that Caroline gave you know what data that AI or the agent you know the agent can access what actions it can take and when humans must

intervene. So there needs to be that humans in the loop human oversight. There needs to be that um that layer of the that will allow for whether it's regulators or whether it's the you know

organization or the customers to have that auditable trail to know you know the process from beginning to end um and and when humans must intervene

um and then I think when those boundaries are defined up front and then they're enforced consistently that innovation becomes sustainable. But but governance is key. Um and I think you

know we we talked about sort of security by design, privacy by design, but um we need to have those in place before these applications

are then scalable and you know it it can't be retrofitted. It needs to be from the be you know at the start. Absolutely. So the regulators role kind of came up and and you mentioned policy

and governance. Where is the boundary between regulation, policy and governance in in ensuring all the uh oversight capabilities are in place for a responsible development and scaling?

Rebecca, &gt;&gt; um, very happy to to to uh, reflect on that question and and maybe before I pick up on the question of governing agents, it would be helpful for me to

just say that the organization that I'm I'm privileged to lead is the partnership on AI, which is a global nonprofit organization. We have about 140 partners in 19 countries. And what's

unique about those partners is that we bring together very large technology companies, very large enterprise financial services companies and we bring them together with academics who

are studying and publishing about many of the core aspects of technology and bring in a whole set of disciplines that need to be engaged in this conversation. We also bring in civil society. We bring

in advocates who are very much focused on what is the you know what needs to be regulated and what what are the harms both the current harms and the potential future harms and that gives us the

opportunity sort of look around the corner. We have good good insights that come out of the large technology companies and then help the community to sort of keep up to speed and sort of

keep working at pace. And so last year we identified agents. Um you know remember that I think it was 2024 was going to be the year of agents. Uh and so we put together this really

phenomenal international working group just to try to put some definitions around it because everybody was talking about agents but we didn't we didn't know uh what we all meant. And I one of

the pieces and Caroline this just directly relates to all of those elements of of governance that you mentioned. We put together a risk framework because the reality is that

real time failure detection monitoring so when these agents do not work is very hard to do and there are some circumstances where having human oversight just isn't going to be

appropriate. We're not going to get the benefits of the innovation if it's there. So picking up on the on your framework, we identified can you understand agents through three

components to better understand their level of risk. So one is clearly the stakes. What are the stakes? Financial services high stakes, right? Restaurant reservations potentially much lower

stakes, right? Test environments versus real world environments. So what are the stakes? How do we understand that? What is the scope? What are what authority are you giving to these agents? and what

actions are they able to take on your behalf? That is there's quite a spectrum, right, of the ways in which you could limit and some of the early agents we saw were very constrained,

right? Some less constraint now. Um and then third, can you reverse it? Is this a reversible action? Right? So with those three sort of core elements, we could help uh many of the companies who

come to us to better understand okay if I'm going to think about an agent application, what are these this just to get us started in thinking about what level of real-time detection failure do

we have uh failure mode detection do we need to have in place? So that's an example of some of some of the work that uh we do and now we're taking that work to look at very specific use cases and

and financial services is one of those areas because we think so much about AI is when you get into the use case you really start to understand what the risks are and that goes back to the

question of regulation right and and when you're operating in a highly regulated sector uh versus in a in a less regulated sector what does that mean in terms of the guard rails that

are in place and we do fundamentally believe at PI that there's not a silver bullet for governance and control. It has to be an ecosystem of actors and one piece of it is clearly voluntary good

governance uh disclosures uh ongoing monitoring uh and transparency. There's a whole set of things around standards and certification and auditing which is key and yes there's a component for

regulation as well. &gt;&gt; Excellent. So, so I think that draws up a a nice picture at the strategic level, trust infrastructure and policy and guidance and governance frameworks

necessary for the the the strategic view of how the transformation might be possible and then of course taking a dive into a little bit into the weeds for the operational elements of what

might we be missing in the implementation at the operational level. So, so com what do you see that we tend to underestimate in the operationalization of these great ideas

and of course we are not transforming things for the first time. We've seen journeys in the past and so what do you think you might have seen that we should have learned or have learned uh that we

could benefit for in the future for the operational challenges? &gt;&gt; No absolutely I think I think there are three things that we kind of underestimate. One is the visibility. So

looking at you cannot govern what you can't see. I mean it sounds easy. I mean it's like yes that makes sense. Um the second is boundaries. You know guard rails must be defined before deployment.

And I would say the third is what we would call sort of dependence mapping. But it in these interconnected systems you know if you have one failure here it could be a cascade of failures. And so

in that case anticipation matters more than the reaction. Um you know my time in government and you know having now worked in in the private sector um you know we tend to generally

be more reactionary. we you know we we regulate based on some some incident and then we we you know we put together kind of a a solution based on that incident. So I think what the

the panel has said is we need to be a bit more anticipatory in how we handle sort of you know how we how we handle governance and it's not something that's like an afterthought

but it's something that is really at the forefront of the strategy of the approach um and at the operational layer as well. I mean we we do you know see situations where you know AI is deployed

and scaled in a not so responsible manner. Um and that really hurts not only the industry as a whole but it hurts a lot of the applications entrepreneurs that are developing these

awe inspiring innovations especially in healthcare. incredible innovations in in healthcare using AI and I think there needs to be whether it's through the partnership for AI or other

organizations that focus on model frameworks. I think what you were describing was a perfect example, Rebecca, of a model framework that industries, um, enterprises,

organizations that are considering adopting AI, um, and leveraging, you know, these new technologies that there is a governance layer and there is a mechanism in place to ensure that

consumers are protected from any potential harm. I would say that the cascading risks is is a massive issue because they usually grow into a bigger issue because they

are cascading down to uh cause a larger footprint of damage and then of course arising from a siloed way of functioning which is exactly where the whole partnership needs come in. So so

essentially from operational risk at the infrastructural core and connectivity of uh interoperability and uh and non-siloed ways of creating the the systems to the end beneficiary the users

their benefits their uh rights and protection and privacy. Uh Caroline, what should we be careful about in in guard rails being put together to ensure that the user privacy and rights are

protected? &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. Um I think it's important actually for companies or for anyone uh working with AI to keep the people at the center. And so how do you

do that? Um first it's really important to have principle foundational principles that act as your northstar and so at Mastercard we have developed data and tech responsibility principles

that guide everything that we do with data and AI these are consumercentric principles very easy to understand for everyone and applying everywhere and they're really important to um instill a

culture of responsibility across the company and so these are easy principles like privacy and security, transparency, accountability, fairness and inclusion. Now, of course, you want to make sure

that you um bring these principles to life that you make them operational. That's the hard piece, right? So, that's where we developed an AI governance program to really embed these principles

into the life cycle of all our innovations uh from day one. And um we also take the strictest standards as the baseline to design these innovations because it's much easier for product

development teams to deal with one single standards even if it's a strict one than actually having to deal with a multitude of different rules. And so these governance frameworks is actually

what is important to make sure that you walk the talk. And then the third piece is actually technology is also part of the solution. you know, embedding technical standards, you know, your AI

systems. What's important is that these AI systems or agents don't operate with open-ended autonomy. And so you want to make sure that they act within guided by

your principles, your values, and then within clear permissions. So you need to make sure that you you make it clear what is the agent able or authorized to do, what is not, and where must the

human step in. And of course all of this is a iterative process. It's not a one-off uh control point. It has to be constantly reviewed, audited, improved. Um yeah, I think

actually these are strong art wheels. Absolutely. I would pick up on walk the talk and and an iterative process because as we were earlier talking the the ecosystem the world is evolving so

rapidly that if you created solutions today it's not like they'll actually be relevant in a year and if you're talking about a horizon of 10 years there's a lot of iterations in the way along the

way. So looking at from the strategic and then operational, we have a little bit of a layout drawn out uh in terms of having an ecosystem where more AI innovators can create solutions and

provide value propositions. So uh Rebecca, what do you think a healthy ecosystem looks like to achieve what we want to achieve in the next decade? &gt;&gt; That's a great question. I I think let

me start with with one aspect which I think is crucial and may not be apparent for those who may not be currently sort of working uh with AI with AI or with an organization with AI. I'm everybody's

using it on a personal level but you know in terms of um on on an organizational level and that is that there's a very complex value chain. you talked about sort of the consequences of

of runon and and um increasing in cumulative risk and um one of the the things that I think is is just extraordinarily important for all of us who are in the value chain is to

understand all of the levels of risk across the value chain. It's it's you know deploying an AI system or procuring an AI system is is different from a SAS application or a software upgrade right

because the the the AI system changes in the real world and so real time monitoring of what whether and how reliable it is based on the constraints and and parameters that you have set for

it is crucially important. But that complicates the procurement process and the understanding of just what an enterprise might need when it is p purchasing a a particular API delivered

foundation model or an open model and thinking about how that works. So this notion of each actor on the value chain having a different set of responsibilities

uh both to the public um and to the government but also to each other and a lot of this is about transparency. So how do we set up these mechanisms whether they're model cards or

disclosures whereby we can create greater trust across the value chain? That might seem like a sort of, you know, um, rather sort of, um, commercial interest piece, right? But this is

fundamental to unlocking the benefits that we all want to see AI deployed and to deliver in our communities, whether it's in healthcare settings, payment settings. Um, think about all of the

potential for AI. And what I hear from uh different actors all the way across that value chain is we just need much more clarity about what the distinctive risks are. Um and then and and and I

have to say like the value chain right goes all the way from uh the uh minerals and resources that are to be employed through the data through to the compute through to the model developers through

to the deployers through to the ML ops and the asurers and there really so we've done a lot of work to articulate what this ecosystem of the value chain looks like and how crucially important

it is that we get both a sense of individual actor and share responsibility and then shared responsibility across the value chain in order to unlock the benefits of AI.

&gt;&gt; That's a very broad value chain you laid out. Wanted to see if if you think we we miss bringing or having somebody at the table in that value chain, which you already

drew pretty broadly, but &gt;&gt; I love this question. I think you're absolutely right. I mean, and and then thank you for asking the question because you know um Karolene talked

about customer trust, right? and um the role of uh citizen and community engagement in this and I have been very heartened to see some of the really phenomenal uh inclusive design work that

is happening to better understand uh well sort of in terms of the applications themselves about how they are effectively meeting community needs and how do you do that effectively and

then there are other questions like data centers and making sure communities are engaged in those discussions. So I think um you know we operate our our businesses within a broader moral

license right and the moral license comes from the support that we have from the citizens and communities uh uh that we act in not to mention the employees that we recruit um to be to be part of

this work as well. So I I thank you for uh acknowledging that because I think that's an important piece of of the puzzle that we always have to keep top of mind.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. uh comb you you you function in various sectors and you actually mentioned health. Uh so what opportunities might we have for knowledge transfer in terms of ways by

which we could be moving faster more efficiently that other sectors have experienced and we benefit from in the payment to commerce journey. &gt;&gt; Yeah know that's an excellent question.

I think you know u the knowledge transfer the from whether it's in the payment space or whether it's in health or whether it's in you know other industries I think some of it is trans

translatable transferable um especially when it comes to best practices model frameworks standards um I think organizations forums such as the partnership on AI

um are helping to contribute to that knowledge transfer. Um and I think they're you know also organizations and sort of the uh sort of international um you know whether it's OECD whether it's

the ITU um that are that are pivotal to shaping sort of the the dialogue that is going into a lot of the kind of what are those best practices? what does good governance look like? And I think a lot

of you know enterprises that we work that that you know use our platform whether it's financial services um whether it's healthcare and life

sciences whether it's energy you know they are looking for kind of that what does good governance look like and you know those model frameworks I think having um you know just just being part

of those conversations and dialogue and having a seat at the table and be able to kind of contribute to uh defining and and shaping whether it's the standards, whether it's the you know

terminology I think could be really helpful. Um and I I think yeah that's how we're going to sort of progress even further by bringing everyone along and we're not excluding um you know whether

it's civil civil society or whether we're not excluding like one sector that is heavily influenced uh or impacted um and in this space payments it's it's everyone.

So, so would it be fair to say that the the closest sister sector would be the health care sector that the financial services could link and benefit from by standards and innovation frameworks?

&gt;&gt; I believe so. Yes. &gt;&gt; Excellent. So, you validated something that I would want to pursue going forward and the innovations being done in the Indian context. Uh so uh let me

uh request for questions as you think of some coming up from the audience and then of course I'm going to request our panelists to offer specific advice to learners, researchers and entrepreneurs,

innovators and entrepreneurs in terms of what uh they should be aware of for solutions, problems, attitudes, mindsets, skills. So if each of you can give one piece of advice to those three

segments, learners, researchers, and entrepreneurs starting from Rebecca. &gt;&gt; Well, first and foremost, use the tools. You can't understand them if you don't use them. Uh be very cautious, be very

careful about your privacy, but it is important that you use the tools so you can get a better understanding of how well you know what they do and what they don't do. and you can get a better

understanding of how comfortable what your perception of risk is associated in using those tools and what benefits they can really drive for you. So that's my my first one. And then of course from a

multistakeholder organization I always say wherever you are find somebody you don't know hopefully has a very different perspective from from yours. Listen to them. Find some opportunity to

work together um and do some good work. &gt;&gt; I like that. So I would say you know there's sometimes that myth that you need to have a STEM degree uh to know coding to

be involved in AI. Let's be honest, nobody's a real expert in AI because the technology is moving so fast. What you know today may be totally out of date tomorrow. What you

really need is a growth mindset. The willingness to learn, to adapt, to listen to others, to partner because you know uh AI governance is really a team sport and what it needs is a diversity

of perspectives, gen gender, cultures, backgrounds. So yeah, so I think you're all ready to work on AI. &gt;&gt; Excellent.

&gt;&gt; I was just say I don't know if I could add any more to that because I I uh I think uh both Karolene and and Rebecca said it best, but yeah, just be willing to be curious, be willing to experiment,

test, learn, and and uh and it's through the sort of that mindset that you know really you're going to benefit from. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. So, so I would definitely uh repeat at least two things that I heard

as in talk to people, communicate, learn and and I learned today in terms of the the health and the financial services closeness and how solutions can be benefiting from each other and how they

scale and be responsive to the needs uh and and not being conditioned by having a tech training to create solutions because if you have a different training, you actually bring the

diversity of intellectual understanding and different users and what perspectives they may have. So that's very beneficial. So so let me uh wrap up uh with a request to our panelists with

one sentence of what would you say or see when uh say in 10 years uh that would make you feel like we have arrived and I'm going to start with Congress this time.

&gt;&gt; Okay. Um, you know what I what I guess what I'd like to see is that we don't, you know, we talk about a major theme of this summit has been sort of that

responsible AI and I what I'd like to see is that 10 10 years down the line that it's not um that it's the norm rather responsible deployment and not sort of some competitive advantage.

Going back to the opening about the excitement, I hope that everyone including the young, the old generations, the minorities, the underrepresented uh populations,

everyone equally benefits from AI everywhere. &gt;&gt; Excellent Rebecca. Well, being in India, um I I hope and I expect quite frankly to see the u so much of the leading

frontier innovation to come out of countries like India where there's this deep deep deep interest and passion in AI, deep deep capacity for uh education and engineering knowledge and expertise

and deep commitment to to democratic inclusion as we've seen this week with this just phenomenal interest in the and engagement in the in the summit. So, I would love to see the center of the

eye-catching innovation uh and truly beneficial and responsible innovation um moving from uh some of the the countries in the west that are currently dominating to see some of the some of

the builders and makers being much more global in nature. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. So, so thank you for summarizing what we can look forward to and and experience that excitement

beyond these five days of very intense excitement if I may say so and a lot of hard work on the on the uh part of the panelists. Uh let me open up for questions if there are any. Uh and of

course we we definitely have time for some questions. So is there a mic uh we could share and put up some questions. The question is to understand the money part of it. So when we are moving from

payment to commerce and all the things that you mentioned with respect to investments that we need to do from an infrastructure perspective, from a policy perspective, there are

stakeholders that we have to convince. So what's the opportunity that from a revenue perspective that you see is worth putting in all these agents doing all these collaborations? What's the

business opportunity for anyone to invest in this what you just said to jump in? Well, I think this is such an important question, right? Because um if there isn't a market incentive to

drive forward innovation, we won't see it. Um, and I think what I'm what I was saying about the the need for transparency and assurance across the ecosystem is that companies are really

trying to determine what is the market incentive and that leads right back to investors, right? And I often hear that investors themselves are trying to sort of figure out the risks uh and rewards

with regard to um uh new opportunities for for investment or otherwise. So I think it's very important that we understand that there are a number of incentives that drive uh the the

investment in payment in development and uh part of that is having having a much better and stronger way to assure and measure and govern these models as well. &gt;&gt; Did you want to add?

&gt;&gt; Yeah, I I I I would like to add. Um, no, I think I think you're exactly right and Rebecca, you know, you you said it exactly best that there has to be there has to be that return on investment.

There has to be that ROI. Look, I'm I'm at a, you know, enterprise, you know, software company. You know, we're definitely profit driven. I was in government. We were very missiondriven.

combine the two and just imagine the awesome you know power and money investment will come if you find that kind of an innovation that combines the two

&gt;&gt; and I'm just going to compliment so investing in AI governance investigular is investing in trust and investing in trust is priceless right Nitra &gt;&gt; love that

&gt;&gt; all right I think we'll we'll wrap up with that there's a large red screen here that says time's up. So I'll take that as the indication that we have to wrap up. I want to thank our panelists

for the insights and the wonderful uh guidance they have offered for all the group uh and people here and those that will tune in to listen to our discussion online now and in future. Uh once again

thank you very much. &gt;&gt; Thank you.
