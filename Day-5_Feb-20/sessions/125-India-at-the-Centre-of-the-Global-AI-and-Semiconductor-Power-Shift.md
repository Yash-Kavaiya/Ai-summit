## 📝 Transcript

Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining AMD's session on the global semiconductor power shift and the center of global AI shifting to India right now. We're excited to begin

what promises to be one of the most interesting conversations of the day. a leadership fireside chat on India at the center of global AI and semiconductor power shift at a time when AI capability

is increasingly tied to computer infrastructure, industrial capacity and national competitiveness. This discussion brings together leaders who sit at the intersection of policy,

manufacturing and advanced computing. It is my privilege to invite our moderator for this session. Leading this conversation is Jaya Jagadesh, senior vice president of silicon design

engineering and country head at AMD India. Ja has been instrumental in building one of AMD's largest global design centers with teams contributing across CPUs, GPUs, SOC's and AI engines

that power cutting edge compute systems worldwide. She brings a rare combination of deep silicon expertise, global product leadership and national ecosystem engagement. She's deeply

committed to talent development in the ecosystem as well. Please join me in welcoming Jaya who'll be moderating our session. [applause] Our first panelist is Dr. Thomas

Zakaraya, senior vice president for strategic tech technical partnerships and public policy at AMD Inc. Dr. Zakaraya previously led Oakidge National Laboratory where he

oversaw the deployment of multiple worldleading supercomputing systems including Frontier the first exascale supercomputer. His career spans scientific discovery, national computer

infrastructure, public policy and global partnerships. Please welcome Dr. Thomas Zakaraya. Joining us is Professor Vive Kumar Singh, senior adviser on science and

technology at NITIO. Professor Singh plays a central role in shaping India's science technology and innovation architecture from R&amp;D governance to university industry collaboration and

state level innovation ecosystems with a level in uh with a with a background in computer science data analytics and experience in academic leadership at leading institutions. He bridges

research depth with national policy execution. Please welcome Professor Vikram Vive Kumar Singh. My apologies. [applause] And finally we have Mr. Rahul Girk,

founder and CEO of Mowglick. Rahul has built one of India's leading industrial supply chain platforms and has expanded into manufacturing and industrial finance navigating the realities of

scale, capital and execution in India's industrial ecosystem. Please welcome Mr. Rahul Ger. We will now be beginning the discussion. Thank you so much for joining us.

All right. Uh good afternoon everyone and I would like to extend a very warm welcome to each one of you for this uh session and thank you for taking time to be here with us. So we are uh meeting at

a moment when AI is no longer a niche technology and these conversations have become foundational and it's a there is a shift in shaping the entire economies and that's the global impact that this

technology can have and having spent about three decades in semiconductor industry doing design engineering I've seen compute evolve from from a singlethreaded processor to massively

parallel AI systems and that's stupendous growth that we have seen and a transformation of technology and honestly AI is is a technology that that is probably the most

transformational that we will be able to see in our lifetimes and true AI leadership is something globally there's a contest every country wants to achieve achieve self-reliance and you know uh

leadership in AI and that's the importance of this technology that we're talking but true AI leadership itself happens when silicon software systems and policy all of these aspects have to

come together to achieve that leadership no one aspect can really get us there and that's what truly excites me uh for today's session we have expert experts uh who have the knowledge in each of

these many of these aspects and we will be uh you know asking questions and they'll be sharing their perspectives on this which I'm sure all of us will enjoy listening to.

So coming to India, you know, from what I see, India is truly well poised for this technology shift and we bring together engineering talent, silicon design strength and a growing ecosystem

of system and infrastructure partners including manufacturing. But what truly defines and makes this moment different is the scale and the speed at which we are moving.

So uh we do see a strong commitment but what is also important is collaboration. No one country or one organization can you know truly achieve the results or or be successful at this but we all need to

collaborate. We all need to be become very aware because this is not a simple thing. It has the potential to touch human lives and and humanity at a larger scale. So through this panel today I

want to look at three perspectives. First, how do we continue to build the intellectual foundation? Second, how do we build manufacturing depth and supply chain resilience through a sustained

investment model? And third, how do we build a credible sovereign AI capability? &gt;&gt; So with this uh I will uh get to Vive. I'll start with Dr. Vive. Thank you for

being here sir. Uh my uh question is if India uh you have great experience in shaping the national science and technology strategy and if India truly wants to become a credible center for AI

and semiconductors where should we focus first and what is the government doing to enable it? Thank you Ja. Uh it's a very important thing uh very important question. uh I

think India has already taken a call to go in a big way in the whole deep tech domain and uh lot of changes that we see happening in terms of AI compute then uh you know AI data centers and so on uh

recently we all heard about the tax holidays for data centers that are going to be created in India uh also you know platforms like AI kosh because that's that's very very important if you want

to create AI I applications for India, you need AI data which is you know centered in India which is for the context of India. So what I believe you know when you talk about credibility and

how how credible we are in this into this you know deep tech domain comprising AI semiconductor biio manufacturing even you know other areas what is very very important is that

credibility doesn't come only from announcements. So what we what we really need to know and what we really need to do is to go at a scale and fortunately a lot of positive changes are already

happening. we have uh India AI mission we all know about that 10,000 plus crores for 5 years and it's a very systematic effort where we have almost all so all seven pillars address you

know all kind of needs that we need for AI and similarly if you look at semiconductors we we all know about what is happening in fabs uh also you know we know that India has a very strong

ecosystem of you know VSSI design semiconductor design and so on unfortunately most of the IP is not with India but you know there's a time when is also going to happen that India would

also be owning a lot of IP so credibility I think for India would be very very important and this is coming not only as part of announcement but it's it's coming you know as part of

commitment for for you know for scaled deployments for scaled growth accelerated growth and what we see now is something you know which nobody could have thought of 10 years back or 5 years

back so we I believe we are on the track And we are very much into you know in into the whole uh realm of AI and semiconductors and lot of push is there and the whole ecosystem is evolving and

and we all as we move further we all are going to work towards you know uh creating a very very credible ecosystem for overall growth of the sector. &gt;&gt; No great insights. Thank you Vive. Uh

now moving to Rahul. There's clear clearly a growing momentum to strengthen manufacturing in India. Given your journey, you have expanded Mowgllex from digital marketplaces into manufacturing

and industrial financing. Do you believe the Indian private sector is truly ready financially and have the mindset to take on long-term investments that are needed?

&gt;&gt; So firstly, thanking thank you for having me. I think uh um I think the question is very pertinent because again pre-COVID uh there was a very different environment uh both from a geopolitics

perspective uh supply chain perspective and I think the supply chain as a word started to become popular in co times. So uh uh and I I think I take some pride in the fact that at least as Moglex we

have been part of seeing the supply chain journey in the country as well as continuing to now see the manufacturing journey. on the specific point that you raised on um both from a will

perspective, capital perspective, demand perspective. If you look at these three aspects of it uh so I think uh the demand in the country clearly is growing rapidly and one of the changes that has

happened obviously India becoming the larger uh in terms of GDP size uh consumer demand, people expecting faster and faster products, people want variety of products so on so forth. So I think

demand discretionary spread is increasing. The one significant change that has happened postco we see is that while the demand is growing there is also an increasing uh appetite for

people to start building more and more manufacturing to also start to look at many of those being localized rather than just depend on global supply chains because obviously we have gone through

moments where like we we may not have enough mask capacity in the country. we may not have enough oxygen concentrator capacity in the country and we some of those shocks kind of uh got both the

private and the public sector realizing that there is a a bare minimum manufacturing that needs to happen in the country for it to be truly self-reliant at the population scale

that we are in. So I think that will has gotten generated the capital is starting to flow in. I think the question on whether the capital is large enough and long-term enough I think we are seeing

increasing trend that there are clearly government will whether it is in terms of the uh fund that we have seen of one lakh k now $1.2 2 billion for uh specific AI deep tech things like that

but also private uh capital which within this week the numbers that I'm hearing is more than hundred billion dollar plus commitment from the private capital uh companies saying that they're going to

invest into data centers localizing so on so forth so I think the capital is happening today is it happening broadbase the answer may be no but has it started to happen and has it started

to go from like maybe few hundred kores to few billions of dollars so that is happening Can we execute at the same speed and scale? Only time will tell.

&gt;&gt; Sure. No, there's definitely an increased momentum. But along with manufacturing, I mean, I'm also biased more towards the design front based on my experience. I do definitely want to

see lot more local startups and and Vive just mentioned we don't have the IPs. I mean having our own IPs is is one of the key steps we need to take. So, so moving on uh question for Thomas. If advanced

fabs remain limited globally, where should India focus on on in the near future? Where can we realistically create value in the next 3 to seven years?

&gt;&gt; Well, thank you J and I just want to echo the the sentiments that uh my colleagues here on the panel have mentioned. So, I'll build on that. So I think the opportunity for India is to to

move from compute to capability right I mean that's really where we need to be and I will I'll pick couple of areas so so sovereignty and resilience gets intermingled so I'm

I'm going to sort of keep those two things separate sovereignty is one where you are really trying to make sure that your data and your application or use cases

are resident in in in country and it's relevant to country and that's an area that is uniquely India's to lead because no one else is going to do that. It it it has to be done and you already

mentioned the opportunity we were with the CEO of Medi today talking about 50,000 startups. I don't know how to get my head wrapped around 50,000 startups. So

I to asked him can you tell me what the top 50 are so that perhaps a a company like AMD can partner with them try to help them to mature. So so that is on the sovereignty side. On the resiliency

side, the reality is that getting I mean clearly India needs any sovereign country uh expects to have resiliency create their own IP and India should have the same aspiration given this the

scale of ambition and scale of population and and here I think while we certainly should have an ambition to go up the development cycle to the leading edge of chip design.

I think there is an opportunity to also look at being part of the supply chain for leading edge deployment. So you don't necessarily have to be at the 2nmter scale for GPUs or CPUs. There are

critical technology in the deployment at scale of AI infrastructure where India can play a role. For instance, uh we know that the entire ecosystem is going to be driven to optics as interconnect

technology, co- package optics as and there are clear supply chain that is not available globally that is something that is being considered today and leading candidates obviously today I

would say are US, Japan, Malaysia but those are the kind of niche areas where India can start the journey where you are really contributing to the the first of a kind or the end of a kind leading

edge technology. So those that's the way I would approach it. &gt;&gt; No great insights. Thank you Thomas. Uh now continuing today AI leadership is ultimately limited not by ambition but

by access to secure a scalable computing resources. So Thomas continuing with you you have led Exoscale class systems and now work you're working on sovereign AI

partnerships globally in the US programs such as Genesis and broader national compute initiatives have attempted to systematically align infrastructure research and industrial capacity. So

what lessons from th these models are actually applicable uh to India? So I think this is a great area for public private partnership in my view. The public part of it is is a uniquely

government function. Government brings both policy as well as the demand signal particular in the area of science and innovation um critical infrastructure whether it is

energy sector or national security as well as uniquely government missions. And the opportunity here is is to I mean the India has supercomputing mission. I think there is an opportunity and I

think India is already thinking about um deploying these these national supercomputing mission and national scientific infrastructure that is

um on a trajectory to be at global leading scale. So today countries like uh US, China, China is a particularly interesting example. Uh the LA China developed the intellectual ecosystem

around HPC which then translated to AI over a period of 20 to 25 years. It was intentional and if you look at where the AI penetration, AI adoption, AI infrastructure resides globally, you can

directly trace that to investments in in sort of supercomputing mission that build the underlying infrastructure. So I think that is a great opportunity. Um already plans are there. Uh but you know

it's not a static view. So one of the things that I would encourage as we plan for the future is not plan based on where things are but plan on where things will be by the time we deploy

these kind of infrastructure. &gt;&gt; No that's great future looking uh planning is what we really need. Great. Thank you Thomas. Uh Vive moving to you from a policy standpoint. How do we

balance national security concerns with openness and global collaboration? &gt;&gt; Well, it's a very tricky question I would say. Uh you know for a country like India,

we all know you know I mean the kind of culture that we have in India is we have always believed in the fact that knowledge is a common good and that is how your you know our whole innovation

ecosystem has been operating. Our universities have been creating lot of knowledge and we all you know uh researchers, R&amp;D personals they have been trained with the fact that whatever

you create should be for a you know for a common good. There were never efforts to productize them to convert them into socioeconomic goods to uh you know protect them with you know excess rights

and so on. So that was the that was the common thing that we have been doing earlier. But what is happening now is is a completely different word and that is where our our academia our R&amp;D

institutions are also being asked to you know change the complete course. So it's not only that uh researchers uh you know faculty members in universities they should end up with

research publication and that's all. So it's it's very very important that you productize also. Now what is happening? See if you if you talk about the culture of innovation and how you see in terms

of the global world that we are in uh particularly for sectors like AI and semiconductor. I think what we need to do is we need to go for a you know a strategic decision

making in the sense that what is it that we want to do. So for example there are certain sectors where uh you know the the setup that we using has certain components which may be used

in some critical deployment. So in those cases what we need a set of clarity of rules what is it that we would like to indigenize what is it that we would like to have built on our own and what is it

that we can keep open for for rest of the world for collaboration and so on. So I think what we need is I would say uh two words would be important is strategic autonomy. Autonomy in the

sense that autonomy where it is needed but uh at all other places where we can collaborate with the world where we can contribute in terms of collective knowledge creation India can always play

a role and India is playing a role in terms of the large pool of talent that it contributes across the world. So my my take would be you know a focused strategic autonomy in in this sector

would be the key point for us &gt;&gt; and it's also a fine balance between autonomy and collaboration that we need to create. Great Rahul uh question to you as AI infrastructure scales demand

patterns for chips and hardware will shift. How should Indian manufacturers position themselves early? Where are the first mover advantages? &gt;&gt; Um I think

we are kind of late to the party in some sense in the semiconductor and chips. Uh some say it's two decades, three decades late to the party, right? So and then there are

couple of countries which have a disproportionate advantage not just in terms of what is more popularly known as the 2Nm and uh 23 companies dominating that but also in terms of the entire

ecosystem that is required around all of those factories and uh chipsets and systems so on so forth. So I think uh for us uh I think the India journey will be its own unique path. So that's one

thing that I've always at least over the last 20 years I've seen that if you were to wait for landline to become 10% of the population we would have not had the mobile revolution if you had to wait for

credit cards then I mean like it would not have happened right so I think the in this new era that we are living I think the manufacturers will have to find few spots which may not be as

obvious which uh given the conventional way the countries and ecosystems are built And uh I think uh one of the good advantages of events like this is you

start to have a very large population and smart and talented people throw that sets hundreds of problems simultaneously and maybe 5 years later we'll say like okay we knew that these are the three

things which will work or all of that kind of thing right but I don't think uh uh the there is like a today unique path I mean definitely it does seem that um we need to start building cap

capabilities and capabilities need to be built. Uh design we have capabilities, we don't have the productiz capability. So that is one capability which needs to be built. The manufacturing capability

while we are starting with some of the fabs which are in the mid zone uh but the entire ecosystem of chemical suppliers like clean room suppliers, utility suppliers, uh how do you make

sure that uh there is uh enough packaging uh verification and many of that ecosystem getting developed. So all of those are going to happen simultaneously. So I think the

opportunity remains in all of the areas and I think therefore at least my encouragement to even my management and the way we are looking at Moguls and so on so forth is I mean you try 10 things

do not be scared and uh to try one thing or two things and then you fail and uh conventionally also while in the western and so world there have been horizontal capabilities companies have built and

scaled in India Historically over the last 15 years every startup every large company has built vertical stacks of companies. So they are doing in integrated they may be chip design to

manufacture to systems to product. I mean like that's how just the model has evolved so far. So I think uh that's what vertical man vertical stack manufacturing all parts of the ecosystem

we'll have to give a shot and maybe over time we'll become horizontal. That's great. Thank you Rahu. So uh you know I do see uh quite a few students in the audience. So one thing

that uh we are now facing is kind of with this technology what is knowledge? How do we acquire knowledge? I mean traditionally we go to schools, universities for that but today it's at

your fingertips and with that when the advancement of AI it's it's just going to get better. You want to learn about something you you always have it on your fingertips. So what really do we need?

How do we prepare the next generations for to solve the problems of the future is is the question. I mean we cannot just stick around with our traditional ways of learning and we have to scale

and adapt to the newer ways. So question uh for you Vive how can we uh prepare ourselves and equip ourselves for this next phase that's coming. &gt;&gt; Well I would say uh efforts have already

started. So that's the best thing and uh as you rightly said this is the best time to be a student. You know if you take yourselves 20 years back you'll always be constrained with resources you

know you the best that you have is lot of books you'll have to go to a library there are books that you can't afford and so on and and books are also not on time so you have later editions and so

on. So what is happening now is you know with lot and lot of information which is which is you know can be customized for you specifically uh then you have lot of recommended systems you have retrieval

augmented generation systems you know all of this with generative AI and what is happening so the best part is that you have a plenty of information you want to learn anything you want to

acquire a skill you always have resources and most of the these resources you really don't have to pay for that because there's lot of material that you can access for for free. uh the

programs uh particularly for India we have something called uh NASCOM's future skill prime where you can you know which is an aggregator for lot of online courses similarly there are platforms

across the world that you can use now what is happening is that essentially what we have been doing in our universities engineering colleges and you know other institutions earlier

is that it was largely a kind of memory based learning where we were acquiring knowledge we were memorizing things but now over a period of time it's it's a more synthetic perspective which is

being uh you know percolated across institutions. So students now are going more into that creative aspect where they're able to create solutions for certain problems and with the whole

ecosystem around startups. We all know India is the third largest startup ecosystem of the world with lot of support system that we have. Most of our universities have incubators uh you know

other support systems. So this is the best time and that is why I said this is the best time to be a student. If you want to do anything, if you have a creative idea, you always find support

and there are lot of skilling programs from government of India, from many other organizations, many uh you know philanthropic supports are there. So even lot of organizations which have

their own products, they are you know offering free of cost training to to students. So u this is very good but what is important is largely also due to the fact that you know we keep on

hearing that AI is going to cause a number of you know disruption in terms of jobs that are there because a lot of jobs which were there in in areas like software testing and customer support

and all of that is gone. But at the same time these technologies are also creating new jobs and for that you need to prepare yourself and fortunately the best part is that we have enough

material enough resources enough support system that we can prepare ourselves for the new kind of that are going to come. So this this the whole revolution that we see in front of us will require

massive skilling a [clears throat] bit of reskilling also. Uh so many of my uh you know batchmates 25 years into the careers and they now feel that they have to reskill themselves with many many new

new things you know life was very good somewhere in Silicon Valley 25 years lot of money but now they feel threatened and that is the beauty of startups and you know all these new ideas that are

there. So I would simply end by saying that this is the best time to be a student. Absolutely totally agree. You know, I have to share this uh uh thing. I was actually conducting a panel

discussion within AMD with the senior execs and one of the fun questions was if there is a machine or an equipment that you want to invent, what would it be? And the unanimous answer is I would

love to have a machine that can take me 20 that can make me 20 years younger. Right? So you know you guys are extremely lucky make use of the this opportunity to the maximum.

All right. Uh so as we come to the final leg of this discussion India's opportunity in AI and semiconductors is very real but it's also time bound. Momentum alone will not be enough.

Sequencing capital discipline institutional alignment and infrastructure depth truly matters. And all these areas have to work in complete alignment with each other. So uh you

know let me close the session by asking each of you uh one more question. Uh first one is for Rahul. Uh in the global race where others are moving fast, what is the one move India must execute

flawlessly to stay competitive? I think like many other things I think it's not one move. So [laughter] maybe we do everything is a Bollywood dance move right? So there are like 10

moves to everything. [laughter] Uh but I think uh the one of uh the things which has happened at least from my vantage in the startup ecosystem is uh over the last 15 years we have become

extremely good at being fast followers. Like maybe 15 years back if there was a product or a service in US or in uh Europe it would take 3 to 5 year lag to come to India and now maybe that lag is

like 1 month 15 days I mean like so probably chat GPT within the first 1 month the maximum number of users are coming from India right so we have become extreme fast thanks to technology

that we are fast followers the number of apps that might be built in India might be higher than most countries comb combined together. Maybe US, China might be the only ones but otherwise I think

India would be in the top three in terms of building all the uh apps in the world. I think the move that needs to happen is the scale of ambition beyond India into the global platform because

most of this effort that has happened in last 15 years are around kind of dominating the Indian consumer businesses applications so on so forth. I think we need to up the game on global

and we would require a significant amount of public private upping the game because most of the countries capital pools that we are fighting cannot be only attracted

by the private players. So I mean if someone is raising $100 billion $200 billion we need to at least start the race with 10 billion 15 billion 20 billion right which is not possible

today completely in the private. So I think how do we bring this and push the capital bar, global bar together as a government and as private players. I think that's that's one thing I would

love to see. &gt;&gt; That's a very valid u statement. Right. Uh next question to Thomas. Thomas, if we had to place one strategic

bet that defines India's position in AI and semiconductors by 2030, what should it be? &gt;&gt; So, I'm I'm going to repeat what Rahul said. There is, you know, the one uh I I

don't I don't know much about Bollywood dance moves, but I would say one move is certainly ambitious. I I I'm I'm going to to sort of regress back to a few previous questions since we have a few

minutes. I thought I will I will sort of start with public private alignment. Rahul mentioned that it is very very hard for private sector to raise the kind of capital that's being raised um

elsewhere uh in India and and that's part of it is is you know so one of the important thing that government can do is to derisk that enterprise now I don't

believe that government should derisk a private sector's business venture by investing in that effort. But there are unique places where government can derisk through

public private partnerships that would enable this ecosystem to develop so that additional ventures can be taken up by private sector on their own because I don't think that my taxpayer money

should be used to subsidize. I mean look there is a role um so so you mentioned genesis I did not describe genesis I don't know whether any of you in the audience know what genesis is so I'll

take a couple of minutes to to just discuss that as a opportunity to think about how to frame public private partnership so there's uh today United States spends

a trillion dollars a year in R&amp;D expenditure Right? And roughly about 20 to 25% of that is government. The rest is private sector. Now, if you look at the R&amp;D spend in the

United States, it's been steadily growing at about keeping up with inflation, maybe slightly above inflation, 2 to 3% over year-over-year. But if you look at innovation output,

it's been flatlined. Part of it is because some the the problems are getting more and more complicated. Uh discovering new materials, cure for cancer, all those

things are in increasingly significantly impactful for society but also significantly challenging. So the goal of Genesis project is to really one align public and private partnership.

Two invest government resources to bring academia, national laboratories and private sector to identify what they call light lighthouse problems. So you can call it grand challenge problems

that are relevant that is likely to move the needle across these areas and the government is then investing substantial resources for compute infrastructure software stack uh partnering with

private sector in these important problems because it is uh it is being done in a open collaborative framework. private sector. This work is in my view appropriate for government to invest

because the government is not investing directly in any particular business but the business allow is is able to take the fruits of this collaboration to drive innovation in their own sector. So

I think that is a really good model. I think it was already alluded to. It is if you are a fast follower or if you follow anybody the danger is that it may be appropriate for a business but as a

nation anytime you follow somebody and if that is your ambition you are destined at best to be number two at best because there always somebody in ahead of you. So I think for a country

with the history of India, the ambition of India, the talent of India and now the will of India, there is nothing wrong with aspiring to be strategically deciding where India can be uh

worldleading in part of this. I mean you're not no country is going to dominate every aspect of this ecosystem. identifying strategically where one can be that leader globally and I would say

there are at least if I can speak to AMD just as an example we were discussing about Helios and how it is and based on open standards there are many components it may not be GPU that you start but

there are many components there where a private sector in India can aspire to be a leading provider based and open standards so that a business like AMD or public private sector would say well I

can I can get a better product better total cost of ownership if I can plug into that and one last thing I cannot let you get away with the you know just the the this time being great for the

youngsters uh you know Ray Kurtzswe said that today for each of us in this room we age only 8 months for every chronological year because of advances in medical care and and that is true

because longevity age you know people are living longer because of better drugs better health leaving etc. So AI has the added advantage of providing greater solutions. So it's not just the

youngsters. There is hope for us if we [laughter] can if we can live for another few more years. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; So we are all lucky [laughter] to be

here at this age of &gt;&gt; fully like we are truly lucky to be in this. &gt;&gt; Yeah. No, that was very insightful. Thank you Thomas. So uh Vive question

for you. I'm going to say what is the one bold decision but I'm going to change that to what are some of the bold [laughter] decisions we must take to ensure we

don't look back and regret uh 5 years from today. &gt;&gt; Well, I think what the the biggest advantage that India has is of course you know a huge pool of talent. So that

is something that we all need to rely on. That's that's uh that's the most important thing for a country like India and this essentially see India has an

inherent culture of innovation. So it's not that you know we are always following or we looking at technologies and so on. The fact is the ecosystems where we have been living in they were

not you know geared up they were not situated in the context that we were creating products. So the culture of transforming that innovation to products has not been there unfortunately for a

long period of time. Things are changing now and probably what we need to do is to invest more in our youth to invest more in skilling to invest uh more in how do we convert the knowledge that we

generate uh in our universities in our R&amp;D labs into actual usable products which have you know soioeconomic impact. So that's that's the most important thing that I believe uh we should be

looking at. Of course uh given the fact that we also have an advantage that we have the advantage of scale also. So you know lot of things that we have done and we have proved it in terms of the

digital public infra that we have created at a population scale of size India it matters a lot if you go to any part of the world particularly anywhere in Europe if you identify yourselves

from India you know and you are in some discussion related to it and so on so you'll always be regarded with you know lot of depth in the sense that everybody believes that India India as an IT

superpower largely because of the talent that we have. So this is something that we should leverage on and uh something that we really need to invest in heavily to to see what is

going to come for the next generation and to provide an environment and our prime minister keeps on saying ease of doing business. So that is something that we really need to look into to to

enable and to create an environment where we are able to transform the knowledge that we create into usable products. &gt;&gt; No absolutely right. Right? I mean

talent, skilling and ease of doing business. I mean all of these are coming together for India and in fact uh I led the uh committee for future skills and I worked I got the opportunity to work

with 13 other eminent leaders from industry, academia uh across the board and one thing that stood out was if we can actually get our skilling right we can actually supply

talent not just for India but globally you know that's uh something that's going to be very effective if we can uh get our skilling uh actions right. So uh thank you again. Uh today's conversation

was truly insightful and inspiring. We touched upon many aspects of semiconductors and AI and the ecosystem and what and India's potential as such. And again in AI leadership will not

really happen by accident. It will require a deliberate alignment across policy, industry, research and infrastructure and uh we have many strengths that we need to work on. Uh we

need to come work on strengthening and leveraging for the growth that we are ambitious about and truly what matters now is decisive execution, moving with clarity and with urgency. So it's going

to be a great journey and I once again want to iterate that we are truly lucky to be here in this phase and what a fantastic journey we have ahead of us and let's be committed to that journey

of learning and advancement. Thank you all so much for you know attending this session. I appreciate [applause] your time. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Do we have time for audience questions?

We can take one question one or two out of 500 is it out of 500 sessions here this is one on semiconductor I'm very glad that you guys organized it and very very insightful a few amazing

questions and as good a response quickly to my question so I teach AI and sustainability at IIM UI and I I cover the entire supply chain starting from the rear earth going

through the chip design manufacturing the semiconductor supply chain essentially and and all the way to data centers and electronic waste sustainability is at the core of all

design decision in my class and that's what we are trying to teach the new management uh uh human resource if you will in India. Your your thoughts on having

sustainability not as a trade-off but as a core design choice for every decision that is made either in AI or something. &gt;&gt; Um wow. [laughter] So, so um it's a great question and I

think every one of us certainly I can speak for the company that I represent here and I must say I'm in India so I am going to give a shout out to the 10,000 AMDers in this country. AMD would not

exist we would not be able to do what we are doing without the contributions that they make every day. So India is already very much part of a glo global supply chain. Sustainability is very key. We

design our products with a goal, explicit goal of flattening the the energy curve because, you know, I mean, it's easy to say we're going to build megawatts and gigawatts, which we may

because it is going to be a fundamental infrastructure in which society is going to progress. But it's incumbent on us to make ensure that we we are very very uh thoughtful and committed to

sustainability. I also would like to say that we have to be humble enough to know that we are not going to get everything right. Um I was at a national academy US national academy meeting where Subras

Suresh was he was the president at the time. We had just rolled out the grand challenges for the 21st century and he said you know if you look at it the grand challenges of the 21st century are

sol are attempting to solve the problems created by the solutions to the grand challenges of the 20th century. So, so the reality is that we don't know what we don't know. But yet, as long as we

use sustainability as a core goal and and be humble enough to know that we are not going to get it all right, then I think we, you know, we cannot stop progress. We need to continue to move

move forward, but know that we're not going to get everything right and course correct as we go along. Okay. Uh I'm told we are out of time now but

&gt;&gt; yes actually we are running out of time and I I really appreciate for joining us for this session and I'm very much heartful thankful to our distinguished guests. So as a token from mighty side I

would like to give a short I mean cute momentto puja you can also join. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Thank you. [applause]
