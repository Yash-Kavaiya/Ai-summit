## 📝 Transcript

Artificial intelligence is real and it is influencing governance, markets, public services and even geopolitics. The question before us is not whether AI will shape governance. The question is

whether governance is going to shape the artificial intelligence. It's transforming governance in fundamental ways today through decision intelligence,

public service delivery at scale and national security and strategic stability. Moreover, the governance challenge becomes uniquely complex as AI introduces speed, opacity to a level,

concentration, global reach and dual use. This creates a governance paradox. Regulate too slowly and risk harm. Regulate too heavily and risk stagnation.

The answer is not control versus innovation. The answer is intelligent governance. Therefore, the principle of AI governance should necessarily include

human- centered design, transparency and accountability, risk based regulations, global cooperation, and adaptive policies. AI does not recognize borders.

We need interoperable frameworks, shared safety standards and cooperative oversight mechanisms. Governance frameworks must evolve as the artificial intelligence evolves. Static

policies cannot manage dynamic intelligence. In this era, we move from individual national level policies to coordinated global norms. And that's the necessity

for today. History will not judge us by our sophisticated algorithms. It will judge us by the wisdom of our The industrial revolution reshaped economies.

The digital revolution reshaped communication. The AI revolution will reshape decision making itself. With that power comes great responsibility.

The digital revolution which we are undergoing today. Surely we stand at crossroads. One path leads to inequity, instability and uncontrolled disruption.

The other leads to augmented human capability, smart governance and inclusive prosperity. The difference between these futures will not be determined by machines. It

will be determined by us. the policy makers, the people who use it and each and every person who's involved in the process of AI governance. Therefore, we need to commit today to ourselves for

building AI systems that are safe, secure, transparent, equitable and aligned with core human values and that's what we are going to discuss here today.

Last but not the least, the message that this panel discussion and dis the fireside chat is going to give is let us govern govern intelligence with wisdom. Thank you so much.

&gt;&gt; Thank you sir. We are truly honored to have with us today a leader who has been forefront of technologydriven governance in Maharashtra. I now request Shri Ashi Shaar Sur, honorable minister of IT and

cultural affairs, government of Maharashtra to grace us with the keynote address. Good morning to everybody. Respected dignitaries, excellencies

and all the policy makers, members of the media, dear friends, young challengers, ladies and gentlemen. Namaskar madam and a very good morning to all.

India today is not merely hosting an AI summit. India is helping to write the operating system of AI age. We meet at Bhat Mandab under the banner

Maha AI building safe, secure and smart governance as a part of AI impact summit 2026 the first in his global series to be hosted in the global south.

Over 20 heads of state, 60 ministers and hundreds of AI leaders from the industry and academia are here reflecting a shared conviction that AI must be inclusive,

responsible and resilient. I hereby say under the leadership of Chief Minister Dendra Fanviji, Maharashtra has positioned itself as a

living laboratory for AI in governance. A partnership with global technology leaders for example our AI powered Mahak crime OS showcased

by Microsoft's Satya Nadili has already transfor transformed how we prevent detect and investigate crime faster response shorter investigation cycles and more

transparent processes Simultaneously, our state digital agency, Mahai, is building what we call an intelligent government infrastructure,

a cloudnative modular APIdriven backbone and that uses AI to integrate services, predict needs and respond in real time. This spans smart recruitment,

AI based property mapping for urban local bodies, realtime urban dashboard for traffic, weather and civic issues and pilots in flood management and smart mobility.

The philosophy is simple. use use AI not to distance the state from the citizens but to make governance more human, faster, more responsive and more inclusive. In other words, scale

empathy through insight. Across the world, public sectors are resting with the same three imperatives. Serve better. safeguard digital sovereignty and adopt AI responsibly.

Many countries have realized that interpal public date and robust AI governance are becoming strategic infrastructure at par with energy, transport or telecom. For Maharashtra,

Mahayai is our response to this challenge. A safe, secure, smart governance stack must rest on five pillars. Compute and cloud at scale number one.

High quality public data sets number two. State AI governance number three and interpolarity and standards number four and capacity building is number five. Smart governance is not only about

deploying chatboards or dashboards. It is about building resilient, auditable, human- centered AI systems into the nerve systems of cities and state, transport, energy, public safety, urban

planning, disaster response and welfare delivery. without trustworthy governance, smart cities, risk capacity, opacity, bias, security breaches and erosion of public trust. In Maharashtra,

we see internet health as a core policy concern. Just as physical health is essential for individual, digital health is essential for societies. Disinformation, deep fakes, AI generated

fraud and cyber attacks can undermine democracies, markets and communities with unprecedented speed. Our response must be combined that is robust cyber security, digital literacy and critical

thinking, hybrid verification ecosystems and that is our response as far as our state is concerned. I'm here really really happy to be the part of this summit and at the same time giving a

response addressing the challenges and our ecosystem under the name of Mahaya and therefore we are here to present our case as a building safe secure smart governance and appeal all the best of

the technologies and platforms of the world to associate coexist and work with us. Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; Thank you sir. Your vision for a

digitally empowered Maharashtra truly truly sets the tone for everything we we will discuss today. And now the highlight of today's session. May I request all the panelists to join

us on the stage please? Shri &gt;&gt; Pravin Pradeshi sir Yashi Adav Dr. Anupam Chhatadyay Dr. Amit Kapoor Mr. Suresh Sati

Major Ranjit Gowami Miss Bina Sarkcar Mr. Druar Doc uh Davendar Sandu Dr. Ganesh Ramak Krishnan Vikas Chandra Rastoi sir Rajes Aaral sir

Shri Pravin Pardeshi, Chief Executive Officer Mitra and Chief Economic Adviser to the Honorable Chief Minister of Government of Maharashtra. Shri Yashas Sri Yadab, Additional Director General

of Police, Maharashtra Cyber Department, Government of Maharashtra. Dr. Alupam Chhatabady, Associate Professor, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. Dr. Amit Kapoor, Chair, Institute for

Competitiveness. Mr. Suresh Sati, Managing Director and CEO, Protein Ego of Technologies. Major Ranjit Gowami, head corporate affairs, Tata Consultancy Services. Miss Bina Sarkcar, customer

success executive service now. And the and moderating this conversation is Mr. Druhar, co-founder and CEO, Primus Partners. I now hand over to Mr. Druh Dhar to moderate the session. Okay.

&gt;&gt; Thank you Aditi and a warm welcome to all our panel members. Uh I'll start with uh Pravin Pradeshi sir. So sir uh at Mitra you have been experimenting a lot with AI. There are multiple AI

initiatives which have been taken. If you could share your thoughts your vision as we start this. So, so first uh the most important thing about AI is getting our energy the some

of the hard things right. So one is energy because you know remember President Trump just mentioned that why should we be paying for Indians who are processing most of our answers. So I

think we are pushing on green energy more than 19,000 megawatt of that to come up at solar level. So that that's the fuel for AI in future. The second is that we capacity building. So all our

staff from Mitra and lot of our associate departments we went to this uh AI university and you know gave them a course and we also hope that there'll be online courses available on I got where

government can government staff can become empowered to use AI. Uh then we look at what is the impact on the economy. So the impact on the economy mostly people are concerned about the

jobs and that's a real uh issue. uh one analysis from NITI shows that from 1950s to 2020 all highly educated people with post-graduate degrees engineers they are the ones who had a 95% plus chance of

getting jobs but from 2020 till now 65% is the rate at which physical jobs that is masons um brick layers uh home carers their uh value and their employability is increasing visav highly educated

ones. So this is the impact of AI. So how should we uh do this better? One is of course as our secretary it mentioned making it available in government ensuring seamless access to services but

other aspects which we don't look at which we are working through our state data authority is how do we also incach the data uh at a large scale because otherwise we become a a sitting target

for people to just use India's data for monetizing their own uh values. So two two big examples are pharmaceuticals. India has the largest population and you know the number of diseases experiments

etc. Now this is all health data and this is very valuable for uh pharma companies. So the state data authority is working on issues wherein we can make it a single source of truth but make it

available also and if there is a commercial v uh possibility make those resources available to India that is to our government and not to be cashed for free. So these are some of the

applications. Government issues many many orders. We have issued more than 150,000 orders which are called government GRs and it's a maze which through which it's very difficult even

for government officers whose departments it is to understand what is the latest position on a complicated situation. So we are working with professor uh Danesh is here from IIT

Mumbai. So Mitra and we are working together with them uh to uh uh uh disentangle all these orders through a small language model not a large not a large language model and so that you can

query at two levels one for the government officers. The government officers should be able to ask on in any complicated situation what is the latest position on whether an additional FSI

for a building permit can be given in this situation or not. uh what are the Supreme Court orders and on the other hand citizens should also be able to ask under those rules. So this is called

Maha uh GPT and hopefully this will be the first application which is both available to government officers and to uh citizens. I stop here. &gt;&gt; Thank you sir for sharing all these

examples wonderful examples. I'll come to uh Yashi Yadav sir. So uh cyber is another large user of AI. So if you could share your examples, your experience around how cyber is using AI.

&gt;&gt; Okay. So law enforcement and cyber security is one of the major concerns for law enforcement agencies all over the world. And I would like to draw your attention that under the visionary

leadership of our chief minister Mr. Dindra Fnavish GI who had the foresight to use AI in law enforcement work about 5 years ago. So we have launched and implemented this Maharashtra cyber

security project which generously borrows AI tools, technologies, algorithms and we are fighting real crime with this with these technologies and the USP of this project is that the

best and the most state-of-the-art tools technologies experienced consultants in the field of cyber security and experienced and

professional police officers have all coaled under one roof and there's a live police station as well. So this is how cyber security is being embellished through this project and the beauty is

that be dark web monitoring, threat analysis, social media monitoring or any type of cyber crime, sex tortion, ransomware, cyber bullying and lot of other types which cyber crime takes.

They can all be undertaken handled by just one on the fingertips by just one helpline number 1 930. So this agency if any kind of cyber

issue is with any citizen they can just dial this 1 1930 number and all the cyber solutions will be provided by more than 150 cyber consultants. So lot of AI tools are being used in this and

seamlessly and the best part of this whole exercise is that in less than six months more than 1,000 cr of rupees which would have gone into the hand of the scamsters have been frozen

and are being ultimately returned to the victims. What a big relief to the victims and more than 70 young girls who were being subjected to intense cyber bullying, blackmailing and extortion and

were on the verge of committing suicide because of in very efficient AI tracking. Uh their they they were prevented from taking the extreme step and 70 lives have been saved in less

than six months of its operation. So that's how AI is at the forefront. Thank you. Is at the forefront of being the bull work against cyber security concerns. I would like to draw your

attention to only one report that we generated which is called Echos of Pahelgam. Now in that case while the in Indian army was fighting a conventional war with Pakistan

on the uh on the uh because of the Pelgam incident more than 1 million cyber attacks were launched by nation state actors whom we called as AP groups from Indonesia,

Pakistan and even Turkey and so many other countries and they were thwarted by such AI tools which we call as threat intelligence tools like Luminar, Cognite or Pathfinder which are big data

analytical tools. So in the darknet we still find the traces of these cyber attacks. So cyber crime is now slowly progressing into cyber terrorism and cyber warfare. So that is what we have

to be very very careful and before I end this preliminary address I would like to also draw your attention what beyond AI a big big threat is lurking it is called quantum computing now quantum computing

can do processes in cubits hundreds of millions of cubits it's its speed and it can solve complex issues in less than six seconds which the best of supercomputers would take more than 50

years to do it immediately. So quantum computer computing can break the best of encryptions including RSA encryptions of the banking industry including blockchain technology.

Now if these encryptions are broken in less than few minutes, the whole financial system can be lopsided and lots of money can flow into actors or threat actors which we are not aware of.

Bitcoin can be broken. Even credit card encryptions can be broken. Banking systems encryptions can be broken. So right now we have to prepare what quantum computing can give us as in

terms of pros and what can be the shortcomings or dangers lurking because of quantum computing the cons. So we have to prepare because China and other countries have already invested $15

billion or even close to$20 billion. We have invested only $1 billion till now. So that's how we have to catch up with quantum computing before it's too late. So this is how cyber security and law

enforcement perspective on AI and I would like to pass on the patent to the next speaker. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you sir. Uh that was quite reassuring as well. Uh and since you uh

spoke about quantum I'll want to bring in Dr. Anupam Chhatupadha. Anupam uh you're working at the intersection of quantum and AI. So if you could share your thoughts how are things moving in

that direction? So thank you for the panel. So I think I'm the only academic member in the panel. So I can brought some bring some perspective from research. But to be

very frank this field is moving so fast that the gap between the research and technology commercialization has almost blurred. So to make sure that we are doing stuff what is grounded in reality

we also do a lot of industry collaborations. I would like to highlight one particular thing that we are doing now. We have recently launched a spin-off that helps in detecting

defects and uh as you might know that defect is a very very serious concern now cyber crime to echo the thoughts of Mr. Jadub that he mentioned defect can be used to

construct audio video and image which is almost discernable by a regular person. you cannot look into it and tell that okay this is defect very very difficult to detect and because of that we are

facing a lot of challenges in the research so I will highlight a few research challenges related to the defect detection the first one is of course the uh models that we need to

train for defect detection they don't have enough data which is relevant to the use case scenarios that if someone is calling with the generated audio message with a defect

and the message and the call is happening in Marathi or Hindi then we don't have enough data set for the models to be trained on that and the only thing that we can do is to

create some synthetic data sets but uh that is not always realistic. So what we are doing in order to solve the scenario is to curate enough real world data set by getting audio samples and video

samples and images by scrapping over the internet. But then again there is a problem because you know that if I'm doing something on AI and I have to solve the data problem I

need to know whether the data is properly labeled or not and unle data in many cases it's indistinguishable from garbage. So if I'm looking into a defake audio or defake video which is going

around in my social network, I have to also have a mechanism to tell that this is actually defect. And for that we do a corresponding truth checker to see if that particular image is reporting to an

incident and that incident has been covered in any other news or media then only we tell okay this is grounded in reality otherwise it's defect. We are building our database on that on the

synthetic database creation. This is something that we can do if we look into the problems related to addition of noise because in real world spoofing and defect audio calls which banks are using

which people are using for also making video calls, zoom calls, the audio may come with a lot of noisy surroundings. And we did a simple experiment that we took the models, we ran the models with

very clean samples. it was detecting defect perfectly. We added synthetic noise to that and the detection quality degraded. So this is something that we could do synthetically because noise

creation is in our hands. We could create a variety of different noise of different frequencies. Then we started training the models with clean samples but adding layers and layers of noise

and the detection accuracy improves. So this is one level of research that we are doing and on the other spectrum what's happening is many people are having data set or models who are not

very comfortable in sharing those because they consider the models to be the proprietary or the data to be sensitive. To address those problems, there are some solutions from the

research in particular uh fully homorphic encryption where you can perform the detection and AI operations on encrypted data set. But unfortunately so far it has been very very slow and

computational intensive. So instead of that what we are trying to do is to use a technology called federated learning where there could be multiple models and the models could have an additional

layer of differential privacy that could be merged with other models where no one user of the final merged model would be able to tell what are the source training data set or what are the model

weights that was coming originally because you are adding a wrapper before you go on with the merging. So these are more of algorithmic say research domains that we are targeting. And I would

mention one last point about the practical implementation aspect of it. So we recently participated in also a defect detection hackathon that was invited by home ministry in UK and what

they put on a very strict uh requirement for participation in that is we could only utilize the model in an air gap scenario which means there would be no external influence that can come by

accessing the cloud or by collaborating with some remote uh computing service provider nothing like that. So you have to do everything in one room whatever the facilities available there and that

can happen with your smartphone with your small embedded device and that makes it very very difficult to port a complex model which is trained and learned over a big server like GPU. So

you have to cutle down the model and when you are trying to do this compression and optimization of the model that ends up becoming too inefficient in terms of the detection

accuracy the noise builds up. So you have to pick up best model make a mixture of experts and pick up the best samples. So this actually opens up a lot of research avenue and fortunately now

we are getting real world use case through our spin-off. we can address this one by one and see where research can be pulled into the product in order to help this.

&gt;&gt; Thanks Anupam uh for giving a perspective both from research as well as industry. So I'll come to Sur you. So you're working uh extensively in DPIs and there's a strong inter interaction

between DPIs and AI. So from your experience how are things moving in the DPI space and how is AI influencing? No thanks Dup. I think from a DBI perspective we are all very familiar. We

today have population scale digital rails and uh you know that puts us in a very sweet spot because today lot of times when we start using or embedding AI into any technology are we ready to

embed AI or not? And I think there was reference to data sets. How is data organized? How can we enable AI on top of it? So I think first of all the population scale DPI that we have that

gives us a significant advantage. Uh whether we talk about identity we talk about our UPI rails which is the payment and the transactional layer which comes on top of it. And uh similarly when we

look at data itself uh digilocker today has uh millions of authenticated documents that come into play over there. Uh so while we have the digital infrastructure in place if we can embed

an intelligence layer on top of it and if the question is around uh targeting subsidy getting the right beneficiary putting the money in the hands of the right person uh that becomes a very very

important and significant leverage. I will just take two or three examples where we see AI playing a significant role. uh one is that as we move from static identity to dynamic eligibility

now we've seen it all happen today we have digitally verifiable credentials so the moment you are using static identity you are only able to prove who you are what do you do and then you are applying

for getting some sort of benefits or uh subsidy coming through to you but if you have verifiable credentials these are credentials which are machine readable uh we talk about the concept of blue dot

which technically means all of us have certain attributes which are associated with us. If these are available in a machine readable format then AI can actually determine who is eligible for

what subsidy. Uh the second part comes to the fact saying are we being reactive or can we do predictive governance and predictive governance can be strongly enabled by AI because the moment you are

having credentials which are digitally verifiable you are actually able to predict who needs some sort of subsidy. Now today if there's a distress in income and that can be tracked uh you

can trigger some sort of benefit to that and coming at a government level if you can put data consented data being shared with the government the same can come through and last but not least is the

important part related to inclusion error and exclusion error. Uh so when we talk about inclusion error we are talking about leakages. uh when we are talking about exclusion naturally we are

saying the right person is not getting what is due to them uh so your ability to be able to predict precision using verification is going to be very critical again an AI layer can be

embedded over there uh but all this very clearly and we've heard it before uh all this is very clearly important to have the guardrails around it so AI should be explainable

uh the moment we are saying explainable today a decision taken not to give uh benefits to somebody should be very clearly explained and similarly if there are benefits going out that should also

be explainable. Uh the second part is auditable. So whatever we are doing there has to be an audit layer over there to explain what has happened and more importantly there should be a human

redressal pathway because ultimately you can't put everything to machines. You have to have that human person coming into play and having accountability settled over there. So I think these are

critical aspects which can make governance more predictive, more precise and more proactive going forward by embedding an intelligence layer into the DBI.

&gt;&gt; Thanks Sur. I think uh very uh valid and meaningful points. I'll come to uh Ranjit. Uh now we talking about AI. Uh there are a lot of uh happenings which are there. We are all we have seen we

have heard about so many things at the summit. uh now major tech company like TCS which is doing a lot of work in this how does large tech companies come in and collaborate with state governments

how how how can you enable that what can be the steps in that &gt;&gt; thank you uh I think uh we need to first take a holistic view of what are we trying to achieve with the

tagline for this summit if you go by that will for all happiness for all is very holistically kind of captures it. Uh as coming from Tata group I'm reminded that 170 years back almost our

founding father Jim Shia Chittata spoke about giving us the guidance saying that uh society or community is not another stakeholder in the business. It is the purpose as to why the business exists in

the first place. So similarly if we were to apply the same analogy over here today I think AI is not a technical tool which is fundamentally going to make the governance more efficient. It is

fundamentally meant for how to bring the benefit welfare and happiness to the community at large. So if we try and approach the uh you know question from that perspective it definitely comes up

and like even Sur alluded to uh how do we make sure that it is inclusive the people get the right uh you know benefits that they are entitled to and do not uh go to somebody who's not

entitled to the uh you know the colleague uh from uh the police forces also spoke about as to how the criminal tracking and other things these These are translating the intent into action

at the ground level. Uh largely when it comes to organizations like DCS, we believe that each department in the government firstly should not be treated in isolation. Each department in the

government should have the ability to have a common database of people be able to extract the information and ensure that the citizen is seen as a citizen of the state or the country and not as a

citizen of the department. So that common databasing is something that we are trying to approach uh it from. We have the Aadhaar database uh not every department is still connected to it. Of

course we are trying to find a reason as to how that can become uh the major point of it. So small steps like that and of course bringing in the platform's intelligence to its core. Uh that's

fundamentally the steps that we have taken. &gt;&gt; Thanks Ranjit. Uh with that I'll go to Bina. Uh Bina uh I want to talk on the aspect of ethical AI biases especially

you work with women for ethical AI. uh how do you see biases or maybe biases around gender diversity creeping in and what needs to be done around this? &gt;&gt; Uh thank you Dup. So uh yes I do work uh

I volunteer with the woman for ethical AI South Asia chapter it's powered by UNESCO uh so one of the key questions that we ask ourselves is what are we solving for uh every time and um I've

been looking at the various solutions that are uh debuting or being uh showcased as part of the India AI uh mission. Uh many of times uh when we look at a particular um hardware or a

piece of um you know any any new device through which we are delivering what we now call as AI services uh mostly on large language models I should say that uh what we sometimes seem to

miss is the wood for the trees. Uh for examp I'll just give a very um u you know hard example over here. Uh we do know smart glasses is not a new uh

phenomenon. It was introduced by Google glasses way back in 2015 I remember 2013 2015 2016 about that range. Uh one of the reasons why it was recalled was uh you had safety concerns because uh

people were taking images videos without consent. Uh we have seen the return of these glasses. Uh and um those concerns have not gone away and yet uh you know you see them in the market, you see it

in India being sold in every uh in any optic store. You know in my neighborhood optic store I have my colleagues who flaunt it uh saying that I'm so cool you know I can I I've taken the latest piece

of technology. So when we talk about how do you build ethics and governance uh you know Yashasui sir said. framework. So what this means is we are not giving guns to everybody right. Uh

India has been very very smart about it. Of course there are certain countries where owning a gun is is fine. It's as per their rights. That doesn't mean India has to adopt it.

uh right we have our very able police force we have the Indian army right so what is exciting outside one needs to contextualize it humanize it see if it is threatening 50% of your population

I'm a part of that population and then decide whether it even needs to exist in that market so when you're building out solutions and when you're building out uh devices uh we have the India

safety institute. It has been instituted in 2025. I do know that what I would uh urge uh policy makers is that it should not uh while we do have it and I do know we are working with uh research

institute industry uh ideally if any new device comes like this the first um uh line of defense so so to speak should be this institute that actually should determine whether it

actually creates a problem for the police force for cyber security right uh does it threaten 50% of the population we are already seeing it playing out in the uh UK US there is uh no uh policy

that protects us okay even now we are not protected as as women uh leave women even children right so um I think that is something one really needs to take into consideration while every we love

technology trust me as as a lady I find find it extremely liberating to be able to uh create applications with just language. Uh but if you use that technology against us by building out

bringing out devices and hardware that endanger us, uh I feel that's where it it breaks down. So you definitely as part of ethics you need to evaluate it from that framework. Uh I call it uh the

Kali versus the Rakabija effect. I'm sure some of you know that. uh why would you create a ratab create a kali &gt;&gt; yeah [snorts] so vina I think a very

valid point uh that you have made with that I'll move to Dr. Amit Kapoor uh we're talking of AI and its impact uh and benefits. How do you see this benefit percolating to the next level of

cities tier 2 tier three other places? So dup this is a very important question and as I was hearing all the panelists here I would like to rake a few points. Uh we definitely agree that yes AI can

be transformational. Uh but we have to understand a couple of points here. One of them is that as to what is the quality of education that we are giving so that people are able to use it in the

right earnest. In fact the issue that Bina was talking about is about ethics education and so on and so forth. The larger point here is when you talk about the skill development levels in

Maharashtra uh out of the 100% or 9 cr workforce that you have only about 20% of them are at skill level three and four 80% of them are at skill level one and two. So if you have to move beyond

that you need to do something far greater. That means you need to embed your education system and build it very strongly. Uh and then the second point out here is that how do we use and if

you really want to talk about tier one and sorry tier two and tier three cities we have to also understand that what is the level of penetration and quality of internet in these locations. We can

tomtom about uh internet and everything but the numbers are not very supportive right now. And you talk about internet and broadband connectivity. There are severe issues with this within the state

of Maharashtra itself uh which is supposedly one of the finest states in terms of internet connectivity itself. The average speed of internet traffic in Bombay or in Mumbai is about 58 Mbps on

a broadband network. when you are talking about usage of AI and if you want to take it to the masses then you have to have far better deeper internet connectivity and broadband I think it

has to be done on a war footing not that we are not getting there but it'll have to be done faster and quicker the second thing is going to be about inadequacy of supporting uh infrastructure so this is

where I also see that there's a tremendous level of opportunity that exists in Maharashtra to create this because if you really look at it like 16% of India's workforce, IT workforce

or what you call as technology workforce sits in one single city in Maharashtra that is Pune. So if you're really talking about it that means Maharashtra has the potential the talent to really

take it to the next level and that is where you have to build infrastructure you will have to build uh what do you call the when you talk about the data centers etc the opportunity does exist

and things and last but not the least is about it's going to be about cost and affordability you will have to bring cost and affordability to these services as you go along but having said that I

think the larger potential uh we have not touched here And when you talk about tier 2 and tier three cities, this technology has a huge possible impact that can be done at tier 2 and three

tier three cities. And that is about nutrition. Today Maharashtra actually has a problem on nutrition. 50% of the people in Maharashtra are malnourished even today. How do I use this technology

to assess what is happening in my pin code level or a smaller level of geography in maybe various cities and locations. The second thing is about water and in sanitation access to basic

knowledge. What about access to can AI solve my education problem in tier 2 and tier three cities? In fact, none of us is talking about the elephant in the room and that elephant in the room is

that we are all super excited about AI but we are not understanding that AI is also going to be the biggest dumbing down element for the society. In fact, when you talk about AI itself, it is

going to make bonobos out of us. People out here when you actually use the doom scrolling when you talk about Instagram, what is happening to our children? And that is exactly what AI is going to do.

How do we set our education system right? That's what you have to do in tier two and tier three cities. Last point and that is about the higher education space itself. When you talk

about your workforce and close to about 50% of it is undermployed. So I have to disagree with Pra for one small point uh he he made a very powerful point in terms of saying that how after 2020 uh

the there has been a transformation in terms of how people are getting jobs etc. I do agree with it but the larger point here is that we are also not preparing our workforce right and that

is happening in tier 2 and tier tier three cities so we need to take it there potential exists as of today Maharashtra is the engine of growth in India we cannot def de debate that even today it

is about close to 17 to 18% of India's GDP and it'll define India's growth story in the future definitively but if Maharashtra does it right then the country can follow suit on this and that

is where things have to be &gt;&gt; thank thank you Dr. Rammit uh and thanks to all the panelists. So with that we'll come to the end of the panel discussion. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. Thank you to all our
