## 📝 Transcript

and minister Cindy to frown over last year and we are delighted to note that many of the activities that were outlined in the MOU have already kickstarted. So I think to that extent

it's fantastic that Dr. Padla is here today and will share with us his ideas on where an Indo-German collaboration in innovation and AI can have a valued proposition for both countries. I'm also

delighted to have my own colleague Dr. Thomas Kun who's come all the way from Germany from the frown institute of experimental software. He will be sharing some of our experiences and

competencies in AI particularly with focus on workplace changing which is of course one of the biggest topics we have today but also manufacturing agriculture and health and I think one of the key

topics that Rahu can present to the Indian audience is data space. We have created a secure data space in the cloud for many years where challenges from industries are brought in and discussed.

So you will hear a lot from him. I'm particularly delighted that four Bangalorean CEOs are here today. [laughter] We have with us Sindu Bangadran who

needs no introduction. I think everyone knows her and who doesn't know is coming under a stone. So uh we also have Anraan Austri who are CTO of Mercedes-Benz research and development

center in Bangalore and we have Datri Salgam from Robert Bosch software solutions and of course Brashant Brashan he's sitting at the back Doris Swami from Aun

which was earlier continental so as you can see a power packed industry captain session which will follow after the panel. And last but not the least we have Modi Nyall from Bisman Shiftton

which is a think tank which has been producing a lot of knowledge papers around India and Germany and actually positioning India as a positive partner for Germany long before Germany even

started looking at us so seriously. So thank you for that. Um I'm standing here in front of you today as the head of frowner in India for the

last 18 years. Extremely proud that frowner is one of the largest applied research ecosystems in the world. We have 76 institutes in Germany. We are present in more than 80 countries. We

produce two patents for every working day. We are also uh the inventors of the MP3 white LEDs and many such inventions. But what really singles us out in this innovation corridor is the fact that we

take research from lab to the market in the shortest period of time. So this is an area where India really needs support and we are delighted that we were one of the first movers coming into India 18

years ago and even today there are very few international R&amp;D organizations that are active in India. We have been earning more than €70 million euros in the last 10 years from research

contracts with Indian industry, government and research organizations. And we have a absolutely amazing network of partners in India including organizations like COT but also with

Indian industry which is really gearing up for innovation. So I think we came in at the right time uh and took advantage of this uh you know innovation trajectory that has picked up in India

and it's exciting to see what's unfolding before us. I have to say that today what we are bringing together is really a thought-provoking session. We only have 15 minutes, so I would like to

get on with business immediately. And we hope that some of the thoughts that we are leaving behind with you today will resonate and will actually trigger a long-term dialogue and engagement so

that we can take the Indo-German Innovation Collaboration to greater heights. I would now like to invite Mr. Gog Enyler to kindly deliver his special address.

Good morning ladies and gentlemen, dear Anandia Minister. Um I don't know whether it's maybe that we are just as crazy as you are

sometimes that we are big fans of here in India. It's uh always delightful to uh to be invited uh by you here in India. You do amazing work here in the country. I wish uh you know we'd have

several anandas here in the country to multiply your your efforts. Uh so thank you very much for the invitation and um I'm impressed by the distinguished panel uh of speakers today and of of panelists

here. Um all of the panelists and speakers um here today are drivers of technology and so it makes sense that you are also at the forefront of innovative AI

technology from increasing crop revenue from increasing crop revenue improving diagnostics on or minimizing errors in manufacturing

AI I undoubtedly has huge potential for social and economic good. AI is predicted to contribute between 5 and 15 trillion to the global GDP by 2030 to 2033.

But there are also questions of course. How can we ensure that this growth is inclusive? How do we minimize negative effects for people and the planet? What kind of

effect would this have on the labor on labor markets for example? Um after all the motto of this summit is actually welfare for all. India for one has ambitious goals to

create massive computing infrastructure in big parts powered by green energy. Germany is investing in so-called AI lighouses which foster AI innovations for climate

and environmental protection. Since 2020, Germany has funded over 60 projects leveraging AI for sustainability. The topics range from wildfire

prevention and renewable energy to bi biodiversity monitoring and circular economy. Paramount that government, academia and industry work hand in hand.

By promoting research and development, creating a clear regulatory environment and investing in the training of skilled workers, we can unlock a broader potential for AI.

India shows huge potential here. It accounts for 15% of the global AI talent pool and has the highest AI skill penetration rate. In terms of research and development in AI, India ranks third

in the world after the US and China. India and Germany with a longstanding scientific partnership are natural partners in creating solutions that are sustainable and inclusive for all.

Hence only two days ago, ministers Vashnau and Vberger launched the India Germany IIA pact, a new partnership focused on implementationdriven

collaboration across government, industry, research, skill development and innovation. It will include aspects as AI for

industry and manufacturing, talent, skills and mobility, joint research, innovation and infrastructure and overall AI for social good.

So I very much look forward to the discussion of today's session that it can give fruit for fruit for thought on this most relevant topic. Thank you again for the invitation and I wish all

of us an interesting discussion on many of these pertinent topics. Thank you. Thank you for your kind words Mr. Ensiler. Uh we now have the pleasure of hearing Mr. Tom Dr. Thomas Koul who

heads the division of embedded systems in franopheres. As you all know we talk artificial intelligence in franoper we call it augmented intelligence which means that

human intelligence is still at the core of what we're talking in terms of AI. It's a pleasure to bring Dr. Thomas to India. The floor is all yours. &gt;&gt; Yes. Thank you for inviting me.

&gt;&gt; Yeah. What is uh what is Arhova doing in the field of AI? You all know AI is on one hand large language models mostly driven by the US. We have huge open-source models coming from China. So

what is Fhover contributing? And our goal is to bridge industry and academia to support uh to to support the industry in creating new products and bringing ideas

into practice. And I have chosen here a few highlights on what we can do as frownher. So for example, when you speak about AI, the question is how reliable is the result of AI? Do you get

concrete? Do you get reliable information? That's one topic. Trustworthiness. How can we achieve trustworthy responses? That's something that Franhoer is researching on for

sustainable growth. It's also very important to preserve knowledge that is available in the company especially if people retire. Most of small and medium-sized enterprises have exactly

this problem that knowledge is leaving and you cannot get this knowledge back because the new employees simply don't have this knowledge anymore. So how can you preserve knowledge?

We call this industrial AI. So bringing AI models into practice, creating specific specialized AI models based on company data based on sensitive data not personal data of persons but sensitive

data for business, sensitive data on for companies so that they can support these companies with these leads that the AI for example creates a colleague that is an expert for a specific specific device

and that can help humans to work more efficiently with this device. And last but not least, as my colleague already did introduce, data spaces are key technology for that because for AI,

we need to be able to train AI and therefore we need a reliable access to data and a way to share data but based on rules and that's what data space data spaces are meant for. With Fhoer, you

have the ability to instantiate data spaces that scale up to 10,000 transactions per second and that's quite a lot. So, FOA is structured into alliances and

the most important one is the so is for here is the big data and artificial intelligence alliance. So we have more than 30 institutes that team up in creating AI strategies. Each institute

with its own field of competence but all of us support best practices, studies, expert opinions and we support all companies in creating new solutions. And as you can see we have a lot of fields

that our institutes are working on. life sciences, health care when it comes to diagnostics to personalized medication, logistics and mobility for optimizing supply chains, making them more

resilient production and industry 4.0 very important. We also need to keep production in Europe to be to remain resilient. So it must be economic to produce in Europe. energy and

environment, renewable energies, smart grids, self-managing grids. That's very important topics also for AI and big data, business and finance security to make sure that our data is well

protected. I cannot go into detail for all of these topics. So we've collected a few samples on what we are doing from embedded AI, image analysis, collaborative transport,

cancer diagnostics, swarm intelligence, of course also defense topics. I cannot go too much into detail here, but AI has a huge impact. And while the ways regarding general purpose LLMs is not

our ways, the applications that can be created with AI, the transformation of industry, that is very well our mission to bring AI to use for industry and therefore also to use for all. And

then we are back at the topic of this event here. Welfare for all and happiness for all because every industrial revolution in the end did yield much more wealthyness for

everybody. I have brought some highlights and I promise I won't go into details here. No worries. So the virtual colleague is one thing that is important when people

leave companies. We have expert knowledge. We have experience and this is very hard to preserve. So con just imagine a virtual colleague that follows the people in the field that learns from

them and that keeps the knowledge in the company once this person leaves so that the company knowledge is retained. That's one project, one project that Fenhoff is doing in the field of AI to

support industry and also smaller and medium-sized industries. Trustworthiness, that's very important. We all know that AI is not perfect and probably some of you have already

tweaked the AI maybe a little bit on purpose to see okay, how far can I go with that? AI basically is stupid. It has a lot of knowledge but it has no understanding of that. Trustworthy AI

means we observe for example the field of use for a specific AI model and track whether we are leaving this field. We have an uncertainty wiper that gives you with each response of the AI an

uncertainty value that says okay how trustworthy is this particular response and that's very important when we want to apply AI also in safety relevant environments for medical uh for medical

diagnostics for image recognition and also in traffic that's very important then to know how believe is the assumption of the AI here. Federated AI training is very important

when we want to work together. For example, a robot that can grab something that every human can do. Grab into a box and take something out. For a robot, that's a very big challenge. We can

train robots to do that. But it's much more effective when we can do a federated training when everybody can contribute data and in the end we receive one model but one model where

you cannot derive any sensitive data back because nobody wants to share so nobody wants to share their sequence. So that's where data space that that's what

data spaces are meant for. We share data based on rules. We can provide data just for training of AI. Nobody will see the raw data for that. We just use it for training of AI. And here Frhoer is

researching both governant policies and efficient implementations of cross company data spaces. So that's my pitch, my motivation. I hope I was able to give you some ideas,

some insights in what we can do with AI besides of open AI. I think Sam Alban is not here so I can say that [sighs] they're doing great things but there are also great things that can be done in

addition to that. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much Thomas. This was just an appetizer as you know we have very limited time but anybody who's interested can visit our stand where

we've also demonstrated some of use cases in AI and agriculture um and also in AI and medicine and AI in manufacturing. You're welcome to visit us at the German pavilion. I would now

like to invite the uh CEO of center for development of telematics to share a few thoughts on where India and Germany can work together. Thank you sir. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much Arandi. Uh

uh honorable minister ma'am policy makers industry leaders experts. It's honor to address uh this forum at a time when artificial intelligence is reshaping global economies

and governance architectures. uh today it's not merely a technological shift uh because uh AI is quite pervasive it is being applied to almost all the sectors and where it is not

applied it will be applied soon sooner than later uh because it underpins the uh competitiveness productivity and so societal resilience and for India and Germany together Germany being the

precision engineering expert you know for years and India are bringing the scale. I think there is a very good way that India and Germany work together and align uh the uh the how the AI is taken

forward uh in a very responsible ethical way so that uh not only it helps us economic uh progress but also meets the uh the the social good challenges. Uh as we know India's AI system is uh quite

vibrant ranking uh third globally for its competitiveness and developer activities. Our uh AI mission is already investing more than $2 billion. Uh we have given for startups 38,000 GPUs and

this will be further increased. Uh it could bring uh 1.7 trillion uh value to India's economy by 2035. and the tech sector particularly is projected to uh you know contribute uh $280 billion

revenue this year itself. Uh Germany's AI market is also rapidly expanding uh driven by strong uh industrial integration particularly in manufacturing and substantial public

private investment. Uh Germany's AI market is expected to be nearly 30 billion euros uh by 2030. there I read that there are 600 more than 600 startups in Germany and we also have lot

many startups. I think together uh how the startup ecosystem could work together for the benefit of uh not only both the countries for for bringing global uh good to uh this sector.

So there's a need for a win and win situation for India and Germany uh partnership between two great countries given our diplomatic relations given the as I said the precision engineering

which Germany is famous and the scale what we bring in India I think there are many areas where we can contribute but I thought I'll uh focus on two three one I think it was mentioned in smart

uh Germany's leadership in in industry 4.0 zero and India's expanding manufacturing. I think uh this government has invested heavily on the manufacturing under various schemes like

uh PLI and DLI schemes and it is going to go forward and therefore how do we use AI in uh smart manufacturing. We would like to work with the Germany in terms of uh developing smart

manufacturing standards, crossber industrial data flows and safeguards enabled energy efficiency and since we arrived late in this manufacturing space a lot of our manufacturing plants are

actually started using AI. In fact uh recently there was a science eventic uh wherein the Tatas presented how they are going to bring down the cost using AI. in manufacturing. The second point I

think Anandi brought up for agriculture. I think pron is already working in India for agriculture and agriculture being one of the key part of our economy uh the service sector and the economy

agriculture sector. I think it also makes us a good partner for how do we improve the the productivity, the yield, the income for farmers uh the efficiency gain, productivity gain and that will be

another area we can work together. Um I would also like to say that uh uh you know given especially given the economic progress uh we are making and we see lot of challenges coming from the cyber

security area uh we get millions of attacks in our country millions of attacks and I'm not sure what is happening other part so therefore AI in cyber security is very very important

which we use to some extent and we would like to learn from Germany uh whatever and we would like to share these what we are doing how we are using AI to you know come to a pattern because the kind

of data flow for example India we receive data rate at 10 terabyte per second 10 terabytes per second is the data rate and how do you process this data in real time and be able to tell

that how how [snorts] and where the attacks are happening uh as far as the um dot is concerned we work in various areas uh I don't know some of you may be aware I would like to

placed it on record that India made its own 4G and 5G and it was launched by honorable prime minister in September 25 and this was a journey uh we we took alone for 6G we would like this journey

to be together with the world because we were actually lagging behind we never developed 1G 2G 3G suddenly our honorable prime minister said you 4G and 5G and we did in two three years and it

is launched today uh serving close to 170,000 and base stations are radiating generating a data rate of 5 pabyte and will grow further. So 5G 6G is one area. The second area is quantum because as

all we know all many of the leading economies have put a sunset date to the current level of encryptions which will be broken because of the quantum computers and therefore there is a need

to work on quantum uh together. We uh particularly in CO we work only in quantum communication. In fact uh I am the chair of the national quantum communication hub along with IIT Madras.

Uh we we fund lot of research uh into quantum uh to startup. So uh so this could be another area where we could work together. The third thing is um I'm not I'm not aware what kind of frauds

happen in Germany or happen or don't happen in India. there were you know there were a series of frauds cyber fraud calls or these type of calls so we developed the system at India scale and

are successful today in blocking for example I'm just giving example of we used to get 1 million regular international calls and we were getting 15 million spoofed calls 15 million

spoofed calls per day and uh at my gateway in 5 millcond I have to decide whether this call is a one call or spoof call today we have deployed that system in India which in [clears throat] five

sec millisecond tells you this is a spoof called drop it and this is a result called send it so at India scale we have developed a platform called scharsati.gov.in

in I don't know how many of you are aware that this is again a digital intelligence platform one side is exposed to the customers the citizens and the back in back it is connected to

all kind of stakeholders because what used to happen if as telecom I have declared one u let me check time also yeah I think it's happening so one is that uh you know if in telecom I have

said this number is fraudulent bank doesn't know police doesn't know so what we did we integrated all of these stakeholders in one single platform what we called digital intelligence platform.

Once I declare this number to be a fraudulent number for any reason it is flagged in bank, police everywhere so that everybody takes care. Today when the actual uh financial transitions

happen between A to B, there is a module which we have developed called FRI financial risk indicator. Before the money is transferred, the bank digs through the database and says this money

is going to B. Is it safe? So my my system tells you no it is not safe. This guy is not a safe guy. So the transition is stopped. So we have done the fraud management at scale. Uh we would like to

you know uh work with Germany to further enhance it and how to use AI into this. And going forward I would only say my time is over. AI should not uh widen inequalities. Uh it should strengthen

inclusion, productivity and resilience. Uh let us ensure AI becomes a pillar of sustainable economic growth and social good. As Anandi said, we already have an MOU with uh Franhopper which we are

working together. Uh I would be very happy that you know if this partnership goes much beyond and we together uh going forward given the geopolitical changes happening going forward together

we go and develop the technologies together for the uh wider social good. Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; Thank you Dr. I I can only underscore that it has been an absolute privilege

working with you and it is not something where German technology is being given to C do but we are actually co-creating there are India specific challenges for which teams from C dot who are extremely

qualified and they have amazing infrastructure I would really appreciate at some point uh Dr. some of our German delegates maybe not this time but next time come and see the

kind of work you're doing because I think that brings a different level of understanding inside and trust uh without wasting any time I'm sure all of you are listen waiting to listen to do

professor Dr. synonyist uh we had her yesterday and I must tell you that it's really amazing to see first of all a woman as a head of innovation and digitalization in Germany uh and

secondly somebody who has really a lot of deep insights like in the last two times that I've heard you ma'am you really bring to the table so the floor is yours

&gt;&gt; that's not easy for from the technical point of view here. &gt;&gt; So thank you. Thank you. Ani I'm really a fan not only of you and women who are leading in such a kind as you do it and

others here. I'm a fan of frown hoofer as well because uh as you already pointed out uh they try to get the leg between research and then bringing it really to society and to economy growth

and at the end of the day I'm coming out of the biotechnology area and I think we really have lost a lot of chances in coming from the research really bringing to economic growth and I think AI has

the opportunity and as well uh quantum as you mentioned to do this and dear excellencies and gentlemen's ladies it it's a great honor for me to deliver special address I never have given a

special address and uh try to to to hit this uh at this Indoian National Technology Forum I'm coming out of a region where we are working together and strong together with

frowner. Even in my hometown we have two and uh one of this is a frowner uh cyber security where we have base the digital hub of cyber security as well. So we built startup we build up a startup

ecosystem in the area on the interface of cyber security and uh digital and AI. So maybe this could be an anchor point afterwards. As a minister for digitalization and

innovation, I very much welcome the opportunity to discuss how we can turn AI into concrete public value in manufacturing, in agriculture, in healthcare and through trustworthy AI.

As uh Thomas Kuna has pointed it out, the AI summit all is about AI and we see how dynamic the process is going on. AI is already transforming how we produce, how we heal, how we grow food and how we

govern. And the key question therefore is not if AI will shape our society. The question is how and whether economic development and

social good move forward together rather than separate directions and looking at the dynamic AI is going forward. We really have to be careful that we balance these economic development and

the social part. And I think this is something which has to do with trust full or trust as well. Even my region developed a cl a clear strategy and our digital strategy and AI

strategy are based on a simple but I hopeful demanding principle that is technology must serve people not the other way around. Our AI made in his agenda combines innovation with

responsibility. And we want AI that strengthens competitiveness, but also social cohes, fairness and trust. And this is a way we invest not only in research and

infrastructure, but also in practical project that deliver tangible benefits for citizens and business. So we have a funding program. It's over 60 billion and we invest in

people who have a vision in how AI can benefit human. So we invest in 170 startups till now and I want to give you some examples so that you get an idea. uh and I start with healthcare because

healthcare is one of the most promising fields where I for social good we support innovative project that would be very difficult to realize without our public backing and we found we fund uh

for instance one project it's called demo and demo it's not duo it's duo and it's a small uh it's a small group three uh who are working on PhD at the technical

university of Damstat my I'm a ma and I was happy to give them 1.8 8 million euro because they are developing a loadbearing roboting wheelchair, essentially a walking robot that can

safely and autonomously overcome barriers such as stairs or uneven ground using advanced robotics and AI. This project will have for the people with mobility impairments that is not

science fiction. It is a difference between dependence and independence participation on everyday life and I think that is really a good example how we invest our funds. Another example is

Riska risk um stratification in cardiology using AI. The goal is build a clinic decision support system that analyzes patterns in ECG recordings with AI and detects cardiovascular diseases

at an early stage. So you can go through prevention. That are two of a lot of AI and healthcare startups we are given our funds in. And a second field I would like to highlight

is agriculture. Even for India agriculture is a very important area and which crucial pillar of economic development and food security. Again we support a project uh and this

is only one of a lot on the early detection of plant diseases using automated analyzes of satellite data. So we even connected with the space AI models can recognize signs of plant

stress and disease at every early stage of growth circles. So you can really reduce pesticides and analyze before the plant disease occurs. AI can at the end of the day make

agriculture more sustainable and more productive at the same time. And I think this is something where we have to go through. Another example in our strategic agenda in the future of AI is

that we set up an AI innovation lab at Hian AI co-unded by my ministry and we provide a high performance computing environment specifically for AI applications along with advisory

services for science business and public administration. So this is a particular focus in the startup and we want to enable smaller players to develop innovation AI

solutions and we want to be at the end of the day in a position that trustworthy AI is not a slogan but a practical challenge and this is why we established an AI quality and testing

hub and has a public private company that develops s methods and tools to test AI systems. So at the end of the day, the aim is to translate the idea of trustworthy AI into testable criteria

and practical producers that business can use real deployments. So you can say that is trustful AI and we give it as a trust building um criteria. At the end of the day I think

looking on the discussions we have had in the last days that the inan German dimension is particularly important. India has shown with initiatives like ADA, UPI and India

stack how digital public infrastructure can scale and enable innovation at massive levels. Germany can bring expertise in regulation, not too much data protection

and quality assurance. Together we can build bridges between scale and safeguard, between innovation and rights, between economy, development and social good. Because we are thinking

grounded on the same values, democratic values. And let me close with a conviction that guides our work. AI will not automatically lead to better outcomes.

It depends on the choices we make, what we fund, how we regulate, which ecosystems we build and whom we include. So let us proceed on our democratic values and go forward with a union

German collaboration in VI. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much professor Dr. synonymous uh was really a thoughtprovoking and a very concrete uh talk on what we can do with AI as the

scope for the German collaboration without which ado let me take forward what we on the topics that you have mentioned by inviting the four CEOs to please come on stage can I request that

three symban and prashant to kindly come We have a few minutes to uh really get into the topics and I would like to start by very quickly saying that uh in

the last few days I've attended quite a few of the sessions here and there are so many nomenclatures for AI. It's been defined as a transformational technology that comes once in several years. People

gave examples of the steam engine and of the internet u you know revolution and industry 4.0 which dramatically changed the way we live and work. We are now riding an AI transformation but complete

with anxiety with speculations with admiration but also with excitement. So let me take the audience through to what makes a CEO stay up at night and let me start with Patri Bosch has

been a pioneer in India. You know you came here century ago and you've stayed on resilience in the Indian market which has not always been very easy. Um and you cover a lot of base scanning across

manufacturing, software, medical and many more sectors. How does the vision board of uh Bosch lead in terms of the AI development and the deployment? &gt;&gt; Maybe the first question what keeps me

awake in the night? um the fact that you are 100 years old um and you know if you're 100 years old the the uh the effort that you make change is also higher so uh that keeps me awake at

night. Uh as Bosch I think we are uh we are working on two sides of it. So one side you know if you see we're deploying AI uh to on the into the market now if you see

autonomous driving AI cockpit or AI in healthcare so these are all products which go into the market. So fundamentally we are you know uh navigating a new business model new

behavior of consumer and developing our products for that. On the other side, now you are using AI to disrupt longheld beliefs of how we build software, how we do engineering. So this is massive. You

know while we have huge excitement to position our AI centric products in the market uh I would be dishonest if I say we don't have anxiety how to get over the paradigm shift of engineering and

software development using AI. So these are two edges at which we are operating now. &gt;&gt; Thanks so much Cindu. Let me come to you. you know you are the world's leader

in enterprise application software at one time I remember you telling me that 97% of companies worldwide use SAP uh it is already embedded in your workflows even before people are talking and

wondering how to go about it but how do you see you have a responsibility because you have a captive client base how do you see these innovative technologies being rolled out to

companies while they still have anxieties about their business and how do you go about get assurging those spheres and building in a model that works on layers that are already set and

like he said very difficult to move right now in retrospect. &gt;&gt; Well first of all uh Ani it's great to be here absolute honor to be amongst this very distinguished panelists and

you and all the previous speakers who are on stage. Yeah, I think like Daddy said, we live in very times which are changing and particularly in technology, right? I

mean, literally every day you have to open up and see what is the new LS that's on, right? So that's the principle and which we are now including. So in that sense this is also

the assurance when we say when we talking about we the world's largest enterprise application portfolio from SAP there's a lot of cost that our customers place on us many of them

sitting right here at this table you all and and so when when we say 87% of the world's business commerce touches and SAP system still it's a matter of lack of um responsibility and a lot of trust

which we continue to take forward given that we serve 26 industries and across 12 portfolios that we have right but at the same time given which pace at which technology is changing our

responsibility also from an AI perspective it's embedding AI across the core of our business processes. So if you take a process like a lead to cache or a total weight force management or a

design to upgrade strategic sourcing or procurement this is what we assure our customers that when you run at your best you run the most compliant and the most ethical and the most responsible manner

right and so that we uh to make sure and protect the choice we give customers also the choice to in a secure manner, in a compliant manner, in an ethical manner

and in a responsible manner. And which means also translating I think we get it from several of our speakers responsible design. You need to be able to explain how to this u decision that you're

making or asking the user to make. Giving that explanability, transparency, the fairness of that decision making, auditability, right? And that becomes even more important because today when

we talking about agent we're talking about autonomous workflows where a lot of that decision making yes the human is in the room but part of the workflow is completely autonomous right and so

that's a lot of the work that's what's keeping us busy at night and mornings I would say uh and really making sure that when we say customers can run at their best in a compliant in a secure in a

responsible manner how do we make sure that they are to make volume happen for customers to run in a safe manner. Whether you're up at night or not,

you're certainly on a to person who's been up at night for several months now and I can personally vouch for that is crashant. Uh Continental is now a Romeo. It has not

only changed in name but also in terms of his core processes, some of his business sectors. So um innovation is not only in the name, it's also what you do. What is Awome now up to and what is

happening? &gt;&gt; First of all, thank you for having uh I'm sure all the panelists agree. I think in India we have moved from

support ups to center of excellence. I think at we focusing on two things. one is certain evaluation for our customers for the organization for the stakeholders and the second is

customercentric uh uh innovation uh just to let you know one year I think we've been able to gain efficiency improvement in R&amp;D in excess of 20%. How did we do this? Actually

there were two things we do with one strengthen core technology be it plants in terms of how do we enhance the quality using AI be it be in terms of you know when you products there's

always a lot of false calls which requires a lot of efforts for you to redo that. So that's where the implementation of AI in terms of enhancing the quality and the second is

certainly human development I think using the uh GitHub what that was talking about where this base coding and also for uh developing different test scenarios and a test situation. So these

are the things what we are really focusing on. uh one as I said uh how do we really enhance the velocity in engineering in R&amp;D we using this automated technology and uh also we

introduce something called Ricknet in automotive the biggest challenge today with so much of complexity of technology is uh coming over to recruitment because

always you leave one or two uh which is very very important like how do you really enhance yes in terms of the recruitment and second is certain in terms of agentic which is used in the

enterprise in the support function like finance controlling or BP market analytics. Yeah. So this helps us in giving a very good summary for the leadership to take decision based on the

data and third is certainly on the horicola um in the product innovations and we have a place here in the German stand where we have displayed which is dollar here in India one on the

autonomous mobility which is called enhance night vision where being able to with the use of the enhance only the uh uh the vision camera vision in the night for easier detection and the second is

something called e travel companion where you seamlessly interact with the vehicle. Um the third is access like all driver seamless access with the car. These are

the three which was developed innovations which is displayed in the German stand as well. So in summary, I think uh we continue to drive make use of a what we call from our increase to

uh a seamless integration uh into the uh corporation. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much Prasham. Uh let me go to Mercedes. Uh Mercedes-Benz is a northstar in innovation. I mean you've

been around several decades. uh it's also been a very competitive environment in manufacturing which uh a lot of people say that Germany has lost its edge but it's an old school field. So

how do you bring in AI into the settled kind of operations which is reflected in your standardized operations and very uh I said old school procedures. Is is it challenging to get AI into it now?

Good morning everybody and thank you for having me here. Yes, Mercedes has been one of the most invited companies and we plan to remain in past 14 years and maybe next many 100

years. Uh AI as a technology is not a challenge. We don't say any technology is a challenge and we have been using it. I think if I'm not wrong, MercedesBenz was the first automotive

company to bring AI into the cars in 2019 itself. So if you have been driving cars from cars from 2012, you must have experienced AI there itself. Today our focus is is multifold. For example, we

want to offer technology to our customers. That means you you you drive the car and you experience a while in the car uh the way car behaves you directed the car etc and then perhaps

are behaving in the seat and a second part that we also using planning to use is that should we tighten our operations using AI we want

to bring operational efficiency using AI and many things happening agent has such thing be trying to you know evaluate or implement how we can bring the benefit to all of

us. So in the technology it's very exciting because it's sometimes you feel that I was making so many things but I think that's

now and then does the same thing and say impact. So we looking forward to you know going ahead with this and using it &gt;&gt; and of course MBRDI in Bangalore is playing a very big role into this

process initiative. &gt;&gt; Do you think the 19 application was largely developed in India to by experts back then? Yeah. And in fact, I've heard one say that every Mercedes-Benz today

has one component or one replication coming in from your Bangalore [snorts] out of it, which is fantastic to do. It was so beautiful. India for

&gt;&gt; Yeah, [sighs] we have another five minutes and I'd like to use this for a rapid round, rapid fire round talking about India. So uh we've always heard about the you know the big combination

of manufacturing excellence in Germany engineering scale and speed in India. Uh let me ask Datri is this this heightened German interest in India is it offensive or defensive given the what happened?

Yeah, I would say it was long overdue. You know, I think you know that given the capabilities of the two countries and the common ethos that we share uh for for reasons unknown, we play it very

low. Uh while many others play it uh significantly high. uh so I think now uh we can collaborate on many dimensions uh not just the precision engineering of uh Germany much more than that because the

pragmatic approach Germany brings in to solve problems from the first principles is what is required now because we in a phase where we are to cut the norms of AI and to marry the substance of AI. So

for this I think we uh I mean you all know in this uh room uh the diplomatism on Germany you know how we can bring in together. So it's absolution I see. &gt;&gt; Thank you. That's very diplomatically

put. Uh sir I come to you. You have just inaugurated a huge campus and you have admissions of taking more than 14 15,000 people. Uh the controversial question that I'd like to put to you is they say

that the cost arbitrage is 4 is to one that is for four one German you can get four Indians in India not only more answerage they say it's just the opposite right so

we are looking at a de demographic dividend in India but there is a huge aspect of inclusion productivity skilling, reskilling, how does that play into your vision for India?

&gt;&gt; You started off by talking about the campus, right? And if we were talking only from a start point of view campus, right? So that that bush we just had chancellor's commentary

as well and right looking at India as a constant arbitrage is on the brand I think any of my hats onto the I don't see it in any of those conversations

let's let's not be today when you look at you mentioned GitHub copilot and if I just look at cloud code the latest office uh that we have the speed at which you can

do this is of course changing but what it means also is experts can focus on high value focus areas right and high valued main use cases and this is the beauty of the pace at which innovation

is going and this is also why companies like SAP or anybody else here in this table are invested in India because we want to bring the best of countries and and and beside customers all over the

world. So we really want to bring this and the pace at which our people here in in India are able to take forward understand the context drive forward things drive that product leadership

creation of IT the change we are talking about and that is why we are all so bullish on on driving this kind of innovation power friendly Indian field. &gt;&gt; Thank you Sindu. I have actually two

more provocative questions for my other two but uh due to the aosity of time we'll have to take a break uh because we still have morally talking about a study but I think uh the the fact is clear

that if opportunity you have Indian opportunity like never before it's an inflection point it is an opportunity for cocreation and working together in a in a very like um minister said with

shared values with a very clear agenda and I thank you very for being here and for sharing your thoughts and uh can we will you quickly come and talk about your study please

&gt;&gt; because we just have two minutes and we have to close and quickly come &gt;&gt; sure take a seat and two minutes I have no idea I'm going to go through this but

2018 industry.
