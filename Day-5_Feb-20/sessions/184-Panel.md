## 📝 Transcript

It works without resilient secure infrastructure is both timely and essential. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Mr. Ju. you know.

So firstly, congratulations to all of you for hosting one of the most spectacular AI summits that the um world has ever seen with about 250,000 attendees and uh congratulations to uh

his honorable prime minister Mr. Narendra Modi as well as minister um um for actually bringing us all together to talk about what the possibilities of the future are with AI. So what I thought

I'd do is I wanted to actually walk you through where we are today and what the possibilities are and what the constraints are going to be that we need

to overcome. But let me just take a step back and say that we are probably moving at a pace that is faster than we've um ever either expected or seen before with AI and we are now squarely in the second

phase of AI. So we started with this kind of notion of intelligent chat bots that answered questions for us um you know that felt like magic three years ago and now we're at this point where

agents are conducting tasks and jobs for us almost fully autonomously and we're actually soon going to go to the third phase which is physical AI as well and what this is going to do is

fundamentally reimagine work across a multitude of dimensions and vectors that we had never even imagined before. Now if you think about what AI is doing is it's basically

forcing us to rethink every assumption that we've had in society and I think a lot of these are going to be positive and we also need to keep be mindful of the downsides that might be there but if

you really think deep and long and hard um the first thing that I'd say is the modern development process for software development has completely changed and flipped at this point in time where AI

is going to in fact at Cisco we have our first product that was 100% built and coded with AI where there was no human writing a single line of code right the what that actually has as an

implication is that your um your exponential curve of innovation is almost going to feel like a vertical line and

how we need to adjust for that because right Now what's happening is that the rate of change is going to accelerate. But as that acceleration is happening, what you'll find is the absorption rate

of technology is still not quite at the same level as the innovation rate of the technology itself. And so rather than having a human in every loop, which is the way that we've thought about it, we

need to flip that model and make sure that AI is in every loop rather than thinking about a human in the loop. And the big mindset shift that's starting to occur is this notion that you know these

aren't just productivity tools. These are going to be augmented teammates into our society uh where they will be working on behalf of humans for humans to go out and conduct things that we

actually need additional capacity for. So then the question to ask is what could hold progress back for AI? And we think there are three things that could fundamentally be impeded for

the progress of AI. The first one is an infrastructure constraint. And what I mean by that is there's just not enough power, compute, and network bandwidth in the world. Now there's not enough

memory, enough capacity to build out the data centers. These are massive constraints and infrastructure is oxygen for AI. If you don't have enough amount of infrastructure, you're not going to

be able to make sure that you can fulfill and harness the full potential of AI. So infrastructure is the first big constraint that we see. The second big constraint is this notion of a

context gap. If we think of each one of us in our lives, the way that we think about acknowledging kind of, you know, gathering information is we are taking

trillions of tokens of context every second and assessing it in our brains and actually informing ourselves of what we need to do as we move forward. These agents are going to need to have that

same level of context enrichment. And if they don't, they'll still make decisions, but they're not going to be very good decisions, you know. So the second one is this this fundamental

context gap. And then the third area is a trust deficit. If you don't trust these systems, you're never going to be able to use them. And you'll actually see that there's an impedance to

adoption as a result of the absence of trust. So you have to make sure that you actually start to think about safety and security at a fundamentally different level than what we've seen before. And

if you think about what the new metric for success is, the new metric for global competitiveness moving forward is our ability to safely, securely, and efficiently generate

tokens for the use of AI, right? And every com every country and every company is going to actually get measured by your ability to safely,

tokens. And that'll directly impact your economic prosperity as well as national security. So let's go into each one of these three constraints and talk about like what the

dynamics are and how do we need to make sure that we overcome them. Because if you look at the pattern on the infrastructure side, specifically with what's happening with agents, what

you're starting to see is as we move from chat bots to agents, the pattern of inferencing is going from this very spiky kind of compute um you know, consumption that used to happen to a

much more steady state, you know, kind of persistent demand signal that you're starting to see in the market, right? And that'll have a very very different level of infrastructure requirements

than what we might have seen before. And so I think we have to keep that in mind as we're building out the rest of um you know these kind of token generation factories that we're building

out. We'll need to make sure that they can actually accommodate for that second um you know kind of behavior model rather than the first one. Now as you go into the context gap imagine this.

Imagine if you're an ER doctor and imagine that you actually had an unresponsive patient and you had no charts on the patient. you had no history about the patient. You had no

symptoms that you knew that the patient was experiencing. How would you be able to go treat that patient? You might still be able to do it, but you're going to make a bunch of guesses, right? An

agent without context is still going to make decisions, but those decisions might not be the kind of decisions we want that agent to make. And so, we have to make sure that we figure out

effective and efficient ways to enrich context for that agent, for the AI. And it's if you in the absence of that it's just going to be forced to guess and those guesses are as good as you

flipping a coin and you know head showing up. So how do you close that context gap and so the way you close the context gap the first one is these models have been trained on human

generated data that's publicly available on the internet but we are running out of human generated data publicly available on the internet. So now what you're starting to see is there's a

tremendous amount of enterprise data that's actually intellectual property of these companies. Can we make sure that we can enrich these models with this proprietary enterprise data for the

purposes of that organization so that they can create competitive differentiation? Right? And so the first one is this notion of connecting enterprise data to AI and agents. The

second big area is no this notion of enriching agents with machine data because right now what you see is most of the data is human generated data that these um AI models have actually been

using. We need to make sure that we use machine data. What does machine data mean? It's time series data when something you and all of us humans we start our

day by actually consuming machine data. We might check the weather. That's machine data. You know, as you have more and more agents, 55% of the growth of data in the world is going to be machine

data. As these agents work 7 by 24, you'll have much much more data and logs, metrics, events, traces that'll actually need to be consumed. So that second area of agents being enriched

with machine data is going to be critical for these agents actually operating with a sufficient level of context. And third is you have to embed AI in every workflow. You can't just

actually think about that as I'm just going to have a tool that augments to my broken process. You have to fundamentally rethink the process that accommodates these agents. Agents don't

adjust to us. We have to adjust our process to the agents so that they can actually be effective for us. So that's the second big area is the context gap. And then the third area that we talked

about was this notion of a trust deficit. And in AI, the risk with AI now is no longer that AI is going to give us the wrong answer. The risk with AI is AI is

going to take the wrong action. And when you actually start having an AI take the wrong action, the consequences are far more grave than just giving you the wrong answer. So what do we have to do?

So there's two areas that we think are going to be really important. The first one is we got to make sure that these agents get protected from the world which means that jailbreaking an agent

having prompt injection attacks u making sure that there is a level of two abuse or data poisoning we have to make sure that we can protect the agents from that happening. And then the second thing we

have to do is we have to make sure that we can protect the world from the agents so that the agent starts going rogue. it starts having behavior that's we can actually make sure that we can provide

effective guard rails at runtime because no longer is governance a document. It's going to be a runtime implementation so that as the agent is working if you start seeing that the

agent's doing something that's not going to be in the best interest of humans we have to be able to inject guard rails into that dynamically at runtime so that we can make sure that that that creates

a level of trust for the system. Now, it turns out that Cisco is actually building solutions across all of these three areas. And so, the way that we think about ourselves is we want to

invent and innovate in making sure that the critical infrastructure for the AI era is as simple to deploy, as safe and secure as we want it to be, and as contextenrich as it can be. So, what are

we doing? We're building networks that agents will run on. We're building context that makes it richer for these agents to operate in a way that allows us to make sure that we

can delegate safely and securely to them and feel good about the outcomes that we're going to get. And we're going to make sure that we're going to have security that governs these agents. And

all of this is going to be done with a tremendous amount of observability and visibility that says in every layer of the stack from the way that the GPU is getting utilized to how the model is

performing to the how the apps are being built to how the agents are performing we can have observability from bottom to top in the entire stack. Because if we can do that and figure out

that every company, every country is generating tokens in the most effective and secure way then you're going to see that there's progress being made. Now why is this a tremendous opportunity for

India? Because India is not just going to use AI. What the way that we've seen over the poor course of the past week is you're actually helping shape the

direction of the entire world with AI. And I think there's a few key areas that we should all feel very hopeful for and why India can be a tremendous contributor um to AI for the rest of the

world. not not just for India but for the entire world. The first one is we have a huge talent pool of young, vibrant, intelligent, smart, educated people within India that actually

contribute to the workforce. We've got one of the largest groups of people under 30 that are actually going out and contributing to the economy. Number two is we have a very strong

digital foundation. Having common identity with Aadhaar, having uh UPI, these are things that you know we in India you all might take for granted but these are these are very rare to come by

in in countries especially at scale. And third, India actually has massive massive scale. And why is that important? Because AI works best with scale. Because AI works best when you

have the most amount of data, right? And so the way I think about this is we have a tremendous opportunity ahead of us. Now the future is not going to be built by AI alone. In fact, the

future gets built when humans can confidently put AI to work and delegate jobs and tasks to AI in a way that we feel safe and secure. And so I I'm actually as hopeful as I've ever been.

However, I also feel like there's tremendous amount of risks of these things can going sideways. And so we as a community have to band together and make sure that we actually work as an

ecosystem to keep AI safe and secure because if we do that in the right way, we're going to solve the hardest problems that humanity has faced and reduce and hopefully end suffering in so

many different areas. We might be able to cure the best uh the the hardest diseases that we've not been able to overcome. We might be able to overcome poverty. we might be able to overcome um

you know the gaps around education so that that can be evenly distributed to people. We can make sure that we can improve people's quality of lives. So I think there's a lot to be excited about

but those constraints need to be kept in mind and we are so grateful to be partnering with India in this journey ahead. So thank you all. Take care. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much Mr. Ju Patil. That was

really an interesting session by CEO Cisco highlighting the agentic AI, the role of agentic AI as well as the physical AI and the current scenario. And also the last line was really an

assuring line saying that the future will not be built by AI but by humans who can put confidently put AI to use. Well, ladies and gentlemen, moving on. Now, it's my honor to introduce a leader

who's been at the forefront of shaping the future of wireless technology and intelligent computing. Mr. Cristiano Ammon is the president and chief executive officer of Qualcomm, a company

that has defined and continues to redefine the global compute connectivity and AI landscape. And well, AI doesn't just live in the cloud, it runs in your pocket, in your car, in the factory

floors. And Mr. Ammon is leading Qualcomm's push to bring powerful AI processing to the edge, enabling billions of devices to think locally and act intelligently. Ladies and gentlemen,

it's my pleasure to invite Mr. Ammon, president and CEO of Qualcomm to the stage. Please give a round of applause. &gt;&gt; Good afternoon everyone. very very happy and privileged to be here. I'm

incredibly excited and energized about what's happening here in India with AI and I think what's happening with AI in general. What id like to talk to you today is uh about the next chapter of AI

and u this is something that's very near and dear to Qualcomm. We've been we've been talking about this because I think we're really entering now the next phase of AI. as AI gets developed is going to

be part of everything uh that we do and especially the interaction that we have with computers and with digital systems. So intelligent is no shifting for something that we kind of started and uh

we all experience going to you know a chat box and asking question into something that is going to be all around us and everywhere all the time especially with the devices. I actually

love the presentation right before from my friend Jitu from Cisco when he talked about the traffic change from chatbots to agents and this is important. I'm you know I've been often talking about this

how we should be thinking about AI in a much broader sense and it's easier for a company like Qualcomm to talk about this because we build a lot of the chips that go into devices where the humans are. So

as you create AI in the data center and you train and create those models all this data and you deploy this you're starting to see that this get utilized in different ways. One fundamental thing

that AI is doing for us, it is changing the human computer interface because we don't have to now learn how to use a computer. If you know I've been uh often talking about this in

different presentations, we had to learn how to use an as keyboard and we still use that on a laptop. Then we use like to touch a screen. But now the AI understands what we see, what we hear,

what we say, what we write. So in itself it's changing computers is changing the devices we interact with and uh it's becoming a pervasive technology that is going to be everywhere and I think

that's the mission I think of Qualcomm when I think about uh what we going to do is the same way that what we did with mobile communications and the creation of of the computer that fits in the palm

of your hand is ability to take that intelligence everywhere. everywhere and it's going to be creating a number of important shifts in the industry and I want to start talking about the mobile

industry. uh we we may have had the the privilege as a company to be part of every single transition of wireless technologies and this talk today I'm going to talk about

the next one that is coming as well and what we saw with the transition of wireless technology that fundamentally at every generation of wireless you saw big shifts uh not only in in in devices

in companies and and because of the transition uh especially Especially for example when you went to the ability to have a phone that you carry with you all the way to connect the phone to the

internet all of a sudden that phone became a computer um and it started to drive the future of the internet like a country like India that leaprog I think the internet and went straight to the

mobile internet and that's going to be true again when you think about uh AI for example in the mobile ecosystem AI is going to fundamentally change how we think about the mobile device all of you

today and uh me included I think we we look of our smartphone of our inseparable device where most of our digital life is and the smartphone today is at the center of everything that we

do. Uh but now that's going to get replaced by an agent. Now when you think about the entire value chain that got created for example uh for the mobile industry there's enormous amount of

value on things like oss and application stores and that becomes like the platform when when you're going to develop an application that you're going to do different things into the platform

an agent that now understand human intentions because you know you just need to tell him what you want uh or he's going to see what you see and and and make a decision uh for you uh

assuming you will authorize it. Uh when that happens um that's where the value is because then the agent is free. Uh it can go to the internet and do things. It can go to your phone and do things and

uh you're no longer bound by constructs of your hardware or your apps and the application. So as a result we expect AI is going to have a fundamental shift in the mobile industry where where the

agent is going to be at the very center and as the agent is at the very center everything surrounds the agent. You can access the agent from from your mobile phone but you can also the agent from

your glasses or for a pendant or for anything that you wear. And I think we're going to look at the mobile ecosystem right now not only as a single device experience, but you're going to

connect uh to agents uh across multiple types of devices. And I think that's incredibly exciting. And that's not only unique to what you're going to see in consumers. That's going to happen also

with things you know because you now you can also have create AI that's going to get trained on different things on on physical signals like physical AI on sensor data and you're going to deploy

that in every computer. So what's exciting about AI is it's going to very quickly evolve or something you go to a browser and you ask a question and I think as uh as my colleague from Cisco

said is got trained on all the public a available data on the internet you're now going to go to a different type of AI experience that's going to be the fundamental software that is going to

run in all the devices around us and how you going to have interaction of that devices. So I also want to basically uh you know as as we think about this future I just want to give you an

example what we saw uh across the industry is workloads or use cases have shifted devices devices didn't go anywhere but the workload shifted we used to do a lot

of things on the in the early days of the internet on your laptop and for example e-commerce you will do it on your laptop now most of the e-commerce in the world is done on a on a phone

tomorrow. Uh or it could be like as early as you know within the end of this year as you start to see the proliferation of glasses. If you have a glass that has u agents is connected to

the internet has camera on those smart glasses. The glass see what you see. Um you can just look at something and say I would like to buy this. Uh what is uh you know it's can you check this uh for

example check this on Flipkart. uh what and just buy it for me. I would like to buy this. Um integration of payment system. You got a bill say pay this notify me when I'm done uh and so forth.

So I think we're going to see this fundamental change of devices. But that's go also going to be true about the revolution that's happening on robotics and and the revolution that is

actually happened on industrial. So that's incredible opportunity and we we have been incredibly focused as a company to basically drive that future of computing.

There's also a big debate which I believe uh is the wrong way to look into that which is about cloud and edge. Uh there's a lot of debate about oh this is going to be running on the cloud this

going to be running running on the edge and actually it does not matter. I think about your device today your smartphone today has incredible amount of processing power and there's a number of

different things that run in your smartphone. If you put on airplane mode uh you probably don't use it. You just put it back and wait until you get connectivity again. It's the most cloud

connected device because those things work as a one. It is. And you're going to have now intelligence that's going to be incredibly distributed across the cloud, across uh the near edge, the

network in itself and on device. And it's all going to work seamless. They're going to things that you're going to be able to do on the device uh because they're they require an instant response

or require unique context unique information that is relevant to you. Something is going to do on the cloud and they're both going to be growing and it's going to be

transforming how we think about computers. So I like to provide uh the simple I think a description. Let's say we all using agents and you're going to pick the agent that you like and the

agent to be useful it needs to be fast. It needs to be relevant for you. Let's say, go back to this example, the example I provided on the glasses and you have those smart glasses and

you're walking around and you have a camera. Then all of a sudden you see somebody and you ask this glass like it's some like it's your friend next to you and said, "Who is this person?" And

and you want to get a response. This is so and so. Or you're going to say like, "What? Can you translate this for me? Uh what is this? Can you pay this for me?" You wanted this this thing has to be

similar as no friction. So certain things are going to be done on your device and the things going to be on the cloud. It's going to be completely transparent to you. But the interesting

thing is those agents for them to be very useful. They needed to be contextually aware of what is relevant to you. So over time the agent that I'm going to be using, the agent you're

going to be using, they need to be relevant to me. So you're going to have a lot of things that are going to be uh being processed and understood about you. So much so that I believe that in

the end game I think it was said in the prior presentation from Cisco that all this available data that is publicly on the internet that you train models it's a fraction of the data that is going to

be generated if you have for example a glass of a camera that sees everything that you see try to annotate that image get information about the image and the context uh reads what you read uh and so

forth. That is an incredible amount of data and that's going to be providing a lot of important context for those models going to be relevant to you. That is the future and uh it's an incredible

transformation. It's going to transform every industry. No industry is immune to this. And I think what we're doing as Qualcomm is really creating the future hardware and software that will help

enable this future across all the devices. We were very unique semiconductor company. I think when we're probably one of the few companies that can be working on chips from sub 2

millwatts to a smart earbud uh that you're going to wear all the way to now 2,000 watts per chip on the data center. But I think that's the incredible future that AI is going to transform every

single computer and uh the agents are going to be at the center of the experience. is going to replace um a lot of the um oss and and and application definitions we see today and I that is

that is the new future of technology including the future of mobility and that's why we're incredibly excited about this and with that I want to talk about something that is happening

which is about the next generation of wireless technologies I would like to provide uh uh uh an example from the past when you think about telecom networks and I think we're

probably one of the uh you know uh American uh telecom companies uh that are really focus uh on the evolution of cellular technology. When you think about the evolution of this sector when

this all started was about providing a telephone. I think we all of us was an incredible thing. You have a twisted copper pair to get to your home. You pick up, you get a dial tone, you dial

and eventually could dial anybody in the world over a telephone. Even how cellar started was about make sure all of us had the ability to carry a telephone. That was the that was 2G uh that you can

call everyone. That's different today. Now you have a very high performance broadband uh network for data. Voice is just one application in the many applications that you do with the

network. It fundamentally changed the nature of the infrastructure. The equipment was different, the use case is different. We're heading to the next big transformation of the telecom uh sector.

6G is going to provide an evolution of connectivity, faster speed, lower latency, uh higher coverage. But that's not the story. That's just a piece of the story. It's just continue to improve

the connectivity. The biggest part of 6G is AI like I said before is now going to come to the telecom network and that becomes a large scale uh AI uh network that is processing and get trained on

all of the signals that happens at the network and providing new capabilities. One of the biggest features of 6G is the network is a sensing network at scale. I'm going to make example. The network

not only will provide a connectivity between your device um and and the internet, but will sense everything that's around you. We use techniques that you see today in autonomous driving

cars like uh radars as an example to detect your environment. It is going to provide a map of everything that is happening at scale and you're going to have completely different type of

services for different industries. It will provide context for your agents very important and the network will have that role. It will provide traffic management systems and some of the use

cases that are going to be uh you know part of uh full self-driving cars. You will do drone detection and manage the you know uh traffic control of of the uh economy. There's going to be aerial uh

in the wide area network and much more because AI is also going to the network. is going to be one of the biggest transitions I think we have as big as going from voice to data and it's all

going to part of this uh future of AI and I I just want to now make another parallel I think to the presentation from my colleague from uh Cisco it puts a fine point on on the the network that

needs to be built the cap capability of the infrastructure uh the security and trust but that is an incred incredible future with technology. And as I get to the end of the presentation, I want to

highlight that India has an incredible opportunity with this transformation. We have seen that those big shifts in technology creates opportunity, change players. It changed uh I think the the

role of uh different countries as they provide uh global scale for the technology and that's an incredible opportunity for India. I look of what happened in mobile in

India and one of the largest data consumption per user in mobile devices in the world is in India. The whole internet is mobile. when you think about the potential all those things that I

just discussed about how AI is going to change everything creates new device new experiences new services um that becomes a massive opportunity and when I look at the ambitions that was set by the AI

summit I'm going to provide just some examples those are just examples uh it can be very broader but I just want to connect with some of the ambitions um of the summit

there is a process of jumping into a large scale scale industrialization. Uh India is becoming a global manufacturing hub as well. And with AI, you go from the very beginning with

smart manufacturing automation with the incredible change that is happening in this sector enabled by those technologies. Same thing with smart cities, the ability to continue to

evolve uh the infrastructure, the ability to use AI uh to increase the scale uh the reach uh the access for health care, how you change education, those are

incredibly powerful uh you know learning tools, the ability to actually use some of those technologies to empower people with information and you're going to have an ongoing learning experience.

Think about those agents on that with you all the time answering questions, telling you how to do things especially when you think of context for example of those new devices such as smart glasses

and it can fundamentally change industries for example such as agriculture and this there's just few examples of the potential of connecting this technology with everything I think

that is going on in India. It's an incredible uh and excite you know exciting future uh enabled by AI and it's really it's going about uh me meeting the ambition of democratizing

this technology for everyone and actually being have an important role in increasing uh the global welfare and uh you know as a company that has always been focused on enabling uh our

partners in other industry to innovate. I think the history of Qualcomm we never believe is the job of one company to be responsible for all the innovation is really to enable many industries and

partner. Uh we're incredibly excited to play a very small part on this mission. Thank you very much for the opportunity to talk with all of you and enjoy the rest of summit. Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Thank you so much Mr. Cristiano Ammon for that very very interesting session and I'm sure each one of us must have gained something some new insights out of it. Are you all excited about such

sessions? Such keynote speakers louder yes would do better. Thank you. I think we all keep reading about AI. We all we all are aware of the challenges in front of the world when it

comes to AI but capital but U such sessions are actually adding such new perspectives to our understanding of AI the challenge and also the future what to expect in future so I think it's

really time to thank our keynote speakers who are adding such great value to our understanding of artificial intelligence as well as to this AI impact summit and ladies and gentlemen

Now, it's my honor to invite her excellency Bush, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Energy and Business, Sweden. Sweden has long been a quiet powerhouse of innovation from Ericson to

Spotify to some of Europe's most promising AI startups as Deputy Prime Minister Ms. Ebush is navigating the critical nexus between energy policy and AI infrastructure.

Now that's a challenge I think every nation will face as the data centers demand ever growing share of national power grids. Ladies and gentlemen, please join me in welcoming Deputy Prime

Minister of Sweden, Her Excellency Eva Bush. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much, excellencies, distinguished guests, dear friends. Namaste at zahine

and uh let me begin by expressing my sincere gratitude towards the government of India and to the organizers of this important summit. It is truly an honor to be here in beautiful beautiful India.

Given this unique chance to address you all today, I would like to talk about three points. About why first of all it is important to be here. Some reflections on public legitimacy and

finally about cooperation and AI sovereignty. India today is not only the world's largest democracy, it is a leading voice in shaping the future global order.

Your leadership matters. Your perspective matters. And the global south must be fully included when we shape the rules of innovation, technology, governance, and global

standards. Speaking as a European, as a proud Swede that represents the second largest international delegation here at the AI summit after France. That's worth an

applaud in itself. Thank you so much. The Nordics are deeply engaged here in India and we are here because we believe this partnership is strategic. It is long-term and built on trust. India is

not only the world's largest democracy. It is also the world's youngest democracy. And I am impressed with the long-term vision of India for a better life for young people with a commitment

that stretches across generations. And Sweden shares this long-term commitment. Since India first gained independence, Swedish companies have worked alongside Indian partners. And we

have grown together. And as India makes strategic investments in sovereign AI models and advanced research, ensuring that 1.4 billion people can benefit from AI. This is not only industrial policy.

It is in many ways poverty reduction. It is empowerment. It is development leap of historic proportions. Sweden intends to be a reliable and innovative partner as India continues

its economic rise. Prime Minister Moodi often talks about and speaks of India as Vishma, a friend to the world. Today we stand at a new frontier where that friendship is

more vital than ever. The frontier of artificial intelligence. Sweden is a proud friend of India. In the ancient scriptures, we read of the samudra,

the churning of the cosmic ocean. It teaches us that collaboration is the only way to truly unlock the deepest treasures. Today the vast ocean of data is our samudra and AI is our turning

rod. Clearly thank you. So as you understand clearly there are very very good reasons why we are here and why this summit is taking place in India in New Delhi. And that brings me

to the point of uh legitimacy. In 1450 with modern time telling when the printing press was introduced the reaction from the status quo was not excitement it was fear.

power had long depended on being able to control information. And suddenly knowledge could scale. And if you um look back at the arguments that we heard then they they're a bit familiar

actually. This will spread the wrong ideas. People won't know what to trust. Society will lose control. And people, especially writers at the time, will lose their jobs.

But the printing press wasn't dangerous. What was dangerous was not understanding it. Those who understood it could soon reach a nation in only two weeks and a whole continent possibly in two months.

Every major technological shift follows the same sort of emotional curve. It goes from fear, then trust, then legitimacy, and finally a worldwide transformation.

We are now living through another such moment. An artificial intelligence isn't just another digital upgrade. It is a fundamental shift. AI is no longer about algorithms alone. It is about control of

energy, compute, capacity, data and trust. Nations that master AI infrastructure will shape economic growth, industrial capac competitiveness, and democratic

resilience for decades. It's going to make a massive shift. Make no mistake, we are not digitalizing the old economy. We are building an entirely new global AI industry. One that will redefine the

foundations of productivity, of health care, of defense, energy systems, and of course also public administration. The nations that lead this transformation, they will prosper. Those

that merely consume AI built elsewhere will fall behind. The future will not be decided necessarily by the ones that big builds the biggest models, but rather the ones

that build the most trusted systems. So for me, the question is not whether or not this transformation will happen. The question is who shapes it and on what values. And that is why I am here.

So let's um talk a little bit about something else that is often misunderstood data centers because AI much like fire it is powerful and in this sense it is invisible and it is

very energyintensive demanding of energyintens data centers often on the countryside rupturing forests and fields to many citizens data centers look like someone else's internet using our

electricity At least that's the debate in Sweden and I know in many other countries. But I believe that that perception is incomplete. In reality, they can be

longterm local job anchors if implemented and used correctly. They can enable renewable energy investments. They can be infra infrastructure for hospitals,

for research, defense, and industry. And they are the factories of the new economy. And this brings us to the core political challenge. People do not vote for technology.

People vote for outcomes, a job, a hospital that works, energy they can afford. If AI is to become electable in our democracies, policymakers must find a way to

translate complexity into tangible benefit. Fear turns into trust when we understand and when understanding grows. So how do we get there? No nation can build resilient AI infrastructure alone.

Democracies have to cooperate. AI sovereignty does not mean isolation. It means choosing your dependencies. To be able to choose our dependencies and the values that shape global AI, we also

need a measure of sovereignty over AI. True sovereignty, the way I see it, rests on three pillars. First, jurisdictional control. Knowing where your data is stored and processed.

Second, infrastructure capacity. Having sovereign compute for advanced models. And third, strategic choice. selecting partners from a place of strength, not dependency.

And in a turbulent world, you need to choose your friends carefully. Sweden is choosing India. India provides the incredible scale and speed, the very engine of this movement.

Europe and Sweden can provide precision and trust. The filter that ensures that we what we extract is the amit the nectar of progress for all. Just that Lord uh Vija Karma unified divine vision

with practical tools. We must unify the human heart with machine power. We must not see AI as replacement for the human spirit but as a power multiplier for human dignity. And when we combine

India's digital scale with Sweden's systematic trust, we do more than build code. We build a future where technology never outruns our values. Sweden offers Europe and all of our global partners

what the AI transition actually needs. So now you'll have a little bit of Swedish bragging which is not that very common. But first of all, we have an abundant of clean and um reliable NFG.

We export more electricity per capita than any other European country. AI is becoming the most efficient way to export energy without exporting electrons. In Sweden, AI training can

run a roughly onethird of the carbon footprint of a typical US hyperscaler operations. This transforms us from energy exporter to intelligence in exporter, a fundamentally more valuable

position. But energy alone is not enough. And that brings me to the second Swedish strength, industrial depth. Sweden has deep expertise in scaling complex industrial systems. We are

modernizing traditional industry while building new AI infrastructure and Europe cannot be underestimated. You cannot buy the bypass the European Union in the AI stack. Consider just ASML in

the Netherlands, the only company in the world producing extreme ultraviolet lithography machines essential for advanced ships or ARM in the United Kingdom whose architectures power most

of the world's smartphones and an increasing share of data center prop processors or SAP in Germany embedded in the missionritical enterprise systems of the global economy and of

Ericson from Sweden, a global leader in 5G and a frontr runner in 6G, the backbone of edge computing and AI enabled networks. You cannot build the AI ecosystems with Europe and you

shouldn't because we'll be a reliable partner. Third, but not least, trusted institutions. When you make a deal with a Swede, that is a handshake that you

can trust. And Sweden offers the ability to move from strategy to execution. In the Nordics, Sweden, Norway, Finland, and Denmark, we are now building AI gigafactories, manufacturing

intelligence at industrial scale with near zero carbon energy. We combine clean power, political stability, rule of law, technological sophistication, and a culture of trust. We see ourselves

as a sort of pathfinder helping define the roots that will shape global AI infrastructure for decades. At the same time, we are making strategic commitments during this planet

parliamentary term. We have committed a substantial amount of funds to AI research, AI development and implementation. Therefore, ensuring that Sweden seizes the economic and societal

benefits of this transformative technology. Building on that foundation, we are today presenting in Sweden an AI strategy with high ambitions. The strategy will outline concrete steps

that will steer Sweden towards sustained AI leadership. Our strategy not only demonstrates the scale of current commitment but also maps a path forward for Sweden's future. And we have

launched an oxa an AI workshop to help public sector adopt AI safely and efficiently because trust is built not by slogans but by implementation. And this implementation brings me back

to India. India understands scale. India understands development. Your investments in sovereign AI models ensures that AI speaks all of your languages, reflects your society, and

serves your people. This is what real inclusion truly looks like. When 1.4 billion people gain access to AI tools that empower farmers, small businesses, teachers, and doctors, that is not just

innovation. That is transformation. Partnerships between India and Sweden combine scale with engineering excellence, market dynamism with institutional trust. Together, we can

ensure AI strengthens democracy, drives sustainable growth, and expands opportunity. I'd like to sum up by saying people fear what they do not understand.

But what people understand and see value in they will defend. Our tasks as leaders is not merely to regulate AI. It is to make it legitimate, to make it understandable, and most importantly to

make it beneficial. If we succeed, AI will not be feared like the printing press. It will be embraced like electricity. Indiv invisible, indispensable, but empowering. Let us

shape this new industry together. Open, competitive, democratic and inclusive. The future of AI must empower our people and strengthen our shared prosperity. I look forward to doing this together with

India. Thank you so much. Thank you so much your excellency Bush for your valuable insights and for elevating the summit and it's really interesting to listen to the

perspectives of countries like Sweden because when we talk of AI for all and global c cooperation the role of each and every country becomes very very important. Ladies and gentlemen, before

I move on, I need to announce you that announce that there's a rupe card which we found. If somebody has lost this rupe card, though I don't know how much money is there, but if you've lost this rupe

card, kindly come to me and collect it from me. Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, now we move to the next panel discussion which is on adoption and acceleration of artificial

intelligence. The panelists joining us represent some of the most thoughtful voices on how AI is being built and adopted around the world. Mr. John Palffrey is the

president of the John D. and Katherine T. MacArthur Foundation, one of the world's most influential philanthropies where he has championed the idea that technology must serve the public

interest. His perspective on how AI can be deployed equitably, not just efficiently, is essential to the conversation. Miss Terons is the managing director and global head of AI

and data policy at JP Morgan Chase AI one at one of the world's largest financial institutions. She's navigating the frontier where AI meets regulation, risk and responsible deployment,

ensuring that AI in finance is not just powerful but trustworthy. Her excellency Paula Angibar is the minister of ICT and innovation for the government of Rwanda. Under her

leadership, Rwanda has emerged as one of Africa's most ambitious digital economies, proving that visionary governance can leapfrog traditional development pathways.

And we also have Mr. Stephen Bird as the panelist who is the global head of thematic research and Morgan at Morgan Stanley bringing the investors lens to the question of which AI bets are real

and which are hype. And this discussion will be moderated by Mr. Rudra Chadri, vice president of observer research foundation. Ladies and gentlemen, please join me in welcoming Mr. John Palrey,

Miss Leon's, her excellency Paula Angibbar and also Mr. Rudra Chri. Kindly come to the stage for this a very interesting conversation, a panel on adoption and acceleration of AI. Mr.

Bird will be joining us very soon. Thank you. &gt;&gt; All right. Hi everyone. There's a good bit of distance between me and the panelists, which might be a good thing.

We'll see. Um, we've got about 25 minutes, so I'm going to keep it quite swift. The general panels about policy on the one side, adoption on the other, and I wonder if that's actually the

case. Yesterday in the inaugural, the prime minister made very clear that adoption is a huge opportunity for India and other parts of the global south, but we have to do it responsibly. President

Macron made a very similar pitch in his inaugural speech. And I want to start with that framing. And I want to come to you, Minister. Um, Rwanda is a fascinating country in

general, but you're particularly fascinating on the African continent because you were way ahead of the AI curve in a sense. You invested in a startup ecosystem. You were looking at

scale before many of us thought of use case scales. give us a sense of how Rwanda manages these minefields between governance policy on the one side and adoption at population scale on the

other. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much Rudy and great to see you all. I think for us the decision has always been clear around um how we leverage technology as a country to

drive uh social economic development and so AI like many other technologies that we've experimented with as a country we took the same posture and so the idea was uh figuring out how we leverage uh

this particular technology to address uh societal challenges and there were certain trade-offs that we had to make um when it comes to governance. It was a posture around rather than try to focus

more on regulating would rather figure out where do we see uh AI creating the biggest benefits and gains for society and then we're able to build regulations uh according to the use cases that we're

implementing and so the regulatory posture that we take then is more adaptive um and it's one where it's evidence-based because we're already building use cases using that to

determine what kind of regulations are needed and they're very specific to the problems that we are solving as opposed to trying to create a very abstract regulatory um framework which may not

necessarily address whatever risks and concerns um that we foresee. The second one has always been on partnerships because that's been key. The the level of development, digital development that

we've achieved as a country is thanks to the various partners that we've been able to attract into Rwanda. But partnerships, we also look at it very uh closely to determine how do we make sure

that these partnerships are helping us to build capacity. So for example, we're not going to acquire a foreign solution, invite them to train on our data, and just leave us with an application. We

want them to be able to train our people, co-develop this with our people, so that at least we have the skill set and the mastery of what we're trying to deploy, which will then create that

closed loop around the regulatory environment that we um put in place. And last, again, I think it's a it's a conversation that we've had throughout this week around sovereignty. Uh

thinking about data sovereignty by design. We're building our national data hub and we're really making sure we understand, you know, what are the guardrails that we put in place. We

don't want to wait for a crisis to start, you know, worrying about what who is using our data, what are they accessing that for. And so we started with already putting in place the data

protection and privacy law that governs how you collect, use and process data. And that has been the foundation through which we can then start to ensure that everything that we do from a data

sovereignty perspective we do we're doing it by design. &gt;&gt; So I'm going to come back to the question on the benefits of AI for all of you and for you minister in a minute.

You know this entire summit process started with Bletchley where I think if the general philosophy was that can we come to some kind of a global compact when it comes to risks and risk aversion

when it comes to early warning systems the institutional outcomes was these AI safety institutes that were built out. Can I ask a challenging question? Is from your perspective is a global

compact on something like AI actually possible or are there norms that we should generally be thinking about and fitting into our national jurisdictions? &gt;&gt; So I I believe a global compact is

possible. However, it has to reflect um the different context cultural linguistic everything. And so to a certain extent what you're looking at is what are some of those shared standards

that we all subscribe to as countries which are non-negotiables for everyone that is building and deploying AI uh products and solutions. And then obviously you then get to contextualize

it to whatever problems that you're solving for. And so again, it's going to come back to what are nations deploying AI to solve for and how do we make sure that these standards are reflective of

what we're looking uh to adopt as a through the global compact. &gt;&gt; Yeah, if I could come to you, you are you're leading AI at JP M. um you've been in the Obama

administration in a very different office on science and technology and policy way before the AI wave kind of hit us although people have been working for AI for three decades now. Just give

us a sense just just before I come to the immediate take us a sense back to those second term of the Obama administration. Give us a sense of how were you thinking about AI?

Well, I would say that era was the first in which global governments started considering AI policy questions at all. Um, and honestly, a lot of the same questions were being asked then as are

being asked now. Um, the question of global governance that the minister just spoke to, I think was top of mind then as it is today. Um, questions of standards generation and

interoperability were certainly uh part of the conversation. issues of fairness, transparency, bias mitigation, um sort of uh localization and other questions were all very much gerine. Um

so you know in many respects the field has completely transformed especially from a commercial perspective given the level of investment that we're seeing globally um in the last 5 years

especially but um in many other respects the foundational questions remain the same that um that policy makers were considering over 10 years ago. Um and and those questions I think are

applicable um uh in a lot of different directions. I you know I think one of the one of the big differences in the current moment is that I really feel like we've moved um

from an era where these these conversations have been more theoretical to an era in which they are much more applied and made much more real by the um the questions being asked by

organizations like ours for example as AI deploying entities um where the you know the issues of applied AI organizations are really where the rubber meets the road when it comes to

these governance issues that we're talking about from the stage and that policy makers have been considering for the last decade. &gt;&gt; So I think if I if I talk to most people

who've been for the first three summits and I talk to them about this summit there's a lot of argument about there's a lot of energy there's a lot of discussion on use cases diffusion

getting this out to humanity getting it out to people and now we have to work downstream and upstream and figure out how best to do the diffusion piece. Let me ask you a question is you've been

here for 3 4 days for the summit era. Um what's really struck you in terms of the diffusion argument, the adoption argument and then if you put your policy regulatory lens to it, what are you

thinking right now? &gt;&gt; Well, I I actually don't think the hardest questions in this field, maybe this is a controversial answer, but I'll I'll try it on for size here. Um I don't

think the hardest questions in this field are technical right now. I think they are questions of human uh issues and institutional um issues and I hear that no matter

where I am talking to clients and other large enterprises speaking to governments globally whether in New York, California, Brussels or Delhi here this week um where the hard problem

really isn't frontier advancement right now. It's actually making this technology useful to real organizations and um and making it helpful to real people in their everyday lives and um

core to that set of issues are the governance questions that have been so top of mind here at the summit I think um and uh questions of how we scale responsibly, how we engender trust in

the technology because in order to um in order for AI to be useful, it has to be applied and in order for it to be applied and widely adopted, it needs to be trusted. And so, um, there's, you

know, these are, I think, are cornerstones of what what we need to be thinking about when we're actually thinking about the frontier of AI in many ways.

&gt;&gt; John, you run one of the largest philanthropic organizations in the world. Um, if there are students there, you should corner John afterwards for all sorts of things. If there are

professors in the audience, but you've also got a very strong legal background. So same question to Terra is when you think of diffusion when you think of impact use cases and you think of what

Paula said which is we have to be adaptive about the regulatory architecture where are you at Rudy thank you and first let me please on behalf of MacArthur Foundation congratulate our

hosts in India what a wonderful global stage to be on to be having this important conversation the point of view that I come from as a law professor and as leader of a philanthropy MacArthur

Foundation is of course that we need to make the technology the AI I work for humans and to put humans at the center and I've been delighted on this main stage and throughout the summit to hear

that as the focus here in India and of course around the world and I think the way to do that is not to treat the AI as something magical and separate but rather connected to all of the things

that we're trying to accomplish. So whether it's lifting people out of poverty or improving health care or a bank providing capital as needed, we need a stable regulatory regime that

makes that possible and puts humans at the center rather than just seeking to advance the technology at all costs and then treating it as something magical and other than forms of mathematics,

forms of science that we have been able through human history to regulate so that it serves humans, not for its own sake. From your perspective in terms of

philanthropy, but also from the perspective perhaps of peers that you talk to, is the current moment on with the verve for adoption, the verb for getting this out to people changing the

way you're thinking about grantees, partners, and the philosophical way in which you're thinking about releasing money. &gt;&gt; Yes and no. You know, I think there are

some constants in philanthropy that are very important and maybe more important than ever in this moment. you think about the amount of capital that is flowing towards AI and its development

mostly of course by the private sector um sometimes by sovereign wealth funds and so forth. What we need to ensure is that civil society has a voice. And of course, again, I credit our hosts for

including civil society uh in this conversation and continuing to do that from Bletchley to today and and onward. And the civil society world doesn't come for free. Somebody has to pay for it,

right? And philanthropy has been historically the source of funding that. And I'm very impressed by the Indian philanthropic environment that is developing. Um we're excited to

partnership with the center for exponential change and others who are developing uh homegrown both philanthropy as well as ideas that are coming from India to the rest of the

world. But if we don't invest in civil society, there will be many many fewer voices able to bring the kind of um sensibility that we're talking about to the world. It doesn't come um without

actually thinking about it carefully. So no, we are thinking that long-term capital that is for academia that is for organizations and I think about the of course the observer research foundation

um which you're involved in um partnership for AI for which Tara was the founding um ed these organizations along with academia who have to be funded in a stable long-term way by

philanthropy. Um, we've been able with colleagues to raise half a billion dollars for humanity AI, an effort in the US. Um, close to that amount for current AI led by Martin Tis and AI

collaborative for um, uh, global efforts. So, we're over a billion dollars in commitments between these two efforts, but we have to be at that scale because otherwise we will not have the

voice of civil society, the voice of many people in these AI governance debates. That's so crucial. &gt;&gt; Minister, let me ask you a question on you talked about the benefits of AI in

Rwanda. Um, can you open that box up for us a little bit? You know, one of the arguments has been is that and there are a lot of arguments about how is this stuff going to pay for itself? Use case

and diffusion is all great, but is there an opex model or a revenue model for beneficial deployment? It needs to be sustainable over a period of time. And there's another argument which says when

people actually start using things that are useful and they see value in it, the rest will follow. What are your citizens in Rwanda feeling in terms of value? &gt;&gt; So I I'll I'll defer a little bit

because I think value cannot just be seen in monetary terms and how are we going to have the return on investment? How do we just sustain this financially? It's a good metric to to use for sure.

But I think the way we are looking and when I look at the uh you know the the use cases that we've already identified one it speaks to our government's decision

to make sure that we're delivering better services to our citizens. So whether it's healthare, whether it's making sure that we're giving quality education um to to our students in

Rhonda, whether it's making sure that majority of our population which is made up of farmers have access to the right data and extension services that then ensure that they have a growth in

productivity um which will translate essentially also in you know them being able to have more income and you know getting out of poverty and building wealth wealth for their families. But a

starting point for us has always been what problem are we trying to solve and is AI the best way to solve for this or is it a combination of AI and many other technologies that can solve for that.

We're a country that has been on a journey of digit of digital transformation for more than 20 years and so we've already started to see the benefit of that. So when I look at the

education use cases, we are ranging from being able to facilitate teachers with you know uh assessments uh tools that can help with faster and better assessment. We're looking at um AI

solutions that support with better lesson planning. And so if you're able to have better lesson planning, you're able to deliver quality education and make sure that it's similar across the

country, then I think there those are benefits that one can easily quantify. For the health sector, we're looking at um our frontline health workers, the community health workers, delivering

primary health care, giving them decision support tools that enable them uh to have better diagnosis and at the same time to reduce the backlog of the in the referral healthcare referral

system. Uh essentially that's also going to translate into uh less wastage into better care but also even bringing down the cost of care per person if if you look at it that way. Um so for our

people they're very optimistic obviously like any other country everyone has to wonder okay there's lots of data that we're going to be using some of it a lot of it is going to be personal data uh

what guardrails are we putting in place we have the data protection and privacy law that I talked about earlier um but the most important thing even for our people that they need is how are we

building capacity in country so that a lot of these things are not solutions we acquiring from elsewhere but we also we have you know more than 70% of our population that are in the youth

bracket. It means these are already people that are very excited about technology that if you train them the right way, they'll also be part of building these solutions. And so I think

there's a lot of optimism on what it can do. It doesn't mean we're shying away from what the risks are. We think that's why we're doing everything by design, use case by use case, trying to

understand for each use case that we are deploying, what could be the risks that could be unique to that particular uh application and how are we addressing it.

&gt;&gt; No, I think that's fantastic. I think the way you're thinking about disagregated risk rather than just one big banner sticker on top is perhaps the way we all need to go in as we think

about how is this use case risky but how is it actually useful and adds value in different ways. Um so that's fantastic. Um keeping an eye on the clock. Um Terra I just want to talk a little bit about

deployment and scale. Um we all love diffusion. We want this stuff out to everybody. How do we get it right when it comes to deployment and scale? Because none of

this is going to be easy. It's going to require some kind of a sustainable financial model. It's going to require a lot of work across the board and across borders. So just give us a so someone

who works on scale and deployment. Give give us a viewpoint. &gt;&gt; Sure. And maybe just a few words on census scale in our context here at JP Morgan Chase. We operate in over a 100

countries globally. um we spend close to 20 billion US dollars a year on technology and um and we are investing really really deeply in AI. So um you know I think to answer your question one

of the paradigms from which we come to this issue is certainly from the risk the unique risk management capabilities of finance and regulated banks specifically we've been using AI

technologies um at the use case level for over 10 years you know starting first with more traditional analytic techniques moving into the era of machine learning models

now introducing large language models looking in in the direction of agentic capabilities and beyond. And um and I think underscoring one of the points that John raised earlier which I think

is important here you know the the sort of riskmanagement posture and considering what effective governance and controls looks like in order to scale in the way that you're describing

um is something we have built muscles to do before. we we know how to do this pretty well and one of the um superpowers I think that we have is a sector specific lens on regulation and

oversight. I think that also speaks to some of the great points that the minister just made um with respect to really evaluating risk at the use case level. you know, make this conversation

about risk management grounded and practical in ways that address the real ways in which AI is getting deployed at the level of individual use cases and um and then making rules of the road that

are applicable to that specific context. I think that's really crucial. Um the other the other kind of piece of the equation is and and this speaks to the point I made at the top about our global

operating model. We really need regulatory harmonization to the extent possible in order to allow for consistency of rules across borders. And I think that you know there's there's

been a lot of um really really rich conversation this week at the summit about sovereign AI um you know as a part of the global governance conversation. I think that that has its own um unique

and important goals and I think it needs to be held in the same um you know sort of space as a realization that we also need to be um considering what a global baseline looks like what clarity um

enables for global operators so that they can really get responsibility at scale right. I'm going to ask you one question before I come back. Um,

what would you like to see going ahead from this summit? The baton's been handed to Switzerland and from Switzerland there's possibly another likely candidate, but what would you

like this summit process to do in an institutional setting perhaps to keep these conversations going? &gt;&gt; Well, I I think that John's earlier point about the need for

multistakeholder diversity is really key. I think that you know looking across sectors government civil society and industry is deeply important and making sure all those voices are at the

table is critical. I think a sub point there um from my perspective is that I would like to see more deployers sitting in seats like this one. Um you know we are one of the largest financial

institutions in the world and we use AI in really really deep ways as I mentioned before but I want to see folks from retail energy. I want to see people from manufacturing. I want to see folks

um who really represent the real economy um you know sitting on stages like this one next year in Switzerland and speaking to how we deliver real value in the hands of customers and citizens

every day using these technologies. &gt;&gt; And John, very quickly to you, I'm going to ask you a cheeky question. Um the kind of philanthropy I think that we require now in AI is for MacArthur to be

working with a frontier lab that's working with a local lab that's deploying. Is that in your imagination? Sure and Rudy, thank you. It's and I think it's an exciting idea of going

from here to Switzerland and imagining what could come next. And I think what could come next for philanthropy is absolutely an important piece of the story. And I think if you think about

the way in which technology works, it often begets innovation in other sectors. So I think what's exciting is that the technology itself can inform the way we practice philanthropy in the

ways you suggest, but it also can figure out how to regulate better. And it turns out of course regulation is not just against innovation. In fact, regulation sometimes prompts further innovation and

then uh this wonderful cycle can continue. So I my sort of key point on this would be to say let's not have a false binary. Either you regulate or you innovate. Let's figure out the way that

the regulation and the governance drives innovation. And I think that's an exciting idea not just for governments as the minister said or for banks. It's true for philanthropy too which can

improve uh its work a little bit along the way too. &gt;&gt; No bang on and minister last word to you. We would love to see the summit hosted in Kgali. From your vantage point

and a lot of this is about south cooperation. A lot of it has been about global cooperation. What would you like to see between now and Switzerland? What can we all actively do to make this more

palpable by the time we get to Zurich or Geneva or Davos or wherever it is? &gt;&gt; I think it's great that since we started with the Bley Park combinings, we were looking at safety, governance and now

it's about impact execution implementation. It would be great that we start to um you know quantify what that impact has looked like um and also to you know create a way where these

exchanges are truly happening and I couldn't agree more if we have more of the people that are building and deploying some of these solutions here if we could have some of the communities

that have either benefited positively or negative here so we can have their voices so as we go ahead with how uh large scale adoption of this technology is going to happen across the world.

We're taking into consideration uh these conversations. And I think the last one for me is to make sure we have more voices coming from the African continent and elsewhere so that we can sort of

balance between where are we seeing the biggest impact. Is it in emerging economies? Is it in the middle economies or the big ones? And what could be the nuances um as we as we continue to

deploy massively? &gt;&gt; And I think to do that we need to take this to the African continent sooner rather than later. &gt;&gt; And we're happy to host you.

&gt;&gt; There you are. Um, good offer there. Um, Minister John Terara, thank you so much. Thank you for being with us at the impact summit. And back to the organizers. Thank you.

&gt;&gt; I thank our esteemed panelists for that uh very engaging discussion and I thank Rud also for moderating this panel discussion. Ladies and gentlemen, now I move on to our next keynote speaker.

Well, it's my great pleasure to invite our next keynote speaker who is Miss Anne Bouvro, special envoy for artificial intelligence, France,

diplomat, a technologist and former director general of the GSMA which is global system for mobile communication association. Miss Bouvo sits at the heart of France's

efforts to lead on AI governance and international cooperation. She's been instrumental in advancing the global conversation on responsible AI regulation by bridging innovation policy

and multilateral diplomacy at the highest levels. So we are about to set the stage before I invite Miss Bro here. But indeed this is one platform the AI impact summit where we do get the

opportunity to listen to all these esteemed speakers as they put forth their points their remarks and their valuable insights which is based on years of experience. Ladies and

gentlemen, at the time we we are all concerned about AI regulations and we are all concerned about ethical and responsible AI. It would be a pleasure to listen to

our next keynote speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, with a round of applause, please welcome Miss Anne Bouvro. Special envoy for artificial intelligence, France.

Namaste. Bonjour. Excellencies, distinguished guests, dear friends. Thank you so much for welcoming me here today at the AI impact summit. I had the

privilege to lead the organization of the Paris summit about exactly one year ago. It is in Paris that India announced to the world its desire, its ambition, its resolve to organize the AI impact

summit that is taking place now. Holding an AI summit is a in a country from the global south is very important from a symbolic perspective but it is even more important from a strategic

perspective. It sends a very powerful message to the world. AI is not a privilege of a few nations not the preserve of a few companies. It is a global transformation

and it must be shaped by all. India is in my view the perfect country to host this summit. I don't need to remind you about the scale of this market, the richness of the ecosystem,

the strength of the technological expertise here, your incredible entrepreneurial dynamism. India has over the years positioned itself to be at the forefront of both AI

development and adoption. Just to quote a source, the Stanford AI index ranks India third globally in AI market competitiveness. This is not by chance. Yes,

France and India have a longstanding partnership and I believe share a common understanding of what is at stake. This year is the year of Franco Indian or India French innovation.

Um and last year in Paris the geopolitics of AI started to be very visible. remember one year ago the announcement of Stargate, the US saying that they were investing in AI um to

really dominate the world and and remember Deep Seek, China saying that they're also in the race with a different way. Um AI is at the center of a fierce geopolitical and economical

competition, but this also created a momentum for stronger collaboration between countries such as France, India, Brazil, Japan, Germany, Canada and many

others. coalitions of the willing of the countries that have key talent in AI who share a vision that it must be inclusive and sustainable and a legitimate

aspiration for more sovereignty. I believe this is a very key geopolitical moment. In Paris, we spoke about action. This year in Delhi, we speak about impact.

We're going from the AI action summit to the AI impact summit. Impact in education, in public health, impact that improves lives, not just in theory but but in practice. And there

are a number of areas in which our strong partnership between France and India is very relevant and strategic. I'd like to start with public health. During my previous visit to India back

in November, I was deeply uh impressed by some AI applications and in particular by an AI application that I saw at AS at the AllIndia Institute for Medical Science. uh an application which

uh if you just cuff into a smartphone, AI analyzes the sound and can be an early detector of tuberculosis versus uh a more classical cold or or other viral uh illness. Um this is a very important,

very practical, very tangible application of AI for public health. Second, data sharing and data governance. The ongoing work between ice here in

India, the uh health data hub in France and other partners and the recent that was signed will enable I think as a first in the world for data transfer for health data transfer across borders uh

in a privacy preserving way. This is this will enable joint research uh and finding new cures for diseases. Third, research and academia. I chair the board of one of France's

leading academic institutions superior norm. So this is a subject that is very dear to my heart. This week there was a full program of scientific exchanges. We called it rush

uh because there's a rush to cooperate between uh our two countries. Um this was um uh a series of exceptional thoughts talks by uh researchers and heads of in institutions and the next

edition of that will be held in France. Fourth, I want to talk about AI for the common good. Uh and I was very pleased to hear John Pafrey from the McCarter Foundation talk about current AI.

Current AI is a foundation that with the help of his foundation but also uh at the onset of France, India and other countries and with other um uh partners we launched in Paris. This is a

foundation to help sustain AI development for the common good uh by helping to enable open data sets, open source tools, whatever will not be funded by VCs and and private um uh

funders. Um this year at this summit we are launching an open hardware tool to promote linguistic diversity and AI powered translation. This is a partnership between Bashini and Current

AI. With its 22 official languages and many more being spoken here in India, India perfectly embodies the challenges and the opportunities of cultural

representations in AI systems. This is faced by many countries around the world. Uh but this is a perfect place India to launch this initiative. And fifth and and not least, sustainable

In Paris, we launched a coalition for sustainable AI. AI requires huge amounts of energy and risks putting our uh climate goals uh and and our uh desire to preserve the

planet at risk. So we launched this coalition and this year we co-chair France co-chared uh with India the resiliency working group uh and um sustainability

uh is really something that needs to be taught at the beginning by design in AI systems. It cannot be an afterthought. We're launching today together with India and other partners a resilient AI

challenge uh that will help find solutions in this very important area. And finally, we must speak about safety, especially for children.

This is a priority for President M. If you heard him uh speak yesterday, this is a priority for him because this is a priority for citizens in France. I believe this is a priority for parents

and citizens around the world. AI can enable a number of great things in public health, in other areas, but it must not become a tool that endangers children.

We must demand and strengthen age verification mechanisms. We must fight against cyber bullying. Innovation and protection can and must go hand in hand.

Excellencies, dear friends, AI is not only a technological transformation. It is a societal, cultural and political The question is not whether AI will change our societies. It is already

redefining work. It will transform public health. The real question is will we shape AI or will we tell our children that we didn't even try?

France stands ready to work with India and with all willing partners to build an AI ecosystem that is inclusive, sustainable, sovereign and rooted in the common good.

The future of AI must not be written for the world. It must be written with the world. I thank you very much. Thank you so much Miss N Burro for those

very valuable ideas and remarks and especially drawing attention to some very pertinent questions about sustainable AI and responsible AI and as she rightly said that AI is not just a

technological transformation ladies and gentlemen it is also the societal the political and the cultural transformation and now we come to our next keynote

speaker and many many people here are actually waiting only for him. OMG, I don't think Are you ready to listen to the founder of Serb?

All right, ladies and gentlemen. So I move on to our next keynote speaker who is Mr. Vive Raguan, the co-founder of Serbam, a company building AI that speaks India's languages and understands

India's context in a world dominated by models trained on English language data. Their work is a powerful demonstration that sovereign AI capability is not just a luxury, it is a necessity. So ladies

and gentlemen, please welcome Mr. Vive Raguan, co-founder of Serva. I come here to say that India can and I think that's the message I want to send India can

and India can train state-of-the-art models bring AI to a billion Indians and do it all and that's really the message of why we started serv

I want to talk about the long arc. You know when you look at uh well, you know, today you the world is moving so fast. Everybody talks about where is the largest model or who has the fastest

chip. These are all transitory technical advantages. In the long run, it's sovereignty that matters. And unless we build these things ourselves uh it's something that you know we'll be

left behind in the race. In the past 15 years of my life I worked on building Aadhaar which is India's digital identity program. Prior to that, many of these technologies,

yeah, many of these technologies were propriety technologies and we buil built this kind of self-created technology that is open-source and a public infrastructure that is available

to all of us and that led to the creation of the India stack. So when you look at it over the course of long periods of time, sovereignity will always trump technical leads that are

short-term. We have a mandate to build. It is not an option whether we want to build in these technologies. AI is a technology that has impact on every single aspect of

human life and it's a core technology that a country like India must understand from the foundational level. We otherwise we will become a digital colony which is dependent on other

countries for this core core technology. That's something that is it's it's not an option. It is something that we must do and we have unique advantages and our

unique advantage is actually our diversity. We have so many languages. We have 22 official languages and in fact you know pe the way people speak in our country changes every 50 kilometers and

that diversity must be captured if we have to understand the voice of the people and therefore if we build AI from India it must acknowledge that diversity and do this. The other thing of course

is we are a huge economy. There is demand and if AI is there to help the citizens to do everything this is we can be one of the largest consumers of AI in the world and that demand is there and

then we have to build we know that we are a costconscious country right everything needs to be at the lowest cost so we need to build efficient AI that actually can be delivered at scale

for the people so that the last person in the country can actually have a better experience right today if you look at UPI one of the great success stories of the past decade and if you

look it is for the first time we feel that in India things can be better than everywhere else in the world but AI done the right way can make sure that every service to citizens actually is the best

and the cheapest and actually done in the best possible way for the country and that's the promise of AI and that's why we said we need to do this in India and I think it's not about I mean we we

we have companies which have you know you know globally when you look at AI companies they are massive companies but in the end we have to show a new model where we can actually build AI which

helps everyone and then we can win for the people and our model can be adopted in the world and that is my belief of where we need to go on this thing. So, Saram has been building India's full

stack sovereign AI platform and we de we work with developers fundamentally India is is is a country of developers. We have more developers than and we work with enterprises and we work with

governments and I think that's and we have a full stack platform which I'll talk about. In fact, the full stack platform consists of three different things. One

is models. We need models that are built in India and that is the key thing and that's what we'll focus on sovereignity and models. And then we are focusing on applications. applications is AI for

everyday tasks for making things better for people and finally we'll talk about infrastructure and infrastructure at India scale. The first thing I want to talk about are

sovereign models. The rule number one is they are built from scratch. They are not dependent on any other model that is there in the world. They are built from scratch. There is no data dependency on

anyone else but at the same time the focus is these are worldclass state-of-the-art models that we have. So I'm going to talk a little bit about some of our models. The first model is

actually the SARS model which is actually the speech model which helps recognize speech in in Indian languages is natively multilingual. It's supporting all the 22 languages. It

actually supports realtime streaming and complex speaker diorizations. In fact, if you see this is actually best in class in Indian languages compared to any other global model in

terms that's that's something to say that in the co these are extremely small models but these are models which have been trained with significant amounts of Indian diverse data which will actually

lead to better performance uh on on on indices. So let me just take a play a a a an iconic moment in India uh diorized using our model. Oh sorry

okay I don't think I can make this happen. Okay. Is audio is not playing. Let's maybe we'll come back to this. And

&gt;&gt; here we have a majestic liftoff of LBM3 M4 rocket carrying India's prestigious Chandrean 3 spacecraft M4 rocket. You have been skyrocket.

So then of course we move on from speech recognition to actually speech synthesis. We want to create models that are we want to create models which are naturally expressive Indian voices and

they have low latency streaming and actually production grade quality. So in fact our models uh our speechtoext models are considered in blind tests are actually the most preferred voices in

Indian languages and this is something compared to all the global competitors such as lean labs and and cartisia etc and we have actually the most preferred texttospech model in the country.

We'll also talk we also have a dubbing capability which actually uh preserves the speaker modality and has precise control over duration and supports mixed language things. So I will show you in

fact in this model as well we see compared to any other model in the world uh we are the most preferred as far as as far as dubbing is concerned. I'll show a small snippet of what happens

here. 10. We have the remaining 13 bits in which the 12th bit is called the small a bit. Then the remaining six bits are compute bits. These three are the

destination bit and these are the jumps. Destination. Moving on. So we've also built these vision models and these vision models are actually

very good for un they're actually for document digitization. They're very good at language layout understanding visual grounding and in fact finding intelligence by visual components and

finally uh reading uh reading order predictions. In fact, the vision model that we built is only a three billion parameter st space model which beats all other models in the world not just in

Indian languages but in English as well. So therefore it shows and many of these models are many orders of magnitude bigger than our models and still we are able to get worldclass performance from

them. Of course in Indian languages we are far and away ahead of the models that are there uh that are there from the global

competitors. Now we come talk about some of the LLMs. We have actually we India has started the the training of LMS from scratch and this was done through a grant from the

India AI mission that actually without which it would not have been possible for us to train uh these kinds of models through a GPU grant. In fact, it is a it is a context it is it's a model which is

of extremely small model which can run on a single GPU and it is run it has a 32k context length and is trained on 16 trillion tokens and it's extremely efficient uh thinking which actually

gives better answers with lower and and the focus of this model is actually real time conversational applications that people will be able to it will be able to generate conversations in all the

Indian languages in in a real-time system and some of the benchmarks show compared to models global models of similar size such as Quen 30B or GPOSS

it is far superior in the ability in terms of various parameters such as fluency language and script and uh usefulness and conciseness so that the important thing is that this is able to

at the size it is again a global best and then we'll come finally to our largest model which is the 105 billion parameter model this is the largest LLM that has trained in from scratch in the

country and it is basically better on par with most open-source and closed source models of its class and it can handle various kinds of complex reasoning learning tasks as well as web

searching and things like so it's actually a fairly complex uh fairly advanced model which again works in all Indian languages. uh from a benchmark perspective these

models again compared to things like GBTOS OSS 120 billion as well as Gemini flash is actually superior in in terms of the kinds of outputs it can generate uh it can generate. So therefore this is

really an example while this is quite a small model uh it is really uh just to give you an idea last year uh we had deepseek R1 which was which was actually was launched and that was 670 billion

parameters the numbers that that we are getting are actually superior to what DeepS R1 had last year of course the state-of-the-art has also improved but the goal is we can show that India can

build these things and I want this the most important thing that I want people to understand is just because and I think that the you know I would love that not just us but many other people

come and show that we can actually build world-class models from India because that is the fact and these models was built with a team of just 15 young people and really it's the game of the

youth of India that have actually made this model uh what it is. I'm just the sport and the these these young kids have actually made something like this happen and if these kids can do it we

have so much talent in the country and I think that's I'm very positive about given the right kind of uh uh support in the way that we have been given that much bigger things can happen

moving beyond our be beyond our models we actually want these models to become useful and so therefore we build applications And I'll talk very briefly about the

kinds of applications that we build uh with with so in fact we have a an an ability to actually converse uh and and this is our real time voice conversation that happens. We do more than a million

minutes of voice conversation in 11 Indian languages every day using serum. So these models are actually being used to build things. So these models which have been trained fully in our control

are actually now being used for conversations uh in across enterprises and that's and across enterprises and government use cases. In fact in the last month we did we actually took about

uh you know 20 uh you know NOS's actually spent did a core minutes of calling within a month and to really understand and what people actually are saying at

the ground we actually have ways by which we can make this available for work tasks and enterprise task and we also have the ability to do this for content which is

digitizing books translating books, dubbing videos. These are all studio products that we have. You know, I think finally I want to end with with infrastructure. Uh we actually

are doing many interesting things. We are making our models smaller to work on the edge, to work on phones. We are making we're actually many of you may have heard that we have also launched

some of these glasses so that we are able to have these models run on different form factors and capture the intelligence capture the voice of India at every point in there and finally for

these things to work you need to have compute at a large scale and to be ability to actually very efficiently deliver all these models to India at India scale at India costs.

Finally, we are of course trusted by many leading enterprises and we also work uh with many government uh government agencies and I think the story of Saram is just beginning and I

think it comes back to India can thank you so much. Thank you so much Mr. Raan for all your views explaining to us what is all about models.

Ladies and gentlemen, moving on. Our next speaker is from one of Silicon Valley's most influential venture capital firms, General Catalyst. And he has been among the most vocal advocates

for what he calls responsible innovation. The idea that companies building the future also bear the greatest responsibility for its consequences. And well, I must say that

his perspective bridges the worlds of capital and conscience. Please welcome the CEO of General Catalyst, Mr. Hand tan. &gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

&gt;&gt; Let me just start by thanking uh Shri Prime Minister Modi Gi for getting all the AI thought leaders together uh in this world and delivering the message around making sure we shape AI for human

centricity for human empowerment. I think that's a really important design principle and stepping up and embracing that and enforcing that as a world leader uh is exactly what we need today

as we work on uh embedding AI into our society. So the biggest opportunity in capitalism today is what I call global resilience. If you think about the last five, seven

years, we have gone through so much uh uh on the planet. We've had a pandemic. We've had wars. We've been learning how to embrace artificial intelligence as a enormous technological shift. Many many

interesting shocks that have happened to us over the last several years. And the answer to um embracing uh uh sort of resiliency and delivering um uh transformation is actually

artificial intelligence. That is the answer for actually driving what I call national resilience in all the key industries whether it's healthcare whether it's deterrence and defense

whether it's scaling of the energy infrastructure so we can deploy AI all those capabilities uh uh they present enormous opportunity and artificial intelligence is the answer for all of

them it's India's time to lead uh when it comes to delivering national resilience it's the strongest growth market in the And as we have learned over the last few

years when when you think about diffusion of AI uh growth uh is an enormous uh lever for it because it creates opportunity to embrace new technologies and new solutions. The

other thing that's really um interesting is because AI is deflationary by nature, it matches well to what's required to uplift the opportunities here in India. solving for uh needs in healthcare and

education uh and other parts of what we deliver uh to society at large uh with the complexity of over a billion people that is if we can go solve that you're going

to go solve the problems for the entire planet so I do think India's got all the dynamics going for it uh to lead in in in using AI to transform different industries

um the other thing I would say is the Hey in I expect India to uh leapro uh deliver this transformations by leaprogging. If you go back to the digital infrastructure revolution in

India and what we saw with uh UPI and Ahar the opportunity to completely rethink what the paradigms are going to be in these other industries is what lies ahead.

Um India it has a lot of things going for it when it comes to resiliency and being able to deploy AI. Uh first of all um you've got um increasing investment in

infrastructure. We saw that over the last couple days. There's a lot of infrastructure investment. There is work being done around open source. I think the US India corridor is is incredibly

interesting. The pack silica announcement today was an important one. We need to make sure the innovation flows fluidly between US, India, Europe across all parts of the western world so

that AI can thrive in the democratic world. That is uh where we want to see this technology uh come to scale and u and it's got a young demographic. It's got a lot of potential in terms of being

able to deploy a lot of these capabilities. One topic that is very much top of mind for me is there's this narrative that artificial intelligence can take the

jobs of young people and we need to slow down progress. And my biggest u um advice on India's leadership in AI is to reject that narrative and lean into it. I think everybody entering the workforce

and there's a million uh Indians that enter the workforce every month. Everybody that enters the workforce should be fully empowered with AI because if you have that kind of

productivity be behind every single human being entering the workforce, imagine the productivity we create in every company in every industry and how it's going to unleash the opportunity in

Um the the way India is going to lead in artificial intelligence from my perspective is through entrepreneurship. Ultimately startups are the most important institutions of the future.

We're rebuilding every core pillar uh of society uh with new businesses and India has got an enormous talent pool. So many of you u came in uh for the AI summit and we are actively building companies

here with many of the entrepreneurs. I think just watching businesses like Septto and Rafi and uh policy bazaar health and others that are transforming these industries we have great

confidence that the Indian entrepreneurs are going to build the next generation companies that don't not only drive abundance and resilience here in India but are going to be positioned to be the

global uh leaders uh in different markets. So to that end, one of the announcements that I made uh in our round table with uh Prime Minister Modi yesterday was that we're increasing our

investment. Uh we're going to be investing $5 billion over the next five years in the Indian entrepreneurial ecosystem. It's the largest of its kind. And thank you.

And it comes from a deep belief that Indian entrepreneurs are going to create some of the most interesting companies uh of the next generation. So come build with us. Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Thank you so much Mr. Himementa for your valuable remarks. Ladies and gentlemen, now we move to a conversation about how artificial intelligence needs to be positioned in the global context. And we

have very elite panelists for this session. Miss Cristina Georgiva, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund from macroeconomic stability to digital transformation.

She's been a leading voice on how AI will reshape the global economic order and what policy makers must do to ensure that its benefits are widely shared. Miss Joanna Hill, the deputy director

general of the World Trade Organization, bringing the trade perspective to a technology that is redrawing the boundaries of comparative advantage. Miss Josephine Tio, the Minister of

Digital Development and Information for Singapore, a nation that has become a global benchmark for how governments can integrate AI into public services. And this conversation will be moderated by

Mr. Mariano Florentino, president of the Carenegi Endowment for International Peace. So we have a very elite set of panelists who are going to join us on this panel discussion which

is titled AI needs to be positioned in the global context. May I please invite our panelists to please join us on stage. &gt;&gt; So over to you Mr. Clear.

&gt;&gt; Thank you very much and good afternoon everybody. How are we doing AI summits? Let me try that again. Hello Delhi. Thank you. Much better. It is not every day that we have the pleasure of having

such a distinguished panel of international leaders. And I want to start by making three observations only as special observations for those of you who have chosen to be with us this

afternoon. You could be anywhere in this complex, anywhere in this city and you're right here with us. The first is about the role of technology and science and global ties in making the world

better. For those of you who are younger than me, which is most of you in the audience, you will live longer than my generation because of global ties, commerce, science and technology. In

1950 when India was a young nation, global life expectancy was 47 years. Now it's closer to 73 years. But at the same time, the second point is that the world that we are navigating today is

fragmented. That set of global ties, diffusing science and technology, advancing global understanding and cooperation is a lot harder now than it was even five or 10 years ago. And

everybody who's been on this stage has been alluding to that in some way, that reality. The third point is that the use and development of AI will have an effect on those ties and on that

prosperity and our likelihood. But there are divergences, different paths around AI. Some countries are using it more, some less. Some countries play a certain very developed role in the tech stack

and others less. To talk about these issues, I cannot imagine a better panel. It's not every day, as I said, that we have the managing director of the IMF, the deputy director general of the World

Trade Organization, and the minister um for information and digital development from Singapore. So, I'm going to start with a question for managing director Gorgieva. And the question is all this

discussion about artificial intelligence at the frontier, what do you see as the greatest possibilities and the greatest risks? &gt;&gt; Uh thank you very much. Uh namaste.

&gt;&gt; Namaste. Uh AI is an incredibly transformative we know. And the question is what does it do for the world economy? Uh we did some

research and here is the answer. Based on what we know, AI can lift up global growth by almost a percentage point, what we say 0.8%. What does that mean? It would mean that

the world would grow faster than it did before the COVID pandemic. And that is fantastic for creating more opportunities, more jobs. This is the magnitude that we see for India and it

would mean that India's uh uh vixit barat is achievable. It also means that the world risks to be even further diverse.

The accordion of opportunities may open even more from countries that do well to those who fall behind. Actually what we see is the potential for countries that go fast on

digital infrastructure on skills on adoption of AI that they can do twice as well as those that don't. So what is our uh main reason to be here at the uh uh AI summit in Delhi to embrace India's

proposition of democratizing AI making sure that experience in India can then be passed to other countries especially countries in the developing world to make diffusion to make adoption of AI by

the main priority and do it with focus on people on improving the opportunities the livelihoods of people. I am very optimistic about AI. I am also not naive. It brings significant risks.

First, it brings the risk of uh making countries and the world less fair. Some have it and others don't. Second, it brings the risk of displacement of jobs with no good

thinking about how to help people find their place in the new AI economy. We calculated this risk as very high. We actually see the impact of AI on the

labor market like a tsunami hitting it. Globally 40% of jobs will be affected by AI. Some enhanced others eliminated. in uh emerging markets 40% but in advanced economies 60%. And that is

happening over a relatively short period of time. And the third risk we at the IMF worry a lot about is financial stability risk. Could AI get loose and create havoc on financial markets? But

on balance, my appeal to all of us is embrace the opportunities, be mindful of the risks and manage them well. And above all, make sure that as the the the uh the uh spirit here is

that AI is for the well-being of everybody everywhere. &gt;&gt; Thank you. And what what we're going to do, we're going to come right back to these questions in a minute, but I want

to bring in uh the deputy director general of the World Trade Organization into the conversation. I want to ask you picking up exactly where managing director Gorgieva was going, the

interest in democratizing the technology, having more countries be closer to the frontier. For more than a generation, as you know, we have been having arguments about trade globally

and about whether trade helps reduce the gap in well-being between countries or actually pulls them apart even more. And given all that experience, I wonder what role you think the international trading

system has in dealing with potential inequities and access to AI and the development of AI. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much for the invitation to be here. Uh definitely we see that trade

can help the diffusion of AI uh to those that most need it and we also think that AI can help trade and can help lower income and middle inome economies really progress through trade. Now we do see

that AI is really shifting what we think of as comparative advantage uh to those economies that are more strong in capital data uh and in computing power and therefore the countries that are

more labor intensive feel more at risk. At the same time we also see important opportunities for these same countries. Uh, of course with all the caveats that we've been speaking about the importance

of investing in skills uh and and regulations and in infrastructure digital infrastructure incredibly important. Our research suggests that by the year 2040 trade growth could be

almost uh growing by 40%. So that we see really important opportunities and for the middle and lower income economies and trade is already working well in that way. uh our trade agreements, the

world trading system is set up so that goods trade and services trade can develop with AI. But there are some areas where they're still too new and still too nuanced and we still have to

wait and see how that will develop and how the system has to accommodate. &gt;&gt; Minister Teo, as that system evolves and we deal with this emerging, not not even emerging anymore, emerged technology,

uh we talk about how much it's going to affect countries large and small. you are playing a critical role and I know you're playing a critical role because I see you at every single AI summit in the

world. It's amazing. Um but how are countries like Singapore in a position to navigate this tsunami these changes and what um in particular what do you think we can learn from Singapore's

strategy as I see it of being at the forefront here on AI governance the model AI governance plan for example but also navigating a world that some people see as bulcanized between China and the

United States around the technology stack. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much Tino. has a lot of um questions packed into one. I'll do my best to address them. Um I think

embedded in what you're saying is that um there is the risk of technology decoupling and what what does uh small state do in in this kind of context and how do we navigate uh the big power

contestation? Uh the way we think about it is that um for Singapore it's very important for us to maintain this ability to operate as a trusted node. Trusted node means that

well we can trust you with our technology. So your companies your uh people can continue to access these uh whatever is the most sophisticated because they will not be abused and um

the risk of them being misused is also minimized. Uh the question however is um how do we remain trusted and I think the only way to do so is if we act in a consistent and principled way and being

consistent and principle is uh not a matter of size. It it uh and and Singapore is not the only small state that has a good track record of holding this discipline.

uh we are consistent in being pro Singapore and sometimes our choices may align with this country or that country. Sometimes they will align with many countries. Sometimes they only align

with a few countries but they always align with our own interests. In technology choice for example uh 5G uh we are always operating on the basis of principles. Number one, that these are

commercial decisions that have to be undertaken uh by the uh operators of um the the the mobile networks and they have to decide uh on the basis of you know what works for them in terms of

performance in terms of security in terms of resilience keeping in mind what are all the rules that are in place in our context. So those are the broad you know directions in which we operate in

and um and and it's not easy but um it's it's it's a path that has served us well &gt;&gt; and I note that among the many things that Singapore I think has contributed to the discussion of AI globally in

addition to being a trusted node and connecting different countries there's also the role Singapore and the region of Southeast Asia plays in all this because Southeast Asia is such a a

region of such such diversity and importance globally. And I want to come back in a minute to the question of how we might imagine Southeast Asia evolving as almost a laboratory for some of the

issues we're talking about. But first I want to go back to Cristina if I may and and ask you about it was clear in your earlier remarks that you see enormous possibilities for AI. But you also

acknowledge candidly something that maybe not every speaker has acknowledged which is along with that opportunity will probably come some disruption some real policy difficulties in some

countries that are experiencing rapid changes in the labor market. The question then is how we might develop the right strategy so that the productivity gains that the world can

experience would actually translate into shared prosperity. What do you think we can do on that score? So the the first thing we ought to do is to carefully observe what is actually happening and

then project what are the implications for policy makers. At the funded, we did a very interesting piece of research in the United States assessing how much AI is affecting already the uh labor

market. And we found out that one in 10 jobs already requires additional skills. And for those who have these skills, the job pays better. Now with money in their pocket, people then go and buy more

local services. They go to restaurants, to entertainment. That creates demand for lowkilled jobs. And to our surprise, the total impact on employment in the aggregate is positive. one job in with

AI, 1.3 jobs uh on in total employment. But what does that mean? It means that a smaller segment of people get higher opportunities.

A larger segment, yes, they can have jobs, but jobs that are on the lower end of the pay scale. And the most problematic is the fate of those squeezed in the middle. Their jobs don't

change. In relative terms, they pay less and some of the of these jobs disappear. What concerned us the most is that jobs that disappear tend to be entrylevel jobs. They are routine and they are

easily automated. So if if you are in in this place of the labor market that is easily automated of course that creates a risk for you. Now once obviously we we will continue to

work with countries to understand what is happening and then how do we project it for policies for the future. I would make three conclusions so far and of course we have to be agile in how we

look at AI. The first one is uh education has to be revamped for the for a new world. Uh people have to learn to learn not to learn specific skills so much. uh and there has to be second

there has to be support for those if if there are a big chunk in a particular local economy and this labor market is changing dramatically there has to be social protection social support so they

don't feel like what happened with the industrial workers in the United States when their jobs were exported overseas uh and three it is very important that we look at the overall enabling

environment why in some places AI makes it faster and in others it doesn't and what we find is not very surprising some parts of the economy some parts of so society are naturally better

positioned because they have digital infrastructure in place they are already in the digital world because there is more demand for uh entrepreneurship. Somebody spoke

about it and entrepreneurship is more uh dominant. uh and I think it is important for the world to be very attentive to what works what doesn't work and not sugarcoat not

sugarcoat the picture because if we do we would end up where we ended up with globalization people revoling against it despite all the benefits it brings because yes the world as a whole

benefited but some communities were devastated and the world did not pay attention attention to these communities in a timely uh manner. Uh so that is my my my conclusion so far and I know that

I am very mindful that we we are going to learn much more at the front. We are trying to see how how are countries positioned. Uh some countries actually have more demand for AI skills than

supply. Some countries have more supply of AI skills than demand and some have neither. So we have to work on multiple fronts and we have to work based on concrete assessment of conditions in

countries and localities in countries. I want to finish with a message to the Indian friends here in the audience. You're very fortunate that your country invested in public digital

infrastructure. So this condition for AI check you're very fortunate because your country is removing actively barriers to entrepreneurship

and on that count we say check and we are super fortunate to have youthful energetic innovative population that is embracing AI. So what do we say? Check. Uh so all the very best.

&gt;&gt; That's terrific. Um minister &gt;&gt; agree with the managing director more if I may be allowed to chime in. &gt;&gt; Yes, please. Uh I think sometimes there is a um um a desire uh a tendency to

want to think of uh ways of regulating AI um in order to slow down its um its its uh advance and perhaps you know to uh try and forstall the risk. Uh I'm not underestimating the need uh for example

in making sure that there are guardrails on AI safety. I just want to say that that those are important but to overexpect AI regulations to deliver on the other

uh important issues such as the potential for greater social inequality. I think this is is unrealistic. The way to deal about the the way to deal with it is to look at what other methods

there must be to strengthen social solidarity. For example, what provisions do we put in place to help people to move from one job to the next? What provisions do we put in place to ensure

that even people who don't earn a lot have the prospect of owning their own homes, access to good health care, educating their children to a very high level. I think these are the other

things and you cannot run away from those conversations just by expecting regulations to solve the problem. So what I'm hearing you both say in a way is that it would be a very silly thing

if we tried to solve health care problems &gt;&gt; just by regulating pharmaceuticals. That would be a very poor fit, right? At the same time, you recognize that, you know,

certain products that are sold, it's good for them to be safe. And in fact, safety, trust, security can make them even more easy to diffuse. But I think what what a very important takeaway from

both of you is that the entire spectrum of tools that a society has to build social cohesion are going to be important in the transition to a more AIdriven economy and we shouldn't ignore

them but we shouldn't put just the focus on what we can do by making models built in a certain way. And I I'd love for you to chime in because trade has come up already just

even in the last like 47 seconds of a bunch. &gt;&gt; Actually, yes. Uh we put out a report last year that looks at this issue exactly in that way. We look at the

opportunities that I talked about of AI in the future uh not only for uh the advanced countries but developing and you know lower income but we also look at the need for national policies for

that to actually happen and to help transition. And so we look at issues around competition policy, around labor force, uh around skills development, around education. And to do that the

world trading system cannot do it alone. Uh we need to partner at our level uh with international organizations and at the national level with the appropriate authorities and private sector in order

to have that holistic approach. I would say lesson learned uh from past experiences and we definitely want to apply those lessons to this new one. So we have about four minutes left and I

have a last question for you all. Imagine yourselves in the future looking back at the past maybe 15 years in the future and at that point you're being interviewed on the same stage here in

India and you're saying it's been a very good thing to see how well the world has handled its relationship with this emerging technology of AI and it's turned out very well because blank and I

want you to mention one thing that you think in particular would have been so critical to make that transition well. You've all mentioned a bunch of things, but I'm interested in the main most

important takeover that you'd like to leave the audience with. &gt;&gt; For me, that one word is trust. In 15 years, if we went and ask citizens in all the countries where AI is being

deployed widely, do you trust this technology? If their answer is no, then I believe that we must have failed in some way. If they believe that this technology has been implemented in a way

that didn't rob them of a livelihood, that didn't rob them of, you know, being totally misinformed about the world, didn't rob them of um um, you know, being able to carry out their lives in

in a safe and secure manner. It didn't destroy families. I think if they can still say that this is a technology that um can work reasonably well if you put in place the safeguards, I think we

would have come a long way. Deputy Director &gt;&gt; um an appreciation for what the world trading system can and is delivering. You know when I think about it last year

it turned 30 years uh that the WTO was born and down the road at CERN the worldwide web was being created by scientists that wanted to collaborate and that architecture which is

technology neutral allowed for those developments of the digital economy to come through. um and how much of that architecture can serve us for this new wave and then concentrate on those areas

that are still needing to be worked on um by collaboration, by cooperation and focus on those you know trading with uh trust, trading with safety um and then appreciating and using what we already

have uh to deliver. managing director. &gt;&gt; Well, um in 15 years uh if my uh life expectancy has grown by another 50 years, I would say great, we are

successful. Uh but on a serious note, I think to me the most important factor, it goes a bit in the trust area is the ethical foundation of AI. whether we would manage to put AI on the foundation

of force for good or we leave space for AI to be force for evil and that balance is not easy one when I look at progress so far we have done

much more on the technical side of AI and much less on building that strong ethical foundation and putting guard rails that are not restricting innovation but are protecting us from AI

for pet. &gt;&gt; I will make just &gt;&gt; I still want my 50 years extra life. One closing observation to just reinforce my appreciation to the three of you and the

work we do. In the in the weeks immediately after the release of CHACPT, which seems like 20 years ago, but it was not that long ago, there was talk about the need for an international

atomic energy agency for AI or a new international agency or treaty. We don't talk about that anymore. And I think in some ways it's an appropriate and mature recognition that we already have a set

of institutions and mechanisms in place to deal with a set of emerging challenges. I think it's also a recognition that many individual countries have to do their part to

create social cohesion and manage this exchange and this transformation effectively. But I would ask that this audience recognize that all three of our remarkable leaders here on the stage

also reflect another reality which is that even if sovereignty is important and even if individual countries have to have their own priorities. The challenge of how we best live with the technology

we have created is truly a global one. It's not an individual country one. And the conversation we're having today is an example of how we can learn from each other and find the right solutions.

Thank you and namaste. I extend sincere gratitude to all our esteemed panelists for their valuable insights and also thank you so much Mr. Quayar for steering this conversation so

seamlessly. Ladies and gentlemen, I must also thank Miss Georgiva for giving all those checks to India uh highlighting our strength so that we can also move forward and adopt and adapt to

artificial intelligence and this is an important part of the whole program and we're going to have this photo op that's the high point of every conversation

a moment of pride creating memories. Thank you so much. Thank you, Miss Georgie. Thank you, Miss Johanna Hill. And thank you, Miss Josephin Tio. Thank

you, Miss Quayard, for playing your part in contributing to this panel discussion. next keynote speaker is one of India's most pioneering entrepreneurs, Miss

Kiran Maz Mazum Shaw, who has built Bioon from a garage startup into one of the country's most successful biotechnology companies. Her perspective on how artificial intelligence is

transforming drug discovery, healthcare delivery and the life sciences is grounded in decades of building at the frontier of science and business. Ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands

together to welcome Miss Kiran Mazum Shaw, chairperson Bioon Group. Let's just go. Good afternoon and let me say how delighted I am to be a part of this

wonderful summit, the impact AI summit that India is launching and hosting for the first time which I think heralds uh a big signal that we are part of the AI journey that

the world is on. I've basically um taken off from where the last panel talked about sovereignity and I thought I should talk about why India must build biotech sovereignity

that is embedded in AI. And let me start with this first slide that basically says that if the 20th century was defined by the internet and the early

21st century by digital sovereignity which was all about data being the new oil and the new fuel. The coming decades I believe will be shaped by biotech sovereignity that is embedded in AI.

I believe that nations that command the convergence of biology and AI or what I like to call the convergence of biological intelligence and artificial intelligence

will define the future of health care, food security, education, biommanufacturing, sustainability, biocurity and much more for India.

This is not merely a cuttingedge It is a strategic and geopolitical imperative. Now let me really touch upon what I mean by biological intelligence.

Living systems are the original intelligent machines. And why do I say this? Because biological intelligence has evolved and has been built over 3.8 billion years,

it is different in the way it learns, memorizes, builds, and processes information from multimodal signals and circuits. Cells sense,

they compute and they respond through intricate signaling networks. They also then interface with gene regulation and genes regulatory circuits

and immune memory. These systems operate within inbuilt biological guard rails which focus on feedback loops and control mechanisms

that maintain what we refer to as homeostasis or health equilibrium. Disease arises when these guard rails fail. So when we talk about ethics, when

we talk about governance, living systems have an inbuilt sense of guard rails and governance which is about keeping you healthy which is about which is a wonderful way of making sure

that it compensate it repairs and makes sure that you can still live in a health as healthy a way as possible. And to illustrate this, let's look at the way our immune system responds to pathogens.

The immune system responds through imunological ammunition like cytoines, antibodies, and killer tea cells. It also memorizes the identity of the pathogen in memory T- cells and B cells.

And years later when the pathogen reinvades the memory cells rapidly retrieve this information and translate it into instant action. This is the marvels of biology in the way it

receives information, processes information, stores information, retrieves information and acts. And the inference of all this

information is done at speed and it with energy efficiency that we can't even imagine. We don't need those gigawatts of data centers. We have distributed data centers that take sips of energy

when it needs to use it. Our brain which is the biggest superco computer known to man does this so efficiently that we need to understand how biology

works. Another great thoughtprovoking example of biological intelligence is the migration of the arctic turn. This little bird that is the size of a

tennis ball takes undertakes a 70,000 kilometer journey between the Arctic, the Antarctic and back with no prior knowledge with no older

bird to guide it and yet it does it with astonishing precision and speed. How does it do it? This is about navigational intelligence embedded in its DNA.

AI by contrast learns from data to optimize decisions at machine scale. So therefore the true inflection point lies at their intersection. AI powered biology.

From protein structure prediction and generative drug design to digital twins of cells and organs, AI is compressing discovery timelines and reducing development risk. And

therefore, I believe that the next frontier is even more profound. The reprogramming of cells themselves to restore biological balance.

But for this we need to understand how biological intelligence operates. Imagine reprogramming cancer cells into non-malignant cells. Imagine repairing bone tissue that is damaged and

irreparable. Biological intelligence is built on an intricate network of cell signaling, gene regulation and immune memory that work symbiotically as I mentioned to me

to maintain homeostasis. Now if we now come to what I've just spoke spoken about which is reprogramming and re-engineering. We are moving from static

one-sizefits-all drugs to programmable biology which is the new frontier. We need to learn how biology learns, stores data, retrieves and processes data in such an agile and energy and

efficient way. Once we understand the computational models of living systems, we can use AI to accelerate with predictive precision the most advanced present-day therapies.

Today we are all excited about personalized carti therapies that basically eliminate tumors with precision. autoimmune disease interventions that

recalibrate immune tolerance rather than broadly suppressing immunity. And then the most exciting part of longevity and health span. These are areas where we must understand how

senence is modulated, metabolic pathways of aging are created and cellular repair mechanisms to delay biological aging and restore tissue resilience happens. If we understand all

this, as the last speaker said, we may be able to live for another 50 years and more. Crucially, these approaches seek not to overpower biology, but to reinforce its

inbuilt guard rails or regulatory circuits which focus on repair, feedback control, and immune surveillance. AI can map these regulatory circuits at scale, enabling targeted interventions

that preserve homeostatis. That is the excitement of new science led by AI. new biology led by AI. This represents a paradigm shift from managing disease to re-engineering biological systems

to sustain equilibrium. So India's future health security will depend on how optimally we

combine the code of life and the code of If foundational AI models for drug discovery, genomics, cellular engineering and clinical decision making are owned offshore, India risks

strategic dependence in the most critical domain of national resilience, which is human health. Biotech sovereignity embedded in AI must therefore mean sovereign control over

trusted biological data. indigenous AI models, computing infrastructure and translational pro uh platforms from discovery and development to manufacturing and delivery.

This is essential not only for economic competitiveness but also for preparedness against pandemics, antimicrobial resistance and emerging new bio threats.

Now I really believe this is a very important aspect of what AI can do for biotech and the economy. AI alone will not create economic opportunities but the delivery of AI

through in our field through manufacturing and products will do that. India's global role must evolve from being the pharmacy of the world to

becoming the biotech platform of the world. A nation that offers AI native discovery engines, programmable therapy platforms and scalable biio manufacturing as global public goods.

And this requires embedding AI across the biotech value chain. When it comes to discovery, we need to develop foundation models for proteins, RNA, cellular circuits and systems biology.

When it comes to development, I think there are huge opportunities to develop incilico trials, digital twins and AIdriven trial design to really de derisk the success of pipelines

and probability of success. When it comes to manufacturing, smart biio manufacturing using AI for yield optimization and most importantly quality by design is going to be a great

opportunity for all of us. Now when it comes to regulation, it has to be a science first approach. Tech enabled regulatory pathways integrating real world evidence through AI

validation. I think that's going to be a huge opportunity which we must do right now. What is important is for regulations to keep up with technology.

If we compress timelines of discovery and development to a fraction of what it happens today and if regulatory speed does not keep up with it then we miss out on a huge lost opportunity. So

working in tandem working in synchronization is the need of the hour. The this transformation cannot be driven by industry alone. It demands a triple helix of government,

academia and industry. Government must invest in sovereign AI bio infrastructure, trusted data architectures, regulatory sandboxes and mission mode

programs in cell and gene therapy, immunooncology and longevity science. Academia must mainstream computational biology, neurosymbolic AI and AI first

life sciences education to build a new carter of translational scientists. Industry must co-create shared platforms, translational pipelines and globally benchmarked biommanufacturing

clusters that convert science into scale. Capital markets must also evolve to support long cycle high-risk biotech innovation that is so rampant in

startups in our country. Deep science requires patient capital. But the societal and economic returns from reduced disease burden to global platform leadership are exponential.

Now coming to ethics, trust and global leadership. Sovereignity is not isolation. India must build ethical, transparent, energyefficient and biasaware AI systems

for biology that are globally interoperable yet rooted in public interest. And I think this is the unique model India can create by embedding principles of equity,

affordability and access into AIdriven. Yeah, I'm good. Yeah. AIdriven biotech. India can offer the world a new model of innovation combining technological leadership with

social purpose for India. Biotech sovereignity embedded in AI is not a sectoral ambition. It is a foundation of health security, strategic autonomy and economic

resilience. Those who master the language of life augmented by the language of machines will shape the future of humanity. India has the science, the AI and life sciences

talent, the scale and the values to lead provided it builds the sovereign platforms of tomorrow today. Thank you. Thank you so much, Miss Cho. It was a pleasure listening to you and you

actually added a new dimension to our understanding of artificial intelligence and helped us understand how code of biology and code of intelligence, artificial intelligence, if they work

together, they can give us solutions to so many of our health problems as well. Well, ladies and gentlemen, now it's my pleasure to invite our next speaker, Mr. Geodano Albertazi, who is the chief

executive officer of Vertiv, a global company that provides digital infrastructure solutions for data centers, communication networks. Under his leadership, Wave is advancing its

role as a global industry leader by accelerating innovation, strengthening technology leadership, and enabling the digital infrastructure that powers critical applications worldwide. Ladies

and gentlemen, please welcome Mr. Jodano Elbatazi. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much. Thank you very much. &gt;&gt; The clicker. Oh yeah, here better with a

clicker. Good uh good afternoon everyone and it's uh absolutely a pleasure and an honor being on uh on this uh stage where so many distinguished presenters uh in the last two days have had the

opportunity to talk about AI. An astonishing thing to me is that the majority of the AI conversation as it should be as it should be are about what AI can do.

Very interesting presentation just finished tells tells about all the beautiful things that AI can do and particularly what AI can do in uh here in India. But when we talk AI, we also

talk about data centers. But let me go then to the physical part of AI, not just what AI can do for us. There is an important very important physical part of AI that sometimes is overlooked

and it shouldn't because it's it's that physical part that makes AI actually possible. So I'll talk about the physical part today. I will talk about uh the power, the cooling, the data

center infrastructure. Vertive and myself with Vertive have been in the industry for decades. Well, Vertive longer than me. It used to be part of uh uh Emerson, Emerson Electric

and we are almost 10 years as an independent company now publicly traded uh in uh in New York. But what we do is really make sure that that physical part is provided with the best technology.

the technology that supports the continuous evolution of the AI IT stack as those rapidly almost exponentially and I'm talking almost exponentially from a mathematical standpoint evolve

and it's no easy task a task that we would do very well because we know the space a lot we have a lot of innovation but there are several dimensions to this one is the extreme density ification.

Now it we all know what GPUs are. Probably two years ago, majority of people didn't have any clue about what a GPU is. But now GPU Nvidia is absolutely central to everything all the all the

conversation about AI. Well, that phenomenal evolution from a technology standpoint is changing the DNA of a of a data center. What used to be a rack with it inside 10, 15, 20 kilowatt per rack

is rapidly becoming more dense and and with more power and heat to dissipate uh in it. This is going to 30 50 kilowatts per rack all the way in the possible future

one megawatt per rack. That's a lot of power in a single rack. The design of a data center is uh is changing dramatically as this design changes. Of course uh also uh the the technology

that supports it needs to change. But let me go back to AI artificial intelligence. Let me go back to and let me do draw a parallel human intelligence. Human intelligence

happen in the brain but the brain doesn't survive without a body. What we are what we do at vertive make that body provide the technology for that body so that the brain can function and that

brain is the IT stack but not only that brain can function but also can produce intelligence and that's what an AI factory an AI data center is doing but just like the body you know historically

data centers and data centers engineering was viewed as disperate systems coming together. Now we cannot think about a human body

or anybody as individual parts, a chiller, uh a liquid cooling unit, a an interruptible power supply or whatever else in the power train or thermal chain you can think of. Everything needs to be

orchestrated. Everything needs to be interoperable. Everything must be thought of as one thing. And that's what we do in a in a in a world that is extraordinarily

challenging, but it's a challenge that we uh of of course respond to very successfully. Challenging in terms of time of deployment and in terms of scale of deployment. Data centers need to be

developed faster and faster and are becoming bigger and bigger. You heard that you know it is about data centers. It India is certainly privileged from an AI

standpoint also because there is a lot of power available that can be harnessed for uh more and more powerful and larger data centers. Now as that happens again if you think go back to the to my

analogy of the body you think about a system you think about everything that is the body of artificial intelligence then it is about changing the way we build that body from one piece at a time

with a lot of activity happening on site laborious hard from a quality standpoint to uh most integrated at factory level and deployed as uh as Nvidia continues to lead the

world in terms of uh technology in terms of IT stack but also in terms of thought process for the infrastructure and it's something that we do a lot together well then it is not

just about the infrastructure and the speed and the size and the scale it's also about optimizing the infrastructure with reference designs that exactly target that type of application. So we

of course are thrilled and always honored to partner with Nvidia in this this adventure and venture and uh and lead the market in this respect. So here you have an example of what we call um

one verive one core. There's an example of a fully pre-engineered defined data center. But when we talk about the body the body of AI the data center then let's talk very simply we

talk about three fundamental elements of that body. One is the power train. So everything that goes from the grid if you will for your utility takes that power all the way to the chip. uh that

power infrastructure is changing is evolving as uh as the power density changes and uh the current architectures are migrating towards over time what is an 800 volt DC power infrastructure I'm

going technical on you some of you I know are very technical so I'm not afraid about that but I will not go deep so everything you see on the left side of of this is exactly representation of

that power train. So take bring the energy take that energy to uh to the to the chip. Then the chip and all the electronic components in a in a server generate heat and that heat can be very

dense and require very very advanced cooling mechanisms. And that's the beginning of what what we like to call the thermal chain that starts and it's what what you see on the right side of

the this chart from the chip all the way to the heat extraction the heat then rejection or even more importantly and more extend extensively so is the heat reuse. So this is the system the

fundamental systems of uh of this body but again it's not just about the components of the system is how the entire system works and more and more we see that when we think about the AI IT

what used to be thought of as a a server at a time is becoming really an AI pod an AI by unit at a time. The unit of compute is no more the server, it is the pod. The unit of compute is not even the

pod is in the entire data center operating as one single uh computer. A unit of compute that can can go all the way to gigawatts. So uh it is about making sure and I believe we do it very

well that I say uniquely well but of course I I I root for ourselves. Uh it is about making that infrastructure available at scale and in a very easy uh modular to deploy uh fashion and that's

what we do. So a repeatable converged a converged uh infrastructure made of building blocks that can go from uh 12.5 megawatt all the way to 2 gigawatts all the way to gigawatt. So um

clearly it's not just about building that infrastructure but that infrastructure over time needs to be like we like to say future resilient. Some people like myself have been in the

industry of data center uh for for quite some time and it's fascinating the speed at which things happen and this speed is also uh enabled by new solutions that make

prefabricated and very fast to deploy part of data centers that used to be very very laborious. Take a data hall. It's empty when the building is new. You have to fill it with uh with power with

cooling with uh cables. Uh you have to put put the racks very laborious and time consuming. Time to token is of the essence. A prefabrication for example with what we do with Vertis

smart run reduces the time to deploy almost 85%. Uh almost an order of uh of magnitude. So the industry is changing not only in scale and in density but also in the way things are done and

deployed. Let me take uh a different angle now and focus on India. Uh India clearly central to the AI evolution revolution.

uh and central certainly in terms of the infrastructure that is being built and the infrastructure that will be built in the in the future and in the coming years. uh this infrastructure and the

speed at which this infrastructure will be built of course will depend as I was saying by the ability of uh the likes of Vertive but certainly Vertive given our prominent position also in India to

really enable this at scale and at speed in the ways that I explained. So uh Vertive in India has a long tradition. We've been here for uh decades. We have what I believe is an awesome team and

awesome partnerships and uh now this um this uh forum uh this uh these sessions these few days convinced me even more of the importance of India as a place to invest and invest we will

we are expanding our capacity and will continue to expand capacity We see India certainly as an extremely promising market as a a hub for uh um AI not only for India but globally. So it has got

the power availability certainly India has got the right demographics. So I'm I couldn't be more excited about uh the business in India. I couldn't be more excited about what we're doing in India

and what our partners are doing in uh in India. So with that I'm I'm extremely optimistic. I'm a big optimist about what AI will bring as we heard and uh and with that thank you very much.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much Mr. El Betazi for your impactful address and also for data centers have up until now been usually constructed in one of two ways.

Traditional data center build follows a sequential process. Materials and equipment arriving individually on site with the build progressing from the ground up. Alternatively, pre-fabricated

modular construction can offer many advantages such as quicker deployments and risk reduction. Vertive offers many solutions in this space. However, in the age of increasing IT loads powered by

artificial intelligence, there's another option that combines the advantages of both. Vertive one core Verdive power and thermal infrastructure building blocks

are inserted into a brand new Verdive supplied steel building shell or an existing building. Infrastructure building blocks are made in controlled factory environments and

tested before shipping to the site where installation is quicker and easier compared to &gt;&gt; well ladies and gentlemen now we move to another panel discussion on a very

consequential question of the AI era which is the future of work. The employment is a big question which is being raised when we are adopting AI. And this panel we have very elite

panelists in this panel as well. We have Mr. Sanjie Bikchandani who is the founder and executive vice chairman of info edge. He has created no.com India's largest job platform. Mr. Deep Bagla who

is the mission director of the Atal innovation mission India's flagship initiative to foster a culture of innovation and entrepreneurship Miss Radhika Kapoor the senior

employment specialist with the international labor organization's decent work team for South Asia and we also have Mr. Prakash sorry I'm sorry we also have Mr. Prashant warrior who is

the CEO of cure AI which is the health AI company and ladies and gentlemen this is the most scaled health AI startup in the world today may I please invite our panelist to please take their seats on

the stage and this panel is being moderated by Mr. Siddhart Madan who is the managing director and partner at Boston Consulting Group. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome our panelists.

Thank you. We're at a very defining moment of in the history of work. On one end we are seeing new possibilities, new productivity unlocks, new jobs being

created and on the other there's a lot of growing anxiety around uh what would it mean and the kind of disruption it'll bring to work especially the knowledge work the the white collar jobs as they

say. Um let me start with Mr. BLA uh how do you how should businesses and policy maker think about this transition? It's very interesting first. I don't think any of us have any answers.

We will try the fundamental point you know and I remember when I joined banking and I take you back to 1986 we went for training and the first thing

we were told that the only job which will never change and is stable and safe in the banking world is that of the teller. You have to go get your cash.

The first job to go when digitization happened was the teller because you started taking it out of the machine. Now the challenge which remains for all

of us is that we are entering into an area era where there's no playbook and what is it which it is going to move into. So we've got to put it into time spans. If I look at it what is going to

happen in the next 5 years, 10 years and then after that no one knows. I think next five years is going to be one of the toughest times of disruption. How many of you have ever been laid off?

Excellent. You're the only one ready for the next 10 years. That is the most important thing going forward. And I think one of the things which we are trying to do at the art

tinkering labs and my team here is here and with her she's the one who's putting it at the school level we are trying to bring AI and tinkering the idea of innovation that you and what

I've also started seeing as a trend from there that many of them may not be looking at going to a very formal education system but getting into a job profile there and then and it's more

task oriented. So I'll start off with this and I know we'll go on with the questions but let me end here but as I see it I think that disruption in the next 5 year and 10 year period will be a

lot for all of us to learn psychologically on how can we be without a job when we are asked that's the first most important point and then tend to see what is it which we can pick up to

take on next because that's where we all talk about will be that peace killing peace coming in. Radhika, you have done a research recently on this. Let me ask the same

question to you. But uh let me add are we overestimating near-term job loss and underestimating the long-term transformation which it's bringing

&gt;&gt; somewhat. Yes. First, let's let me also somewhat endorse what Mr. BLA said. I think that this is there's immense uncertainty and we really do need to have more granular and more nuanced

understanding of what this transition actually entails. uh because you know different segments of the population, different segments of the workforce are going to be impacted differentially by

this transition. Now there is this narrative of this doomsday prediction and we're all going to lose our jobs and we've got to be psychologically prepared for losing our jobs. I think yes it is

indeed the case that most of our jobs are going to be exposed to uh automation and to gen AI but it doesn't mean that our jobs are going to be destroyed or that they're going to be completely

dispaced because if you go and look at the academic literature and a lot of the research be the IMF that the managing director was spoke in the session before at the ILO we know that an occupation

essentially entails many different tasks it's a bundle of tasks now there are some tasks in those occupations which are going to get automated and there are others which are not going to

be done uh not going to be. Now last year the ILO late last year the ILO actually put out a study where they looked at all the different occupations and they did a gradation of the extent

to which they were exposed to automation. Now if you look at the share of jobs where almost all the tasks had a high likelihood of automation and therefore were likely to be displaced

that number was actually somewhere between 3 or 4%. And that's a global average. If you actually you know break it down and look at a in countries with low income middle income it was even

lower. In high income countries that was close to 6%. But the share of jobs where some tasks were going to be automated but that also meant that there was more scope for freeing up time to bring in

new tasks enhance their productivity was actually quite high. That was about 20% of the jobs. So what I'm saying is that in order to manage this transition there are two things we're going to have to

do. One of course it is indeed the case that a small proportion of people will lose their jobs and they will be displaced. We need to think about how they are going to be absorbed in other

sectors and that to my mind is going to require more than skilling and reskilling. It's also going to require thinking more carefully about industrial policy about macroeconomic policy, trade

policies, labor market policies in particular social protection. But for those who are actually you know in the middle uh where some tasks will be automated and others will not we need to

think carefully about how those occupations can actually augment their productivity how they can engage more meaningfully with NAI and enhance their productivity because remember all of

this then also has an implication that enhanced productivity which has an implication in wages and prices all of that also boosts demand in the economy which then drives more job creation and

investment and that virtuous cycle of growth, investment, job creation. So, so I would say that you know yes support those who are you need policies to support those who will be displaced but

at the same time augment productivity in the other jobs which are somewhere in the middle and there is some buffer against automation. Sanji with no you have a front seat to what's happening in

this space like are you seeing structural shifts like you know uh there's a lot of uh feedback we get from media from social media from panelists but you know what as of now no creek

growth has not been impacted so on the ground we are not seeing a reduction in hiring but at the same time we are careful and cautious and answer I don't know Right? And the truth is nobody

knows and anybody who is telling you he knows is uh is wrong. They don't know. So because there's so much happening and it's so chaotic that you can't really figure out right what is going to happen

right but I'll go back in history a bit 1982 I was in college. Deepak was in college. We were in college together actually uh in Delhi University and these two new

companies were set up uh AppTech and NIT saying we're going to teach you how to use a personal computer. Nobody cared. A few cared but it was not mainstream. It was not okay. So most people didn't

care. By 1985, you know, it had become somewhat a requirement that if you go and learn how to use a computer, maybe your prospects of getting a job go up or if you got a job,

maybe you'll become more productive at your job. In 1985 to the Rajiv Gandhi government, the government said we're going to introduce computers and banks that and at that time banks mostly

public sector banks. The all India Bank employees association which is the one of the most powerful trade unions in the country then went ballistic. They're going to lose jobs. We're going to lose

jobs. Government said never mind we're putting them in anyway. So computers came into banks they weren't used for a while. Then they began to get used and guess what? Nobody lost jobs. Right?

People got more productive. People got MIS they weren't getting earlier. They served their customers better. Right? Uh nobody lost jobs. Okay. uh so new technology increased productivity did

not cause job losses now I'm not saying that's exactly what will happen this time right but you know maybe now will some jobs or tasks get automated

possibly so but will others come up almost certainly yes uh so what I tell individuals never mind policy guys and governments and you or multilaterals what I an

organization what an individual is look you don't bother about will jobs be lost will my job be lost will I lose my job and will I get a new job right now them my answer is simple learn three new how

to use three AI platforms every quarter by the end of one year you know 12 AI platforms believe me you will be employable okay and I'll give you an illustration

of this I finished business school in 1989 head. Uh by then I had finished college. I had done 3 years of work in an ad agency and had done business school. This 89 uh that's an important

year. Why is it an important year? Because the classes of 1988 and 89 were the first two batches to have graduated from the IMs who had actually used PCs at the IM because the PCs came into the

IM in ' 87. Okay. So we I walked into my job as PC literate. There were two PCs in the marketing department at the company where I was working. All the other

people were senior, very highly qualified. I am but I was the only guy who was PC literate. Right? Believe me if they were sacking then in that department I would have

been the last to go. I knew how to use that technology. So if AI is coming, it has come. It is inexorable. It is relentless. It will come. It has come. Right? Learn how to use it. So if you

don't do AI, AI will be done to you. &gt;&gt; Very insightful. I think if you optimize local optima, we are somewhere going to find the global balance. Uh Prashant with that let me Rika referred to you

know it's a job is a bundle of tasks tasks will get disrupted but the role might shift like for all of us. Let's make it real like you're closer to the medical community. How does the role of

a doctor or a nurse change going forward? Like can we envision an AI doctor in the future? what would the job look like? &gt;&gt; I think healthcare is slightly different

from a lot of other industries, right? I think it's highly regulated. Number one, um so I I think about three things from a healthcare perspective uh from a futuristic um perspective as well,

right? One is that um the capacity is limited especially if you're talking about the global south, right? India has I mean we operate in the radiology AI space. We automatically interpret

radiology images with AI. And if you look at India, India has got one radiologist for every 100,000 people which is about and US has one radiologist for 10,000 people. Kenya, if

you look at Kenya has the same number of radiologists as Minal Hospital. So um and and many African countries have like one or two radiologists, very very small number, right? And so there's not enough

capacity to meet that demand. So when you look at job loss per se, I mean there is not enough capacity to meet the demand that is there for healthare. So in many ways, I mean you're not going to

lose jobs. It is going to upskill people. healthcare workers and doctors who are on the ground supporting patients. So that's that's one is about upskilling uh people right and

supporting uh making healthare workers able to uh support patients. Maybe there is an AI doctor that can do primary care. I mean primary care is something that can be significantly automated. I

mean you're looking at three things that you're doing in primary care. One is to understand patient symptoms. So AI can prompt the patient can understand what symptoms they might have. Second is to

recommend tests uh which again AI can identify the right tests and and recommend what uh testing should do and third is around uh diagnosis and treatment right again which uh AI can

potentially do or even sort of triaging to the specialist. So these are things which AI can do. So I think in general AI is going to upscale doctors and healthcare workers to do better and meet

more patients and save time. Right? One of the things that we are seeing across the world is uh you are using AI agents to uh scribe and take notes of the doctor patient conversations uh which is

a task which I mean if you I mean if a doctor is meeting 40 50 patients a day and after every one of those uh conversations they have to write down take notes from that conversation AI can

do that automatically we use that note take we use note takers in our meetings why can't you use note takers uh in a doctor patient conversation so we are seeing that I mean upscaling sort of one

area second area I think which is going to at least from a healthcare perspective I see uh is uh a tough one is uh around regulation right everything that AI does today uh in healthcare

across the world in the US it's FDA cleared you have to get FDA clear to be able to actually provide a clinical decision support to a doctor so that that is not going away right now and

that FDA equivalent India India CDSO every country has its own regulatory body so you have to figure out how to um cross that barrier that hurdle is still there uh and and that is not something

that is going away right now. And that brings me to the third point which is that today I mean if a doctor is taking a decision on a patient saying that this patient has tuberculosis for example or

lung cancer or any of those right they are taking liability for that decision and till AI is going to be able to take that liability that is going to be a decision that doctors will make and so

what I see today and for the next at least 5 to 10 years is that AI is going to be supporting doctors in making better decisions. uh it is helping it is providing all the data in the right

format. For example, what we do is we are able to bring data from electronic medical records uh packs packs basically imaging data of the patient uh pathology data of the patient bring all of that

together into one place for the doctors to help diagnose better. So you're providing that support to the doctor in making a a clinical decision and also providing treatment planning sort of

automated treatment planning uh treatment plans which they can use to then um uh provide uh the treatment plan for that patient. So it is a supportive tool and I see that uh for the next

several years AI is going to be upskilling upskilling doctors uh in providing better care and uh providing more care to patients especially in the global south where there's not enough

capacity. um if you know multiple areas or multiple playgrounds of action is happening like there's startups there's infra there is energy you know yesterday

our honorable minister spoke about the five layers of AI where do you see most amount of action needed like if you had to pick one area to double down on what does India need

&gt;&gt; within the AI stack or generally &gt;&gt; within the AI stack like &gt;&gt; I think on The application side is where we will have a very interesting play on actually the small ones and actually

getting them executed. That's where we've had some strength in any case. But let me just step back a minute beyond this question if I may with your permission. You know one very

interesting thing yesterday the plenary I was sitting right there and next to me was a professor from an Ivy League. Let me not just say it but one of the top five IV leagues. And I was asking the

professor when are you going to go back and start teaching because he was taking a break to do it. He told me a very interesting thing. One of the big things which is happening in this university is

that the master students are feeling that they no longer need to pay that big tuition fees because they are no longer getting challenged because AI is giving them all the

answers. Now see the repercussion of that when we say that we have a million people coming into the job market every year every month in India that is because we go through a bachelor's and a

masters and then they're coming in. So let's say like Sanjiv and I started 22 23 24 one of the most interesting elements which was pointed out was that maybe

that age barrier no longer remains. You may have somebody who's 13y old and ready to do a job in a task and that is another trend which might just picked up because the moment you're

going to see a complete change in the educational system think of two industries which have so far withstood or been having push back on the youth change which can come to them. The

financial industry is one and the education industry. But now they're being challenged on it in a big way. your four years masters, two years masters, four years bachelors, maybe

nobody needs to do it. So see the number of people which will get into the task creation and the task doing force. That is another element which we've not yet been able to quantify.

Very insightful and so this will allow me to go back to the first question I asked you. Are you seeing a structural shift like I for example are people now instead of asking degree pedigree asking

for more AI fluency basic skills instead of degrees? &gt;&gt; Uh I people talk about it. I'm not sure how many people actually do it right at the end of the day if you've got a

credential it matters. See uh what does an IIT degree mean? At one level it means you've learned something. Another level it means you

are you you have demonstrated commitment to a prepare to get it. So you you are able to work hard. You know some level of physics, chemistry, maths. That's how you cleared the entrance exam right and

you were at the top of the academic heap and that's how you got into the place in the first place. So when I we go to IIT to recruit, we don't hire for the specific knowledge they got at IIT. We

hire for the fact that it's a fantastic filter on several counts, right? Also, right? Uh and to some extent, you know, a 13year-old uh you know, ready for work. Look, business is about people.

Business is about people and managing people and working with people and selling to people and you know running teams being a good team player being a good leader. So that comes with at least

some years of experience, some years of, you know, maturity, right? So can I be a forex trader in front of a computer at 16 if I'm technically good enough? Answer is yes. But can I lead a team of

salespeople out in the field who are calling on clients who are 20 years older than me? I don't know. Maybe you can, maybe you can't. So, so you know some stuff I mean people are still

people. &gt;&gt; Nadika what does it mean for the gig workers and the temp workforce and you know the labor laws were written long back

what would it mean as we move ahead how do how should we even think of the labor laws or the role that the temporary labor brings in like the we done with the age of working in the same

organization perhaps for 30 years as as s just mentioned. So you're talking about temp workers and gig workers and before I answer that more directly I just want to reflect on the comments uh

that have been made by the other panelists you know the conversation that we're having here on displacement and productivity enhancement including the comments that I made earlier we're

really talking only about 10% of India's workforce at this point uh the conversation on AI is right now you know today we are having this summit in the global South and the global south still

vast proportion of the workforce is in the informal sector for India 45% of its workforce is still in the agricultural sector 55% of the people are self-employed uh

95% of employment is in enterprises with less than 10 workers so you know that part of the conversation we're completely missing out in in the future of work and I think we need to bring

that in here as well because a lot of the gig work and the casual work uh what that you're referring to is essentially what we see in the informal sector and for that sector the risk is not

excessive automation they might completely miss the bus and not realize any of these gains or productivity uh gains from AI so we also need to think more carefully about how how all of this

can enhance productivity in the agricultural sector uh how there could be greater AI adoption amongst micro and small enterprises which are basically the engines of job creation in India And

that's again going to require a lot more than skilling and credentials but also they're going to need a lot of financial support for adopting AI. Uh they are going to need uh digital infrastructure,

access to broadband so on and so forth. And now going back to your question on the changes in the world of work and labor regulations. Indeed there is no denying the fact that uh labor

regulations have not kept pace with the changes in the employed employee relationships. uh we now live in a world of work where there is a proliferation of non-standard employer employment

arrangements. Uh the platform economy is a manifestation of that as well and certainly there's a need to update that. At the ILO for example, there is a conversation for two years which is

happening on what are the kinds of conventions and recommendations that are required to bring decent work into the platform economy and of course India is leading in that conversation with the

code and social security which seeks to provide social protection even to platform workers. So that's a very forward uh uh looking uh ambition. &gt;&gt; Yes. We're at time, but I'll just end

with one last question. Rapid fire. One word, maximum 5 second answer. Lot of still unknowns. What does success look like in 2030? What would you be proud of? We'll go in a row.

Most critical point when everyone works together, the government, the society, the people, the academia. I think that joining the dots is absolutely core to seeing any element of success for

anyone. And last point, I think the biggest benefit of the delta multiplier of AI is India or will be India. Prashant &gt;&gt; in success for AI is world's GDP growing

at 10% or more uh by 2030. I think uh if there is net job increase which means the jobs lost if any are less than the jobs created I think that is success.

&gt;&gt; I think an inclusive AI transition where we have better jobs more productive jobs and where the agricultural sector and the MSME sector have benefited from this transition and we don't leave the

informal sector behind. Super &gt;&gt; with that we'll wrap this panel discussion. Thank you so much for insightful comments. I thank our respected panelists for that

thoughtprovoking and very important discussion and thank you so much Mr. Madan for this for moderating this conversation and asking all those pertinent questions which I'm sure many

of us would also be thinking of asking our panelists. So it's been a great moment having these panelists with us on this very important discussion. Ladies and gentlemen, and now moving on, our

next speaker brings an essential perspective on the governance architecture being built around AI internationally. It is my privilege now to welcome Mr.

Thomas Schneider, ambassador, vice director, and co-director of international relations of com Switzerland. Mr. Schneider has been a central figure in global digital policy

for over two decades representing Switzerland in key multilateral forums. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Mr. Thomas Schneider. &gt;&gt; Thank you. I hope you can hear me.

So dear friends and colleagues from India and from all around the world, it is an honor and pleasure to be here with you in Delhi at this pivotal moment for global AI governance. And first of

course I want to express my gratitude to the government of India for bringing together a diverse and distinguished group of leaders, innovators, researchers, civil society

representatives from all around the world. Switzerland very much welcomes and supports the focus of the AI impact summit which is well presented in the free sutras people progress planet as we

all have learned in the past weeks and months and we fully agreed that we need to develop and use AI in a way that everyone in the world can benefit from the potential that AI offers. This

includes economic and societal social progress for everyone. At the same time, of course, we need to make sure that we respect human dignity and autonomy as well as our planet, which is the basis

for all life that we know, at least so far. We haven't found other life elsewhere. So, we are honored and very proud to be hosting the next AI summit in Geneva in 2027.

It is overwhelming to see already now and feel the momentum and the enthusiasm that we sense on national level among all Swiss stakeholders as well as the very positive reactions from our

partners from all around the world who are all eager and willing to cooperate with us and contribute to the summit in Geneva. Already now we are approached by many governmental and other stakeholders

that share their ideas with us about what the Geneva summit and the road leading up to it should focus on and what it should achieve. And let me assure you that this is very welcome and

helpful to us. The Swiss motivation for organizing the next summit is to not to make a show. It is to substantially and meaningfully contribute to achieving the goal that mankind uses the unprecedented

potential of AI for good and not for bad. This potential of AI which may be at least as transformative as the invention of the printing press, radio, television and the internet as well as

the invention of the combustion and other engines together. This potential must be used to raise and not lower the quality of life of all people in the world and not just a few. AI must

strengthen and not weaken the dignity and autonomy of all people in the global north, south, east and west or whatever we call the region where we live and help us all to live together in peace

and prosperity. So we are very keen to hear your ideas about what we could and should do together to achieve this goal. Of course, we do have some ideas on our own, but we have not decided yet about

the focus of the Geneva summit. We will discuss it with you together, shape it together. Of course, there will be a Swiss flavor to the Geneva summit which is based on the way we work and the what

we understand our role in the international community. We will try to be constructive, creative and innovative and try to find pragmatic and fair solutions through bringing together all

stakeholders in their respective roles and with their respective experience. And at the same time, we will try not to reinvent the wheel and duplicate processes and instruments that already

exist and that work, but rather we will try to build on them because we do already have a number of dialogue platforms for AI governance and for sharing good practices such as the UN

internet governance forum and its national and regional initiatives, the AI for good summit and the global fora on ethics of AI organized by it, UNESCO and many other UN related processes and

fora. We have other fora like the OECD, GPI and other international and regional organizations. And of course we will build on the outcomes of the previous summit in the UK, Korea, Japan uh sorry

Paris, Japan will follow uh at some point in time UK UK, Korea, Paris and of course here in Delhi and we should not forget the many academic and other networks that provide expertise and

solutions. So we will do all at best to bring them all together and with the help of our long-standing partners from the Diplo Foundation and the Geneva Internet Platform, we will also try to

facilitate the orientation in these complex governance ecosystem in particular for less resources communities so that also they know better about what is going on where and

where we need to raise our voice so that they are actually heard. At the same time, we consider the transformative power of AI to be too big, broad and context specific. So that no one single

institution and no single instrument will allow to us to seize all opportunities and will solve all problems. So we will have to learn to live with a certain complexity of the

governance of this transformation. But also this is not a completely new situation. If we look at how we have governed the transformative power of combustion and other engines in the past

200 years, there are some lessons that we can also apply to AI. While today we are developing AI to automate cognitive labor, we have developed engines to automate physical labor. We have put

engines in vehicles or machines to move goods or people from one place to another. And we have put engines in machines to produce food or other goods automatic automatedly. And we do not

expect one single institution or instrument to govern all of this. But we have developed a set of thousands of technical, legal and also non-written societal norms that guide us uh in the

use of these machines. We have regulated also the infrastructure that these machines use. We are setting requirements and liabilities for the people that develop, handle and steer

these machines. And we have developed instrument to protect people that are affected by the impact of these machines. And we are seeing different levels of harmonizations when it comes

to regulating machines and engines. Uh as an example, of course, we know that the airline industry is much more harmonized because it's global than the way we regulate cars driving in our

streets on one side or the other side um where there's more uh diversity possible. So after 200 years, we are still continuing to adapt the governance framework for engine-driven machines

depending on their context of use. And we need to do exactly the same with AI. We need to develop appropriate technical, legal and societal frameworks and norms that allow us to develop and

use AI for good in many different ways. And this work has already begun. We have analyzed um our existing governance frameworks have started to identify and fill the gaps. We have started to work

on technical norms for AI systems. We have started to work on binding and non-binding legal instruments. And of course in this regard I'd like to particularly highlight the um bill

convention on artificial intelligence, human rights, democracy and the rule of law for which I had the honor to lead the negotiations among 55 countries from all over the world at the Council of

Europe in Strasburg. This provides for a principle-based framework not just for Europe but for all countries on our planet that value human rights, democracy and the rule of law so that

our societies and economies can use AI to innovate while at the same time we uphold our respect to human dignity and autonomy also in the context of AI. The principles set out by the convention are

simple and clear. But the convention leaves enough leeway leeway to participating states in order to allow to embed these principles in their existing legal and regulatory

institutions and traditions. This will allow many countries to become parties to this global convention and to make sure that their governance frameworks may although not become identical but at

least interoperable. This convention which we hope will be ratified and enter into force very soon will become one important instruments to make sure that AI is used for the for the good and and

not the bad. But of course there will have to be many more binding and non-binding norms and more sector specific norms and instruments to complement it which hopefully will be at

least coherent in their logic and spirit. So we will use the time until the Geneva summit next year to continue to identify gaps in global and regional governance of AI and achieve our shared

objectives so that AI is used for innovation while at the same time legitimate concerns and risks are appropriately addressed. Switzerland will be the host of the next summit but

we know that we will not able to achieve anything on our own. So we look forward to collaborate with all of you with all countries and all stakeholders from the global north, south, east and west. And

we will first try to identify areas where there's a willingness and the shared vision um to make progress together and then work with all of you on pragmatic and workable steps towards

this vision. We will only be the facilitators trying to build bridges and build a climate of open and respectful and constructive dialogue, trying to offer pragmatic structures for

trustworthy cooperation so that we can all use the potential AI to say it again to live together in peace, prosperity, and dignity. The Swiss Summit team and I personally

are looking forward to collaborating with all of you in the coming months and we look forward to seeing you all in Geneva in 27. Thank you for your support and attention.

&gt;&gt; Thank you, Ambassador Schneider, for that very focused address which helped which enhanced our understanding of AI too. Ladies and gentlemen, now I would like to welcome Mr. Matthew Prince,

Chief Executive Officer, CloudFare. Cloudflare powers and protects a significant share of the world's internet traffic. And Mr. Prince has been at the forefront of the debate on

how AI intersects with cyber security, content delivery, and digital infrastructure. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Mr. Matthew Prince, CEO, Cloudflare.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you. It's an honor to be here at India's AI Summit and I look forward to what we'll be doing in Geneva next year. I know that here I'm supposed to be talking about the future, but

forgive me for a second. I used to be a professor, sometimes teaching history. And so I think sometimes in order for us to understand the future, it's actually good for us to understand some of the

past. The past we start with and what the previous speakers were talking about was another technological marvel which was the birth of the printing press. Uh the printing press started as

transformative technology uh built in Germany just out of outside of mines. Uh and it was uh though not held there, not contained there but spread incredibly quickly across the whole of uh of

Europe. Uh expanding not so that it was in any one place but into a thousand cities within less than 60 years which at that time was remarkable. It started in Germany but it was never just a

German thing. By 1470 there were presses in Paris, Rome by 1473, the Netherlands and Spain by 1476 in London. German technicians who learned from Gutenberg literally walked across Europe with that

knowledge and shared it across all of Europe. And they would set up a shop in a new city, find a local investor, a merchant or a bishop and then start printing local laws, local languages,

local cultures. And because the technology was not centrally controlled, no single country could gatekeep it or shut it down. This was one of those once-in-a-lifetime

moments where technology spread and the world got better as a result. And I think I think today that is that turning point that we we are now. And so inspired by the honorable prime

minister's words yesterday, I thought I would frame what I would think of as a framework of five things that we should all be playing for. And I think we can almost all agree that these things if AI

delivers them will be better than if it doesn't. So the first is much like the printing press this should not be a technology which is controlled by five companies. It should be 500,000

companies and those companies should be spread around the world. We need to make sure that as the honorable prime minister said we democratize this technology and make it available for

everyone and anyone. Secondly, we need to make sure that we're building business models around this technology. Too often today in the early early times of AI, AI takes but it does not give

back. We need to make sure that content creators, that journalists, that academics, that researchers are able to be compensated for the hard work that they do to create their content rather

than just having that content taken, regurgitated, and spit back through AI systems. And this is one of the key challenges that we have to think about as we go forward. We also need to make

sure that what has thrived in the early internet, small businesses, individual entrepreneurs, the global south being able to ship to the world, that that needs to be able to continue as opposed

to AI being a consolidator. And what I worry about is the fact that the small businesses that most of us do business with today, the relationship that we have with them is personal or based on

mere convenience. your AI agent isn't going to necessarily care about those things. And so we need to make sure that small businesses and especially those in the global south have the tools to be

able to survive as the world moves to more and more agentic commerce. We also need to recognize that unique cultures and unique identities, languages shouldn't be homogenized by AI. There is

no one universal culture and we can't forget those things that make each region and each part of the world unique. AI needs to respect and actually emphasize that. We don't want to make

the mistake of just merely Americanizing the world. But instead, we want to honor the culture of all of those places around the world and honor those things that have made us unique. AI shouldn't

remove our humanity. It should accelerate it and enhance it. And finally, we need to make sure that the technology is available to all, especially the poorest of those in the

global south. This can't be something where you can only get the latest, unbiased, unfiltered, uh, highest technology uh, if you can afford to spend thousands of dollars per month on

a subscription. There needs to be a business model that allows AI to be available to the broadest set of users and make sure that we aren't leaving people behind with this incredibly

powerful technology. That's the framework that I would aim for. One where AI is distributed, not controlled. One where AI is actually enabling creators and research. One

where AI is enabling businesses, small and large, to compete on a fair playing field. One where AI is bringing about our humanity and our differences, not homogenizing us, and one where it is

available to all, not only held by the rich. I think that's something that most of the people in this room can agree to. And I think that as we think about policy, as we think about technology, we

should be thinking about making sure that we are moving in that direction, moving towards all five of those goals, not moving away from them. Unfortunately, we are not yet there. And

I think we are at a crossroads and we need to all whether in business or government or civil society be thinking about what are the actions that we can take in order to achieve those five

milestones. So, how am I the person here talking about this? What in the world gives me any right to be up here speaking? Cloudflare

runs one of the world's largest networks. We have presence in over 120 countries, more than 300 cities uh worldwide. We see an enormous percentage of the world's global internet traffic.

Uh over 20% of the internet sits behind us. And so, we are not an AI company. We don't have a model ourselves but today over 80% of the leading AI companies use us. So a huge percentage of the internet

uses us. A huge percent of the AI companies use us. And we sit in between those things and are working towards our mission which is to help build a better internet. And when I say help is really

important. We don't believe that we can do it alone. We believe that we need the work of all of the people in this room in order to contribute to that. But we do see and can act as a broker between

these two sides. The content creators on one, the AI companies on the other, trying to figure out what is that future of the internet going to be? What does it look like? How can we make sure that

it continues to achieve all of those goals and there are some real challenges. The internet that we know today was really built based on a very simple formula. And that formula was

create rate content that drove traffic and then monetize that traffic through either selling things, subscriptions or ads. And if you think about it, that's how the internet was f funded over that

period of time and Google was the great patron of funding that in fact the way that we can measure how this has changed is to actually look at how Google's behavior has changed. 10 years ago, we

have data on this based on Cloudflare. For every two pages that Google scraped on the internet, they sent you back one human visitor. And with that human visitor, again, you could sell them

something, you could show them an ad, you could get them to subscribe to whatever you were doing. That was the business model of the internet. And that's what caused the internet to

flourish. But that business model is fading away. If you look at Google themselves, they have gotten to the point that for every 30 pages they scrape today, they only send you one.

It's gotten 15 times harder to get traffic from a Google search. Microsoft is even worse, 70 to1. But that's the good news. If we look at the pure AI companies, OpenAI, 3700 pages taken from

the internet for every one visitor they send back. And in Anthropic's case, 500,000, a half a million pages scraped for every one visitor you send back. the world is going to look more like

anthropic over time and that is going to put pressure on what has been the historic business model of the internet and what I worry about is that researchers, journalists, small

businesses are going to get crushed by this change unless we recognize it and try and figure out what is a new way of dealing with this. How are we able to stay in front of these changes? What is

the new business model of the internet going to look like? And so when we think about this, human eyeball traffic, the current currency of the internet is going away.

It's going to be it's and it's and it's never going to return in the same way. We are all getting our answers more from AI than from original sources. And so we have to figure out some new way in order

to compensate creators. And that might be very pessimistic, but I actually am optimistic about that because you see it it turns out that what we really want to compensate people for for for a better

internet is not repeating the mistakes of the internet's past. Um the internet was never built with security in mind. We should be thinking about that with AI and it was always wrong to equate

traffic with value. There are a lot of times that are things that are salacious that generate a lot of traffic but don't actually further human knowledge. And so there's an opportunity as we think about

what the new business model of the internet is to try and figure out a reward system that actually rewards creators for furthering human knowledge. What's amazing is this is directly

aligned with what the AI companies want. If you think about it, for the first time in human history, we have something close to a mathematical model of all of human knowledge. It's not perfect, but

that's what the sum total of the AI systems that we have are today. They are taking up that way and and they're a way of quantifying what we know and what we don't know. And what's interesting is I

think of it as like a giant block of Swiss cheese. And that that block has a lot of cheese in it, but it also has a lot of holes. And those holes are the places where there are holes in human

knowledge. And what the AI companies want, what all of us actually want is for those holes to be filled. And if we could create a system where creators are actually rewarded by filling in those

blanks in the Swiss cheese, those holes in the Swiss cheese, by rewarding people not for creating content which is rage baiting, content which makes people angry, content which is designed just to

provoke, but instead content which is designed to further human knowledge. That is something that we have a market for today and that the AI companies are excited to pay for. What we also have to

think about is how we avoid the cycle of centralization and control. And we've seen this with technology and over and over again. Telecoms exhibited it. Social networks exhibited the

hyperscalers are exhibiting it. And there is real risk that if we don't make it so that more and more people can create an AI company. If we end up with a world of five AI companies, not

500,000, that is worse for everyone around the rest of the world. And so what we're trying to do is think about how we can make sure that anyone anywhere in the world has the tools and

the knowledge and the ability to compete in this incredibly exciting space. We need to stop the consolidation of AI and again lead to 500,000 companies, not just uh not just five. So what we're

fighting for at Cloudflare as an example and what I would ask that anyone who is playing in this space fights for is how do we make sure that we level the playing field and that we make sure that

everyone around the world can participate in what is this incredible technology. We need to make sure that AI is coming to all the parts of the world including the global south and I am

inspired by the stories of startups and students here in India that are inventing an AI future. We need to make sure we cultivate an environment where that AI future can grow and it doesn't

get stifled by a handful of companies that are out there. So at Cloudflare, what specifically are we doing in order to make sure that this is the case? We're trying to figure out how can we

make sure that content is available all around the world in and and and is is accessible uh that and widely available to everyone. That's by taking the top models and making them available across

our global network so they can be run in the city where you are actually living. Um that that also means that we should make it easy to use and enroll in these in these systems. So making it so that

you don't have to have a degree in computer science to start playing with AI models and making sure that that's that's the case. What we also are doing is actually funding the education of

both startups and students to uh to do this. So we have our own startup accelerator and in India it is the second largest by uh country participants come from here and it's

amazing to see what all of the startups in India are creating and we're proud of the fact that we are giving enormous credits to be able to use our services for free for startups that are trying to

build that next generation and take on some of those giants. We're also trying to make sure that this is adaptable and multimodel around the world. So we have adopted the ability to roll out models

across our platform that support all of the different things that you need wherever you are in the world and those models should be regionalized so that they can be trained on local laws, local

languages and local cultures. I'm proud of the fact that we have done this with AI for Barat which we rolled out with 22 official languages across all of India and made it available for students in

India to be able to experiment and try and it's incredible what we're seeing people build with these models. We also launched an IIT uh uh buildathon to be able to take this with AI for Barat and

Cloudflare workers AI and it's incredible what the students there were able to build and deliver. We also need to have secure by design. That's the key to what we're doing. We need to not make

the same mistakes that we had with the internet before. And we need to make sure that it's actionable and affordable. It can't be that you have to have trillions of dollars of budget. You

have to stand up your own nuclear power plant in order to be the next AI company. And so we're designing systems and we're working not just to say how much money can we throw at the problem,

but how can we make these systems more efficient so that we can pass on that cost and make it uh more affordable for everyone. These are the work that we're doing at Cloudflare. And I would

challenge anyone in the audience, if you're working in AI, strive for these five values. How can we make sure that everyone has a chance to participate in the AI economy? We want to make that

available for the world. We can't say that this is going to be a technology that is restricted to literally five companies in one postal code in San Francisco that have access to it. It

needs to be available to the world. We're here to help. appreciate all of the uh effort and the great hosts from the AI summit in India and I'm looking forward to Geneva. Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Thank you so much Mr. Matthew Prince for that very immersive address and also for highlighting the importance of democratizing artificial intelligence and also highlighting the importance of

content. We should have quality content as well as availability of content for everyone. Ladies and gentlemen, moving on. I would now like to welcome Mr. Vijay Shakhar Sharma, chief executive

officer from PTM. That's a name which we all Indians are so familiar with. From a small town in Uttar Pradesh to building India's most recognized fintech brand, Mr. Vijay

Shakhar Sharma's story is a testament to the entrepreneurial energy that India brings to the global technology conversation. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Mr. Vijay Shakhar Sharma.

Uh &gt;&gt; wow. First of all, I do believe that everybody who's an Indian must be very proud that And I think this is the power of India

my friend. I don't have to say this. Everybody who somebody in AI is right now in this country. Our prime minister has been able to bring the excitement of AI just like 10 year back he was able to

do it for startup India. So from the startup India to the AI India once again for our honorable prime minister. This time guys I don't have to tell you how the

powerful capability of AI all of us have experienced. Many of you must be using a personal agent in every other day and if not agent and the beauty is that more you use it

the more it becomes addictive. It is where the technology is. And now today in every nook and corner of the country we can see the payments reaching and completing itself. And now

this takes us to the next milestone where every one of us who uses a smartphone can now use power of AI. Now I don't have to tell this once again the capabilities that we will harness over

the period will not be just limited by the chhat or let's say the photo edit WhatsApp message pick up it will go towards the industry. So till 2025 AI was more of a individual experiential

play if you will. You know you were trying to find out use case and the problem answers that you fundamentally believe that it'll be but 2026 begins with a commitment and confidence that AI

will bring the capability in the business and the work and the problem that we typically would not have assumed that would be solved. And let me say this typically I come from financial

service industry and I fundamentally believe access to credit creates the wealth but access to credit requires lot of insights and abilities to confirm whether this money will come back or

not. Many rules and regulations are allowing us to expand the ex reach of credit. But by the capability of AI we will be able to take care of corner cases where it should not go or it

should go. So people will become more financially inclusive than ever before. As you are all knowing the smartphone gave access to the financial system to the every nook and corn of the country.

Now this time financial institutions will serve those customers. So from access to the rich ability of financial system will reach. Financial systems bring wealth to the country. Bring

access bringing access to the credit to the last person brings wealth to the person there. And that is what I believe AI will be able to do. Let's say in financial system you could talk about

agriculture. You could talk about husbandry. I remember the conversation between Nandani sir and prime minister sir yesterday was happening about let's say how could you use the power of

ability of cattle to use in AI and then Amul case was talked about. Now imagine the same thing could be done even for machines even for plants even for agriculture. The capability of AI that

we want to use will make it possible for us to build it in India for the problem and solution that we built for India. And this time we while we are solving the problems here, we will not solve a

local problem. We will solve a global problem because the capability of Indians have been proven that we can make worldclass technology. The technology that solves at a order of

magnitude scale and abilities that are globally renowned and capable. Once again I'm going to say that that this is not about foundation model only. Important a foundation model is a

horizontal capable model. I don't mind saying that we must must and for sure have a foundation model in India all because we have a capability and resources to do it. And I'm very proud

that my fellow entrepreneur Seram has done the job and I do believe that is a acknowledgement that we can build it. It's not something rocket science. It's not something that we cannot build it.

But the point is not about just building a foundation model. Point is about building the models that solve for us, solve for global south, solve for global problems. And those models and the

requirement of those models to bring in everyday life can only happen in a country where the demographic dividend belongs to us. So the first time our demographic

dividend will also become the demographic technology dividend if you will. The capability of our young capability and ability and intent of our young will aid to the propagation of AI

unlike ever before. It is not about just using let's say a messaging platform or a payment platform. It is about adding the capability in your everyday life and that is rare and possible only in this

country. Again there is a question of for me that will you build LLM models or will you build agents on top of it. I'm sure all of us have understood that models are the foundation and the let's

say on the top of it an agent. It's like asking will you build vehicles or will you engines different and there that requirement will go

metaphorically 10 number of times and many more fold than ever before imagined. So right now IC internal combustion but

use case using it to make a passenger vehicle using it to make a bus using it to make a truck using it to make a trailer. That is the use case the world want to see. India not only will be the

use case capital of the world but India will also be the capital of number of LLMs that India will build. India will build more number of LLMs for the section of usage and ability of usage

than ever before. The fight is not about just a foundation model. Fight is about AI that works for a sector, works for a segment and solves a problem of an agent. For example, like call centers

are the talked about thing that we will let's say what will happen to the jobs of call centers. I don't mind saying that call center literally job may or may not be challenged. Yes, but the

capability is immense. problem solve if imagine a European there is there is a old age in Europe and you need to solve for their healthcare tracking and positioning and

requirements. So a call center can evolve to become a healthcare provider because they can track the local knowledge of that country and the nuance of that country and remotely somebody

can humanly look at it and confirm yes you should take that action and that capability can only happen in a country that is embracing the change and embracing the technology. It is not a

question of whether there will be AIEL job reduction. It is rather a question of there will be AIEL abundance and are you on the riding the wave or are you getting victimized on the wave. I

remember 2010 when this country had feature phones. I remember the business model that I used to run was feature phone le value added services business ringtone ring back tone many of you

might have been the customer and you remember that and I want to tell you one thing I was going for IPO in 2010 and the challenge was that what will happen to the future forward because the

smartphone I had seen in US and I was uncomfortable that we should do an IPO at that point of time because I was like the business model is going to change yes the world had not seen but I knew it

that the ringtone will no more be a business model and the power of capability of smartphone was not about that there will be PCD feature for ringtone

and that is the power of AI that you should look at it and that is the capability that Indians will look at it some of us will embrace it at a ability and capability that we can extend and

deliver even further set of capabilities that are not yet seen and reached within ourselves and some of us will feel that we are victim of the capability this machine gives and that

is the change my friend always continuous in the world and I think the India and the land of Gita which has told that change is the only constant in the world will not only embrace it and

lead it but it will lead from the front and show the world the ability and capabilities of AI that will show up so ladies and gentlemen I'm very proud to be in the country

where We today are talking and the center of universe of AI gravity is and from here onwards we will instead of looking at AI as a challenger to any problem that we see or any opportunity

that we today yield but to a larger opportunity and larger capability that India will make and all Indian will make India proud. So with this I again and again say the ability of India can only

be underestimated when we all together join our hands and join in the revolution. So I would say this once again join the revolution and change the way India is perceived in the world. And

today our honorable prime minister has shown that the center of gravity of AI is India. Thank you so much guys. Thank you so much Mr. Vijay Shaka Sharma

for that very very energizing address. Let's have a big round of applause for Mr. Sharma, please. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Our next speaker is an artist and business

leader building scaled governance-led institutions across financial services, consumer brands, entertainment and applied AI. As founder of Swatantra Microf, she has built India's second

largest micro finance institution, championing inclusive growth at scale. A director at the Adity Bila Group, she drives innovation and drives transformation across global

enterprises. Ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together to welcome Miss Ana Ba. Standing. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome

Miss Ana. Namaste. Thank you so much for that introduction. Good evening everyone. It is truly an honor to be here today.

In his May 2011 address to the British Parliament, President Obama said, and I quote, "I am told that the last three speakers here have been the Pope, Her Majesty, the Queen, and Nelson Mandela,

which is either a very high bar or the beginning of a very funny joke." unquote. Even though I am no President Obama, I feel something similar standing before you this evening.

Being in the company of leaders like our honorable prime minister Modi Gi, Sundar Pay, Rishi Sunak, Sam Alman, MKkesh Amani, Narayan Morti and my father to name a few. This for sure is a very high

bar that I will surely not reach. I am very nervous and this is clearly not a joke. Under the leadership of our honorable prime minister, it has been

extraordinary to watch India step into a driving role in the global AI discourse. As a young leader, I feel extremely grateful to have this platform and I feel that it is our responsibility to

make sure that we deliver. India's journey from a $4 trillion economy to a $40 trillion economy in the ark that stretches from where we are today to the vixid bharat we aspire to

be by 2047. Technology will play a decisive role. This moment carries a similar taste to that of the industrial revolution, a period where the relationship between

human labor and economic output was fundamentally rewritten. And yet I would argue that what we are witnessing today is even more profound. The industrial revolution amplified our

physical capabilities. AI is amplifying our cognitive ones. What we are living through is nothing less than a Cambrian explosion of possibilities.

A phase where entire entirely new forms of value and new modes of human potential are emerging at a pace that defies our linear thinking. We are standing at a seinal moment in the

history of human progress. A moment of extraordinary possibilities. In our humble attempt to translate these possibilities into reality, I am here to introduce Bir AI Labs.

When it comes to the Aditya group and AI, I want to be clear. My father has been at this for a while. deliberately, quietly and steadily not for the spectacle but to deliver tangible value

to our stakeholders. BiraLa AI labs has a dual mandate. The first is to service my father's direction and act as an apex AI body for the Adita Birala group building

solutions alongside our business tech teams to unlock new value across our businesses. The second is to operate as a frontier research lab doing ongoing original research at cutting edge and

translating that science into proprietary AI products for the open market. This dual positioning gives Berla AI labs a rare advantage. Real world data

domain knowhow and enterprisecale deployment through the group paired with the freedom to build category defining products for global markets. Let me share what this looks like in practice.

As a part of our first mandate driven by my father, we are executing AI deployment across the Adabila group. The group has been operational for the last 160 plus years and we have decades of

operational data across manufacturing, financial services, commodities, consumer businesses and a growing bench of talent that understands both the science and the business giving us an

undeniable moat. With a $120 billion market cap operating across 42 countries with over 250,000 employees, we are witnessing tangible early gains across our diverse portfolio

as advanced analytics and AI reshape everything from supply chains to workforce management. Let me start with Bir Estates. We will be using AI to compress project concept

timelines by 90%. Freeing over 2,000 man days a year. The immediate impact is efficiency. Architects and developers are no longer constrained by the time it takes to test

an idea. Contract intelligence tools will now give our teams a unified, accurate view of every agreement, flagging potential claims before they escalate.

Moving into financial services and the transformation takes a completely different shape. Adita Capital has built one of the most ambitious gen AI programs in India's financial sector not

by picking a single use case but by going after the entire value chain at once. Underwriting turnaround time is down 50%. Credit assessment preparation has been

cut by 90%. A fully AI enabled sales program is already targeting more than hund00 million in gross sales. While the customer service platform is pushing

first call resolution beyond 90%. What makes this remarkable is not any individual number. It is the concurrence. Then there is hindalo.

And here the story shifts register entirely. This is about applying intelligence in one of the most physically demanding energy inensive industries in the world. On the shop

floor, our proprietary factory intelligence integrates 24 operational KPIs in real time, turning what were once static spreadsheets into a living intelligence layer that surfaces

anomalies before they escalate. And what we are building is more ambitious still. a digital twin for our smelters and furnaces and an AI layer on top that will orchestrate the entire coal source

to power ecosystem. But if there is one place in our portfolio where AI feels most consequential, most human, it is for Tantra, our micro finance business. Here

we are embedding AI across sales, audit and quality control and we expect it to unlock at least 30% in productivity gains. It means a loan officer can reach more people. It means a woman in a

village gets access to capital that she would not have had access to otherwise. That kind of efficiency does not just improve margins. It has the potential to improve lives.

The consumer businesses brings this completely full circle. I have come to believe through my experience that to build great brands today product must be backed by contentdriven distribution.

Our fashion, retail and jewelry businesses are deploying AI for hyperpersonalized marketing and real-time inventory intelligence within BRA cosmetics. Our brand Love etc. and

contraband are using AI creativity tools to move from campaign ideation to final asset delivery at a fraction of the traditional cost. What this tells me is that the question

is no longer whether AI can work in complex capital inensive realworld industries. We have seen it and we know it can. The real question is how fast and how deep should we go given the

ambiguity that surrounds artificial Now onto our second mandate and this is where Biri Labs operates as a frontier research lab. The conviction here is simple. India's next great institution

will emerge at the intersection of deep research, applied engineering and market creation. That is our northstar. To do this, we have assembled a global team of researchers and engineers from

Oxford and IIT Madras to bits, Pilani, ISRO, Google and Goldman Sachs. Our first major research vertical is in structure structured foundational models. A field that a recent Forbes

article estimates at a $600 billion market opportunity. Often overlooked, a vast majority of the world's data sits in time series and tabular formats. Stock prices, sensor

readings, supply chain signals, weather patterns, energy consumptions, patient vitals. This data could actually power predictive intelligence in industry, in finance, in infrastructure, in

healthcare. In December, our teams was in Europe in San Diego where our paper time to time was accepted. It asks a very provocative question. Do these time series foundational models

actually understand what a market crash is or are they just fitting curves? A researcher showed that you can reach inside a model's hidden states, inject the signature of a historical crash, and

watch the forecast shift accordingly. This is not curfew fitting. This is a model that has learned something about the structure of the world. Our researchers are working at that

frontier. This thesis for Berilla AI labs has been presented at the Oxford AI summit and the world summit AI in the Netherlands in 2025.

This lab has built is building I would say a credible global research presence presenting at top venues partnering with leading institutions and attracting talent that could work anywhere in the

world but has chosen to build for India. A second research vertical is one that I believe the industry has a moral obligation to pursue. AI now mediates the everyday decisions,

relationships and information environments of over 1.7 billion people worldwide. Yet the study of what this does to human cognition, agency and daily life remains

nent. We at Bir AI labs want to do something about this. We conducted a study with Delhi University students to measure how language model usage affects curiosity and cognitive agency among

students. The results of this study will be presented at King's College this June. This is the kind of research that industry too often leaves to others. But

I believe that those of us who are building AI have a responsibility to understand its human consequences not as an afterthought but as a core part of the enterprise. Alongside the

research, we are also building tools. In December 2024, we launched a beta version of an AI native research and productivity platform at IIT Bombay, combining a Gentic Search, real-time

data processing and multimodal intelligence to deliver contextual insights across the internet, documents, and financial data. That platform is now being used across my own office to drive

day-to-day efficiency. It is a tangible example of what happens when frontier research meets applied deployment and that is exactly the loop that we at Burla AI labs are designed to close.

This approach building at the frontier while staying rooted in real world application is not new to us. The Aditya group's history has been very intertwined with the story of our

nation. My forefathers have built through every chapter of India's journey through independence, through liberalization, through globalization.

Ours is a history of reading the moment, adapting with conviction and building institutions that outlast the disruptions that gave birth to them in the first place.

This century of building has given us something very invaluable. A muscle memory for navigating tectonic shifts. The generations before me, my brother and my sister have learned to read the

early tremors. To invest before consensus forms and to build for decades rather than just quarters. Every generation of our group has faced a moment where the old playbook had to be

rewritten. What is different today is the elements of high ambiguity and uncertainty which if we look at closely can give rise to can give rise to immense opportunity.

And that is precisely what makes this moment so thrilling and so consequential. But here is what I have come to believe very very strongly. No single

institution, no matter how large or how well resourced, can navigate this epoch alone. The journey from 4 trillion to 40 trillion dollars will not be powered by industry acting in isolation. It will

require something way more fundamental. It will require us to build an ecosystem that brings academia, industry and policy into genuine sustained collaboration.

As India writes its AI chapter, we intend to be on the front lines. Not as observers, not as fast followers, but as honest and true, responsible builders of technology, of institutions, and of the

ecosystem this country needs to lead. And we will do so with utmost responsibility. The playbook for what comes next has not yet been written. and at the Adita

Birala group and at Bira AI labs we look forward to writing it together. Thank you all so very much. It's been an honor. Thank you so much Miss Na. Your the

conviction in your words was uh truly inspiring and of course it demonstrated the bold vision as well. Congratulations for the launch of Brila AI Labs 2 ladies and gentlemen. Now I would like to

welcome our next speaker Mr. Takahito Tokita, president and chief executive officer of Fujitsu. This company has been at the frontier of computing for decades and under Takahito

Tokita's leadership. The company is making a bold pivot towards AIdriven digital transformation. From quantum computing to enterprises AI solutions, Fujitsu represents Japan's commitment to

remaining a global technology leader. Takahito Tokita, the president and CEO of Fujitsu. Hello Hello everyone. I'm Takaha Fujitsu.

It's very honor to share our vision for AI to you all of you and today. Thank you very much. For 40 years,

Pujitu has pioneered AI from research and development to practical application. I will provide an overview of our technology

and social commitment. Following my remarks, our CTO Vbec Mahajin details and our AI strategy and powerful technologies that underpin it. At Fujit, our purpose is to make the

world more sustainable by building trust in society through innovation. This single purpose guides our management, inspires our people and shapes our every

product and the technologies and services we create. Our story began in 1935. We started by making communication equipment and

this expertise led to Japan's first computers in 1950s. Since then we have powered economic growth with our critical technology and services.

This long journey of innovation led to K computers and Hugaku two of worldclass superco computers. This journey continue as we now develop highly power efficient CPUs and pioneer

the field of quantum computing. We are on track to develop 1,000 cubit machine by the end of March 2027. Through Thank you. throughout our history, one thing has

remained constant, our focus on people. This human centric philosophy has guide us as we adapt to the changing need for society

to create a sustainable future. We focus our research and development development on the five key technologies areas computing, networking,

AI, data and security and combining technology that brings them all them Based on this strong technology foundation, we are working closely with

our partners and customers across all to cocreate solutions and address social issues and challenges as a key driver. AI is a key driver these challenges. To

fully integrate AI into our society and businesses, a powerful and trusted AI infrastructure is essential. Yes. Therefore, we have been working closely

with the also and Japanese government on the research and development and supercomput and quantum computing. So, and uh AI and is needed the powerful computing power.

Our vision for an AIdriven society is precise. AI must not be a force that replace people or becomes a street to human autonomy. Its foundation,

its fundamental law must be to augment the human capability that are uniquely human. our creativity, our critical thinking and our complex

judgment. We are deeply committed to working with leaders across all industries, pioneering researchers in academia and government bodies worldwide.

With these strong partnerships, we can collaborate collectively establish the standards, ethics and governance needed to ensure that I AI constantly serves the best interest of humanity.

We believe Japan would have been an ideal host for this AI summit. We would be delighted to welcome you all to our country to discuss the future

society we can create with AI together. Now I'd like to introduce our CTO Vbec Mahajin. Thank you. Can can I can I go back to the presentation please?

Okay. So um as Tuktasan mentioned about the u the key key technologies Fujitsu I I think for all of you um that probably are not very familiar as you mentioned we have a long history on

this and and the key areas that we are focused on are pretty much to enable AI and and for AI you need three things. You need the compute, you need the networks and you need the

AI software, right? And our goal is we are heavily focused as Tokita mentioned on the on the sustainable society and we are focused on giving an option for sovereign AI.

This is completely made in Japan technology and we find ourselves at a very interesting point in history where Fujitsu is an option for companies that are looking for technologies that is

often non-American and I'll give you a brief glimpse into what we do. So next month we'll be rolling out world's first two nanometerbased ARM processor CPUs on

servers uh and that and those will be the first ones. This is a highly power efficient processor that is focused on data centers and confidential computing. In October last year, Jensen Hang from

Nvidia, Tokasan and myself, we announced 20 exoscale supercomput that will be rolled out in 2029 that will be based again on the world's first 1.4 nanometer CPU

and that is very important because you are looking at highly power efficient machines that are driving very strong calculations. Now this is focused on defense, government, healthcare,

finance, manufacturing. Something I think that would be very beneficial to country like India. The other part of computing is quantum. For all of you,

you might not be aware, but at this point in time, the world's number one quantum road map is driven by us. It is a 250 logical cubit machine with 10,000 cubits that would be rolled out in 2030.

And next month, if you come to Japan, Kawasaki, we have a huge tower that will hold the world's first 1,00 cubit machine. This is very important for AI. As you go quantum and HPC together,

fused together with a software stack. That's what will drive the compute for next generation AI and applications. and Fujitsu gives you an option to do that.

The other part is networks and there are two paths photonix and wireless. Now you've seen what's happened with memory. The prices have gone up six times in last one year and same with

photonix. What we offer is highly power efficient as as was mentioned in Tokasan's address, environmental friendly, low latency,

long range transmission. It's a 1.6 terabyte switch that is goes up to,000 kilometers and we'll be coming out with 3.2 TB switch. This is what you need to power data

centers, connect data centers. So you have the compute and then you need to connect those And this is again powered by the software stack. By the way, a lot of

this work and R&amp;D for the network software stack and the quantum and Mona is done in Bangalore. So I'll I'll again you know summarize with two keypads right. So we are

focused on being the sovereign AI platform. Yesterday PM Modi mentioned right and and Minister Vashn have said it's not about only about large language models. You are not going to need a

large language model if you're in defense. You need something that drives at the edge. Same with healthcare. You're not going to put those records to be

accessed by everybody. And that's what we are aiming for. We are talking about privacy, flexibility, domain specific security. That's the triangle we bring together powered by

security and the areas this is uh this we believe is very very going to be is going to be very relevant for everybody in the world and that's a stake that we took at Fujisu to focus on Japan but I

think now we roll this out outside and and we're partnering with different vendors here um both Nvidia and AMD are very close partners with us we use their GPU we use our CPU I mentioned Monaka

it's a 2566 core Monaka X and there's 28 core with NP on it. We partner with Oracle. We pocket with Loheed Martin on defense. Uh super micro for servers, Arcus for networks, Yasawa Focon

robotics. We are taking this where we see this is going to physical AI at the edge drive compute and AI and networks. That's where it conflicts combines together and that's how end users will

use AI in robots. In three years, four years now you will have androids, you will have uh humanoids and you drones your iPhones this will be completely changed but the power of compute and

networks and the software that combines together. I think that confluence is going to happen very soon. Uh and uh and this is sovereign and security is going to be extremely important and I believe

there's a great opportunity for us all to work together in this space. Thank We extend our sincere thanks to Mr. Takahito Tokita, the chief executive officer and Mr. Mahajajin, the chief

technology officer of Fujitsu. Ladies and gentlemen, we are now left with two final events of the summit and they are like showstoppers to the whole summit. We have one keynote speaker who is the

deputy chief of the army staff of India. And before that we are going to have the final panel of the day which is bringing together some of India's most influential technology leaders. You can

say it is a highowered panel. Ladies and gentlemen, let me introduce the panelists to you. We have Mr. Salil Parik who is the chief executive officer of Infosys

and he has led the company through a remarkable period of reinvention placing AI at the center of the strategy for clients across the globe. We also have as our panelist Mr. Kitivasan chief

executive officer of Tata Consultancy Services. Mr. C Vijay Kumar who is the CEO and managing director of HCL technologies. We also have Miss Arundati Bhachara,

chairperson and chief executive officer of Salesforce India. And we have the panel which is being moderated by none other than Mr. Amitab Khan, the former chief executive officer of NITO, one of

the architects of India's modern industrial and digital policy. I request all our panelists to kindly take their place on the stage. With a big round of applause, kindly welcome the panelists

of the last panel of AI impact summit 2026. Mr. Salil Parik, Mr. Kritasan, Mr. Cvijay Kumar and Miss Arundati Bhtachara with the moderator Mr. Amitab

Kant. A big loud applause ladies and gentlemen to welcome them all to the stage. Well, it's over to you Mr. Amitab Khan. So let me welcome these uh very

distinguished uh leaders of the Indian IT text service industry and we have with us Arundati Bhachara who's both a banker and a great tech leader. Now uh the three of them amongst them uh they

are leaders of an industry that represents over 300 billion in market value over 25 lakh cr and they employ millions of Indians. We are actually meeting at a point of uh

disruption. I'm not going to take much time in introducing the panel or I'm not going to take much time in giving my own introduction. I will straight away move

uh uh to asking them questions and then open it up to all of you so that you can ask the question. I'll try and start with uh uh the lady in the panel and I'll also try and end with the lady in

the panel Arundati Bhachara who's probably uh the most distinguished of us all. Uh so let me Arundati let me uh try and be as direct as possible. Uh so Salesforce

has uh lost roughly about 40% of its market value in just 12 months. A single AI product launch wiped almost 285 billion of SAS stocks in a day. The market is saying that AI agents will

replace per seat software subs subsystems. Is the market wrong or is the traditional SAS model genuinely under threat? And what does that mean for

thousands of Indian enterprises that have been that have built their uh operations on Salesforce platform? &gt;&gt; Uh first and foremost, thank you very much for asking that question. I've been

answering that question so many times in the last few days that it's almost like rehearsed, you know, as to how I should go about it. But having said that, you know, markets will see a lot of things.

Not all of it comes through. And when you talk about the SAS model, it's not only about VIP coding. It's not only about creating an application. It's also about, you know, understanding what the

workflows are like. It's about realizing what the customers pain points are and ensuring that you are addressing those particular pain points. It's about observability about what your agents are

doing. It's about governance. It's about auditability. It's about adoption. There are so many pieces to making something really work in an organization that to just say that because I can wipe code

that means you know everything else goes out of the window. I think that's being a little too uh you know little too hasty about totally uh you know rejecting a way of doing business. uh

also I must say that uh uh you know which I'm not very true is correct but people have to sometimes pump up values given the kind of money that is going in over there and by the way some of that

money is circular money that's going in over there so I'm not too sure that the market is actually giving the right message that it should and like for everything that the market gives people

investors especially are requested to read the fine print and obviously you know exercise their discretion in the matter. Having said that uh is it true that the models that we have today will

remain exactly the same? They won't. I'm very clear about one thing which is that all of the models that we have today and I mean not the LLM models but I mean the models of working the ways of working

whether it be in the in respect of the SAS companies or it be in respect of any of the other companies even infra companies or any of the other companies things will change and we have to be

very agile about the way we look at these things and realize where are the changes going to come and how can we ourselves uh you know change in tune so as to remain relevant so as to remain uh

not only you know to so as to be able to actually add value to your customer end of the day people who add value are the ones who are going to stay who are going to survive who are going to be

sustainable and therefore adding value is what we need to do and for adding value whatever it it it takes for us to do we need to do those things. So I think you know the jury is out and will

remain out for a while because the race is on and we don't know who's going to win the race. But this much I do know that you know it will not be one individual unit or one individual kind

of unit. There will be very many players in this whole thing. But at the end of it all, as long as it improves our standards of living, as long as it gives us uh results and answers which we never

had before, it is for the good of humanity and I hope that will definitely Thank you. Thank you for that uh very uh detailed answer to that question. I now turn to Mr. Christi Vashan uh the CEO of

uh TCS. Mr. Vasan, the industry consensus is that uh AI will shift work from writing code to orchestrating AI systems. What does uh TCS look like to you in

2030? What will be the headcount and what will be the revenue per employee and how is uh how's TCS communicating that transition to its workforce and to the country? Thank you and uh good

afternoon to everyone. uh see this is the topic that everyone has been discussing in the last few days and few weeks and u like Arundi explained like the market has also has been

contemplating but uh there will be few things that will change many things may not change or the other like uh if you look at uh the role of what most of us do as a system integrator

the role of system integrators come into play because there are complex systems and many of them have lot of legacy and you it's not that uh one day you can have a LLM understand everything and

autogenerate code and the software engineers will go away but not to say like said there will be more and more productivity that will be brought in and uh at the same time you need system

integrators who can test validate verify what is being generated and so that's one part of it the second is as you also look at today the role will shift towards more and more requirements

engineering context engineering how do How do you know whether you are building the right system? How do you validate whether system is doing the right thing? Does it have cyber security? Does it do

some harm? All those things are to be validated. You you may not know all the roles that you will have five years down the line. But uh we don't envy such a situation where there will be a

significant shrinkage of hope. The other areas that we have somehow uh not uh looked at when we get excited about uh generating code is for many of the or for instance cloud came into play about

maybe 10 years ago but if you ask most organization they will tell you that 30 40% cloud has been adopted there's so much to be done so this is going to be a long tail and even within that you would

see many organizations they have to prepare for deploying or adopting a it's not a trivial job. They have to get their data estate right. They have to get their applications rationalized,

modernized. So there is a certain amount of work to be done. They need to train their models like uh Aranti was saying or somebody was mentioning like you will have some large models, many small

models in every enterprise. They have to be trained. And the last part of it which you are not again looking at is what is it new that you can do with all these LMS. there'll be many interesting

things somebody has to build somebody has to think through that so if you look at uh 20 another 30 I don't envisage a time that there's a significant shrinkage of work but there will be more

volume of work that will be produced &gt;&gt; more more volume of work &gt;&gt; more volume of work that will be produced and more interesting work that will be done

&gt;&gt; thank you thank you so uh that's an interesting perspective uh I turn to Salil who's the CEO of Inforces. Uh Sal one of the very provocative statements made by uh one of the Bay Area leaders

and investor actually was that uh uh which attracted a lot of news coverage was that services model is dead within five years. uh uh your chairman Nandan Nilikani uh

just I was reading uh in fact I went through his uh interaction and he said that this is this is not an opportunity gap but this is an execution gap and that the real money is in cleaning up

trillions of dollars of legacy tech debt. Who is right? Is Nandan right or is it this Bay Area leader? Who's right according to you? &gt;&gt; Well, that's an easy answer. Nandan's of

course right. There's no question. &gt;&gt; So simply because he's your chairman &gt;&gt; because I think Nandan I think I mean but I'm sure everyone has a view. Nandan is a visionary who who has a view on

this this business for years. I think the way we see it is uh and we shared this a few days ago. There are several areas of opportunity that come from AI services. Uh and there are six that we

have highlighted uh recently just just a few days ago and those in aggregate we have uh shared some data uh are about $300 billion of opportunity over the next several years. And then we've gone

into a little bit uh uh of the detail in need. So I'll give just a couple of examples. There's one which is like AI engineering which is the building of agents, orchestrating integrating some

of the points what Kiti was mentioning. There's another which you alluded to how Nandan has said it of legacy modernization which is basically saying there were some things which were 15 20

years old with large companies. how can we bring it to the more current and there because of AI agents the cost is lower the time is less and so there's an easier economic rationale for companies

to do it so as we put all these together we see these what we call AI services which will give us the growth and what I think the point you made what Nandan said if we can pivot our company uh to

serve these big six areas has for our clients that that execution part then the opportunity is good and again some data on that like this year uh which will end in March we we have recruited

20,000 college graduates next year we are on track and we've announced we are recruiting 20,000 college graduates this year our headcount has increased in the first three quarters by 13,000 people

and my sense is that will continue so what it's opening up really is new set of opportunities and there is some productivity benefit that comes with if uh like specifically

in infosys but I'm sure in general if we execute and and serve our clients there will be more opportunity there. &gt;&gt; So uh tell me do you at any stage aspire uh to own intellectual property in the

AI stack or will you remain a builder for hire? So there the the approach I'll speak a little bit for Infosys. Uh our approach is we have tremendous IP. So like in AI we built this IP layer called

Topaz fabric which has the ability for our clients to work with any of the foundation models plus the agents that we have built that Infosys has built plus any third party agents. So that's

the layer that we are let's say pretty good at and that we will build and continue to build the IP on uh that that's the approach on the IP that we've taken.

&gt;&gt; Okay. Okay. Uh uh CVK let me uh turn to you because HCL Tech uh has a software uh product business. It has a design custom AI chips in Bangalore and you operate across the full stack actually.

Uh is HCL Tech positioning as an AI builder at any stage and if so how far up the stack are you willing to go into models into compute into infrastructure uh that at any stage will compete uh

with the hyperscalers rather than just partner with them. Uh thank you and good evening everyone and um HCltech uh I mean as you kind of gave some pointers we are uniquely

placed uh because first of all we have a software product business which delivers uh 10% of our revenue and uh we also have a very deep engineering heritage uh where we service

top 50 of the 100 R&amp;D these spenders uh doing a lot of work including some cutting edge work like we have built a 2 nanometer custom silicon for one of the technology companies. So we have these

unique uh capabilities and this also reflected in our uh high highest revenue per employee amongst the IT services companies. So with this backdrop we are uh our AI strategy is one of them is

heavily indexed on building uh because uh of course I mean our core is services we will continue to modernize and evolve our services to be relevant for the future and even if it means it takes

away some revenue streams we are proactively doing it but I think the biggest focus is there are these large language models and the foundational they cannot be applied most efficiently

for enterprise use cases. There is still a gap between what a foundation model can deliver and what is the ultimate efficiency and innovation that's possible. So we are really trying to

bridge the gap and building IPS that will bridge the gap which helps enterprises to scale uh air adoption and we're also focused on a lot of specialized services like even Salil

mentioned like physical AI AI factory uh agentic AI all of this new solutions we are very focused on and of course the partnership ecosystem becomes extremely critical. So we are partnering with

almost all the large uh solution providers. Uh I don't think we are building anything to become a hyperscaler. I think we missed the bus many many years ago and we're not

building models but we building solutions which will make the models much more scalable and applicable within enterprises. &gt;&gt; Thanks. Thanks. Uh thanks for that. I

just wanted to turn to Mr. Christie Vasan because he's the biggest employer in India. He employs over 600,000 engineers uh that you know India produces uh millions of engineering

graduates uh a year and many of them are trained for exactly the kind of work AI is now going to automate in a very big way. Uh what should be our skilling strategy of this country? I mean how do

we do reskilling and skilling at a at a individual level or should we do it at a national country level? I mean what what is the view of India's leading CEO on in terms of skilling and reskilling? This

is to my mind a major national challenge. &gt;&gt; It's a challenge and opportunity &gt;&gt; because last in fact uh three days ago. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Here we ran a workshop with

about,500 kids from all the schools in the NCR region. Most of them or in fact all of them have non-technical background and many of them could not even speak or not fluent in English

&gt;&gt; and we developed we taught them how to use their native language, how to do coding and in fact within a span of about uh 3 hours almost,500 apps were built. So that's the power of a okay you

can you can you can worry about uh what the entry a is going to take away the jobs at the entry level I think a also enables all these people to develop and imagine new areas where software can

make the lives of people better and it creates more and more opportunity you can be afraid and not do anything I think we should be forward leaning and train as many people as possible in fact

all three of us are working with the ministry of IT in ex creating the curriculum for the students coming coming up in the all these universities. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Wonderful. Uh thanks thanks

for that uh very positive and constructive perspective. uh Arundat Gi just uh let me turn to you again and ask you if u AI is to drive India's productivity.

It cannot remain uh just a fortune 500 story. Uh how do we make AI tools accessible to millions of MSME? Uh how do we raise productivity? How do we build for the market? Uh even if uh unit

economics looks slightly different from enterprise contracts, how do we scale it up in a big way for MSME to make the difference to Indian economy? Uh so thank you for that question because I

personally believe that unless we can democratize any technology uh it doesn't really serve the purpose of that country or for that people and AI is something that is not meant for the white collar

worker alone in fact it's one of the things that can actually empower the blue collar just as you were talking Mr. Kitasan it can actually empower the bluecollar workers. Now if you look at

the bluecollar workers we in fact in niti we did one report uh taking into account the blueco collar workers like carpenters, plumbers, hospitality workers, anganari workers. So a lot of

these uh you know personas we had taken and what we realized is that they have a multiple challenges. One challenge of course is uh the way that they have been uh skilled. So they

have a skilling challenge but more than skilling challenge they have an access challenge in the sense that they may be very wellkilled but they don't know that the job exists within the village or in

the next village. So they have an access challenge. The second thing that they have is the challenge of ensuring that they are getting paid on time. Even that is not available. Okay. So they have

several challenges of this nature that of skilling that of access that of payments that of ensuring that they are parts of communities which actually enable them to be supported during times

of distress or during times of need. So many of these are actually challenges that can be solved if we can create use AI in the proper way in a proper marketplace to get the right kind of uh

you know the right kind of um opportunities to them the right kind of certifications to them right kind of assessment of their skills to them. If all of this can be done, actually

speaking, we will be doing the country enormous favor. And you will find that the quality of life of not only these people, but the quality of the of life that you know that they serve, of the

people they serve, people you know who are actually taking their services even that is going to become much much better. So I think you know EI is not something that is meant only for the

white collar workers or for people in tier one tier 2 cities. It's meant formemes. It's meant for the MSMES. It is what is going to empower them to get into a league which they were not able

to access earlier. It is also meant for the bluecollar workers because it can empower all of them. &gt;&gt; Uh Sal we've had a India has done something unique in digital public

infrastructure. It's been transformational in terms of identity payment uh credit uh uh you know the bank of international settlement said that India achieved in 7 years what it

would have taken 50 years to achieve. How do we create a DPI a digital public infrastructure for artificial intelligence? How do we take computing power to the common citizen? How do we

scale? How do we uh make a difference using the power of AI? uh uh &gt;&gt; no absolutely I think there's already work going on uh specifically there are three big areas where uh there's uh

thinking going on there's actual projects on the ground in agriculture in health care uh in making sure that everything that is being done for education uh is helping within the

country for the citizens uh also in that area there are examples where we have shown some of it and now the way that as you mentioned the the India stack or the digital public

infrastructure was created where essentially it was fully available without exorbitant cost or any cost is what the approach is being driven today. uh there are various components of the

architecture which are being discussed uh and working closely with the ministry with the government those will be rolled out today. Of course you have seen that there's tremendous support at the chip

layer, at the data center layer, at the infra layer and now there will be more at the architecture how it can be distributed and at least these three big areas agriculture, education, healthcare

are being looked at today. Um, thanks thanks uh CVK one last question before I open it up to the floor. you know the hyperscalers Microsoft,

Google, Amazon, they're spending close to about 600 billion this year alone on AI infrastructure uh spending almost about uh close to 50 to 55%

on uh capex and if AI services opportunity is really in the range of about 350 to 400 billion uh can Indian IT companies can all of you together uh capture it uh without

adequate R&amp;D uh does it not require greater level of R&amp;D intensity and uh what does what will it take all of you to put in more resources into R&amp;D for the future? Yes. Uh first of all uh uh

this big capex spend also triggers a lot of services spend like building all these data centers AI factories uh the entire infrastructure landscape that's there IT infrastructure landscape in the

world would get refreshed over the next 5 to 8 years that's itself is a huge services opportunity then there is this physical AI it's a completely new spend today there is very very little physical

AI deployed in the world. I it's believed that one of the studies by Zeno says it's a trillion dollar opportunity and that would mean at least $200 billion of services opportunity. So I

think we are looking at some very big services opportunities and even to really encash on this big services opportunities uh the companies like us will need to invest in building

solutions because it's not straightforward services you need to build solutions and which will mean we will have to put in more money into R&amp;D right building solutions and

building labs and kind of PC's a a lot of pre-work needs to be done and uh and also there is a lot of opportunities to create solutions which will really make the uh foundational models much more

scalable for enterprise. So I personally believe we should increase the R&amp;D spend and uh I do think the industry model will support us because as more and more AI is infused more outcome based

contracts would come which also helps us to deliver a higher profitability and uh which means we we can very comfortably invest more in R&amp;D uh but the timing of that we might need to invest a little

ahead of the curve before where the real benefits come. &gt;&gt; Okay. Wonderful. Wonderful to hear this perspective. I'm going to open it up to for the to this house. Uh we'll ask

about I'll open it up for five questions. Uh please name yourself. Uh just be very direct and blunt. Uh please don't ask long winding questions. Uh to the point, very matterof fact. Uh all

young people, any ladies here will be given preference. Uh the lady there Yeah, the lady here. &gt;&gt; Hello everyone. Uh, thank you so much for giving me opportunity. Uh,

&gt;&gt; no introduction, just name and shoe. &gt;&gt; Mana Sharma, CEO of Monoi. Uh, saving my two years to reach out to you from here till here. First question, how can I come and meet you as a young

entrepreneur 27 years with no network? My first question, saving my lot of marketing money. Second question is as a young Indian 27 year old coming from a small town but being in Bangalore for 7

years. What is your um view or idea that we can be work with you guys and your support and mentorship so that India young India can go somewhere else and we can also you know go to like show the

Silicon Valley that 25 year 27 year standing here in a suit talking to you can do something. &gt;&gt; Okay. uh you know I've allowed uh two questions because she's a lady but no

two questions uh I we'll ask the five questions and then I'll open it up for responses. Second, uh there was a lady there. You want go ahead? &gt;&gt; My name is Davi Karavo. I'm from my UK

uh University of Le trying to do the stage for AI creative education and art, health and well-being concept and how the case study can be presented in six month time

and I would like to co-create and collaborate with you. &gt;&gt; Okay. Uh anyone at the back? Yeah, go ahead. No, no, please. There. Yeah. Yeah. The the blue blue shirt. Get up

and ask. &gt;&gt; My name is Navna. Call and I have a three-part question. &gt;&gt; No one. &gt;&gt; Uh just ask one question. Question.

Three in one. &gt;&gt; Three in one. &gt;&gt; No. No. Don't ask three in one. Ask one question. &gt;&gt; One question.

&gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; How will AI create jobs? What kind of jobs? And what kind of skills do we need? you you asking the question which I've already asked.

&gt;&gt; I want the panelist to answer very specifically and directly. &gt;&gt; All right. Uh anyone at the back that side? Yeah, that gentleman there.

Uh hello uh Kishla here and uh my question is as a uh as any employee who is currently in the IT sector what skills he should plan to develop in next 5 years to boost his employability.

&gt;&gt; Okay. Uh no no not front row back. I want to go right at the back. Anybody ride at the back? Uh some back bencher. Huh? Who's who's the backest P? Yeah,

that gentleman in the black suit. Yeah, go ahead. Ask. Yeah. Yeah. Shoot. &gt;&gt; Yeah, please. Sir, sir, my name is Herzswhan. My question is, what can be done to stop misuse of AI? For example,

some people use Grock to undress people. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, one last question to that. Yeah. Shoot in one line. Just shoot. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Namaste. Intentionally I'm speaking

one line. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. I welcome sir. I a software architect. I a founder of a startup called startup sanatana. Though we are talking about so much of AI and AI is

the limelight. Unless and otherwise we built on AI on our culture rich culture tradition heritage kind of thing. probably it will be kind of thing. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you.

&gt;&gt; So we've got the question. We got the question. Now I'll open it up. I'll uh starting from uh uh we'll start with Arandati's response and then move on. you can you can respond to one of the

questions and then uh in respect of the question that this lady uh gave and also others who are startups in this particular organization uh Salesforce has a very vibrant startup community. Uh

the lady who leads it for us her name is Rupa Arvinduan. Uh her uh coordinates are available on our website. Please get in touch with her. she will get you in touch with our entire community. The

community is supported to uh develop on Salesforce and also you know to ensure that you can take your product to market. So all of that is done. So please you are most more than welcome to

communicate with us and get whatever support we can definitely give you. &gt;&gt; Maybe I'll take up the question on what skills are needed in the future. uh I think there is a big misconception that

software coding programming skills are not going to be relevant. I think the fundamental conceptual skills in software development programming is is very very essential uh if you really

want to build a long-term career in the software industry. It could be in services or in product companies or AI. All of that requires sound programming skills. The second aspect is I think

just the critical thinking, analytical skills. How do you really orchestrate work? A lot of standard work that many of you do or the initially the younger engineers do some of that or a lot of it

can be done with the uh AI tools that are there today. But how can you now think of yourself as an orchestrator and deliver maybe four or five times the output that you would deliver without

these tools right I think just orchestrating the work with multiple coding agents I think that's really a skill you're you're while you may take three four years to manage a small team

but on day one you have an opportunity to manage several agents to deliver an outcome which is 5x of what you would normally do that's just an example and that's how you need to think of every

role uh you can amplify the value that you can create using AI skills &gt;&gt; Mr. Christ &gt;&gt; there was this question once again about will A take away jobs or will A my view

is uh it was it's been discussed for the last few days eventually A will create more jobs than destroy jobs and you would find but it may not all of them need not be programming jobs that will

be jobs of different categories different classifications but uh on the whole we find it's going to create more jobs and create more employment &gt;&gt; s thanks uh I think there was a question

really focus on can we build AI with the views of our culture or views of responsibility and that's absolutely essential. Uh we we've also put together and I know many others have a framework

on responsible AI. Uh and there were a couple of questions which sort of were on that line. It's absolutely critical. So in fact the way the agents are built the way the foundation models data is uh

the way they learn all of that needs this approach of responsible AI and that's the approach that we've uh recommended many others are working on it and as a overall industry we should

focus on that and that will give us as good an outcome as we can get and even that after that outcome we will have to refine and modify but responsible AI is critical in

Thank you. Uh so ladies and gentlemen, we've heard uh the captains of the industry. Uh we are in the midst of disruption as I said, but these leaders bring great optimism. They bring hope

and according to them actually uh the wave of AI will end up creating many more jobs for India. But there'll be jobs of a different kind and we need to skill oursel for the new emerging jobs

of tomorrow. But with these leaders, I'm absolutely confident that India will ride this wave to greater progress and prosperity as it becomes a Vix bat in by 2047. It'll create many many more jobs

and these leaders will drive India to a 30 plus trillion dollar economy with jobs in the coming years. Thank you very much ladies. Ladies and gentlemen, we extend our

deepest gratitude to our distinguished panelists for their compelling discussion and dynamic exchange of ideas on India and AI. Your collective wisdom has truly elevated today's conversations

and your insights have set the stage for action beyond summit. Ladies and gentlemen, we thank our panelists for enlightening us with all the views and of course a warm thanks to all our

audience as well for raising very important questions which I think concern each and every citizen as well. We thank our panelists once again. I request everyone to please be seated as

we move forward as we I move on to invite the final speaker of the day. Ladies and gentlemen, I request all the photographers and everybody else to please stay away from the stage. Stay

off the stage, please. Stay off the stage, please. We have one final speaker of the summit. Please maintain the decorum. I request everyone, please maintain the decorum. And all the media

groups, please take your bites outside the hall. You're requested to please do as I say. A kind request, ladies and gentlemen. I request all the photographers and the media people to

please move out. &gt;&gt; Excuse me. Let's get it. &gt;&gt; Yes, of course. So, ladies and gentlemen, it is now my

privilege to invite our final speaker of the day, Leftenant General Bipol Shinghal, who is the deputy chief of the army staff for information systems and training. In an era where AI is

transforming not only commerce and governance, but also the nature of conflicts and national security, his perspective is both rare and indispensable. From battlefield

intelligence to logistics and training, the integration of AI into defense is one of the most consequential and most sensitive frontiers of this technology. Left and General Bipur Shingal. Okay,

thank you. Uh firstly, uh let me just say this that you know I know I'm the last speaker of a long day. So I'll uh I'll do this quickly. I'll come to the essentials.

Distinguished guests, leaders of industry and academia, AI innovators, my colleagues in uniform who are also innovators, students, ladies and gentlemen, a very good evening to you

all. It's a priv privilege to be speaking here as a keynote address representing the Indian Army and the Indian Armed Forces. You know 35 years ago when I joined the army as a young

leftand in my first war game unfolded in a room dominated by large paper maps. Information arrived slowly handed notes verbal updates reports from the field taken on telephone. We pieced that

picture together physically marked it on the map using color-coded pins and flags and presented to the commander who then took a decision deliberately and with reflection fully aware that the

adversary was operating within similar timelines. 20 years later, the rhythm began to change. Intelligence became sharper and faster. Operation rooms had a few

screens displaying maps. Presentations moved to PowerPoint. The volume of information increased. Timelines got compressed. But there was still space to pause, breathe, and the UDA cycle could

still breathe. Today, when I walk into an operation rooms, the difference is stark. It's like a Star Wars coming to life. A massive digital display dominates the wall. Inputs stream in

continuously from multiple sensors. Intelligence is fused almost instantly analyzed by AI presenting a living dynamic picture of the battle space. Some of the work we did as left hands is

now automated and the commander knows that the adversary is seeing much the same picture about us at much the same speed. The pressure is not anymore about awareness. It is about decision. Seconds

matter. Hesitation has consequences. In it is in this environment of speed, uncertaintity and time compression that I want to transport you to an operational scenario. During a high

tempo military operation, a senior commander was presented with a machine generated recommendation based on multiple sensor feeds and AI analysis to engage a target immediately.

The system was confident. Uh the probability score of the machine was high. The decision window was measured in seconds. But the commander paused, not because he didn't trust the

technology. His experience told him that something was a miss. He asked a simple question. What does the machine not know? The pause revealed something the algorithm could not see. A civilian

evacuation had just begun minutes earlier, not yet reflected in the data. The machine saw the movement as that of enemy troops, whereas they were civilians. It is even possible that

troops were mixed with the civilians. However, the commander exercised judgment and restraint. The strike was delayed. Innocent lives were spared and the mission was still achieved.

This moment captures a fundamental truth. AI can inform, accelerate and recommend decisions, but only humans can exercise judgment and bear responsibility for them. Yesterday, our

honorable prime minister and many other eminent speakers spoke of the need for guardrails and safety to be built into AI enabled models. In the case of the military, these are not essential but

mandatory as the stakes are much higher. The Indian armed forces operate in a uniquely complex security environment across contested borders, multiple domains, dense populations and high

escalation intensity sensitivity. Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, let me clearly state that we in the defense forces are fully cognizant that artificial intelligence is fundamentally

redefining the modern battle space. Its power in intelligence fusion, surveillance, decision support, maintenance, logistics, and a host of other functions is a force multiplier in

today's multi-dommain battle space. In keeping with the vision of technological transformation, the chief of army staff has formally declared this year as the year of networking and data centricity,

signaling a signaling a deliberate shift towards datadriven operations and AI enabled capabilities. The evolution is powered by many indigenously built applications. Akam AI as a service,

Samadrishti which is a battlefield situational awareness software, Shaki and Aka Akashir which a sensor and shooter fusion. All of these have been built through our collaboration with

industry leaders and startups. Many of the innovators who have been around in this summit for the last few days for this self-reliant transformation. We are open to collaboration with many startups

innovators to build it further. However, we are fully cognizant that this needs to be a responsible development of AI. Allow me to reflect on four four points on this regard.

Firstly, what decisions that AI must not be delegated to must always remain human. Human control has to be institutionalized into law and moral

accountability cannot be with m with the machine. If a machine recommends a decision with 90% accuracy and the commander goes with it and it is a wrong decision, it gives the commander a moral

buffer. But is that correct? Secondly, AI enabled systems are designed to cause harm. Therefore, they must be treated as a weapon and not as a software. The they therefore must be evaluated and tested

in contested field conditions. Remember that the battlefield is a chaotic battle data environment. Sensors get obscured by dust, smoke, deception, and many other things. A system that performs

well in controlled condition but fails in a battlefield condition is not a force multiplier it's a liability. Thirdly trust and sovereignity must get built in the system. The commander

taking a decision based on an AI enabled system but know must know what is the data being used how it has been trained. The black box of data must become a glass box.

And fourthly commanders and staff of today need to be trained about this fast evolving battlefield. As I told you about the operational scenario as it was 30 years ago and it is today in the in a

war game, we need to be able to integrate algorithms, be able to command systems and know how to go go forward. The Indian army is taking steps in training our commander and staff in this

direction. The the next thing that I'd like to say is that in some the nature of war may change but our conscious must not. It is important to recognize that these

concerns about AI safety and governance are not confined to the military domain alone. They are increasingly shaping national policy. The launch of the India AI governance guidelines and the Delhi

declaration during the summit is a pathbreaking step in this direction just happened during this summit. This framework defines AI systems being generative and therefore having

unintended con consequences and this has lessons for us as military planners. At this stage, I would also like to remind ourselves of a historical truth. I do believe in the wisdom of humanity.

Whenever faced with a new crisis, we have responded. The rules governing the use of NBC weapons, the Geneva Convention on Treatment of Prisons of War, the convention on use of landmines

and other such frameworks have stood the test of time and with few exceptions have been followed during conflicts also. In a similar manner, a set of governance frameworks and legal

provisions need to be evolved about use of AI based systems and autonomous weapons. Already under the framework of United Nations, discussions are underway around meaningful human control and

accountability. His excellency the UN Secretary General also talked about various such initiatives just yesterday. While consensus remains complex, the debate

itself reflects a shared concern for autonomy without restraint that would undermine strategic stability. India as a major military power, a growing AI hub and a civilization deeply rooted in

ethical restraint and understanding that shi that is force and dharma that is rightlessness must go hand in hand has both the capacity and the credibility to lead this conversation.

The clear and all encompass encompassing manov vision for AI enunciated by the honorable prime minister in this hall yesterday and emphasizing moral and ethical systems as well as

accountability is the lighthouse that can guide us all for AI to become inclusive, accessible and responsible. Thank you and Jill. Thank you so much Lefting General Vipur

Shingle for that powerful address on AI in defense. The transformative role of AI in defense. We appreciate the words and the address of Lefting General Vipul Shingle. Ladies and gentlemen, you've

heard all the speakers. Now it's my turn to say a few words to conclude this summit. And of course with this last keynote speaker, we come to the end of India AI impact summit. Ladies and

gentlemen, this summit was never about AI for its own sake. It was always about making sure that when we speak of artificial intelligence, we speak of human consequences. The conversations

over these last five days have been bold, candid and of course at times uncomfortable too. That is exactly what it should be because the easy consensus is never the useful one. India convened

the summit with a single belief that the world does not need another conversation about artificial intelligence. It needs a commitment that works for everyone. And over these five days, that belief

has been met with action, with partnerships, with pledges and with a shared resolve that now it is in the hands of every person in this hall to carry it forward. The summit ends today

and with this I Mta Chopra would like to say to you all thank you. Thank you so very much for being a part of this summit online and offline. Of course the work begins now and we are grateful for

your presence, your conviction and your partnership. Thank you everyone. Let's start the action now. Thank you. Namaskar. Jint
