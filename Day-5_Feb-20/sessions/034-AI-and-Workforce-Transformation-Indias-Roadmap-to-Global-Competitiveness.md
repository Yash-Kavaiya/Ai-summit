## 📝 Transcript

President Global Public Policy and Government Affairs Mastercard. Vishnu Ardus, co-founder and MD, Nucleus Software. Sue Dali, director, Tech and Innovation Tech

UK. Thank you so much, Pragya. And a very good morning uh to my wonderful panelists. Uh we have a few audience in the room, but we have a lot more online.

So I'm I'm looking forward to um you know yeah if we can get our you are here ra are next to me &gt;&gt; and Vishnu is just on his way he should be here shortly um I think the theme of

our panel is AI and workforce transformation and clearly from a you know India perspective uh the AI is obviously creating a number of opportunities it's also creating a lot

of anxiety amongst the youth and I think it's important to decode what does AI really mean and and how do we navigate these shifts that are ahead of us. So in terms of structuring the panel I thought

we'll try and break it into you know three different segments. So one the first segment is clearly about uh what is the disruption and how are we designing for it right so so try and get

perspectives from each of the panelists on how are you seeing this disruption are we are we shaping this disruption or is is this disruption really shaping us so so kish if I can start with you maybe

right um from a one of the sectors that's most hotly debated is IT services and and you're a leading company in that space how are you seeing this change um for your employees. Do you see software

coding now only being done through AI tools? So what is the job of the coder if if you look at it? But but how real is this disruption and how are you staying ahead of the shifts that are

there? &gt;&gt; So I I think the direction of travel is indisputable right that there is disruption. There's an issue of technology

capability and there's an issue of adoption and there's always that technology capability leads adoption. Adoption is going to impact is going to determine workforce displacement or

disruption. For the capability, there's no doubt that there's capability that exists today. Actually, there's capability that existed 3 months ago, 6 months ago where

there's quite a large chunk of work that is done by our industry that could potentially be displaced or improved or in some way impacted by AI. the

what is it that is getting impacted is changing very rapidly. See if it asked me at the beginning of 24 right what services will get most impact

I would have said testing actually I would put BPO first but I'm saying in tech I would have put testing first and I would have put software

engineering last today I'll flip that I'll say software engineering is the most so so the direction of travel I So, so you're really saying software

engineering is bigger disruption than testing and infra management or other stuff, right? &gt;&gt; That is true. So, I think whatever disruption we saw, I thought will be

there in infra uh I think is there but it's it's a plateau. I'm not seeing leaps and bounds of change. What we saw as a personal change like a year ago and now is not so different.

I think the massive difference is in software engineering. &gt;&gt; So, so you know if you are a young software professional today kish how do you see what what does this mean for me

as an as that young fresher out out of college right now? &gt;&gt; So I I I'll say the opportunities for a young technically savvy person is enormous.

Now there are things they need to think of and do differently for that opportunity to become real for them. Okay? Because the real value of AI is not in reducing headcount in blah

functions. Okay? Whatever it is, whether it's in BO or some functional work or software, that's not the real value. The real value is in being able to solve problems that you could not solve

before. And I I think you need to arm yourself with a completely different set of skills to make that real. But if you do that, I think the opportunities are

enormous for a young age. &gt;&gt; Thanks Kish. I'll come back to you Ravi if I can come to you. Right. Mastercard is um you know very strong obviously in financial services but you have a very

strong data and technology play right. How are you seeing this workforce disruption and you know for a company like yours which has a very large GCC in India? What are the different kind of

skill sets that you're thinking about today? &gt;&gt; Sure. No, so thank you very much and thanks to NASCOM and uh great to be here on the panel with uh you know Sue and

Shri Krishna. So I think like so I mean a lot of changed right over the last two decades when I look at our industry so I guess you know if you look at it like all the professionals in u privacy cyber

security data protection technology risk right they've all been enablers of digital transformation right they have uh I mean create what what we enjoy today in terms of uh digital empowerment

and uh the ability let's talking from a payment length, you know, very seamless in terms of wherever in the world you are, right? All that is riding on trust, right? And uh and and uh and and there's

a lot that goes in uh you know to build that trust, right? So now we are seeing is artificial intelligence, AI is being embedded into kind of a decision making, public infrastructure, service delivery,

right, and governance. So it's no longer kind of a downstream compliance function as such. So the uh so I think that's why we need u you know the the shift is in um kind of the the fintech disruption

that came about before. I think the what we we are seeing a a bigger shift that AI uh is bringing in terms of uh the kind of skill sets you know that are required. So you know uh so to your

question on what kind of skills are required right I think the skills I would say is that the uh what do you call uh the capability for system level judgment is needed. So uh what what what

we mean by that is that are you able to you know uh take what outputs are coming you know from AI and you need to have the capability to understand is the model drifting you know and in in high

stakes you know and regulated uh industry like like ours uh it becomes essential because decisions scale very instantly and uh as do the uh systemic errors right and u and the impact of

those errors if left unchecked so I think that it's important to have that system level judgment then uh interdisciplinary fluency is important because the AI challenges are not just

technical right they are at the intersection of engineering of regulation of risk you know user behavior so if we have professionals who are across those domains. All right,

that's important and to have that interdisciplinary approach rather than working in silos as such. Then it comes to the need for a very continuous learning mindset because the AI systems

are evolving with data, right? And the workforce needs to evolve uh that too and the ability to learn from live environments, right? what's happening to adapt models kind of res to be able to

refine the decision making. So that's important. So system level judgment interdisciplinary fluency continuous learning mindset and I think last but not the least is a deep contextual

awareness is needed. Now in a country like ours in India uh you know multiple languages, dialects, informal systems. So if an AI agent is interacting with the user, the question is does it

understand the context and the intent and the kind of the real life realities or is it just a language right? So because the context is shaped by the how models are being trained which means

that engineers have to consciously design for it. So that contextual ability and awareness uh is very important. So the typical engineer who was the coder as we know knew it

obviously has to build a very differentiated set of skills is is what you're really talking about right so understanding interdisciplinary learning understanding context the ability to

continuously learn I think that in itself is becoming a skill so clearly uh I think there's a lot of change that is needed at our college level and school level on how uh you know even how you're

learning so that you are ready for this very very changing world so if I can come to you Right. How are you, you know, you represent Tech UK here. How are you seeing the AI disruption in the

UK workforce? Is there anxiety? Is there uh opportunities that you are seeing? And and how how are you as an organization and of course the UK government supporting this transition

that's taking place? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, thank you Si that's a that's a question in a panel all in itself, but I'll try and touch [laughter] all of them. Um it's a real pleasure to be

here. Thank you so much for the invitation to be well part of the summit. um just to say to everybody, you've done an amazing job. So, thank you. Um but also to this really

important panel discussion and it is absolutely a discussion that we're having in in the UK. And what I found really useful this week um if I can be slightly selfish for a moment is to

listen to the conversations that you guys are having here and the other global people that are here here uh here at the summit and to kind of compare notes. Are we having the same

conversations? Are we facing the same kind of issues? I think what I've just heard from my fellow panelists are some of the conversations that are happening in the UK. Yes, there is change. Yes,

there is disruption happening. And to your point, absolutely. What we're seeing is a lot of roles um not just in our industry and sector, but across industries and sectors moving from, you

know, um very much admin tasks, very much cognitive tasks. Those are being increasingly automated. But then that's freeing people up to do more problem solving and to look at more um client

advisory governance and and using and being able to shift those skills to to um look at AI governance um but also I would say client facing as well which goes to um your point around skills I'll

come back to your broader question but yes it's technical yes it's governance it's looking at other skills but it's also those people skills those human skills if we are shifting people of jobs

are shifting towards more of yes this automation can do the job but what's the added value that I can provide and it's my my human skills which sounds very weird to say human skills but you know

what I mean it's it's that ability to interact it's that um social more social skills then are we teaching those as well as the technical as well as the legal the governance as well as the

software as well as the technical skills are we also teaching people and the young people coming through how to how to how to interact with people as well if they're more client facing. So

absolutely the destruction um we're h we're feeling it in the UK we're having that discussion in the UK definitely in the industry is questioning well what will my role be where will I sit

government is um in the UK is um focusing very squarely on this um so as part of its AI opportunities action plan the UK government created an AI skills partnership bringing together um the

government bodies that are looking at how do we upskill, how do we retrain, how do we get society ready for this next wave of AI that's coming, not just the one we have now, but the one that's

coming down the line and bringing together with um companies and bodies such as TechUK and others to look at how do we do this in collaboration. So, how do we reach the wider

population? I'm not just thinking our industry here, but the wider society and population with what are the training courses, what are the upskilling courses, what are the opportunities to

learn and gain skills to thrive in an AI world. Um, but then also how do we um train our industry and sector for the shift um that is happening as well. I think I think generally and that that

that task force is um looking to train uh over one million people um in in um AI so that we can help um the pop the greater population um be ready for working in this era. Um I think there is

anxiety. I think there is concern. Um some workers understandably worrying about displacement, worrying about um if they're at high exposure to automation, what does that mean? How do they shift?

how do they move? Um, but I think what we are looking at is how do you turn, and this is a word I've heard a lot about this week, how do you turn that anxiety into agency? How do we encourage

people to take a lead, to take what they've learned, but as you said, continuous learning, continuous upskilling because that is what you will need to thrive in in this world. Um, but

I think what we're looking at in terms of helping people do that, it's through restructured training pro resklling programs. It's pathways for midcareer into new careers. Um, one of the very

interesting uh um initiatives that the UK government introduced was um around how people coming out of university that might not have an AI degree can do a one-year conversion course to become

then um able to to work in the AI industry. So, I think there are lots of perhaps we'll go into a little bit more. There are lots of different initiatives that the UK are doing which could be

applicable here and vice versa. We want to learn from how you're addressing this. Um but I think there is there is anxiety but it's then how do you turn that into opportunity and agency. You

know and you know one of the issues in India we keep talking with the government is that uh we have a very disagregated focus right now within India right there are multiple

governments multiple state governments organizations places organizations like NASCOM we are all trying to do some part of the pie but there is no if I can use that word whole of government or whole

of uh country approach right on saying this is how if if this is such a big disruption this is how we will go about doing it do you see that in the UK that there is a integrated approach And then

obviously every actor has their own role to play in that. &gt;&gt; I think it's coming. First of all, I don't think there's a silver bullet. I don't think there's one pure answer

because the moment as you said things are moving rapidly and quickly the moment you put in um a task force or initiative, it may very quickly need to shift and need to change. So I think in

all of these and AI generally um having an iterative flex iterative flexible approach that can adapt and shift as technology evolves and as new developments evolve is is really really

key. So I think the AI skills partnership which we've signed up to with with the UK government has really kind of become a bit of a cornerstone a bit of a nucleus of of how do we retrain

how do we upskill the the general population but then I think there's also the conversation about how are we ensuring our schools our education curriculum what young people are

learning in schools um how is that joined up to the AI revolution and I think um while there's some thinking there I think that could be more joined up and then yes of of course on the how

are we training the industry? How are we getting people leaving as you said those freshers leaving universities with the skills that we need as industry? Um Tech UK is part of a part of Tech UK is an

organization called Tech Skills. Go and check them out. Not right now but maybe afterwards. And we Tech Skills works directly with employers directly with technology companies and universities.

So we be that bridge between the two to make sure that industry employers can provide input into the university the courses the the the what they're teaching students so that when they come

out of university they have a degree it's called a tech skills um gold accredititation degree which means employers will recognize that degree and kind of go yes you've got what I need

come and work for me. So it's it's there's no one single answer to this. I think it's a number of initiatives that need to work together. But as Tech UK, as others, we're trying really really

hard to join the dots. But I think the tech skills um addresses the what do employees need from universities? How do we get universities and employers employee employers working more closely

together? What role can government do? And what can government do that industry can't? And vice versa, what can industry do that government can't? It's really got to be a partnership and a

collaboration. But there's no one I think single initiative that will in my view that will fix this or solve this or address this. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I think that's

probably a great way to think about it that there's just so many changes that one single there's no single b silver bullet like you said you really got to figure out a way how you tie the

different threads but let maybe a thousand flowers bloom because that's the nature of what we're dealing with right &gt;&gt; if you can bring it together and say

here's our coordinated approach I definitely think in the UK we could join up more some these initiatives and maybe India with your scale can can do that um you've definitely brought the world

together in the summit so I've no doub out that you can definitely do that. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Uh so Kish if I can come back to you right um again from a IT services perspective we've been always one of the

largest employers for the engineering talent in this country now with the new skills that Ravi talked about do you see this focus will be largely on more elite top tier institutions and a large volume

of students that were probably studying in tier 2 tier three colleges across the country and did had a phenomenal career in our industry we're closing out opportunities for Then

&gt;&gt; I want to make a point on your previous question and then I'll address this. Okay. &gt;&gt; While you know and I agree there's no silver bullet. Okay. How are I I'll say

that you know I live in the US. The conversation I hear about policy around AI is should we regulate? Should we not regulate? Who should regulate? Should it be the state? Should it be the central

government? I'm not hearing what I heard here. Okay. Which is a big focus on inclusiveness. And so I and I think while you know it may not have all of the country I think

it's still a very material difference in approach of how government I see here is thinking about and actually I heard that from the UK I act minister before I heard from president macaron yesterday

uh in the plenary session. I think there's a big difference in some of countries relative to at least what I'm hearing in US much more focused on how to make it work for everyone how to

make it inclusive which I think is a huge difference in I think it'll lead to a very material difference in outcomes over a period of time okay now coming back to your question okay so first you

know do I know all the answers Um, no. Okay. But but here are some things, some pieces that I think are going to that are true. Okay. Um, first

I think the I've seen young a native talent is much better at many things than taking somebody even who's in their 30s and trying to retrain them. It's much

like you know do you use Instagram? I don't actually you know but there are kids who are grown up with it right so I think it's the same difference the digital native I I think you're going to

see an AI native um generation uh and we find actually like last year um the there's like a set of people we hire

from the absolute top engineering schools varieties we had them train our management team on VIP coding in May last year because VIP coding back then was brand new and guess who were the

kids who were the best in it in the company the people who came out of college right there in in the best so we had them train us so so I think this part is going to be true right when we

think of pyramid we have to bear in mind that sometimes the best talent is the youngest one that is coming okay the second one that's going to be true is I think ultimately the new opportunities

created by AI uh he's going to far outlaw far greater than the number of jobs that that it could reduce. Now there's going to be a period where you know there is a transition period and

I'm not sure exactly uh you know how it will play out but I'm very confident that ultimately AI is going to do so many more things that will need building applications building tech for right and

and I think um however I think the third is also true that for kids the problem to solve is not tech is not coding. It's not you know

creating data structures or whatever it is that kids are trying to solve. I think that's a solved problem by by some of the tech by air. So now you got to think of what problems that you want to

solve which is something else which is where the big opportunity is. &gt;&gt; So so k I'm going to hold you to that where you said AI will create more jobs than it changes. So we'll see how that

plays out. But you know one of the conversations I was having with another IT services company and they were like this AI native talent is great but that talent will have never learned to you

know work without AI and does that mean that some of your foundational and core skills will not be as uh solid as as they were in the past because this is the world you've grown up with and your

dependence on these tools will be so high that does it lead to a lack of some foundational skills. skills also right &gt;&gt; listen um there was a time when coding

you had to do in C++ right and then there were the whole evolution of coding as an example has been abstracting what you need to code for to some something right

so you wouldn't have idees like I don't know how many years ago right but you code who codes without an ID now nobody right and that's been true for whatever a decade so I think that same question

will become who codes now and I don't think anybody will code okay that'll be a solved problem so so no is it going to be a disadvantage I think far from it I think it's going to become

a significant advantage I think the cost of coding is going to become zero cost of code is going to become zero what that means is you can solve any number of problems with code that you

couldn't solve for before because it is too complex or too expensive to do so. So absolutely not. I think it's going to be a big advantage. &gt;&gt; So you have a comment to make on this

and I'll then come to Ravi and ask his input. So &gt;&gt; yeah no really fascinating. I think just on the coding point, you're absolutely right. And I'm just thinking as as a

woman in tech as well, we had a big focus in the UK of getting girls into coding. Brilliant. But actually, well, now why right there is also an opportunity there, but

there's also a risk. So coding you AI for coding great, but we will need somebody to check the code, right? So again, it's that shifting and that moving of skills. And then my brain went

to okay well the people that were doing the code could we repurp not reper reskill them into checking the code and going more into governance but then my brain goes to but hang on but AI might

be able to check the code quicker than a human can but then you get to that point of okay well somebody then needs to check that the AI has checked the code correctly so there is if you know you're

baking in governance and and um assurance in AI humans will need to be in the loop so how can people in the coding world be be shifted in their role shifted to help more on on the

governance side. I did have another point. However, my jetlag brain means I've forgotten it. So, I'll give away. &gt;&gt; But if if you've never coded in your life, how do you know what to check for?

&gt;&gt; Oh, I remembered my point. That's that's kind of related in in a way um to the gentleman from Mastercard was saying about context and completely important. Context is really really key. And

something that is in my brain as well is that people that work in organizations over the last couple of years, they have, you know, done junior roles. They've learned the company, they've

learned the sector, they've learned the industry, they've kind of done the grunt work, you know, to to learn the context and learn what's important. What concerns me slightly is that people

coming in using AI will not using AI, but when do we give them time to learn the company? When do we give them time to learn the context? Are they getting exposed to you know when I learned when

I first started it in a company I started in the basement I worked my way up but I knew the I knew my sector I knew my industry I knew that background I knew that context I knew what I was

checking and why. So we automationing takes those junior roles away. How are we teaching people? How are people getting exposed to the context and what a fintech industry needs and what it

looks like if those opportunities which came through more junior roles are now no longer there. So I think there's huge opportunities here but there's also some rethinking we need to do as an industry

and a sector of are we skilling people with the right things for for what the industry needs going forward as well. So Ravi if you want to go both on the question on we have a million plus

engineers graduating every year. What are the jobs for them? And you know obviously we've talked about the skills they need but will we as and you know today tech jobs are not just in the tech

industry they are in every sector but what do you see as the opportunity for them and secondly this whole part about right what what will humans do if AI does all the coding

&gt;&gt; sorry what would &gt;&gt; what would humans do or the engineer do if AI is going to do all the coding right so &gt;&gt; okay so look I think the uh so uh you

know couple of I'll give you like compare uh at least from a masterard perspective how we are um you know adapting and you know in the workplace to uh I think the latter part of of your

question right so I think that if you if you look at you know and u you know to shri your point around inclusion and you know to going up to the last mile I think it's very very absolutely a

necessity and you you've hit it right right nailed right on the head because India like you know operate uh it's a unique combination of scale and diversity that we have uh in India right

multiple languages multiple jurisdictions multiple levels of government right and technology that's evolving and so forth so I think that the uh so there are certain shifts that

uh are happening in the workforce or need to happen and as we continue to adapt if that where tradition traditional compliance models which are built around static rules and periodic

audits they don't they're not you know they don't serve us well uh in today's day and time. So the workforce of the future has to shift you know from a rule enforcement to a systemwide stewardship

role like how data flows how you know operational controls shape risk over time and uh and and where when to intervene right and then I think we have to make governance interdisciplinary and

influential so which is requiring fluency you know uh for people uh and putting teams together along law, technology, ethics, operations, you know, and uh like I mentioned before,

privacy, AI, governance, they cannot operate only in uh silos, right? So the uh what do you call so the future readiness kind of requires a big structural change u in in design in

procurement design deployment, right? And we also have to close the uh uneven digital capability across institutions. And I think you know we we talked about that that you know if the there are

central agencies and large enterprises can attract talent right while smaller uh cannot. So that will create governance gaps um and u and and governance gaps especially where AI is

expanding the most right. So and those are risks that we need to make sure that we u uh have um um you know the right solutions or the right thought process because it is around going beyond kind

of elite specialization towards more of a broad-based AI digital literacy. So at Mastercard like you know uh what we do is uh I think that you know we have spent you know several of our last years

operationalizing responsible AI uh right uh and not just as a policy exercise but as a workforce and capability challenge. Now we have a very formal established AI governance

framework. We have a chief AI and data governance officer. We have achieved privacy officer you know and we have a privacy by design approach uh into everything uh and these uh and uh ensure

that AI risks are addressed before systems are built and deployed and not afterwards &gt;&gt; and not after so and the we have a AI governance team that is working

horizontally across data science product legal compliance engineering right because that uh knowing that how important that integration uh layer is, right? Because we uh have and and and

then the uh the product and engineering leaders you could say they are the first line stewards of risk and AI risk, right? They are not kind of the recipients of compliance decisions. They

are the stewards up front, but that happens when you get that right integration uh you know up up front. So I think that you know for us from a mastercard perspective what we have

learned that governing AI at scale it's a fundamentally a workforce challenge that requires interdisciplinary skills right and early integration is required into product design and you know what do

you call uh we need u kind of governance professionals who can manage risk and not just enforce rules but I think that's you So, so it is a privacy by design, you know, security by design.

Those are kind of core principles, but then how do you bring those things together in this evolving uh, you know, is important &gt;&gt; and and I think that's a fascinating

part of this conversation, right? The whole focus on ethics, principles, trust, security, privacy by design, right? And as you think about uh Ravi going back to this large student

workforce right that we are building for tomorrow how do we get them to embibe many of these principles obviously when they come into your organizations there's there's structured programs that

you're running to drive this thinking but as if we had to take this back to the whole college university ecosystem any recommendations do you have on how to drive that

&gt;&gt; I I think no absolutely so so clearly you know from a corporation perspective I think like you know I was looking at the this morning when I took a picture of that. I think when I uh you know

opened the news this morning you know the very first thing on on the on the TV uh was around uh you know the headlines was AI skills or skill gap right where the uh and lot of discussion based on um

you know obviously the this week of of what's happening uh at at the uh you know as part of this this summit right so and I think that you know clearly the role that business academia government

We all have a role to play in navigating this workforce transition. I think for corporations, it's not just enough to say you're offering internships, right? You know, to to students. I I personally

feel you know how are we taking our maybe you know chief learning officers or others or or or engineers kind of who are at the front lines how are they working with um um you know

people in academia and actually helping think through and design courses based on real world examples of and situations that are coming. you know then uh and and certainly obviously when when people

come and do internships it helps them get that exposure take that back into their learning environment but I think in you know the whole facet of curriculum and curriculum design is

changing where it needs uh it's should not be only restricted only to computer science majors but I think that this is something that is required you know in terms of AI in its every different form

across a broad set of disciplines right so it it's not something that we can leave it only for uh you know computer science majors you know per se. So I think that the you know in terms of uh

priorities uh embedding AI governance and interdisciplinary collaboration into uh you know is one of the very first layer uh that we have to begin with so that you know the uh uh the people

coming in uh you know as you talked about the engineer they're trained to think across the full life cycle of AI system you know and not just in a very siloed approach right and that is what

talked about bringing engineers, product, risk, policy, all of those you know together and you know then I think another priority is um I know we talk about it and we have to think a focus on

role redesigning and not just reskilling and I think that you know because AI is transforming tasks within jobs rather than eliminating you know uh roles entirely. So I think that the work uh

you know we have to see is how do we u kind of redesign roles rather than only focusing on on reskilling right and we have to build inclusive and distributed talent pipelines. So I think here I mean

I go back to CI you know and uh or and other organizations where we have worked with where you go on the field and you're working let us say with MSMES right and

you know working with the last mile understanding their challenges and their pain points and bringing that into uh into um uh our product design and uh you know end output that's required uh and

because that provides the context Right. So I think that u so uh you know the ability to take our talent pipeline and expose them to real world and uh helping them contextualize you

know is very very uh important. Yeah, thank you Kish if I can follow up that question with you. Right. I think Ravi spoke about two themes. One is role design redesign. So how are you seeing

the role redesign happen from a technology services context? And secondly, I think there's so much we hear about the changing role of the engineer now this whole forward deployed

engineers becoming like the new buzzword in town. How how are you seeing this happen in your organization? &gt;&gt; I mean specifically on role redesign that is absolutely true. I mean just

again going back to software engineering. You think of a typical kind of squad that builds software. It may have had whatever 7 8 10 people some developers some testers scrum master

typical roles. I think in the extreme case we seeing down to three people, one product owner, one developer, one tester

and that's substantial redesign of the role and the time it takes to do it is coming down from 2 weeks to two days. So yes, you won't see value unless you're redesigning

the role. Uh you won't see real value from AI. Now we we've been speaking a lot about capabilities, right? I I think we should spend enough time on adoption and I think there is a pretty big gap

and actually I think that gap is good for work force. Okay, because no matter what the capabilities are, I think by the time it becomes real adopted at scale

into workforce into our enterprise customers, it's several years in aggregate ultimately I think of the impact of work and hence workforce

is maybe in low singledigit percentages per year at most even one to 2% right now. Maybe they'll expand to two to three next year. This is because of the speed of adoption and the multiple

constraints in adoption because I I don't think AI knows context, right? Um we've been everybody's speaking enough about it like you know MAD could mean what the word MAD means

for one enterprise could mean the old word for Chennai in another enterprise right. So how the uh there are many reasons why uh adoption I think is going to be slow but and frankly one of the

reasons is role design redesign because it is not as simple as getting a coding toy or whatever data tool it it is an organizational redesign to to make that happen

&gt;&gt; and are you engag in enabling all your employees to be able to use these tools given you know some of the issues around governance finance risks that are being talked about.

&gt;&gt; Yeah. Uh 100%. [snorts] Okay. I think it is kind of uh little bit silly to tell employees that uh you cannot use um we already got we are already in the

second generation of retraining our employees on AI. I think first generation was whatever on genai and I would say even as of Jan last year the whole concept of agentic came in

whatever you learned till that point becomes useless and so we're doing that second generation of training now what we found is that earlier we used to mandate training we wanted everybody to

learn and we were pushing employees to learn. Suddenly we stopped it. We said hey it's up to you. The truth is if you don't learn you're going to be returned. Okay. Yeah. So it's not for us that

you're learning it's for you. And suddenly we finding that the number of people who are actually getting trained is more not less once you stop mandating it. Okay. So um yeah I mean are there

privacy risks with Facebook? Do people use it? The answer for both is yes. Okay. So I think you're just going to find a generation of people who think about the risk associated very

different. &gt;&gt; So you know yesterday at the impact summit uh the CEO of anthropic spoke about uh I think what was the 100x geniuses in a data center right that's

the kind of &gt;&gt; intelligence at scale that will exist. um as as these technologies uh really mature to a deployment and and this the scale the deployment gap how how do you

see uh the role of human shifting and what is this human AI collaboration that we are all talking about right &gt;&gt; see the thing is this okay I tell my customers this

um stop chasing the shiniest object there is always going to be advancement in technology every month every 2 months, every 3 months, something better will come. And in the quest to keep

chasing that actually what you're doing is not realizing value from anything. So for me, most enterprises can get significant value if they fully adopt systematically

capabilities that existed a year ago. certainly capabilities that existed 6 months ago. So what are the relevance of a data center full of geniuses for most

enterprises? I think it's zero. Okay. What problems can it solve that uh enterprises I I think enterprise problems are not to do with IQ.

It is far more complex than a linear IQ issue, right? So, so I think yes it may be true that AI can do like a thousand things that humans can't but it's not relevant.

So I I think the real focus is not about capability about how do you help enterprise adopt and that is the real answer to your earlier problem earlier question. What do people do if machines

do coding? Actually, the problem you're trying to solve is not writing code. You're trying to always solve for some other problem. And I think that's the reskilling that engineers and young

talent need to go through that for me now AI knowledge is like English. It's foundational. It's fundamental. I I need to be in the business of solving

for something else. I I And there I think the point you've made several times interdisciplinary I think is crucial. Right. So I mean how many times do you go to a doctor and get

frustrated listen I don't want an eye doctor. I don't want a nose doctor. I actually want a doctor. Right? And you know that's true in engineering. You you think about

robotics. You don't want a mechanical engineer. You don't want a software engineer. You don't want an AI engineer. You don't want an electrical engineer. You want an

engineer. And I think that is where our talent needs to grow. Now, frankly, I think academia has a big job to do to to help them get there because our courses are

not designed like this right now. they they're designed as electrical and whatever else. Uh but but I I think young talent who are reorienting themselves that hey AI is not the skill.

AI is very foundational but I'm going to use that to solve for something more meaningful. Uh I think we'll just be fine um on workforce. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Uh so if I can come to you right I

think you've heard a lot about how learning has to change and uh you know whether it's critical thinking that we're talking about problem solving experiential use case based uh but at

the same time you need access to data you need access to compute you need access to research right so how how are you think how how is UK thinking about this and you know are there examples

that India can learn from from there &gt;&gt; yeah absolutely So when we think about realizing the opportunities, economic and social opportunities of AI, it isn't just about obviously skills, skills is

part of it, but it's it's about it getting, if I can use that word again, the foundations right. So in the UK particularly last year, we've focused a lot around um and a lot of initiatives

and a lot of investment has been put into getting the infrastructure right. So whether that is looking at our data infrastructure um the UK government um announcing a a national data library

initiative to try and we we have well I was about to say we have huge data sets but you guys have massive data sets um but the data sets we have how are we using them how are we bringing them

together not just for public services and public sector use but potentially for industry use as well um uh so data infrastructure absolutely a lot of investment's gone into compute

infrastructure so the creation of AI growth zones. So um dedicated areas in the UK where perhaps we don't have the compute um um infrastructure resource right now. How are we building that? Um

part of it is also investment gone into um air. So an AI research resource so dedicated computer resource compute power chips to allow AI researchers at that fundamental um research level to do

the work that they're doing as well. So absolutely a lot of focus and I think if I think about and if I reflect on the last when 2025 in the UK yes the conversation was a lot about um how do

we get the foundations right how are we getting the infrastructure right where I think and where I want the conversation to shift is to now adoption yes we've been talking about adoption there is

already adoption happening in the UK whether it's financial services whether it's in our healthare system whether it's transport logistics but boy there's so much potential completely agree and

um at Tech UK we're really looking at how do we accelerate that um AI adoption at pace and speed in a way that we don't get it wrong. So from a governance, from an ethics, from a responsible, from a

regul regulation point of view, absolutely. Um, and how do we get it right for people, but how do we move uh quickly enough to realize the opportunity? And that's really really um

something that we'll be um advocating for more this year because there again what can government do to help that, but what can we as industry particularly the tech industry help other sectors and

industries to understand how they can do that as well? And that's really a core mission of of my work at TechUK. Skills comes into it, of course, but also does public trust and confidence, right? None

of what we're talking about here is going to really fly if people don't trust and have confidence um in in using AI. Um so there is or having AI used about them, right? So there's um lots of

initiatives happening. comput infrastructure absolutely access to data um making sure that researchers have what they need industry have what they needmemes have what they need but skills

is an integral part of that it's all linked right it's all connected but I completely agree um adoption is really the key um and I was at a UK um had a reception last night the high commission

and the Rishi Sunnak the um previous prime minister um was talking about which country will win the AI We talk about sovereignty and we're talking about you know the previous panel was

talking about sovereignty is kind of key for for India and it's it's key for a lot of countries and we're looking at what does data what does tech what does AI sovereignty mean for the UK but

Richie Sunnak's point was like the countries that will win the race in AI and not the countries that are looking at sovereignty or looking at stack or looking at infrastructure it's the

countries that can demonstrate adoption and can win the race on adoption and that can integrate AI across all the sectors across all your industry and your economy and definitely in the UK

we're very much tying e um digital sorry AI adoption and deployment diffusion into society into our economy as a key driver of growth and productivity as well. So um lots going on but with that

central core theme of how do we get this right as well. &gt;&gt; Yeah I fully agree. I think getting deployment right is is really the opportunity or challenge for economies

that are not competing for the LLMs right so I think that that's what India has to get right because AI can help solve to Khisha's point we necessarily the shiniest toy is not needed for the

enterprise it's needed to solve India's deep healthcare challenges it's needed to solve some of our agriculture related issues right and I think that's where the whole inclusion focus and what AI

can do for you really means &gt;&gt; yeah And I think sometimes we have to take a step back and just realize how transformational, how exciting this technology is. I mean many of us have

been talking about this for a number of years. But where we are in terms of compute infrastructure and compute power that we never had before in terms of the digital data and the data sets that

we've never really had before. I I I don't know. I I'm feeling quite this does feel like a step change. This does feel like a different moment in time. And it's how do we grasp that moment in

time which I think is really important. How do we help young people and everybody working on industry to understand what grasping this opportunity means for them as well?

&gt;&gt; No, I think we're reaching the end of our our session, but I just want to get to the last session and quick comments from all of you, right? Um, you know, what would be Ravi your top three

priorities for business, academia and government to successfully navigate this AI workforce transition and you know what are some risks it should plan for? Great. So I think like you know the

priorities uh I think I mentioned you know to you about this whole uh interdisciplinary collaboration the whole you know aspect around redesign and so forth right and I think in risks

uh I would also see see I think like uh if I go to you know how what we've been talking around AI and how it has democratized access and so forth Right. But there is

also the concentration risk that we have to uh be um aware about. Right? Because uh kind of when we have a small set of institutions or companies or talent pools pull ahead disproportionately

because they have access to better data or compute and research oper ecosystems, right? Then uh I think we have to be very deliberate in how we design uh for systems and I think this is where you

know India uh we uh have a position of strength because uh you know our engineers and uh you talked about the million plus engineers that are you know we we are coming from a position of

strength because India has contributed to the global technology revolution. you look at all the growth of our global capability centers, you know, kind of reflect that depth of the talent pool,

you know, that exists, right? And but I think that um we have to as we go forward, you know, get that, you know, design uh uh aspect right, right? Because foundational digital um and AI

literacy uh into school curriculum, right? because equitable access to tools, infrastructure, right? Hands-on exposure across geographies, right? So and then also we have to go beyond top

tier institutions to tier 2 and tier three because u otherwise again we'll come back to a concentration risk uh you know that will exist and you know because we don't need just people who

can build AI we can uh we need folks you know and professionals who can build with AI who can govern AI and who can and know when to override AI right so I think that's kind of importance. So and

we have to make sure that in terms of risk we don't go towards over automation you know without adequate human oversight uh and uh you know biases need to be taken into account because uh uh

it should work well for both formal workers as well as informal workers right women entrepreneur you know vernacular because uh and we talked about context and the contextual aspect

of it right So uh so we otherwise we risk exclusion at scale and you know to shri's point we want that inclusion uh that that you talked about you know and uh and I already talked about the uh

&gt;&gt; I'm sorry we know we are ending the session so whoever is ringing the bell please we'll be there on time. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay. So, so okay. So, therefore I mean I'll just conclude there that uh

you know it is about uh this transformation that we need is about preparing people u you know to use AI in a responsible ethical manner that also drives social impact.

&gt;&gt; Yeah. So I think you've articulated it very well right the risk of concentration the risk of exclusion and obviously not doing it uh very thoughtfully right. So, so I think those

are very very well articulated. So if I can come to you right what what do you see both as from a workforce transition frameworks what are our big opportunities and risks right so

&gt;&gt; yeah I'm glad you could hear that Bill as Belle as well I thought it was funny in my head um so the question in terms of priorities so very quickly for businesses uh so touching on some of the

the points ro you were making as well embed lifelong learning we need to continuous learn um we all do actually but also our organizations I think think about um for businesses not just jobs

and and and roles but tasks. What are organizations looking for people to do? And I think also organizations need to think about the opportunities but the risks they need to um uh invest in human

skills along with technical skills, governance skills but for government as well we see something in the UK that we think should be prioritized and I don't know if this will resonate with here in

India but it's an interoperability of skills credentials. So if I get a if I get a credential, if we're focusing on lifelong learning, if I learn a skill, if I take a course, if I have a

credential, how is that transferable? Can that be recognized elsewhere? Because people will need to shift and people will need to move. But also a national taxonomy of um skills and and

perhaps requirements and and and um fundamental foundational skills that we're talking about. Are we all talking the same language? Are we all talking about the same skills? some some

priorities there but I'll leave it there. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So a new skills taxonomy and interoperability of skills I think that's going to be very important in

this environment but technology is changing so fast right because what was applicable last year is not going to be applicable this year. Ki if we can come back to you for the closing comments.

How are you seeing this? &gt;&gt; So &gt;&gt; I'll maybe just say one thing. Okay. &gt;&gt; Sorry. &gt;&gt; I think inclusiveness has to beending.

So Okay, we're just ending. We've said that we are ending. It's just those 24 seconds, right? So, &gt;&gt; yeah, why don't you just close?

&gt;&gt; If you look at the internet is very inclusive. That's because academia made something free. I think we need academia to do that for AI. That's how it become more inclusive. I

think this has to be a huge priority. Wonderful. Thank you so much. We've ended right on time and we'd appreciate not getting so many interruptions but but thank you so much Ravi and Sue

really appreciate this discussion. I do see Vishnu at the back but I think because he was caught in the traffic he couldn't join us. Vishnu we missed you here but thank you all for being here.

&gt;&gt; Thank you so much. May I kindly request Sangeita ma'am to hand over momentum. Right. Yeah. Thank you. to welcome you all today for our session

re-imagining AI and STEM education for India's next generation celebrating the vision of Vix Bharat and its grandeur we are witnessing the AI revolution during the AI India summit

with a young population and vibrant digital ecosystem system and strong policy momentum.
