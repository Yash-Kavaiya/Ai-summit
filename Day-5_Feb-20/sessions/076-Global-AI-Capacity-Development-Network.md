## 📝 Transcript

defining moment for disaster risk governance around the world. The frequency, intensity and complexity of disasters are increasing. Climate variability is

compounding existing vulnerabilities. Urbanization is concentrating risk and cascading cascading hazards are challenging traditional response models. At the same time, we are witnessing

unprecedented advances in AI. So at this point of time, how does India bring or develop a model with AI for resilience? We believe that the next frontier in DRR

is not better algorithms alone. It is institutionalizing AI within national resilience architectures. India's experience offers a unique perspective. We operate across Himalayan risk,

coastal cyclones, riverine floods, heat waves and urban flash floods. We manage complexity across federal and state systems and we have demonstrated DPI at population

scale. Our proposition today is not that India is merely an AI innovator but India's evolving as a resilient systems architect integrating space technology materology digital platforms

governance frameworks and community centered dissemination. So today's panel discussion brings together government leaders, multilateral partners, developmental

institutions and technology pioneers to examine a critical question that is what institutional, financial and governance reforms are required to scale AI from pilot projects to national and global

resilience systems. Before the we start the discussion, let me invite and call uh on the stage to uh for the panel discussion his exc his excellency Dr. Vin Ram toul the minister for

information technology communication and innovation from the republic of Maicius. Welcome sir. He is key contributor to national strategies for AI in resilient

infrastructure and south south cooperation. I would like to invite Miss Beth Buddham, senior manager from UK Met Office. She is an specialist and exp uh in the disaster risk reduction via

forecasting innovations and AI explorations for predictions. Welcome. I would like to invite Mr. Som Sasangi, former SVP and managing director from Hullet Packard Enterprise, India with

industry insights on AI deployment in geospatial and climate analytics. Welcome Mr. Som. I would like to now call upon Mr. Nikileh Kumar, CEO and co-founder for Vasar Labs. He is an

innovator uh in leveraging AI for DRR. Welcome Nikillesh. And lastly uh Mr. Panka Shukla, head of customer engineering Google Cloud India for practical AI applications, hazard

mapping, predictive analytics and AWS scale up. So we move beyond demonstration. and focus on double integration during this panel discussion.

So my question first to uh minister for IT communication and innovation republic of Mauritius. Minister the small island developing states face existential climatic

threats. From your perspective, what policy reforms are required to institutionalize AI enabled early warning and alerting systems within national governance frameworks and how

can countries with limited resources ensure sustainability in ventures. &gt;&gt; Thank you and uh good morning everybody. Thank you for the opportunity to be here amongst you. Uh first of all, I would

like to say a couple of points before I get into the actual response there. Today, just like we have the physical world, we have a virtual world as well in which we all live. And that virtual

world is so much bigger than the physical world we can see here in front of us at the moment. And just like disaster can strike the physical world and that is the scope of the discussion,

disaster can also strike the virtual world. And as we we grow in dependency on the virtual world, on our digital systems, we should be well aware that disaster is not just the flood, the

cyclone, the drought. Disaster can also be the cyber security attacks that can actually create havoc in our lives. Therefore, it is very important that the scope of the discussions when we look at

disaster be also extended to the virtual world and cyber security attacks. Now having said this uh in terms of policy reform it is very important that we also create this bridge between the physical

world and the virtual world and I will explain myself. Uh just imagine as we speak here there is a big fire that breaks out in one of the holes and because it broke out there are you know

automated connections that go to the fire services to the medical services they will proactively now start driving to this place. But what when they come to this place where would they know

where are the people? Because their main objective is to save the lives of the people. Secondary the material. Where would they know where are the people? Do they have a plan a structural plan of

this this space? Do they know where do the pipes cross? Now I'm talking about a digital twin. It is really important that we create that digital twin which will be the bridge

between the physical world and the virtual world and the architectural map of that digital twin should be accessible to a certain set of operators the medical the fire services. Now this

is part of the reform that we are looking at and in a small administration it becomes easier to do it as opposed to a huge administration like uh India. Uh now there's one more thing in there as

let's say we also have the structural plan. How do we know where the people are? Can we have heartbeat indication? Uh can we have uh the thermal uh map of the place so that we know wherever

there's 37 38 39° well 37 38 is better. Uh do we know where the people are located so that when the fire services come they go straight to that spot. So this is very important and another

another reform that is important that we be aware of is that when there is some kind of a pandemic there is and which is contagious there is humanto human virus uh transfer.

Now we are all very excited about artificial intelligence but we are also aware that there is this possibility of virus infecting systems right and just like virus infects people virus also

infects systems and virus get contagious in computers as well. We all know that. Therefore, we need to also have mechanisms to protect because if we have a message that goes through an early

warning system to people, this already creates an alert in the minds of people. The adrenaline surge starts already. But if that message is infected, it can create a lot of disruption in our daily

lives and this we need to be very careful of. Therefore, in terms of reform, the decision- making process and I think it was Mr. somebody earlier mentioned in the previous panel, the

decision making process is automated. Now, automation can be from 10% to 100%. And 100% automation in the field of AI where it concerns the lives of people can be dangerous. Therefore, human in

the loop or human on the loop is critical in these kinds of environments. And this is also part of what we are looking at in Maitius. Yes, it's true that as a small island developing state,

we call it SIDS. We have our own set of flash floods that can actually occur within a couple of hours. we can have flash floods and we can see uh cars floating around already and this has

happened uh in the country and we don't want that to happen again. Therefore, there are early warning systems that we are deploying like cell broadcast systems which we have planned to deploy.

Now again the message that goes into that system should be a message that is human verified that is decisions like these that are sensitive highly sensitive cannot be 100% automated

that's part of our policy as well and want to ensure that humans are involved because machines cannot def decide for humans human decide for machines and this needs

to be critical and uh needs to given the attention that it deserves and I believe uh Prime Minister Modi Gi also mentioned uh in his intervention yesterday that there is a great necessity to ensure

that human remain part of the decision-m process uh in the application of AI for disaster uh management. So these are few points I wanted to mention. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you sir for giving insight. Thank

you Mr. Thank you sir for giving your valuable insights in developing resilient uh governance frameworks which actually are scalable across the nations and this is the way to go uh resilient

system which is resilience to even cyber attacks and also sustainable meaningful and not giving any uh say fatigue of alerts also is very much vital for a robust system to be uh effective across

all disasters. So we now come to the second uh panelist uh Miss Woodham. Uh my question to you is the national methological agencies play a crucial role in operational forecasting and

early warning delivery. From the perspective of the UK Met Office, how can AI complement physical weather and climatic models to improve forecast lead time and impact

basically impact based warnings to gain public trust? and what institutional partnerships are necessary to ensure that AIdriven methological insights translate into actionable decisions and

actions at national and local levels with special emphasis on low resource countries. Hello. Yeah. Um right, thank you for your question and thank you. It's a real

honor to be part of this panel. So um at the Met Office, we are currently veloping machine learning weather models and we absolutely do not see these as a replacement for our physical models. Our

our uh tech well our plan over the next over the coming years is to step by step implement these models through blending. This could be hybrid models physics based and machine learning based. It

could be um blending the output from both of these models after after they've run. We don't the truth is we don't know what the answer to this solution is yet. But in order to build the trust amongst

the users of our models, the customers of our data, we're certainly not going to have a complete shift. We are going to do this step by step increasing our blend as we become become more confident

with the data. So it's from this conference you know it's very clear that um PE companies from the private sector are developing these models in the public sector of

course we're developing them too and sovereign capability remains really important but for public sectors we really need to have that co- that co-development

um at the Met office we have a long history of co-developing with partners like India so through WCSSP India and through as um Wiser Asia Pacific we have these partnerships we've um co-developed

physics based models and we really want to do the same with machine learning models as well at the Met Office we're starting standardizing our benchmark and evalu benchmarking and evaluation we

really want to make sure that when we're doing comparisons between machine learning and physics-based models we're being fair to the physics based models. There's a lot of metrics we can look at

that show machine learning models are doing well, but are these the metrics that are most important to users? Therefore, not only do we want to co-develop the actual models with

partners, we want to co-develop the benchmarking and the tests that we do on these models. Thank you. Thank you Beth for giving you insight into how the national meological

agencies uh may plan to use AI systems. Uh so now we move towards the the techn uh technologies so that how do we really create uh resilient systems for uh uh forecasting. So my first question to

would be uh to Mr. Som sasangi uh uh the private sector innovation has advanced rapidly. So the first foremost question I think which comes to my mind is how can technology

providers design AI systems that are interoperable and uh with sovereign data architectures because that is the crucial uh uh issue to be cracked. So uh we have to design

AI systems that are interoperable with sovereign data architectures and compatible with diverse governance ecosystems for a country like India with federal

the government and the state governments. So this is a very vital nut to be cracked from the technology point of view and similarly what standards of explanability are necessary when AI

informs life-saving decisions. So &gt;&gt; your insights on that. &gt;&gt; Thanks Manish. uh really a great question and probably uh in this room I'll be calling

something which is very very important because just when I walked in uh I've heard Mr. Martin and he spoke a point which is so important and critical for a country like India. He spoke about the

government he spoke about the procurement policies and and the scale. So all these three things are so and critical when we look from India standpoint with 1.2 billion

plus citizen. I've been the managing director enterprise for last nine years and I know I've been involved almost in all large critical infrastructure project whether it's uh UIDI or any kind

of transaction code in all application and we know that all these things we have developed at the scale and deliver probably when we look the most important aspect of the human life with the

climate change the disaster which is happening across across the length and breadth of India on coastal side. So but somehow are we ready to do while uh and I'll give you some pointer

which are very important and why it's it's not happening to the Mr. Martin point and I'll just while India has very ambitious plan for national supercomputer mission way back in 2015

where India has said okay we'll be investing 4,500 cr to develop some of the superco computer which will the high class but in last 10 year what we have developed is some 37 supercomput with

just the 40 paflop of capacity is that sufficient now we are planning okay we'll add another 50 uh pa flop but when you look at the global level the kind of infrastructure which is if we

have to manage in a real time this alert and warning system and I'll give you one or two example in United States the top computer system which have been developed and deployed to do these

things they have got a capacity of almost one to two xaflop and one xaflop is close to around thousand paflop whole India we don't have even today 100 paflop of data and us there are multiple

system which provide this realtime information and each of them one is uh al capitan which is 1.8 8x of flop. Then frontier system which has been deployed by the Oakidge National University has

got 1.3x of flop capacity. Aurora which is recently deployed by the Argon National University has got 1x of flop of uh power and capability. So these are the kind of system which are deployed so

that actually they can take the power of AI in a realtime environment where the geospatial data or it's satellite information data or it's any kind of live information and analyze these

things with the help of AI in a realtime environment and provide the alert much ahead of those things somehow we are not able to provide so in India if we want this early warning system to be And I

think our main focus needs to be how we can have the core infrastructure which will meet the requirement of this and last couple of days in every discussion this is what is coming out with the

global CIO and CEO that probably India need the core infrastructure which we have not developed. Now we might say okay we are doing 10,000 uh GPU to the AI and all but that is getting

distributed to a large number of tech and SMB guy who are developing the application but what government needs because it's a sovereign data that government needs to buy this kind of

infrastructure but I know each of the system will cost anything between $4005$500 million to a billion dollar government may not be able to spend that kind of money. So probably that's a

place where private partnership becomes very very important and critical. So my request is that probably department should be looking how the large global institution and technology partner can

bring the core infrastructure and technology because today technology is not a barrier it's a infrastructure and scale and the procurement process and some of these policies how the various

data will be getting integrated is a problem. So if we can address these things to the scale probably India has done on the DPI side where we have implemented and the best example to the

global level where the UIDI is being used almost by almost more than 800 900 million citizen in the country. We can deliver that. We have got a capability and with all these AI transformation

which is happening our honorable prime minister already said that India is going to be leaprogging on those things and going to the global leader in the AI space with all those technology embedded

along with the capability what India has got only what is required the infrastructure but infrastructure will come with a huge cost when you are going to get the infrastructure another

element come is the power, energy and water cooling that's going to be very critical. So somebody has to look the all the three aspect you can get the infrastructure if you don't have the

power. So we need to have the power which can help and and uh power these kind of systems. So alternative power resources are going to be very very critical. They'll be all water cooled

system because they will have hundreds of thousands of GPU and CPUs running together kind of thing. They will require a huge power and huge water capabilities. So need to have that

things. So India need to start thinking on those line to create that things if we have to protect and we have to get the right early warning alert to save the life of millions of citizen in the

country that thank you. Thank thank you sir. I think uh very aptly summarized by you. Uh uh there is no doubt that DRR offers an opportunity for India to create a global public good. what our

honorable prime minister has said the ambition for for India to create uh DPGs uh for the global good and uh the UI is Aadhaar and based on the India stack we have seen many things

which have come off this table and definitely DRR also offers an opportunity for us to ponder so taking forward the from Mr. S I'll go to Mr. Pankage Shuklaji the head of customer

engineering uh at Google cloud and AI. Basically cloud computing and AI platforms enable real analytics realtime analytics at scale. So what are the critical infrastructure

investments which are essential to support AI deployment in low connectivity and high-risisk environments that's very vital looking at the federal uh looking at the

geography of our nation and how can AIdriven dissemination ensure last mile inclusion while mitigating misinformation risk. So your insights on that.

&gt;&gt; Uh good afternoon everyone. Uh so irrespective of the technology when we talk of disaster management and resilience essentially what we are trying to do is we are trying to turn

the chaotic reality on the ground into actionable intelligence right so for example the data fragmentation which is sitting with m multiple ministries and social media various places all across

all of that first of all needs to be brought to a place or at least should be you should have an ability to bring all of that data and turn into a living intelligence. So once the data is there

which is structured as well as unstructured data then we have the ability of our AI models today which are multimodelled to make sense of the completely chaotic data noisy data into

a real intelligence at anime level speed that is essentially what AI is all about. So when it comes to the real implementation of this entire architecture and and the panelist spoke

about multiple aspects that how can we use AI how do we actually implement it on ground if you look at what we need and essentially if when we talk of AI uh broadly it has it is it is there at the

five layers one is the infrastructure layer second is the operating system layer which runs on top of infrastructure and I'm not talking about just servers and data centers but an

operating system system layer which scales from a central to an edge location to a multiple regional locations. Then on top of that the services which are required platform

services which are required to basically build the AI applications make the use of the right models etc. Then you have got the models the multimodel uh ability of the models like Gemini and

various other hyperscalers which provide and for example the India mission lot of Indian providers are building models ma'am spoke about lot of the models which for example other companies are

building. So the question is that how are we able to make the use of all diverse set of models in in [clears throat] a dynamic manner and use agentic AI on top of that to build

applications and turn that into a real action uh which can be disseminated at the places where we want for both proactive during the response and as well as after the response. So the

question is how do we implement it? So implementation of this will require a framework or an architecture which essentially has a central living intelligence of all the data on which

you are basically experimenting and pre-training the models and tuning using different type of models and building applications. The real application of that is going to happen at a place which

might get completely disconnected from your central place. So you should be able to actually build all of these applications AI applications make use of that data make a single central single

truth centrally but ability to send that intelligence back to a tactical location. Today it is exactly possible. So organizations for example Google and many other organizations are actually

trying to build basically bring all the goodness of hyperscaler cloud for the entire infrastructure and manage services layer as well as AI tooling to on-prem

and then ability to also run those in a completely disconnected air gapped environment in a zero trust manner. So you have the security of your data and your uh applications and then also you

should have an ability to connect the edge locations in a federated manner to the central place. But if required during a disaster you should be able to carry it a rugged device which basically

has a basic small set of central intelligence sitting into that with all this uh necessary models to basically take action on the ground and that action could be related to either

finding out where where are your assets where is the uh the maximum impact which has happened how do you actually kind of send the information to various places. So all of those things are absolutely

possible today and uh uh while there is huge amount of infrastructure as at son said is required actually to train models build models but that's happening across the country we should have an

ability to bring all the good models the models for the right thing to to basically run it on prem at a smaller set of infrastructure and make a smaller set of that which can run in a tactical

location which sits possibly in a very limited infrastructure and compute that is what we are essentially trying to do. &gt;&gt; Thank you Pankage I think for giving Google's insight into building rugged uh

uh systems uh at scale deployment of AI solutions in low cost uh and higher risk environments. We uh have another contributor to the DRR particularly AI deployment in DRR could be from the

startups and uh we have Mr. Nikil Kumar, CEO and founder from Vasar Labs. Now basically Nicillesh you can enlighten us about how [clears throat] startups can contribute in developing a DPG uh at

population scale for DR uh particularly for countries like India. &gt;&gt; So first of all thanks a lot for giving this opportunity to be part of this panel. It's an honor. Um and uh before I

go to the contribution to the DPG s I would like to pick it from where uh the started discussion uh minister s talked about uh digital twin I would like to zoom into a bit in terms of uh how do we

deal especially with some real use cases on the hazard part on uh digital twins. You see today digital twins are really required uh when we are acting uh uh uh in action to the various hazards across

the across the time in the year. Uh every month has a different hazard and uh this uh digital twin typically you can see in four layers. Data layer which is predominantly the most important to

begin the journey. The modeling layer which is transforming the data into various insights hazards. the asset in the people layer which is getting impacted where we need to know today in

personalized and in precision where exactly we talked about like if flood is coming which road which houses if a landslide is coming which area and the fourth which is most important is the

workflows to translate the actions and um uh this is where we we see um a role of DPI and DPG because all these four layers s are not uh done by one person. They are look into data scattered across

various agencies and uh we need to have uh DPIs and DPGs which are built across these data right from uh different institutions which are bringing me mutological data, some institutions

which are bringing uh water and other uh asset related data. some institutions which are creating different uh layers like uh survey of India in case of India on earthquake and various other layers.

Now we also see a role of AI today being playing a role and I'll just give an example for that. Um so we uh we see as today extreme events are happening. Uh

one of the first pressure is in the water sector where we see extreme floods uh sudden gush of water coming into the large dams and dams is one of the most extreme and vulnerable uh asset that we

are all impacted to it and um we would also see that the large dams are perhaps we have got a good handle to control them during the disaster but we have lot of small big number of dams uh in the

country where they are unregulated and they are scattered across in large numbers and um there's no forecast available for them. So uh how do we churn uh in real time in in near real

time both hourly and uh in uh days time for close to 1 million water bodies which anytime can be vulnerable. So uh one of the solution that uh we recently saw was translating uh and making

leveraging actually the data gap uh utilizing AI and AI sitting on uh uh real-time satellite data 30 minutes interval uh radar data coming from uh currently all these assets are available

from IMD and uh translating that into a now cast now that that now cast layer translated into hydraulics to each of the dams and uh uh in uh cycle cyclone month close to 5,000 dams were given in

real time. So uh such uh use cases you see is where data is getting connected is available in real time in an interoperable format and then there are players who can translate these data

into actions. I see sir that uh contributions uh where uh such platforms are brought uh at national and state scale and um these uh uh use cases are also packaged and made available uh for

different um uh um recipient departments to translate them into actions. So I would uh say that sir and um one more thing I would just like to add taking this as a forum sir um risk uh

assessment and risk reduction both has a very big uh gap when it comes to data especially various events across take about earthquake take about other uh type of disasters where uh parametric

measurements historic have not been available and knowing uh frequency of location specific frequency of these hazards has been actually lacking because you don't have a uh database.

Now AI can play a very good role here where the information is lying in lots of news which has happened and which contains unstructured information on location, unstructured information on

the hazard that has impacted the damages, the intensity. So AI can actually uncover these informations and create a structured data sets each hazard wise and these will also feed

into various DPGs that will further unlock to the insurance sector to make which will basically benefit from knowing location specific intensity and also frequency of the risk. Sir, I'll

just close with that sir. &gt;&gt; Thank you Nikesh. uh you have aptly sum summarized that uh startups uh in this sector definitely can play a very vital role particularly for developing a

rugged AI systems for India at population scale. Now we have the heard the panelist from the Indian uh perspective since we are learn uh we are running large

systems. So we would like also to have uh the uh the all the members to have the benefit of the of the insights uh of uh uh the how the national systems are functioning in India and how technology

is basically uh being deployed at scale to uh for DRR perspectives. So firstly I would like to uh get the insight from Dr. Dr. Britja Mahaatra the DG of IMD is here and uh

IMD uh can elaborate uh on the on how robust AI based systems uh can be deployed are being deployed at population scale uh in the Indians context. Dr. Baba uh namaskar good

morning to all of you uh respected Dr. Safhatas, our Krishna and distinguished panelists and dear delegates, friends and colleagues. At the outset, I

congratulate um India for organizing this session which has given a lot of thoughts to each of us who were represent here. I'll just start with um what the initiative taken off by

UN and the WO. A clarion call was given in 2022 that the early warning for all and when you go for early warning for all it includes the all the countries all the people and all sectors all

strata of the society. So with that when it came of that at that actually less than 50% countries had the early warning at that time. Now number is increasing but still the time is short now by 2027

we have to achieve the 100% towards early warning for all. It is a long goal and if we review now we find that um during this last five years there has been huge jump in technology and AI is

one such technology which is helping for extensible learning for all. uh looking at the various components of that you need pass the risk knowledge at each and every point what um our friend told us

Nikil and it is not possible with the existing network of any country to have the risk knowledge at each and every location. But at the same time there are unstructured data as it is told which

can be utilized to create the knowledge to create the risk hazard vulnerability assessment which can be the historical knowledge which can be utilized in real time when you go for the prediction of

any severe weather event. Next point comes the early warning. Yes, over the early warning aspects you will see that there has been also huge jump in recent years with the inclusion of many AI

based models. You will find that each and every u large NMSS you can say established NMSS they're utilizing AI IMD is also utilizing AI for taking a decision with respect to the early

warning. At the same time I'll tell you AI has come up as an hybrid model along with the physical models. you cannot uh get away with the physical models because physical models provide you the

physical understanding the reasoning and hence the human knowledge gets into the picture with the help of this physical models. So therefore AI has to be suitably connected with the physical

models that's what everyone is doing starting with European center or in Indian center and to do that also there's been many collaborations and integrations towards that.

So after that um uh if you look at the the basic uh backbone which is the modeling the modeling starts with the basic assumption that weather forecasting is an initial problem. You

cannot give weather forecast if you do not have what is the initial status of earth and atmosphere. So therefore the basic thing which we are talking of now that is already defined in the physical

modeling system unless you improve the data initial data with all types of observational tools and techniques you cannot improve the weather forecast. So therefore here by collecting or by

creating the data with the help of AI also will go a long way in improving not only the AI models but also the physical models and the hybrid models. Once you have to get data the quality of the data

can be improved with the help of the AI there are I'll tell you from satellite we get data a lot of data but only 5% data from satellite is usable we cannot use the data from satellites because of

the quality and further is that the quantity you cannot accommodate all types of data in the physical modeling system as um our friend sung was telling that you need infrastructure you do not

have a computational infrastructure where you can utilize 100% satellite data So yes you are true that in India we do not have sufficient computing infrastructure we have at least now 28

pa flop in IMD and outside of course with national super motion we have come up like that but that is not sufficient and therefore there is scope for public engagement for the augmenting the

computational infrastructure and other digital infrastructures but at the same time there is another scope because of AI now box model has come up a poor country a poor small nation cannot

venture or cannot even dream to have a high performance computing system they can go for AI system. A box model has come up where you can give it to small island nation and there with the help of

a few GPU GPU nodes they can have the forecast and that has come up and it will grow gradually and we will have the affordability to early warning with the help of this GPU based AIdriven or

datadriven models. So after that comes the forecast. Once you come to forecast now we have already come up to AI consensus but physical consensus plus AI consensus then again you will go for the

final forecast that is way then finally you go to the sectoral applications there is a huge scope here with the improvement economic conditions and societal conditions in every country to

improve our decision making for each and every sector and there AML can play a role so I urge upon all the industries academia R&amp;D and think tanks to collaborate with NMS especially with

India department other organizations here to have very authentic specific and judicious utilization of AI with limited reasonable resources available in the country. So thank you very much.

&gt;&gt; Thank you Dr. Mapatra for your valuable insights. Now since NDMMA is the APEC threshold body which basically will integrate all the variet systems into creating a

rugged AI systems I would like the entire audience to get the benefit of the vision of NDMA from member and HOD Dr. Krishna Vasa sir can you please elaborate uh how India may

intends to take this forward to create a sustainable lowcost at scale model for the country. &gt;&gt; So thank you very much for giving me this uh platform. Um I would like to

mention that we already have a huge amount of data that uh exist in relation to almost all the hazards. Look at the earthquakes you know uh we have we record all the micro earthquakes

you know for the entire country and the the kind of data that exists for the earthquakes which are below three also can give us a very good indication of the kind of earthquakes that we can

experience in the Himalayan and other regions and this data the availability ility of data is going to increase exponentially as we are investing in the observational

networks. Almost every mitigation program that we are doing we have included a significant aspect of uh early warning systems. Uh in next five years or so every

village in India will have an automated weather station. We will have large number of instrumentation for measuring landslides. We are going to at least you know

quadrupling the seismometers strong motion acceler. So uh we will be investing a huge amount of money in improving our observational networks across the hazards which will

mean that we will have access to still a larger amount of data. What is important is that we need to have that capacity to process the data and apply the AI models and improve the

precision of early warning. That's that's somewhere that is an area that is a sphere where we are struggling right now. It's one thing to set up the observational network. The another thing

is to how to collect the data, process the data and generate the information that could be used and know more so when it comes to you know informing the common citizens. Scientists is one thing

you are getting huge amount of data but we are not doing it for the scientists. We are doing it for the people who who get affected by disasters. So how do we go about it and the road map is not

sufficiently clear and I keep talking to all kinds of people somebody would come and say say that you set up a huge data center no okay that's fine great but people also say if you are setting up a

huge data center and you are not really empowering all the early warning agencies then how are you going to you know justify the investment in data centers

the data comes to individual uh agencies. How do these the data center and the individual early warning agencies interact so that we have a good model available?

So and we don't have unlimited resources. So the point is this is where we need more clarity. How do we go about you know using our existing networks to improve the the precision in early

warning risk information through a I know a a gradual incremental way of building capacities that of course includes the uh the the data center that should includes improving our connection

with the LLM models but it's also very very important that we need to know find a way of improving the overall architecture that is one area where we are struggling

and where we need some guidance. Thank you very much. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you sir. I think we are coming to the close of the discussion. I'll request Krishna sir to please give
