## 📝 Transcript

as a bridge to democratic access. Switzerland is very pleased to contribute to this global conversation at a pivotal time, a pivotal moment uh for responsible AI. Our message uh which

was supposed to be delivered by our president is very clear. AI can only serve the public good if it serves all languages and all cultures. Today, linguistic exclusion remains one of the

most persistent barriers to digital participation. Ensuring multilingual access is therefore not only a technical challenge, it's a democratic imperative. This discussion forms part of the

international arc that began with the Paris 2025 public interest AI process continues here at India AI summit 2026 and will advance further when Switzerland will happily host the Geneva

AI Summit in 2027. Our shared objective is contin continuity, cooperation and genuinely global approach to AI governance. Switzerland is proud that this session brings together partners

who embody open and collaborative innovation. India's Bashini initiative, current AI uh that emerged from the French AI summit and then many partners from the broader network of academic and

policy institutions of ICA, the international computation and AI network. uh such partners as Ellis, NTU, Singapore and of course the Swiss partners ETH and EPFL. IEN really

reflects Switzerland's commitment to equitable access to compute data and multilingual models. A notable example is Apertus which maybe many of you have heard of. It was developed by ETH Zurich

and EPFL. fully open and transparent multilingual model designed to support public interest applications across diverse linguistic communities. As we prepare for Geneva 2027, Switzerland

views multilingual AI as a foundation for inclusive digital public services and for strengthening participation across societies. Allow me to briefly just very briefly outline today's

agenda. We will begin with the announcement of the launch of the three new joint calls uh under the lead of the Indo Swiss uh joint research program JRP which is making a further strength of of

our bilateral ties um in science innovation and research between Switzerland and India. This will be followed by a panel discussion uh with distinguished international guests and

I'm very happy to announce that this will be moderated by my colleague Nina Frey the executive director of I can thank you so much for attending. I will hand over the floor to the next brief

speaker professor thren suede uh president of the Swiss National Science Foundation. Very warm welcome. Thank you. [applause] Your excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

namaste. It's my great pleasure to be here today with you. It's a moment to highlight a particularly exciting moment in the Indoswiss research collaboration. As

many of you know, Switzerland and India have long-standing trusted partnership in research built on reciprocity, on joint excellence, and on shared priorities.

Today, this collaboration is stronger than ever, and I'm delighted to announce three new calls for joint research projects as well as the launch of our new Indo-Swiss research framework

program between the Swiss National Science Foundation and our Indian partner organizations. This is a really remarkable convergence that underscores both the depths and the

breadths of our bilateral engagements. The three calls for joint research programs span a very diverse range of disciplines and are designed to foster cutting edge high impact research. The

first two calls that we launched earlier this year are in the geocciences and in the social sciences together with the Indian Ministry of Earth Sciences. We're inviting proposals on natural hazards in

mountain regions. a field of great relevance for both our countries as we're e each facing very unique geological challenges. In parallel, our call with the Indian

Council of Social Science Research opens the door for joint projects on pressing social and societal questions. Again, strengthening our collaboration in a domain where cross-cultural perspectives

are significantly enriching the research outcomes. And two weeks ago, the Swiss National Science Foundation together with the Indian Department of Biotechnology

and the Indian Council of Medical Research launched a third call focused on one health, a topic of real global urgency. This one health call is particularly important for us. It

reflects many months of preparations and close coordinations with our Indian partners and and embodies a holistic approach needed to understand interconnected health of humans, animals

and the environment. The challenges we face in this areas know no borders and international collaboration is indispensable. We therefore anticipate a very high uptake

and interest and participation of researchers in both our communities. Taken together, these three simultaneous calls represent an exceptional moment in Indoswiss research cooperation.

They showcase our commitment enabling ambitious science from fundamental research questions in the natural and the life sciences to complex issues shaped by society, geography or

technology. And with each call, we reaffirm our shared belief that long-term co-created research is the key to addressing the major challenges of our times.

So, building on these strong foundations, now is the right moment to announce a new strategic long-term collaboration, the Indoswiss research framework program between the SNSF and

our Indian partner organizations. We aim to create a program in which all researchers wishing to contribute to the Indoswiss cooperation can find appropriate support. Tematic calls on

strategic areas will be launched together with our Indian partnering partners and remain at the core of this program. And to this audience, it might not come as a real surprise that one of

the high priority topics we're currently considering is artificial intelligence. In addition to these bilateral and multilateral calls, I'm also pleased to announce that we are launching several

new measures and funding schemes to support collaborative research with our brand new explore, experiment, and expand grants. We want to give consorts the opportunities to explore new

collaborations, new networks, new partnerships. We want to allow them to experiment with blue sky thinking topics and methodologies that haven't been tried

before, but we also want allow them to expand on already established functional collaborations and build them in an innovative way into the future. We're also increasing mobility funding for

existing consortia to make sure that every project we fund by our program can lead to a durable collaboration, impactful events that connect with the wider society and all the career

researchers can truly benefit from the mobility and the capacity building. We plan to hold frequent flagship events both in Switzerland and in India to keep connecting our various partners of this

program from funding actors, beneficiaries of the calls, policy makers and prospective applicants and early career researchers. So make sure you follow our website and social media

and there's more updates coming soon. I want to extend my sincere thanks to all our partner organizations here in India for their continued trust and collaboration to and the two research

communities in both our countries that show a lot of enthusiasm and engagement in these programs. So, I encourage all interested researchers here in the room and out there to take advantage of these

new opportunities and continue building the bridges that make our partnership so successful and meaningful. Thank you very much for your attention. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much.

Well, thank you so much also from my side. My my name is Nina Fry or Katarina Fry as my colleague or former colleague Marcus Roy had introduced me. I am the executive director of Iken which is this

network linking uh already academic partners from Europe, Africa and Singapore. And I'm very glad that I have many representatives from the network that will be on the panel and actually

also one of the board members sitting in the second row from the Finnish supercomputing center. Thank you Damian for coming. So we have such a big panel representing IAN that is not even a

space for me. So I will be standing here and I would like to invite my panelists uh to take seat uh on the different names. I will introduce you and hand over the mic to you in a minute. Please

please have a seat. Turned out there was a seat for me. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I know. We do a group at 12:25. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; I have to stand

Now we can all take a picture. That's how you came. So, thank you so much. Thank you very much for bearing with us. for taking pictures. I

mean, we actually talk about language, but well, let me think about an analogy to pictures, but um we'll dive right into the the importance of I I would say adds to the language question obviously

also the the cultural and then contextual embedment of of different AI uh in the different settings. So again uh allow me to extend my my thank to all my distinguished panelists for coming

for also allowing us to show like how this I can collaboration works from very different angles. Uh the idea of this next 40 minutes is really to to try to give a in linear like a red line I think

you say uh between the different summits. Actually it started obviously in batchley and I hope we can then showcase how this topic of language and cultural diversity was somehow present

in all the different summits and and unites us all. Um since we're here in in your host country uh allow me to hand over the micros to you to to share with us like the why did bajini been funded

and uh we you had presented your work this morning to to me and Alex it was very impressive how it translated immediately live from Hindi to German to English. Uh but please share with us uh

maybe the next five minutes uh what what your work is what has it been and where where you're going. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Uh thank you very much Nina and uh thanks for inviting me here. Uh Bashini

is stands for Bhasha interface for India. So it is basically looking at 22 languages which are enshrined in our 8th schedule of constitution which basically says that we will conduct or we will you

know have these languages as the languages to start off with to for our work in the regions. uh we started off as a program uh for transcending the language barrier using

artificial intelligence in these 22 languages. Uh at the first base uh we had our own challenges but the methodology which we followed was to uh collaborate with 70 research institutes

across the country and the problem statement was actually divided in between all the 70 research institutes. uh we were solving five problems to uh work on. First was automatic speech

recognition. That means the digital systems should be able to understand what we are speaking in all 22 languages. Then we are looking at the second piece of it which is texttoext

translation in again biirectionally in all 22 languages. Third was text to speech which was basically again that the digital system should be able to speak to you that is again in 22

languages. And then we are looking at optical character recognition in 22 languages and also our digital our dictionary which is basically the vocabulary in all 22 languages are not

digitized. So there was an attempt to digitize all the vocabulary which is around that includes names of places, people, companies etc etc. Uh we have uh till now achieved uh 22 languages in all

the modalities. Uh we also have uh the increased the number of languages. Incidentally in India there are 100 languages which are spoken or written by at least 100,000 plus people. So our

journey is not complete when we do 22 languages. We are moving ahead uh with more languages. So we now have 36 languages on text and we are going to add more languages to move forward. We

also have languages which are don't have script uh and those are basically in the tribal area. So we are attempting to digitize that also and that is being digitized. One of them has been

digitized and will be launched in next few days. uh we also have uh so in all of this we had one basic challenge which was nonavvailability of digital data so the nonavailability was of digital data

which is oil to the AI models was basically done for the first time in the world as a brute force data digital data collection. So what we had done was that we would hire about 200 odd people who

would go down on the field and you know speak to the people on a certain subject uh pick up a picture or any other things so that it becomes the topic of discussion. We will create the

monolingual corpus by requesting them to write the same thing or bilingual corpus if they are you know having two languages and that is how we build the bare minimal digital data. Obviously

when we have done these things uh the model is like a child it only read 100 books so it will be as intelligent as those 100 books. So we realize that over a period of time we need to collect more

data that means give the child thousand books so he's more intelligent and more and that journey continues. So uh we have taken AI as a journey but we haven't waited for some things to become

perfect so that we are in a position to launch them as a product. We launched them and built a narrow use cases. The narrow use cases in the sense that okay let's build something for the farmers. I

will try to give two examples for want of time is one is that we have built up an interface for the farmers where farmers in their own language can ask a question about agriculture advisory and

he is he or she is answered in that particular language. So it's a voice first and voice journey. So that means I will be talking in voice and you know the answers will be coming on voice. So

that's a voice journey sequence. The other thing which we had actually experimented uh on or are working is this is a deployed system. So it is actually a very large system. We are now

we are working which is one of the things which have been displayed here is a project called gan bharam where uh you know the manuscripts have been made interactive plus we have multiple other

use cases perhaps I'll come to them during the discussion but means we have about 20 odd of them displayed in our stall but we have been focusing the clear point is that we have been

focusing on narrow use cases so that we are able to control the vocabulary and the purpose can deliver value because at the end of the day everybody has to contribute to the AI system especially

in the languages for it to improve and become perfect. &gt;&gt; Thank you Amitab. Thank you so much. And uh I somehow assumed everyone knows you but obviously I I should introduce you

as well so apologies for that. Uh Mr. Amitab he's the CEO of of Bajini the national language initiative. Um and we will be collaborating um Alex will be mentioning more uh later on on that but

before that I would would uh turn a year back to Paris um where obviously current AI was started and came out of the public interest AI working group if I if I think so u Mrs. Aya Paday you say

pedil sorry for that uh she's the CEO um quite recent CEO uh of of uh current AI very very important initiative that amongst others also wants to thanks in the topic that we're talking about but

please I know you come from a wrong background also in hardware uh you are launching I think this afternoon something very impressive that also helps the importance of language

diversity. Could you share with us some of your like key focus interest and also why you also focus on on hardware? Thank you. &gt;&gt; Uh thank you so much for having me. So

my name is Ayab. I yes did join recently about a month and a half ago. Uh exactly. Uh so uh really feeling the very warm welcome in in India. Um current AI uh was a initiative that came

out uh of the French AI summit. Uh the founder Martin Tisney was the special envoy of President Mcron at the summit. Um and the uh initiative uh essentially has a vision uh for AI that is global,

that is collaborative and that is collective. And so the idea is that um if we were uh if we acknowledge that some of the biggest uh tech companies that are really uh governing our lives

and really governing AI um and the way we consume it uh in day-to-day uh they are a handful of these companies. Uh they are big, they have scale, they have a lot of financial resources and they

are very ambitious. And so the initiative acknowledges that to be able to stand the chance to be an alternative uh and a counterpart to these uh large companies, we must fight scale with

scale. Uh and so obviously there is lots of uh interesting work happening in public interest AI around the world. But often times the work is distributed, the work is decentralized and uh and

sometimes it's duplicative and it's not always additive. And so as a result uh AI has this vision that we need to sort of um um bring bring together uh and bring more collaboration into the space

but also uh raise the level of uh ambition and of financial scale uh that has taken on. So uh uh current AI is a public private partnership uh between philanthropy

um between the private sector and governments. uh initial it has initial commitments of about $400 million. Uh but the ambition is to get to two and a half billion dollars and hopefully more.

Um the initial commitments are from the uh French government. Uh there are also partners multiple other governments including the Indian government, the Kenyan government, Moroccan uh and many

others. Uh um as well as from MacArthur Foundation, Ford Foundation, McGovern and a few others uh and the private sector. So Google DeepMind uh Salesforce and others. So it really is a public

private partnership uh with the intention of kind of bringing everybody around the table that has sort of the same commitment to public interest AI to AI that works for um individuals and for

the public good. Um and the one of the main vehicles of doing that is really investing in open source. um language um has been a priority for current AI ever ever ever since its inception. The

initiative was called multilingual diversity which I know is something everybody here is committed to and we've been hearing a lot about over the past few days. Um I joined about a month ago

and I'm um myself very passionate about the topic. Um and I uh and I sort of expanded the topic to be about uh culture diversity and culture preservation. So it's really not just

about language. It's also about acknowledging that culture exists in many facets. Language is one of them. But there are also behaviors, there are norms, uh there are also uh artifacts,

physical and digital artifacts. And there are many things that are digitized and un nondigitized. And so we now talk about culture preservation as our as one of our big priorities. Um and it's

something that we'll be doing a lot of work in. um as part of the culture preservation work. Um also when I came in there had already been conversations between current AI and Bashni about

doing a collaboration together for the summit. Um and to be honest I fell in love with the work that Amitab and his team were doing and and the care uh that they were taking with their dialects and

languages and and really the fact that they were going to sort of the source um and getting a lot of this uh uh this this this knowledge, you know, not just data, this knowledge about about the

language from from individuals and from communities themselves, no matter how small they were. Um, and so we uh we ended up collaborating on a device that will launch later today at 3:30 in room

10. Hope you all can attend. I'm not going to say much about it because there's a drum roll situation that will happen. So you guys can come see, you all can come see for yourselves. Um but

the intention of the device is to really get as far as close as possible to the individuals and the communities themselves. Um there is one concern I have uh that could be kind of a negative

repercussion I think of having so much attention on multilingual diversity in a in a summit like this which is this idea that a lot of the big companies and big players have to do all the work. And so

uh Um, you know, this is it's it's interesting and positive that, you know, the big big tech companies are saying we're going to make commitments to mold more multilingual diversity and more

languages. That's good. But oftentimes when you uh when they are uh kind of in the leadership taking these positions, they are there's a brute force kind of uh um methodology that they deploy

because of the scale at which they operate in. And so oftentimes it's about scraping data. Often times it's about uh taking data without licensing it. It's about uh treating individuals and

communities as data where are whereas they are people and they are not data. And so um that's sort of my concern in this area and I believe that we have to get as close as possible to the

communities themselves and in invite them and support them in doing that kind of work themselves. So, it's really about them preserving their own cultures and languages and not about us doing it

for them in this sort of like somewhat condescending way. Um, I'll also say one last thing which is um I myself grew up in Beirut in Lebanon. Um, a very uh tiny country but that everybody has heard of

sometimes for good and not good reasons. Um, but um you know Arab uh Arab language is also uh um very concerned about AI and representation in AI and he we have thousands of different cultures

and dialects within within Arab culture and we also have varying uh degrees of resource uh availability across Arab countries. Some countries are very resourced financially um from a you know

government perspective others are very very have scarce access to resources. So uh I'm also very concerned about thinking about AI that is more uh resilience that operates from scarcity

and operates from frugality and operates from uh a limited um amount of resources uh and looking at that as a positive as opposed to a negative. So that's something that current AI will be

prioritizing in a big way and we'll hope to do more of. So hope to see you all at 3:30 and hope you will uh drum roll with us when we when we call for it. So thank &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. A ya. Um let me hand

over because you mentioned like the obviously the the many announcement they were were made as well also from private companies to start collecting data. I think it's it's fantastic to see that

governments can do that as well. uh and that you also invest from in this PPP so far and allow me to hand over to my colleague sitting to my left because I think you can also showcase how also

public institutions like universities can also train a model multilingual from scratch a scratch not stretch it was probably a stretch sometimes but uh let me introduce you uh to Dr. Alex Ilich uh

he uh founded and is the executive director of the AI center uh a co-founder also of iican um and please uh could you share your experiences with apertus uh which is this multilingual

model and uh and maybe also mentioned something on Swiss AI and how like the Indian languages we can maybe then present next year um in in aertos Alex please.

&gt;&gt; Yeah thank you very much uh for the warm introduction and also I' like expanding maybe on the point that ya made like u you know big tech won't won't solve it. Um I think there's [clears throat] a big

big role to play for academia and uh always there was the question when can academia step in. So in uh Switzerland we are in a very fortunate situation that we have a supercomput that allows

us to do frontier scale models. So over 11,000 GPUs of the newest generation. We were worldwide the first one to get those GPUs. And uh we already released uh the world's first fully open language

model Apertos at 70 billion parameter scale. Um it's basically a team up between ETH Turk and ETFL. Um and we learned a lot in this this process. So first of all we achieved a performance

that's comparable to the open weight models from meta and and others as well. So performance-wise, but then we also put a deliberate focus that we don't do English first and then let's tune it for

other languages, but we built the multilingual part in from the beginning. So um in Switzerland, we have already you know four languages, many dialects as well. So I think we faced the same

challenge and it was also quite interesting to see that in some areas you don't actually need so much data to increase the uh capabilities of the model. Um I will come back to a little

bit on you know how far are we off um for the goal. Um but basically we were able to build this model and one of the key bottlenecks that we also identified is it's not just the infrastructure

where currently a lot of money is going in but also the talent outside of big tech you have maybe 100 people on the planet who have the experience and capabilities to build such foundation

models and that's not enough. Yeah. And I think that's something where academia can change it. And I think that's why it's important. We not just need supercomput and data centers for the

companies. We needed to empower academia. This is very very critical that we also push this very very strongly. Um we named the model Apetus Latin for open because we wanted to be a

foundation where everyone can take it and build on top of it. So it's not something that you know we force up on someone but it's something that can be a thriving community where each each uh

university each project each country gets a step f further and I think we will hear later a little bit from the perspective also from Singapore from India we already heard there there are

not many countries that recognize how important that is as a public infrastructure that you know you really take it serious to develop your own benchmarks

and your your own data sources as well. Yeah. Because today still if you read LinkedIn whatever the majority is driven by benchmarks that the big companies are publishing and surprise in every

benchmark they publish they are of course the best. Yeah. Because they pick what is ever the metric that's usable and I think this metric should be driven by you know what do we want it to be uh

in in the cultures in the regions to empower this. Yeah. And so we have thousand languages included because we traed trained it with data on the internet. As you know the internet is

not the most diverse data source. There is uh 60% of the data uh in our training set is English. 40% is non-English. And uh so what we thinking about now strategically is how can we increase the

number of languages that are close to the performance we see in English step by step for the next 100 languages and so on. And this is uh I think like important because many companies that

are going in that area and say oh we sponsor a data collection effort they just do it on best effort like you let's do something and you don't know does it actually move the needle. So the next

step for us is that you know with all the experiences you know in Bashini and other parts I think we can find out now very strategically how much does it cost us to raise the bar significantly not

just make a check mark out out of that. So that would be also the hope for connecting forward through the mission of uh iican and also Geneva next next next year that we can present also you

know how far of a progress could we make like where do we stand today that it's really usable and economically usable and and to elevate this I think that's that's super critical um on on that side

and uh yeah we also very happy that from the side from Singapore already with the experience there's the first version of of sea lion that's already built on on Apatus and uh we want to extend the

collaborations now globally. Um for the researchers we also have a very strong international program like where we share basically our compute infrastructure. So that's also very very

unique and we would like to see also other countries to do that because we know that you know for where we stand with AI today we're maybe at five or 10% of the potential to train the next

models that are you know including more data becoming more aware of the physical world and so on we need more compute we need to team up and I think that's also a question of how can we collaborate

more and and share more and uh with I can I think like in the beginning we had this like the the bottlenecks you know uh comput that's But we have strong compute uh uh representation uh its data

and benchmarks and it's its talent and I think on these three capabilities we need to jointly increase and whoever doesn't have it should be able to easily get it from from other sides to do it

themselves basically. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you so so much Alex and also for emphasizing the the talent uh need and I think if I can just add that uh you mentioned the talent or the

capabilities in knowing how to train a model uh something that and and again I'm looking at the supercomputing representatives I mean it's also a talent in knowing how to build up such

an HPC so I think that's something we could also add to the table uh but allow me to come back to to the models themselves and the really very concrete applications. Now I'm turning first left

to to the north uh to the Fins. Petri um you're here as obviously as a founding member of of Ian but al representing Ellis network but also the team Finland if I can say that but you were also

member of the HL lab of the UN secretary general. So where you one of the recommendation was also exactly this that we collaborate. Um could you mention uh maybe more from the

perspective of the Nordics you had already your own uh language models but maybe also you can share some thoughts on uh why you recommended that to the to the to the world if I can say that.

&gt;&gt; Yes, thank you. So happy to be here. So indeed I mean as as you all know uh Nordic languages are not the biggest major languages in the world. So obviously we take the kind of the pres

preservation of our languages and cultures very seriously. Uh talking about the HL lab of the UN there was just upstairs a kind of a handover to the inter new in international uh

independent scientific panel on AI. So uh maybe one thing I learned at uh at the in this UN advisory body was that uh uh I didn't know this but like one thing I learned was that uh access to language

and culture is a human right. One of the human rights that all the countries in the world have accepted. So to me this was surprise and pleasant surprise because as also like language is already

important because we operate with language but like what I was saying like even more important is the culture behind the language we have different value frameworks and norms in different

countries. So if there's one sizefits all English version uh AI that we all start to use what is the value framework behind that. So that's kind of I think this is a very critical issue. Another

thing I learned uh in UN was that uh I mean like and that's why uh is that there are several uh global initiatives towards like making this more accessible to all all countries. Seven of the UN

member states of 193 countries are in included in all these initiatives. 119 countries are included in none. So initiatives like I can or current AI or this uh this summit are very important

to make this more inclusive. So I now shamelessly steal a quote from Yoshua Beno who was just upstairs saying saying like we need to make sure that all the countries in in the world are invited to

the dinner table but not part of the menu but they are dining guests. So, I think this was hilarious. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much for sharing. I didn't hear, but it's a I think it's a good

thing that we can take up because also obviously food is very cultural diverse. Thank you. So, let me turn from from the north first more to the south and uh to Singapore. You were also quite recently

I think at NU Singapore which is also the newest member of IANE. you had already developed and I think you will share something on the sea lion model which is obviously for the AAN region

the the famous language model but you also had already collaboration with Apatus and if time allows because I would also allow I need to speak but if time allows you could also mention

something on the importance of sovereignty uh and language please &gt;&gt; so it's wonderful um we interview Singapore um with the newest members of and and it's but it's fantastic that the

and I'm I've only been into Singapore for six months but it's you know the conversation that's being we're having here is the same conversation that we're having I mean um about the importance of

uh kind of multilingual diversity the importance of uh getting close to the ground um the the importance of culture as well as tech and I'm I'm the dean of a college of humanities arts and social

sciences I'm a historian um you know sort of and and it's where my knowledge is is you know in the lead collaborating with computer science interu kind of in developing and engaging um with Cine and

thinking about kind of AI in the context we're talking about. So um you know as points very very important that um it's it's about culture and thinking about culture diversity and and um how AI

models etc reflect um culture how we engage with culture um and history etc as well as simply technology. I think that's that's that's something that's very evident in this this conversation

which is so it's great to be part of this this club. Um so um uh Caline is is uh a large a language model um that reflects um uh 13 languages across Southeast Asia and in fact includes

Tamil because Tamil is a Tamil is a Southeast Asian language because it's a important um national language within within Singapore um with aspirations actually to kind of expand potentially

connect beyond uh uh to other parts of of Asia. Um it's um it's a a nationally funded initiative. I mean it's it's but it connect from Singapore but so it's it's you know part of uh Singapore's

public infrastructure but then it connects regionally and is you know used by um has has good connections with private sector providers across Southeast Asia platforms in Indonesia on

various things etc. So um it's and and you know as as we're hearing a moment moment ago I mean there's a number of different versions of it. One of them is built on appetites. So there's a a real

synergy here. Um, and I think, you know, I just want to flag the connection between Singapore and Switzerland. They're both multilingual, multicultural, um, you know, kind of,

uh, small, relatively small societies. So, there's a very obvious kind of, uh, there's a very obvious, um, uh, collaboration there. And I think one another echoing again something that I

was saying is when we're thinking about AI and we're thinking about the relationship between culture and language, we're also interested in frugality. We're also interested in in

using resources effectively and in thinking about how we can um you know draw on sort of deep truths about language and culture without vast amounts of data you know kind of with

relatively small amounts of data. I mean one of the you know we have lang languages like leos and kamair etc within sea lion and so you're re you know the um colleagues are really

thinking hard about you know how you how you leverage relatively small amounts of language to kind of to to to then produce an effective model in discussions um just a couple of couple

of additional um points and I'm looking at the clock um the sovereignty is the big word uh within the AI summit something I'm I'm a historian I'm a actually in some ways of sovereignty at

the moment. I mean and um and you know kind of sovereignty means power. It's a power that we that we want for ourselves, for our communities, for our nation states. Um um but in a sense it's

also about individuals as well. And there's a kind of complicated relationship between those those two things. And um and so so I just wanted to kind of just just reflect on I

suppose the importance of sovereignty and that you know we're talking about um uh like the the sovereignty of societies that are I guess neither the US or China in this discussion. you know the two big

superpowers maybe um and one of the think one of you know this discussion is about how we how we can think about a world that is multi-olar that is and and is multicultural and and reflect the the

the fact that you know sovereignty actually is dispersed in the in the world in which we live in and that's very important and that's you know Indian principles of non-alignment that

go back to the 1940s you know uh and and and so on so uh I don't know if that I'm allowed to use that phrase in today's India but anyway it's a similar set of princip principles that we're talking

about. So um so the dis dispersal of sovereignty that we're talking about here and power is important but it's also as part of that I think to reflect the limits of the nation state I suppose

and the limits of kind of national approaches to language um in that we all live in environments in which people speak complicated multi they're multilingual societies in a

minute-by-minute way people code switch they they're speaking Hindi in one one minute you know they're speaking English the next you know kind of Swiss German etc. Similarly in Singapore people speak

you know Mandarin Chinese then they speak kind of a Chinese dialect and then they'll speak English and you know so um the the sovereignty is is crucial but we need to if we're interested in the

sovereignty of the individual and power the power of individuals then we need to be have a have a more nuanced account of of of language that allows for things like code switching you know and and

dialects etc and that's something that we're very much interested in in in NU. Thank you so much and thank you to all the speakers. also allow Annie uh to speak because I think you're obviously

from South Africa but now living in in Switzerland and the US and and um you uh lead this linkages between medicine and then the AI and I always think you explain very very concretely in your

work what if you just take an English speaking language and train it in a tiny set of local data ls how you experience that in the medical field in reality. So if you could share something on that and

uh obviously also your role in I can thank you Annie, Professor Annie, she's at EPFL at the moment and then Yale. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, so thank you very much and uh

I I think I will I'll take it down to the ground then about like the consequences about what happens uh like really when you are at a patient's bedside and you ask questions that are

high stakes and something that I do to just test these models in different places because we are rolling out these tools in different hospitals around the world. I asked the same question which

is a very high stakes question of how to treat diabetic ketoacidosis which is a diabetic crisis in a child right and I did this recently in Ethiopia in a language that's not very

well known up in Romo and it responded to me thou shalt not eat insulin on a Tuesday and and and I I I did I did share this advice with the with the with the I thought it was actually very good

advice you should not insulin any day actually but uh but but but I did share this advice but it it's it comes to something that's really really important I'm stating the obvious but it means

that if you do not like because it obviously only trained on the Bible right that that's something that is that's that's very available that's the the one book that is available in every

single language in the world and so you have these biblical kind of terms but the Bible isn't like very like necessarily very accurate in medicine or other things but uh but depending on

where you're coming from. But the thing is that you can't rely on these models to make these decisions because they are inequitably inaccurate in the places that need it most. So we know that

they'll be inaccurate, but the the point is that we actually have to if we're collecting this kind of information, we have to make an effort to collect it in the highest stakes environments and in

those context. So if you have use cases for collecting language, it's interesting to collect it in maybe historical texts or to represent culture of course but I think something that has

a much bigger urgency are the urgent questions. These are high stakes decisions that we are making and people will believe that the model performs well if it only speaks a language but

they might get a false sense of security if we don't really train it to be accurate in the questions that people are relying on these tools the most. So this is why we actually have to when we

collect languages and when we are trying to test these tools in reality we have to make sure that we represent those kinds of contexts and that's what we are doing. So um I'm I lead a lab called

light. It's the laboratory for intelligent global health and humanitarian response technology. So obviously I'm interested in these high stakes environments and these cultures

that are so underrepresented that they will never be represented with any kind of large commercial enterprise. Right? No commercial entity has ever said there's a great place to make money and

it's that war zone. Okay, unfortunately they have I suppose but but but um but but the point is that people don't want to represent that kind of place because it's not in their interests. And this

means that it is so important for academia to play a role. We don't we we're not we don't just play a role because we've got expertise. We play a role because we we do something that

commercial entities cannot provide it. It is we are neutral and we create a neutral space for this kind of collection of data to represent the needs of people and also to make sure

that we can test it in reality. Right? This is why we we can do open science. Um it's because we don't have like any money in the game to to lose, right? And the most important thing to do is

actually to see when we do represent these languages. Not just to represent them and be happy about it, which is the first step, but to go the extra mile to actually test whether the languages are

being represented as you expect them to be. So some of like like some of my patients for example, it might speak their language, but does it speak their language in the way that they expect?

And do they follow the advice or don't they? And this is a really important thing to test in these high stakes environments. My patients will come to me and uh in in South Africa we speak 11

official languages and in in Plaza a way of of it's a way of explaining certain things is it's very different and it gets translated into English in a strange way sometimes. And and so one of

my patients came to tell me, you know, I've got I've got elephants running in my head, right? I know exactly how to respond because I'm that's my culture. I'm South African. So, but what would

what would an AI respond, right? And and I have a pregnancy in my knee, right? I'm pregnant in my knee. That's that's a patient came to tell and that's that's actually it doesn't come from a

mistransation. It comes from the way that people understand how their bodies work. And this is very very cultural. what is the next most likely word after pregnancy in my knee? Right? So, it's

really important that we understand how it works when it's on the ground and taking these models on the ground, right? And testing it with clinical trials um and making sure that we get

feedback from reality. This is what we're trying to do. So, we have starting with IA um a flagship project that we that we made. It's called Move. It stands for massive open online

validation and evaluation. And it's about getting these real world signals from real people in high stakes decision- making processes from our doctors from the people on the ground in

different countries around the world and to get that information from how they are using any tool because we got neutral. We don't if any tool comes out any new model we can test it and then we

get how it works and then when it breaks we don't just say oh this model is bad in this setting and this model is good we really try to get that information and put it back into the model to

continuously improve it and so learning from reality learning from the real workflows of how people use models and I think that's important to to represent reality um and not just the language but

the reality that the language functions Um, so last thing I'd like to say about this is this does cost a little bit more money and it and it's not the traditional kind of way of working in

science and people don't appreciate that implementation [clears throat] science is science and it's such a fantastic opportunity where we can actually do impact like actually measure

it the impact of the models that we are making. we can measure it and feed that back into our models and really create impact driven models and to run these trials it's ambitious but we do need to

start for asking like different kinds of funding and being being more ambitious and I think academia does need to be more ambitious because we are representing something that's actually

very important these days which is and very rare um which is this neutrality when open AI updated from 4.5 to to five or to 5.1. Did they ask your permission?

No. Right. Did they ask the doctors who had validated those models for their context? No. We need control. We need to know how these tools work in reality. And we need to be able to control the

tools. And sovereignty for me is control of tools and control of the environment and to understand how these models work in reality. So that we when we want to update it and what we update it with. So

yeah, thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you honestly. Thank you everyone for [applause] Thank you everyone for keeping the time

and for making sure that we are actually creating the menu and controlling the menu to also steal Professor Benel's words and for contributing here and uh I think we will be more than happy to

update you hopefully next year on our more joint collaborative work. Thank you everyone for coming for staying with us and on the speakers. Thank you. &gt;&gt; [applause]
