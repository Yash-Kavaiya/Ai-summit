## 📝 Summary

The panel discussion situates India's opportunity at the intersection of these two forces: AI providing cognition, autonomy, and predictive intelligence, while 6G provides real-time sensing, extreme reliability, and pervasive connectivity across terrestrial, aerial, maritime, and satellite systems. In this emerging paradigm, networks themselves become AI-native—the radio interface, the RAN, the core, and the edge begin to reason, adapt, self-organize, and optimize through multi-agent intelligence
