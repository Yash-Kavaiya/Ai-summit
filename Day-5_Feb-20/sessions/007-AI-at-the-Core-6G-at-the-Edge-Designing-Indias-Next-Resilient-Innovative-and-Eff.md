## 📝 Summary

The panel discussion situates India's opportunity at the intersection of these two forces: AI providing cognition, autonomy, and predictive intelligence, while 6G provides real-time sensing, extreme reliability, and pervasive connectivity across terrestrial, aerial, maritime, and satellite systems. In this emerging paradigm, networks themselves become AI-native—the radio interface, the RAN, the core, and the edge begin to reason, adapt, self-organize, and optimize through multi-agent intelligence

## 📝 Transcript

opportunity ensuring that India moves from being a consumer of global technology cycles to becoming a sharper of the world's next intelligence and connectivity frontier.

To kick off the discussion, I would like to invite Mr. Ashok Kumar, Deputy Director General, Department of Delhi Communication, Government of India to deliver a keynote address.

Thank you. So my colleague panelist the expert panelist here distinguished dignitaries in the hall and other participants gathered here.

So it's my privilege to deliver the keynote address before uh such a gathering. So although the hall is like empty but I suppose uh many of our participants are online.

Uh the theme of this session AI at the core 6G at the edge uh captures the transformative journey which we have started now. So let me go back slightly uh back in the history

when we rolled out 2G, 3G and 4G, the vision was to connect we human beings. And as technology progressed, we started connecting machines

and objects uh through innovations like NB IoT as all of us know although they were not part of the original vision and we can say that

those were evolutions extensions and maybe we can also call that as afterthought. when the work on 5G started at ITU way back in 2012

uh if you recall after 3 years of deliberations with all the state on 90 plus countries and also the sector members like industry academia. So ITU released a 5G framework they call

it I IMT 2020 and the for the first time the usage scenario the three usage scenario and vision by ITU included support for massive connectivity of objects and

machines and also the applications which required very very low latency. So what uh we should say that for the first time a technology was designed. It was not an afterthought even for machines. Not only

for we humans but also for the machines. As we know that uh the 5G journey started with 3GBP release 15 and that was also delivered in three part right uh just to start early. So they had

three part of releases of release 15 and then every one and a half years or two years we have the next evolution of the 5G technology and when we reach to uh release 18 and that is also called 5G

advanced. So basically AI artificial intelligence uh began to be integrated at part of the network functions or to solve some of the network functions requirement. So

again this was some sort of a afterthought right because we started our vision was not the native integration of AI into the 5G system but as technology evolved we started doing

that perhaps the precursor of the 6G the sift now which we are seeing in 6G the story is different uh if you look at the ITU framework for 6G which was released 2 years back uh So that has got six

usage scenarios. They have envisioned six usage scenario and one of the usage scenario is integrated artificial intelligence and communications. So now the artificial intelligence is part of

the initial thought itself and more important along with those six usage scenarios what ITU conceived is the four overarching principles. the four uh the key uh design principle we can say and

one of the design principle if you read is ubiquitous intelligence. So when we say ubiquitous intelligence what we mean is that every element of our end to end 6G system be it uh the user equipment or

be it the radio or be it core or be it applications everyone will use AI embedded natively into the system. So, so the earlier generations if you talk about connected humans and objects or

machines 6G will actually correct the intelligence as it is envisioned in the ITU uh document and uh of course 3GPP has started working on all those aspects.

So this is a kind of a historic opportunity for we in India particularly for our ecosystem uh that is our MSME startup academia and everyone. So it's an opportunity not only to like

participate in the standard so that our technology our innovations becomes part of the standard but also to build our own end toend 6G uh technology stack. So what are the different government

efforts since I come from a government department of telecom. So I would also like to touch upon what are different efforts the government is trying to do to create an robust ecosystem of 6G

research and innovations. Of course government alone cannot do everything but whatever effort we are trying. So one of the important aspect is about whatever technology we are trying to

develop right uh whatever IP we are trying to create if that enters into the standard 3GPP standard itself it's it's good for us that we are saping the standards the India is also uh for the I

mean we started doing such activities uh from 5G onwards before that we were not at all participating in the 6G I telecom technologies standard making. So to support our uh startup

etc onto this. So if a startup company want to say participate in 3GPP standards that company has to be member of first our SDOS TSDSI and also individual

members of 3GPP and that's a cost right. So at DOT we are supporting TSDSI so that uh our startups can be member of TSDSI and 3GPP at a very very low cost of 10,000 not five lakh 6 lakh and they

can participate so that's it's a continuous thing which we try uh trying and doing in addition to that as we know that unless we do our own uh kind of a research and technology de development

even before standards starts uh uh building up and then take it to the standard. So to support that activity we had come out with a scheme called 6G accelerated research program. So uh that

was floated uh uh I think 2 years back and we have selected 100 plus 6G related projects in different area that includes terahertz technology artificial intelligence machine learning uh

semantic communications and every aspect of uh sensing every aspect of the vision of the 6G and those projects are progressing uh uh and we are trying to help them also participate into the

standard. In addition to that, we have also supported some uh 6G related test bed like terraertz test bed and and one AOC test bed which is doing very good work

as of now. In addition to that there are many uh other programs which are sort of in progress. For example, recently uh we worked with uh ANRF wherein we are trying to come out with a uh uh scheme

wherein uh we are trying to build end to end uh system based on release 18 and evolve it to release 19 20 and 21. As you know that release 21 would be the first release of 60. So we're trying to

do that and perhaps that will uh come uh very soon uh maybe in the next two quarters that will be out. In addition to that uh I would also like to take name of Bharas 6G Alliance here

because uh uh we are also closely working with Bas 6G Alliance as government. So Bharas 6G Alliance has uh created multiple working group on technology on spectrum on devices and

some of the members or chair of those uh uh working groups are here as part of this session also. So uh so so basically Bhas 6G Alliance is kind of suggesting government that what next to be done to

be leader in 6G and and based on that uh we are trying to uh uh uh I mean uh shape the policies of the government. In addition to department of telecom uh our other uh ministries like MIT is also

supporting uh various uh 6G related projects. I would take name of the scheme of DST which is RDI. So once you have a technology perhaps you want to scale RDI will come handy and we have

taken up with DST that telecom sector uh should be included as part of the sector which will be supported in the RDI and secretary DST had uh agreed to this particular aspects and whenever the

schemes are getting floated uh our companies our startup in the field of telecom can actually apply as part of DST. they also have uh they had been running cyber physical programs. So they

are also they are supporting some of the uh 5G and 6G related projects. One more important thing which DOT did uh uh previous years which was actually announced in the budget and inaugurated

by our honorable prime minister was 100 5G lab in 100 different institute across the country. Those labs are actually operational. So those are uh some of the points where actually 6G research has

also started because once you have good knowledge of 5G and if you are able to develop use cases or 5G network elements itself perhaps you are ready to do something on 6G and so my request to

industry here those who are online that please adopt one or two 5G lab and try to work with them that what more can be done in the technology area. With this, I want to conclude my address by

inviting the esteemed panelist to deliberate and provide further suggestions to not only the government but also to the industry, MSME and startup and academia on the way forward

uh on this exciting direction. So I wish the session a great success. Thank you Jind. [applause] Thank you sir. So now we are moving to

our very next segment the panel discussion. Our first speaker is Rajiv Saluja, vice president 5G radio at Reliance Jio. Also joining us is Surrojit Roy, a

senior telecommunications leader, head of technology, technology and solutions COE at Nokia India. Sundep Sharma, a technology leader and AI innovator, vice president and global

head of emerging technologies network services at Tech Mahindra. The dialogue will be moderated by Radha who heads the technology engineering and innovation function for network

solutions and services NSS at TCS. Before we start this panel discussion, I would like all the speakers to have group photograph please. May I also request Ashok Kumar sir to be here.

Thank you, sir. &gt;&gt; Okay. Can we start? Great. So good morning our distinguished guests colleagues from the government industry

and academia all of you who are online this good morning to you all as well. So uh this entire topic which you can read out a at the core and uh 6G at the edge and designing India's next resolent

innovative and efficient digital frontier. So we are at a historic uh inflection point where the intelligence is the basic infra based on which the next uh

evolution of this planet will actually continue and uh we have seen until 5G but in the 6G a lot of hope and we see that 6G not only emerge as a faster network as an option but it as a

distributed computed fabric. It is a it'll it's going to be a have a platform that enables the intelligence everywhere across radio core and uh edge including your satellite which is

nontrestrial networks and the sensor ecosystems devices uh in 6 and AI will take a major role we'll talk about how the 6D payloads or the designs will actually be

AI native how it will drive the overall uh objective of bringing AI and 6G together. As a sar has already pointed out the standards have already been taken AI native to the 6G standards

which is coming up. He's marked us next two quarters. It's quite optimistic but yes we are looking forward for the festival to come and thanks for the government to give all the support to

the industry academia and uh the bariki alliance is also doing a great job uh and our honorable minister and prime minister actually are actively supporting and giving directions time to

time to get this uh forward. So we will uh focus on the edge interfaces at a scale. We'll talk about semantic communications where uh like you would have seen a the India has

really put a very strategic uh point of view that AI is we will ensure that AI is kind of energy efficient. It will not be responsible for melting the data centers. It will be power efficient and

we will uh ensure that every compute capacity is being optimally utilized not like uh we have enough of compute and we'll use it as much as possible and uh data is a strategic fuel for this AI and

uh the networks telecom networks it's not only 6G but all kinds of connectivity networks they will drive this data the strategic fuel to the users to the sensors to the cloud to the

computing systems and deliver it. So here we go. We start. I think all our panelists are there. Uh I think their names are already there in the back side of the uh screen. So I'll just start

with some of the questions. So maybe you will I'll start with uh Surrojit. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So Surjit I have uh the first question for you. the India in the

context of India's in the context of 6D vision where networks are expected to reason self-organize and optimize across ecosystem run core edge and of course when you say

edge it includes devices and uh the sensors how do you see AI is transforming uh the RAM for the 16 the day one you may throw some light on that please

&gt;&gt; yeah Sure. So I think uh we can talk about it in in few steps. For example, first one is on the devices. So we have uh you know many form factor of devices coming up. We already have smart glasses

launched. You know uh we had this AR VR glasses earlier where we could not see outside but then now we have glasses which look more like the normal glasses we wear. But those are having this AI

functionalities right uh you can do lot many you know work in the background and and nobody would know that you are actually looking at something else while you are talking to a person. So I think

from the device perspective the intelligence is being built up in the devices. Uh handsets uh there was a talk that maybe all these smart glasses and variables will take away the handset but

then I guess these handsets are going to stay for a while. I don't know till when but at least for the next four or five years those are going to stay and we we will also have lots of variables right

and maybe some uh you know body patches as well which can sense your heart rate so so as a person as an user I I see that uh we'll be having multiple devices going forward not only one device we'll

have handset we'll have smart glasses we'll have variables right and this all will be having AI enabled you know capabilities but because of the form factor you know the these devices

might not be able to do all the inferencing task on on their own. So which which means that there will be some inferencing help needed from the uh data centers whether it is centralized

or edge data centers. So which means you know there will be lots of traffic requirements towards the network especially in the uplink. &gt;&gt; Okay. So Rojett if you would like to

expand it a little further the inferencing is now tiered distributed that's what I'm mentioning so what percentage maybe you can take an average application will be there residing in

the devices and sensor side what percent is in the RAM what percent is in the core of the network premises and what will go to the cloud yeah I think we don't have those exact numbers but I

think uh if I look at the data traffic as such the van traffic so It's it's going to grow maybe 6 to nine times from now till 2033. There's a projection we have from Nokia Bill Labs

and out of the total traffic uh in 2033 uh almost 30% will be AIdriven right. So 30% traffic will be AIdriven. It can be direct AI which can be slightly lesser but the indirect AI where you know once

you use any uh application it it drives you towards some other application and that that increases your data. &gt;&gt; Maybe right now we have we're in the 5% of the AI traffic it'll go to 30%. 30%

&gt;&gt; in next 3 years &gt;&gt; not 3 years I think the projection is by 2033 around 2033 &gt;&gt; so it it might get to 30% &gt;&gt; right now the

&gt;&gt; yeah is getting embedded to all our life faster than we had thought of &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; so any of you would like to address this thing like uh how much of influencing

would you like to see from the &gt;&gt; uh in the edge itself like for example of course cloud has to do large part of it &gt;&gt; yeah on that what I can comment maybe

sep and Rajiv can also add. So uh first thing is you know uh it really depends on the use case. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; Physical AI use cases like autonomous

vehicles, robots, I think autonomous vehicles are definitely picking up in US and China. &gt;&gt; But if I look at India, I think it's going to take some time because we don't

follow rules. Uh you know we have a bad habit of driving. You know I think the AI models have to tune to understand how the drivers drive in India right so I think uh autonomous vehicles will take

some time uh but those are the use cases autonomous vehicles industrial robots maybe robotic surgeries where you need much lower latencies those are the ones where the inferencing might be needed at

the edge but I think for normal consumers and normal use cases is &gt;&gt; mhm &gt;&gt; we can still manage with the inferencing at the central location right

&gt;&gt; but the main problem is uh having a centralized data center establishing that is a problem because I think the power consumption and the power requirements site infrastructure

&gt;&gt; those are a major challenge and that's why we see a trend that the data centers are gradually moving towards the edge maybe not driven by only the use cases but maybe driven by the infrastructure

&gt;&gt; yeah a lot of a heavy dose of this data set related concerns were there for last 4 days in the summit. So Rajie if I can come to you. So question for is are you witnessing a shift from Telos

uh as a connectivity providers to intelligence utilities and how does the G your organization's plan to deliver intelligence at the lowest cost right you know so in the past decade like

Ashokar also mentioned was about democratizing the connectivity right today more than 99% of India's population is connected by with highspeed broadband right the next

decade is going to be about how can we democratize intelligence. So how can the last citizen of India have the strongest intelligence ecosystem built? That is the whole objective towards which we are

working. And uh like our chairman said yesterday, you cannot rent intelligence. We cannot as India, we cannot afford to rent intelligence. We need to build it. We need to scale it. and uh the complete

infrastructure that we are building uh we are building up from connectivity to the cloud to the edge and then the intelligence ecosystem on top. So uh just to add toward your previous

question uh we believe that uh most of the simple agentic and inferencing workloads will get handled at the edge &gt;&gt; and only the multi-step multi- aent complex workflows. Uh those are the ones

which will get handled at the central location. But uh our our whole focus is how can we create an ecosystem an end toend ecosystem which can ensure uh a all pervasive and an affordable

intelligence to every citizen of this country. That's the whole focus. &gt;&gt; Thank you. So Rajie uh so what you're actually referring to is uh if we distribute the inferences and the

processing across so the power requirement will get distributed and also we will not have lot of concentration of power consumption and the data centers itself it's a good

thought uh so maybe Sundep will just come to you uh how do you see uh AI and 6G anchor use cases can deliver the ROI within next let's say one and a half year from the India's priority sectors

such as BFSI, manufacturing, healthcare, mobility and uh how do you put the metrics as a success? Yeah, I think uh fairly uh good question honestly speaking and if you look at AI and 6G

are two parallel things they are going to merge but as on today we see lot of AI traffic is getting generated maybe it's 6G or 5G or maybe on W line. &gt;&gt; And the pattern is also evolving

drastically the type of AI traffic that is earning. So till now till 2G, 3G, 4G we thought of only voice and data is the actual traffic for which network should be defined. But going further depending

on different type of use cases, different latencies, use case need network has to be defined for three parall dimensions which is latency. Latency is there today in the network

but we we didn't take much of attention because not most of the use cases are not latency sensitive. The other thing is coverage. uh coverage is equally important. Uh reason being uh the uplink

sensitivity of the traffic is getting more and more relevant in the AI type of traffic. And finally, one thing that we all should be aware of the token economy is something which drive all the use

cases. How much token you're going to consume at what pace at what latency drives many of the use cases efficiency or not. So if we bifocate it from the industry to industry perspective, if you

look at the industries which are more sensitive to delay are maybe the robotic surgery, the the hospital industry and maybe the floor machines where robots are taking all the production control.

Their latency plays important role. So we should be using 6 centcentric or the 5Gcentric networks to realize as good as low latency so that the tokens which are exchanged should be acknowledged well in

time we have a faster time to resolve region once and even uh we have observed that even if you uh reduce 10 to 20% of latency the efficiency improves drastically. So it's it's no more a

network KPI, it's a productivity KPI for those use cases. Uh if you if you talk about uh the coverage perspective, uh AI is going to be more uplink heavy, more bursty and we need persistent uh

traffic around it. requests will keep on coming in and that persistence in uplink will only be achieved if you have a good reliable coverage and and the scenarios like when you have to do a lot of

tracking of the assets, lot of monitoring of the assets, you need to have certain use cases realized on that. Those are the immediate use cases that industry will look at. And finally, all

these AI specific things will only scale when you have some national framework around it. You have certain national sandboxes around it. So whatever is coming into the ecosystem, it's well

tested across a diverse set of vendors, diverse set of ecosystem players because use cases for AI may not be related to the one use cases which we have seen so far. So these three dimensions we should

we should look at and once we look at the economics of the token then coming back to the question that you asked where the influence should happen I think it's not about only the where but

at what cost &gt;&gt; so that define how the inferencing traffic would shape up &gt;&gt; totally agree with you uh again taking back to what started as a keynote

uh maybe the 5G labs which is trying to upgrade to 6G labs and of course there are AI labs are coming into it has also as some of the industries to take over or adopt couple of these uh uh labs. I

think uh what you are suggesting as a part of sandbox on the applications they're already happening. I think more uh the department of telecom and go should be working on that part.

uh okay uh surrojit will come back to you again uh let's say uh for next 4 years until 2020 2030 how do you see the evolution path surrojit and uh starting from the devices use use cases traffic

growth and uh how do you see the impact of AID from the networks one is tokens and number of tokens we'll start using the KPI which Rajiva uh sorry SEP has already mentioned about. So what's your

opinion on it? &gt;&gt; Yeah, I think uh we touched upon it I think uh but u just to be more specific about it. So the uplink traffic is going to see a significant uh increase. So

currently uh we see a down link to uplink ratio of maybe 10 is to1 or 12 is to1. I don't know the exact number but that's the range we're talking about. But with this AI applications we are

predicting that this uh pattern will change to maybe 4 is to1 four in the down link and one in the up link. So what what it means is that you need much higher data rates in the uplink. Today

the networks are sort of not built for that. So which means there will be lots of enhancements required in the network. This can come a bit from the 5G advanced and and then you know more enhancement

will come when we go to 6G. Uh there will be lots of improvement on the spectral efficiency in the uplink. Uh and then using AI in the RAN right we can uh improve the coverage. I I'll give

you some example how how that can be done. So for example uh you know the communication between the transmitter and receiver uh it involves the signal received the interference the noise

floor right and theuling and and there there is lots of data huge amount of data which is involved there. So I think with AI using the deep learning algorithms uh we can create uh you know

some logics which can help optimize this entire communication. So and and then with AI this communication can be adaptive as well. So we are talking about something called deep rx deeptx

where uh Nokia is very much uh you know engaged and we have done some initial proof of concepts uh and using that what you have seen is that uh even uh in an environment where you have the signal to

noise ratio which is much worse than what for example 5G can decipher. uh using AI you can actually decipher those signals and and that can give a capacity increase maybe 25 30% and what what you

can also do is you can have higher order modulation supported so this is going to increase the you know capacity of the network and and then as I mentioned you know the multitude of devices which will

require uh lots of low latency uh use cases much higher capacity we are talking about minimum 400 MHz of bandwidth when we are talking about 6G. So today 5G networks are primarily

running with say 100 MHz typical bandwidth we're talking about 400 MHz of bandwidth which might be required and we are talking about five times spectral efficiency. So which means 5 into four

you are talking about 20 times more capacity coming out from 6G networks. Uh but I think this this is the evolution right. So we are doing the standalone networks right now and uh you know this

voice over andr uh slicing uh this will you know get uh I would say advanced and we'll have uh the entire network having slicing capabilities voice will transform to voice for NR and and and

then gradually you go towards 6G where you'll be building the networks which are more AI native. A very interesting point you brought in now &gt;&gt; surrojit. So what you mentioned is it's

it's very interesting. I didn't think about it earlier. You are saying even a single digit designer I can extract more informations. &gt;&gt; Actually we're going to improve sumance

principle. &gt;&gt; That's a that's a good aspect right. So &gt;&gt; and also uh one thing you if you can just throw on the tokens are smaller brackets. You just have instructions or

some questions why it should increase the uplink bust. Ideally, you should order a lot of popular talks like it is going to the SIGs or the AI is going to reverse the traffic pattern. But why

just tokens, right? &gt;&gt; So I I think uh it it depends on the because you have to send the contextual information, right? For example, you you're standing somewhere and you want

to send a 360° view of where you are and you want to send it to the inferencing application so that it can help you you know understand whatever question you have. So I think that contextual

information sending it upwards right it will take lots of data requirement and primarily we are not doing it today that's the main reason because &gt;&gt; and and this type of tasks will increase

and and that's going to increase the uplink requirement &gt;&gt; you want to add something to this &gt;&gt; the the only thing which I wanted to add on the applink side was that uh you know

there going to be multimodal agents you know so right now the traffic that we see is which consumer initiates Right. But when the agents and then on top multimodal agents who are orchestrating

end to-end workflows then they start initiating the traffic that's when the uplink also &gt;&gt; you will have multiple A2A traffic. &gt;&gt; Y

good. Uh so uh Sep for the next question for you. So so there are a lot of A6 pilots are happening. I think whatever the organizations we have seen in last four days of AI impact summit a lot of

them are there and uh what specific coordination mechanisms or co-creation models do you think uh we all should work together as industry academia or government uh to ensure that uh these

pilots they align to the standards they just don't you know build on the silos while 6G standard is maybe two quarters or maybe couple of more quarters was survey. So how we we put uh the

standardization as a perspective which can be adopted later stage and also safety gads a lot of safety issues will come uh the more you're excited about how great things can happen also the

more of the things are exposed and uh we have seen the what it's doing and how things are really getting into out of control and uh so any AI and maybe outcome based AI native deployment

comments if you just can throw some light on that. &gt;&gt; Frankly speaking, your question is so long. I'm not sure how long should be the answer.

&gt;&gt; I'll break it easy for you. [laughter] First one is the prototypes. &gt;&gt; I got it. I got just kidding. So, uh I think if you look at the perspective, uh lot many good things are being done in

the country. &gt;&gt; There are lot many good organizations as as we heard in the keynote that uh there's a bio 6G alliance, there's a DSD as well. So, lot of coordination is

already in place. &gt;&gt; Mhm. The problem is uh with the pilot and the scale gap is not a technology gap is basically a scale is a gap of how we put things together in a frameworks

which are scalable and referenceable as well. So as I mentioned in my previous response that we need to have some national frameworks around AI native architectures

once that is in place I think the quicker thing can be done is that let's align the fundamental what type of use case are being driven and how the data needs to flow around it other part is

that India as a consumer we have a huge amount of data across the industries and data is like bread and butter for AI there's no AI if there's no data but the data today is uh either siloed within

the industries if you look at a sector they don't combine the data together so national framework of putting the data together creating national exchanges where data can come in and people are

organizations are allowed to train the data train the models with the data and we can have certain models which are more industry specific and that plethora of variation of data

putting it together gives a very useful reference of creating frameworks which can be referenced or replicated not only in India globally as well and certain organizations are already in place to to

take care of that. I think more and more efforts are needed. Uh thirdly uh if you look at more more and more the safety guardrails I think we need to have uh certain framework in

place uh how the AI is audited monitored within the telecom network as well. We can't allow some model to take take a change of any parameter in live traffic if we can't audit it. So certain maybe

policy frameworks for intervention if certain models are changing in network parameter how and why they are changing certain explanity needs to be brought in and it can't be done in isolation.

Reason being if you do it in isolation again there's no clarity will come in to have a national policy around it will improve the reliability or explanity of the models. Hence people will come

together rather than creating a differentiation of another layer of security that that may know encompass certain things that are that that should be known to the larger audience and

certain things that we all should do as an industry uh that let's contribute more and more in these forums which government has started like Bharasi alliance I am part of the 6G use case

group work very closely with Shukji and I think many things are already in is we drafted certain white papers which could be referenced around AI what type of implication it will bring into the

network and we collaborate well with the that 5G 100 labs as well the things that they have done already we should encourage them to take these things to the next level certain things could be

referenced certain things be evolved not everything may be done right but there's an opportunity to do everything right in 60 in terms of coordination in terms of national reference sensible frameworks.

&gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; Have I missed anything? It was a long question. &gt;&gt; No, no, no. Uh thanks thanks uh for that answer. So what actually we are seeing

is on the security perspective we see we have already your work is happening on strengthen in terms of policy perspective. Uh these are in place. Uh and typically what if I have to bring in

the DPI stuff or public digital public infrastructure. So you had a lot of learning from all these sectors and how to deal with it even in the telos even in all the industry sectors how to keep

that as creative about that particular data which is not been seen in the telco ecosystems but still we are all responsible to deal with that. I think with the AI coming in maybe some way we

need to understand the DPI of DPI. &gt;&gt; Yeah [laughter] and just to add here you brought a very good point. I think whenever I give a reference the importance of open

ecosystem, interoperable ecosystem, I always give an example of UPI, UPI wouldn't have been a success if we if we have not promoted the open ecosystem around it. I think same mindset is

needed in the AI era. &gt;&gt; Good. Good. Thanks. So Rajiv, uh I have the next question for you. How does the AI native telco change the way enterprises consume

technology and uh and what are the new value pools that will emerge out of it? &gt;&gt; I think it's a very good question. Um see uh Si brought out a very important

aspect of latency right and the second was on the uplink. So first of all 6G is the solution to both both the problems right &gt;&gt; uh enterprises in particular will

benefit a lot from uh from the advent of and the confluence of 6G and AI. &gt;&gt; So there are three major uh drivers of uh value pools which enterprises can derive from uh 6G and AI. The first

would be uh a demand uh you know demand analysis. So you know they will be able to analyze what kind of demand is coming today they their there their there is their their entire data is limited to

the research that they do right but with the new data streams flowing in uh they will be able to understand what new services can can they provide to their customers and how can they embed

intelligence into those new services that they are able to deliver right the second important value pool which enterprise would be able to uh deliver is the workflow automation

So today lot of work which is manual will get automated. They will be able to orchestrate end to end workflows and humans will go up the value chain. That is the second important value which

enterprises can derive from the conference of 6G and AI. The third most important uh part which enterprises can derive out of uh out of 6G and AI is how can they make uh the their end to end

processes how can they make their end to-end uh security frameworks more robust and see till now whenever we used to speak about digitization of enterprises it used to stop at uh ERP

implementations or basic uh you know uh business process automation now AI and 6G are going to take it to the complete completely different difficult different level India is a wireless economy right

we we don't have fiber penetration in this country right so the only way enterprises can go and reach to the last mile in this country is through the confluence of 6G and AI that's the point

of view &gt;&gt; correct uh so another extension to this question so how do you see sovereignity of the entire ecosystem

&gt;&gt; we should deploy when you say sovereignity It's a very complex &gt;&gt; One side said that we we think that okay if we make it open only it will grow. &gt;&gt; At the same time sovereignity is also

asked for every country maybe we can actually make entire European continent will only have one sovereign &gt;&gt; uh stuff &gt;&gt; or what do you see on that and how much

you should make it as a sovereign how much you should make it open what should what is your viewpoint on it? See this token economy in which we are going to go in the next five to seven years. So

sovereignty is going to be a token sovereignty right &gt;&gt; in my point of view it will be very important for us to build our own intelligence and then deploy and scale

it. You know we cannot be dependent on the world to deliver the intelligence to us because that will simply be too expensive for us to handle. Right? So in in order to make sure that uh

intelligence reaches the last uh person in the most remote area and and the last remote enterprise in India, the most important thing we need to have is have a have a token sovereign. We need to

have a sovereign AI ecosystem and end to-end ecosystem starting from device to the cloud to the edge to the intelligence layers on top. This end to end ecosystem has to be sovereign and

and we don't have an option in this. &gt;&gt; So you are saying end to end ecosystem platforms stacks as sovereign. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Token may or may not be sovereign or you

can classify as a sovereign or as a general public one. &gt;&gt; Correct. But what what we're basically calling it as a sovereign token which what I basically mean is that right from

the time the request gets init initiated by an agent or by a human to the time an inference happens and the value gets delivered to the human or to the enterprise this entire value chain has

to be made in India has to be sovereign. &gt;&gt; So you have some view on it. I think I was just supporting him with the gesture but honestly speaking uh the level of intelligence that country needs may not

be a priority for the intelligence for other regions who are creating their own intelligence. So having a sovereign II has a has a economy sense as well and has an importance for our own social

values that we build in the system. Uh AI is not only about telecom. I is a bigger uh base what we are getting as a query output as a as a new generation they should be very well aware of what

is right and that's can be assertained only if we have certain sovereignity developed in the ecosystem for our own nation. So while we are talking about 6G to be specific on AI. So there is there

is something which we need to keep as a crossover sovereign stuff there are certain things which you need to keep it as a open uh stuff for learning from each other as a community learning

correct what you say across the country across the planet and all so that's something would you like to comment and maybe I would uh request surjit to also comment on that as well. So I think just

to just to start I think Sjit will will elaborate more uh uh the era of going further will not be uh a abstract one or abstract zero. We need to look of the hybrid ecosystem which works best as a

mix of which type of AIS is a mix of which type of compute and mix of which type of influencing and industry or the economy is going to be more use case and uh I would say efficiencydriven. So we

should be leveraging which is best for to satisfy that particular use case. So sir &gt;&gt; yeah I think just to add uh I was reading one NITIOG report you know where

we are aiming for a 30 trillion economy by 2047 as part of the Vix Bharat initiative. So out there it was very much mentioned that there are approximately 490 million uh informal

user you know workers. &gt;&gt; So for example all these carpenters, drivers. So they are the informal users and they are not yet equipped with all the applications which might uh enhance

their productivity. So I think from that perspective AI use cases can be significantly helpful out here. uh we can have you know uh smart robots working in the uh you know fields for

helping on the agriculture. Then there may be use cases where maybe a electrician or carpenter you send a video of your uh work and they can that AI can generate a list of the tools they

need what all steps they have to come prepared with right but for all this I think the most important part is the model needs to be trained based on data which is coming from India because if

you train the models based on data which is coming outside India then maybe it is not tuned for you know the India specific use cases it there will be a bias there so I think that's why

&gt;&gt; perspective we are hitting upon the cultural perspective has to be understood by us so there is a bell uh so are we going to have some questionnaire sessions Q&amp;A sessions

any questions maybe we have this two minute left Can you hear it? Okay. &gt;&gt; Yeah, we can. Yeah. &gt;&gt; In fact, I had lot of questions but

[laughter] &gt;&gt; Okay. So, let me uh first my question would be around uh interoperability. So in in in mobile world we see that whatever user equipment you buy from the

market it works on all the operators right when we are moving towards uh having AI related applications we see there is some problem so I was looking at meta glasses they were exhibiting uh

so basically the meta glass being uh say uh uh coming out in the market will only work with the meta so should we not think of creating some AP API sort of architecture where an a product created

uh uh by one user side should work in different applications. It should work with Google. It should work with uh go applications sort of. That's the uh the first question which I have. Uh

the second uh question is about uh the the model training which Surjit was uh trying to uh address. So uh so I mean the advantage of India is like any applications we can scale to a billion

users that is one and the second advantage is that we have a huge data set on many aspects right so how to leverage these two for AI because although we uh we may not be good at

LLMs various LLMs which we have today of course uh new companies have started server and all have started uh working on uh but but we are good at we are having a data right so and the market so

how to leverage that so that I mean models are trained here models are utilized here so these are the two questions which I have in mind thank you &gt;&gt; can I answer please

&gt;&gt; okay &gt;&gt; sir uh I'll try to attempt to answer your question uh the first part I think uh sep also mentioned see this entire ecosystem end to and ecosystem has to be

open has to be APIdriven and loosely coupled so that uh you know there is no proprietary interface from one point to another. So the whole work which is going on right now at least in our

organization is to make sure that how this end to end ecosystem can become open can become efficient and can scale. You brought out a second very important point about India's scale right and this

scale is going to reduce the cost of intelligence and that affordability is a also a very important factor for us to deliver value to our uh you know 140 million sorry 140 cr people that

reduction in cost is a very very important factor. The third important point uh which I want to make here is that when you build the when you when you talk of LLMs you know they are

important but delivering intelligence is not about LLM right or training LLM it is about delivering this entire ecosystem to the last mile. When it comes to LLMs the way we are building

intelligence in India is in every language these models have to be trained. So every person whether is a from south from Kerala or from Assam or from any any state in northeast they

should be able to [snorts] get this intelligence in their local language made that is the whole work we are doing right now as part of Jio &gt;&gt; thank you Rajie

&gt;&gt; I think just to uh answer the second part of the question there's a lot of data how we can ensure I think a framework of having a centralized data exchanges and centralized training

exchanges where enterprise can uh port their data with a certain anonymization so that the no confidential data passed out but industries can come and train the models specific with the data which

is available uh from the enterprises or from the end users within India but I think central exchange mechanism is need to be placed. So I just to add I think um

democratizing the AI is also very important. uh it should be accessible to everybody at at much lower cost and I think in that direction putting GPUs at at cell towers can be one way of doing

it because what you can do is when the [clears throat and cough] network is not very busy and the resources are free those resources can be given to the users to you know train their models or

do some inferencing functions because those resources are there right every site so that can be one way of helping on this direction in my view. &gt;&gt; So you have another question.

&gt;&gt; All right. Uh morning. Uh my name is Siddhu. I'm from AT&amp;T. One quick question. Uh now that Rajiv is also here. See um across the world telecom companies are

realizing that not having a network API exchange and then monetizing that is becoming a problem for many of the large enterprise customer use cases. For example, if a bank wants to understand

their customer behavior, the customers have got multiple networks. So they don't get the visibility, right? So with one, I think Jio and Airel have also joined hands last year. On the US side,

some work is happening. But I wanted to understand how much of this monetization of the network API centric economy is materializing from India standpoint. I know Jio covers almost I don't know 40

50% of the overall population in India. So you might throw some light and then anybody else on the technology side. &gt;&gt; I'll try to answer this quickly because the time is up and we can take this

discussion offline. But see uh we are committed to an open AI ecosystem to drive value and like I said enterprise value cannot be delivered unless the end to end ecosystem is open and connected.

I think ringing the bell but I I'll take this discussion offline. Thank you sir. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; So we have time many any other questions so we can rem

&gt;&gt; thank you everyone. May I request rather to hand over the moment to all our speakers? May I also request Ashok sir to please come on stage and kindly collect your momento.

I think Thank you so much, sir.
