## 📝 Transcript

comes at an important moment when we see a central AI policy challenge to be enabling broad economywide adoption of artificial intelligence. We believe that the winners of the AI

race will be those countries, those governments that adopt AI both inside the government and for their private sector as effectively and as broadly as they can. That is the focus of our

session today. enabling enterprise AI adoption for impact which also serves as the launch of BSA's global enterprise AI adoption agenda. So uh there's QR codes to and our website please feel free to

check it out. Um but we focus on three pillars that we think are the most important. The first is workforce. The second is infrastructure and data. And I would argue that data in this

world is a type of infrastructure. And the third is practical governance. We provide actionable recommendations for governments to advance their own economies.

I am so grateful to the leaders from the BSA member companies who have joined us today to share the perspectives and important work advancing enterprise AI innovation, collaboration, and adoption.

And with that, I would like to turn the podium over to William Kimmit, Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade and a wonderful partner to us. Um, under secretary, thank you so much for

joining us today and for your partnership. [applause] &gt;&gt; Great. Thank you very much. Um, &gt;&gt; it's truly a pleasure to be in your

company today. Uh, leaders from across the technology landscape, innovators, policy makers, and friends from both the United States and India. Uh we're gathered here on the sidelines of the

India AI impact summit. A moment that rightly captures the excitement, possibility and responsibility of this extraordinary time in technology. Uh thanks to our Indian partners for their

hospitality and leadership in hosting the AI impact summit and to the many US companies here today that are working tirelessly to deepen our shared innovative ecosystem.

You are the builders of a digital bridge between our two great nations. Uh I have the honor of serving as the under secretary for international trade uh at ITA within the US Department of

Commerce. Our mandate is focused on promoting American exports, enforcing our trade laws, and attracting foreign investment to the United States. With a presence in markets around the

world and deep sectoral expertise, ITA serves as the US government's primary interface with industry on trade and commercial policy, working to expand market access, address foreign trade

barriers, and support economic growth through exports and investment. Under the vision and leadership of President Trump and Secretary Lutnik, we have been fulfilling that mandate as

never before. Now, BS BSA itself is an excellent example of how quickly the world can change and how successful institutions evolve with it. BSA was founded in 1988

by Microsoft and originally focused on combating software piracy and enforcing copyright compliance. They now represent companies that are leaders in artificial intelligence, cyber security, cloud

computing, quantum, and other breakthrough technologies that were unimaginable at the time of its founding. BSA modernized because the world modernized, and you recognize that

leadership requires adapting early and not reacting late. Artificial intelligence represents the next frontier built on decades of technological progress. From the early

days of the internet to the rise of personal computing and mobile devices to the rise of sorry each wave has laid a the groundwork with AI now at the apex of that evolution unlocking entirely new

possibilities across economies and societies. In Washington artificial intelligence is now framed as a national priority and that is reflected in a concrete policy

agenda. In July 2025, President Trump released America's AI action plan, a detailed roadmap to keep the United States at the forefront of AI while working more closely with partners and

allies. The plan is already being implemented through a series of executive orders that direct the US government to limit procurement to of ideologically biased AI models.

Accelerate the construction of the data centers and power systems that AI requires and promote the export of full stack American AI technologies to trusted partners.

Under President Trump, US policy today places a strong emphasis on co-development, co-investment, and co-creation with trusted partners. From expanding AI infrastructure to building

resilient semiconductor supply chains to advancing joint and research and emerging technologies, our message is clear. Innovation grows stronger when nations innovate together. When trusted

partners like the United States and India lead with openness and collaboration, AI becomes a powerful driver of growth, innovation, and shared success by bringing together US capital,

research and global markets with India's talent, scale, and digital ambition. This partnership is unlocking opportunity for our companies and our India's role in the global AI landscape

is both distinctive and consequential. Few countries combine world-class talent, democratic values and the ability ability to deploy technology at real scale the way India does. For US

companies, India is not just a market. It is a partner in innovation. India's deep reservoir of talent, its democratic values, its digital public infrastructure and its extraordinary

scale make it one of the most compelling environments anywhere in the world for co-creating next generation technologies. Many of America's most innovative

companies, those working at the frontier of AI, semiconductors and advanced technologies have established a significant presence in India. In several cases, their largest operations

outside of the United States are right here. That speaks volumes. It reflects a confidence not only in the opportunity and scale, but in India's central role in shaping the future of technology.

The United States and India are uniquely positioned to lead the AI revolution. Both our nations believe that technology must serve humanity and not the other way around. We believe in free thought,

open societies, transparency, and accountability. And these principles must guide the way we develop and deploy AI. And while governments can create

frameworks and build trust, it is businesses and innovators who turn shared vision into reality. So thank you for the opportunity to be here today and I hope the positive momentum of this

week's summit carries forward as we forge further integration between the US, India, our great companies and our uh innovative ecosystems. Thank you very much [applause]

under secretary Kevin that it's so wonderful to have you here with us in Delhi on the occasion of this historic summit. It's so exciting to have all of you with us here in Delhi. The work that

the International Trade Administration does is so important. So we thank you very much for joining us today. But we thank you for the partnership and the support for US industry around the

world. Um um with that I think it is time for our first panel to begin. So Danielle take it away. &gt;&gt; All right. Thank you Victoria. My name

is Danielle Johnson with Dr. and I'm joined today by leaders from There we go. Sorry about that. Uh, so my name is Danielle Johnson Cut with DocYsine. I'm joined today uh by leaders

Mike Haley from &gt;&gt; Autodesk, Claus Newman from SAP and Chandler Morris from Workday. We are going to discuss the AI potential and how we drive that uh into the workforce.

Um I'm going to start and just open up so that we stay right on time and direct the first question to Mike. Um please share one successful enterprise AI adoption example and two key lessons for

scaling similar impact. &gt;&gt; Okay. So um at Autodesk I lead our research organization as well as our AI development. So as part of research, one of the things we do is at a certain

point of the maturity of our technology, we do example projects with customers to prove out it works. And with AI moving so fast, I think it's appropriate to use an example from research that's sort of

indicative of the future. So something we discovered some years ago in the process of creating buildings and designing and building uh infrastructure the decisions that ultimately impact the

cost and the sustainability of a building are actually made in the first month. Most of the decisions in fact 80% of the decisions are that that affect that is made in that point. So what's

key is to have some technology that is able to give you insight into the consequences of your decisions at that point. So, what we did is we partnered with a customer that wanted to build

affordable housing units out in Oakland on the east east side of the bay um in a site that is right next to a highway. It's an old factory site. Um they wanted a carbon neutral building and they

wanted to build the entire thing super nuts in 9 months. Um which anybody who's worked in construction will tell you that sounds utterly impossible. Um so what we did is we partnered with a

pre-fabrication uh pre-fabricated module kind of home company. Um, and we built an AI with them that could actually analyze years and years of data of what it took to create these kind of

buildings, how to create these modules sustainably as well and then work with them to build a custom AI that could simulate the choices that you made. So if you orient the building a certain way

or if you choose a certain shape of the building everything you does do will change say for example the solar gain of the building or the amount of concrete you might need or the amount of steel or

what whatever you so what what we found is this AI was allowed them to actually generate a design iterate hundreds in fact not hundreds even thousands of scenarios of how these buildings could

be designed and the AI was able to play forward all of those decisions through the construction process and ultimately into the running of the building. The net of it is we were able to design a

set of buildings that there are three units that are going into this lot of land in a beautiful arrangement that avoids the sound and the noise from the highway because noise simulation was

actually part of the AI and it was actually a system that has now allowed us to break ground on this project. We're actually in phase two now of the construction and we're on target for

making actually a net negative um building in fact in within the time frame that they they had proposed. So this is a great example of how this can work. Now to your last part of your

question to scale this. The challenge of scaling this is all about gathering data at every stage of the process from the factory where the pre-fabricated modules are to the field to making sure that you

always have context. What makes these AIs work is having the right context and being able to bring this data forward into that context. And that's going to be one of the especially in this kind of

world, the physical world, getting hold of that context is difficult. planning for it, making sure it works. It's part of what we need. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much for that great example

of bridging that gap between AI potential uh and real world examples. Um let's turn next to Claus. Um across global markets, what top two workforce conditions determine the success of

enterprise AI adoption? Yeah, thanks thanks Danielle for the question and um thanks also to BSA of of having me here. I think it's a great great initiative to do that. Um I could

basically follow up where Michael just left right from from the architecture example. I really like this because indeed software architecture I always imagine it as a house that has a

foundation something needs to be built on top of it. Um but now for the first time since we have AI, I think something has also changed in software architecture because we speak all of a

sudden much more than before about trust, about values, about bias and all of these things which previously it was more about security of course and efficiency. Yeah. And now I come to my

point that um if you believe in let's say certain values and this AI system should reflect my values then we also have to recognize that values are different in different parts of the

world. The values what is acceptable for example in India what an AI system comes up with with an answer with an idea with an innovation is probably very different from what is acceptable in the United

States or in Germany or in other parts of Asia and so on. And therefore we believe also very strongly into this global development coming to your workforce. Now we have a very diverse

workforce in more than 20 countries of the world where we also have innovation happening day in and day uh day out. And I think that is for us super important right that we do innovation in US in

Canada in Brazil in Chile in many countries of Eastern Europe in Paris also in Germany of course and in many countries in Asia. India is also for us a very large uh innovation hub but by

the end of the day it is that what has really has to come together that makes truly a global system that also reflects the different values uh that are prevalent in these different cultural

areas across the globe. &gt;&gt; All right, thank you. We will turn next to Chandler. Uh and your question is given the rapid transformation of the workforce landscape of AI, what

strategic shifts and data modernization efforts must India undertake to build a skills-based workforce and achieve its full AI ambition? I wish I had a segue like yours because that was that was

pretty nice to sort of move from construction to um I think uh I think I think we're all going to walk away from this vibrant summit wondering sort of separating the signal from noise and in

sort of and for me um I'm walking away really excited because I think we've we've had sort of the conversation around started with safety right how we you know risks how do we keep this and

then it moved to governance like how do we employ and deploy and do it with trustworthy way reflective of of cultural norms and now the focus is really on diffusion. It's like so how do

we how do we drive uptake? How do we see ROI and and I'm super excited about India's focus on skills at the end of the day the fusion of AI is going to be based on a an AI ready workforce. I

think at the same time the other the flip side of that coin is uh there will be changes in the future of work. there will be changes in the nature of roles and skills that are needed and whatnot.

And so that focus on skills also drives the agility for employers, for job seekers, for incumbent workers. Um I think I think there's sort of three things that are top of mind when it

comes to how to take an a skills-based approach to work to scale and and I I'm thrilled to see India sort of wrapping its arms around this scale question and frankly I think if we can do it here, we

can do it anywhere. The first is uh a skills taxonomy. There's a governmental role in sort of aligning the language of skills and we are increasingly both in India as well as in other areas in APJ

as well as in the United States seeing a a very vibrant conversation of how do we align on what you know the language of skills. Luckily AI is also ready made to play a role in that because it's usually

noisy data that needs to have inferences driven out of it. I think the second uh piece is really getting that labor market data modernized to a point where we can see very in real time emerging

roles and skills. I mean that's you know and and I from the US we we are we're talking about this regularly like our labor market data is you know six months old maybe that's a lifetime in AI

diffusion in an AI adoption and I think the last piece which we've heard the minister for skills here in India specifically call out is um you got to have it aligned with employer demand

like at the end of the day you can do whatever you want on skills development but if there's no market for those skills it's just it's just wasted resources and no one has those

resources. to waste. So we are really focused on how do you build those public private partnerships to bring in the private sector to ensure that we're building those tools. And the key to it

is and I think everyone in this room and everyone in industry and everyone in academia, we all know a lot of these questions aren't answered yet. I mean we're still seeing the conversation on

ROI. We're still seeing use cases develop daily. And so anyone that's telling you they know exactly what the future of work is going to look like in, you know, a month from now is I I don't

know what crystal ball they're looking at, but we don't see that. And so getting those data sources aligned with employer need on a way that can iterate over time is going to be essential.

&gt;&gt; All right, thank you very much. Um, and that will conclude our session today and let's give a round of applause for our panelists. Thank you. [applause] Um, I'm David Masters and I'm going to

host the next panel. So, as we sort of get set up, we'll just do a bit of a preamble before we um before we line up. So, so the next panel we're going to focus on data infrastructure and

governance. Um so really those underlying principles that support AI adoption. So things like security and privacy and data protection and the things that uh all of us as enterprise

uh software companies understand that our customers uh need to know to uh successfully adopt AI. And uh given the time frames uh it's a uh we're focused on rapid AI adoption. So this is going

to be a rapid AI adoption panel. Um with me I have uh Shinas uh from from Salesforce. uh Josh Karma from Zoom uh Jennifer Mulveni from uh Adobe uh and also and uh and uh and Sam Kaplan from

Palo Alto Networks. Um so the first question goes to uh to Shrinavas. Um could you please share with us uh one successful enterprise AI adoption example and a couple of key lessons that

have come out of that? &gt;&gt; Yeah, Ming. Good morning everybody. Good afternoon. I think uh thanks for inviting me. uh I think um one because we're in India I'll just give you a

quick example herein corp is one of the leading financial services company in India uh so they the way they do is they they give multiple loans and usually their loan disposal process and approval

process would take uh more than 2 days for two wheeler loans uh and uh using agent force which is a platform uh they reduced it to 30 minutes and they're disposing millions of loans in last

Diwali Danteras is a bumper year for them. I think that's a quick uh uh user story we are seeing here. Um &gt;&gt; yeah and just building on that what are some of the key lessons you've sort of

seen out of that? Yeah, &gt;&gt; the big lesson like anything else is meaning every AI implementation starts at data. You know if you don't have a data foundation it gets very hard. Um

the other critical lesson is when you do 10 requests you know the agent is working or not working can easily know. One of the lessons is at scale when you're doing millions of loans. Two

things you need. One you need enough guard rails to ensure that the system is these are probabilistic systems. You to ensure how do you ensure that your standard operating procedures are

followed. That's number one. Number two, which we talked about trust before. How do you ensure that there's no bias in the system? You know, how do you ensure your inclusivity is there?

6 months later, let's say an regulator comes and asks you on what basis did you give this loan. You need to have auditability, the reasoning traces. So you exactly know on this particular

loan, this is how the AI reason. And so you need to build we have to build systems to um track all of this and then how do you test it? You know if if in a regular people are asking different ways

a lot of the documents are not fully there. So if you don't have the infrastructure you have to build all these systems in the infrastructure to make it work at scale in a way the

business is comfortable. So you marry the power of the AIS and the creativity of these AIS with a deterministic statement of uh standard operating procedures and that's how you get the

impact that's the real ultimately that's what we want to measure not on innovation and pilot purgatories but really uh real impact to the end consumer or the business.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. And building on that impact, Jennifer, uh, from from Adobe's perspective, you know, how can that adoption of enterprise AI including Aentic AI tangibly expand opportunities

for productivity and service quality? &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, uh, when we think about Adobe, the types of communities that we serve when it comes to AI, the biggest one by far is the creative community. As many

of you know, I'm sure you all are familiar with Adobe, hope you are. Um, and then of course here in India, that means millions of students, millions of creatives. We heard uh this week the

announcement um by the IT minister of a uh creative make it create in India mission uh and then there's a budget to back that right so it's the government really kind of um not just talking the

talk but actually walking the walk with putting some money behind what's really important of thinking about the importance of the future of creativity in the orange economy here in India uh

and we can't do that without partnership p public private partnership right so the government will do things like provide the uh the the the policies the the the educational traditional

curriculum and of course the funding behind these types of things. But then it's upon um incumbent upon industry to come to the table with the technology and also to offer the types of skills

that are needed. So this week Adobe's announced in partnership with NASCOM uh promoting uh 20 new free courses on the NASCOM future skills platform which we're excited uh to put out there.

Yesterday we announced uh free creative software with AI built in for millions of students here in in in India. Very happy to do that. So the other I just think again that the bottom line is that

that that public private partnership that coming together to do what's needed to bring communities such as the creative community into the uh AI world. &gt;&gt; Thank you Jennifer and and Sam you're

the security vendor on the on the panel so you get the security question of course. Um we've talked a lot about the what of AI governance but for the enterprises in the room today and and

you know the how is much harder. So from your perspective, what does a secure AI by design architecture actually look like in practice and why is this one of the more

critical foundations as AI adoption increases? &gt;&gt; Sure. No, thanks for the question and thanks to BSA for inviting me to be on this panel today. So I just because I'm

a simple man, I tend to think think of things like secure AI by design and sort of buckets of three. So at the highest level, it's understanding how adversaries have been able to leverage

artificial intelligence to create vulnerabilities and to exploit those systems. How are cyber defenders, your cyber security teams across the enterprise leveraging AI to sort of

defend those networks? And then how are we securing the AI systems themselves that are being integrated into our networks and systems at an increasingly rapid pace? And now particularly with

aentic AI like how are those agents then interacting with other parts of the network specific to that last bucket on how we're looking at sort of secure AI by design um we tend to think of this in

in sort of three real foundational layers like first looking at your supply chain integrity um like are we treating these AI models more like software code you wouldn't like put an executable file

that you didn't know what the providence is Yet we've seen enterprises that are going onto something like hugging face and pulling unknown models into operations without having full risk

assessments of what those models are. So being able to construct sort of your model risk assessment and understand that is critically important. Additionally, you have to

know what is operating on your system. How are sizos and your CIOS getting visibility into all the models that are actually operating on your system? This is through third-party risks, thirdparty

softwares that may have AI models running on the back end. So that visibility is crucially important. Second, you got to look at zero trust like look at the AI factory, look at the

backend where the chips are, the infrastructure, how are the security controls at that layer being implemented because these threats and vulnerability can metastasize through that value chain

all the way up to the network layer where it's really having an impact. And then last like what are the runtime guard rails that organizations are looking at? Are we looking at the prompt

inputs and the outputs of those prompts to protect against prompt injection data poisoning attacks? So looking at those layers with regard to agents now agents are adding a level of complexity. I

think one of the things that we really need to consider with agents is how are we treating identity when it comes to agents. Um you know we did a recent report where we found that even nowadays

agent identities machine identities are outnumbering human identities on networks 80 to1. Do we know what those identities are interacting with and what pieces on the on your network they're

interacting with? What are we implicitly trusting them to do? So I think if we're looking at this in layers and breaking it down, we'll we'll peel this onion. &gt;&gt; Awesome. Thank you. I am going to break

in for a moment to welcome a very special guest um to our event secretary s Krishna. Um we are so pleased to have you here as we are closing out this amazing week in Delhi.

I can't think of a better person to be joined by than S. Krishna. Your leadership has shaped India's balanced approach to AI governance. You have overseen the passage of India's privacy

legislation, the finalization of rules to enhance user privacy and trust in the digital ecosystem. You are a wonderful partner to us. We thank you so much for joining us today. And with that um I

would like to welcome you to the podium uh to address our audience. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you for having me and I apologize for butting in in the middle in this fashion. But uh first let me

welcome all of you and everyone in the panel to Delhi. I hope you've had a good week here in the India AI impact summit. uh what we have attempted to do and what our objective was was to democratize AI

and I think we brought everybody into the room standing room only fundamentally as a way of making sure that uh people are part of the discussions about what needs to happen

with AI and what needs to happen with technology in general. uh summits prior to this where basically leaders, some CEOs, some experts, very few uh members of the common uh audience

or others would rarely have access to many of these discussions. We are fortunate that many of the best minds thinking about AI are people whom many of us are in a position to actually hear

from directly and listen to and understand what is happening in this space. Um there are many many aspects to it multiple aspects at multiple levels. We have close to about 500 sessions. So

we're talking about at the one end chips and you know everything that leads to making the hardware relating to technology which will finally which is where AI would work and then of course

all the applications and the attendant issues relating to security deployment and a whole host of issues. So we've we've sort of covered the whole gamut of what needs to be covered in this past

week. We've also had agreement and we've had meeting of minds on a range of issues and truly it will take a while for us to sit down and digest all that has been said the implications of many

of the perspectives that have been put out and many of the u very very interesting perspectives from very interesting quarters in terms of how they are perceiving AI what they think

the threats are what they think the positives could be but if you need to look at it I I think fundamentally whichever way the nuance and you know the detail and uh all of those the micro

elements of what needs to happen is one side of the story but the other side of the story is are we for it or do we fear it and I think um the consensus appears to be that we are for it but we'll take

care of ourselves as we go along and uh we need to sort of address all of those issues whether it is privacy issues whether it is data issues issues whether what ultimately happens in terms of

guardrails each of these things are important but we shouldn't at this point in time block the passage or block the way that AI moves forward we need to move along with it understand where we

sort of put the necessary guard rails to guide it in an appropriate way where the guidance needs to happen where the nudge needs to happen where the push needs to happen and that's basically achieved

through discussion through understanding through understanding perspectives and figuring out which is the best way forward and that's our approach at least the Indian approach to the way we want

to u look at AI and its deployment look at where we can do find ways in which we can do it best and alongside that there's also this whole aspect that ultimately it's about the skills and

ultimately it's about the people who will get it done And that's where I think we can offer quite a bit to the world. I think there are enough skilled people as many people as who walked in

to watch this. We produce about a million STEM graduates a year, engineering graduates a year. So there's a there's a huge uh volume of people that we bring in and whom we can sort of

deploy in a way that works not just for India but for the world. And that's what we have to offer. uh we are the third most vibrant AI ecosystem according to the Stanford index primarily because on

the strength of the talent and u that's that's the opportunity we want to give our talented youngsters we continue to be a young country we will continue to be a young country for the next 20 years

at least and uh that is something we have to offer to the world and above all I think uh what we have succeeded in doing is to bring everybody into the doom into the to make sure that AI in

whatever shape it emerges out of this after this summit will necessarily speak to and will necessarily include people who have hitherto been excluded from this entire race and that probably is

the biggest achievement of this and that's been made possible by the participation of all of you. So thank you all once again for having come out to Delhi and participated in this event.

I apologize for any inconvenience any of you may have suffered over this period but it's been wonderful having you and wonderful to have uh hosted you here in Delhi and uh in India for this event

thank you [applause] for your leadership I want to introduce you to Robinson offic Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; Uh why stay here with global enterprise

AI adoption right behind you? &gt;&gt; Why don't we do a photograph here and then the secretary is amenable. We'll do a second. &gt;&gt; Thank you.

So would you be all right? So we've now saved &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; question for you, David. &gt;&gt; Give it to him.

&gt;&gt; Well, look, Atlassian builds software for agile development. So, we we have to be agile and and working uh in government affairs, we always uh will defer to to government when they enter

the room. Um so, Josh, from from Zoom's perspective, um sort of we've talked a lot about trust. Um, how do governments improve their services, adopt AI, um, and and maintain that uh, security,

privacy, and trust? Yeah, I well, first of all, I was just going to say it's actually really fitting that Secretary Christian made that uh entrance in those remarks

because I think so much about this week has been about Indian leadership and the the Indian approach to regulation particularly around trust and how we're going to take care of people's data and

how we're going to keep it secure I think has been quite exemplary and is very uh is very encouraging. Look, I think the one of the things that that all of us as enterprise software

companies think about a lot is uh how we can make our customers lives better. And whether you're talking about the the most populous country on earth with 1.4 four billion people or or a smaller

market. The the ability to serve government and to think of use cases and to figure out ways to bring the technology not just to the customer but to the to

the citizen to the student to the patient in the health care system to the person trying to get their driver's license is is paramount. And you know my my my boss Eperno was on the previous

panel. Some of you may have been here uh and she was talking about the balance that that we as companies always have to strike between innovation and I think you know risk mitigation. This is this

is an area where I think it's actually incumbent upon all of us as company leaders to to be partners of the governments that we're working with and to help them

think through not just how can we get our software products in as many hands and in as many terminals as possible but how can we uh build confidence that that when it's being proliferated out to to

millions of citizens there is certainty cy that people's data is being taken care of. There's certainty that national security is being taken care of. There's certainty that there will be choice and

competition and avoidance of vendor lock in. Uh that's something that you can of course regulate. That's something that you can legislate. But I think for for the good of the innovation ecosystem,

it's an area where companies have an interest, we all have an interest in corporate leadership and in finding that balance. &gt;&gt; Well, I think that's a great note to end

on. So with that I will hand back across to Victoria. So thank you. &gt;&gt; Unless you're coming up. That's coming. Sorry.

Yes. Great. Well, I am very excited about the final portion of our program. Um, I am have we have Ann Robinson with us, the chief legal officer of IBM. Welcome to

Delhi. &gt;&gt; To have you here. And so I wanted to get your perspective on a couple of important questions in terms of enterprise AI and adoption. So

we are seeing businesses around the world invest in the United States and India and markets around the world. But for many of those businesses, they're still trying to figure out what the ROI

is. So I'd love to hear your thoughts on how companies can move from experimentation with artificial intelligence to real scaled adoption. Yeah. Well, first I'd like to just say

thank you for being here, for being such a terrific partner to the business community. And I'd observe the importance of this question about AI adoption. The theme of the summit is

impact. And as you know, you can't have meaningful impact unless you have meaningful adoption. And in fact, IBM has sponsored research that shows that only 25% of companies are experiencing

the return on investment that originally was intended with the deployments that they have um that they've undertaken. And so, you're right. I mean, there's no better way to say it. We've got to move

out of the experimentation phase and into, you know, sort of really scaled uh adoption uh where AI is embedded into critical infrastructure and um and work models within a company.

um we don't need pilots. Um we need workflows where um AI is uh is deeply um embedded. So you just when I when I think about how um important it is, it's finding immediately those um those

workflows that are ripe for automation that are repeatable um that take a lot of human capacity um that are critical but really are more appropriate for some of the tools and resources that AI

brings to to companies. Um at IBM uh we have program called client zero where when we create new products like ask HR um we deploy that both internally but we also deploy it with our clients and our

ask HR capabilities have reduced um human interactions with our HR professionals by you know a significant percentage I think um eliminating about two million impressions um uh over the

course of of the year. Um so it's got to be seen as core infrastructure rather than um an experiment, a pilot or a nice to have in order for it to really drive um adoption. The other thing that

whenever IBM we have an opportunity to talk about things that are critical to AI adoption, you have to think about what the workforce needs to really engage with AI. And so governance

becomes a really big part of that conversation. People are not going to use tools and resources they don't trust. So having um very clear governance um over the deployment of AI

within your enterprises is going to help your employees uh fully engage with it. And I think you know it's another thing that's really exciting about this conference is you see um the lines and

you see you know how many people are um are engaged on a on on this topic. And so excitement and engagement are great but they're not enough either. you all you have to have that transparency, you

have to have explanability um in order for people to feel comfortable when you embed AI within very core workflows in order to really use it. So those are some of the themes

and things that IBM thinks about. &gt;&gt; Great. Fantastic. So you mentioned workforce jobs are changing. How does IBM feel? what are your thoughts on the talent challenge and and what are

practical steps that companies can take to make sure that their workforce is ready for an AIdriven future? &gt;&gt; Yeah, so the first thing I'm thinking it's a great question. I was really

happy to hear um in the earlier panels two panelists referred to us. So Chandler talked about it, Jennifer talked about it and what they're doing at their companies to um to make sure

that the workforce is ready for um for technology as it's deployed. But I think the first thing I think about is how we even think about it. So um upskilling and training for engagement on a is not

about worrying about job elimination right um it's it's really making sure that we have skills transformation in order to make sure that the workforce can engage with these new tools um

there's we did another uh research that indicated that 40% of the workforce is going to need upskilling in the next three years so this is really critical and I think the way we think about it um

is twofold. One is the sooner you can embed AI in those workflows the better because you can actually learn by using right so you you do need you know more um formalized training but you can learn

just by doing just by interacting with the with the um with the capabilities and then the second piece is that you do need some of that training um you need AI literacy and fluency at scale. So we

have programs um that are designed to um help upskill workers. Uh but but we start with skilling in the first place. So IBM is one of the things I love and am most proud about. We are not as

focused on you know degrees. Um we are focused much more on skills. And so um with when you take out that sort of elite um you know uh pedigreebased approach to to training um you can just

cover a a broader cross-section. Um so uh IBM is pleased to share that we have committed to skilling five million worker five million people um in IBM and we think about that over the range and

the life cycle of um of the development of the workforce. So we have programs that are engaging with higher education but we also have vocational programs and we will get to 5 million um trained uh

people here in India over the next five years. Um the other thing that um that I think we have to think about when you are trying to make sure that the workforce is ready for capabilities that

are evolving as quickly as they are and that's that you you skill you teach and then you have to continue to teach. So upskilling and continuous learning has to be embedded in the way we think about

engaging the workforce um in in AI. And the other the final thing I would say around um workforce uh training and and the like is just how critical um that public private partnership is. So I

think the la the very last speaker u mentioned the importance of the public private partnership and it is um it's profoundly important that you have the engagement of the Indian government.

They have been a sponsor. they've been an active participant in this conference. Um, but they are actively engaged in the conversation about the best way to deploy these skills-based

training programs um in the way that best reflects their policy priorities and you know and their agenda. And so you have um active influence and access to the education systems to you know

sort of third parties that are much better and more effective at bringing the skills programs to the people here. And that um that's just a it's going to have a um an amplifying effect of the

training that we're trying to bring to the country. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Well, thank you so much for joining us. Thank you for closing our program. Very much appreciated. Um thank

you to our audience. Um uh there is a Salesforce event on AI agents starting immediately after this. So I would uh welcome and encourage all of you to stay for that. But Ann, thank you so much for

joining us today. Thank you for what IBM does. How are you doing? I used to work at long &gt;&gt; but I know very well I know

I'm in touch with all those guys but I'm with IEL let's take a picture in &gt;&gt; I between just last week. &gt;&gt; Okay.

What's your number? in New York.
