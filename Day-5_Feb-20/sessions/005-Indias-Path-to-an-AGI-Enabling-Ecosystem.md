## 📝 Transcript

I am Subraat, co-founder of Chariot. It's an immense privilege to stand behind uh this incredible audience of students, researchers, founders, and policy makers. At Chariot, we're proud

to be one of the companies mandated to build frontier models for India under the India mission to build sovereign frontier models for the country. But as we embark on this journey, we must

recognize a fundamental truth. Building true frontier intelligence from India is a monumental ecosystem play. We cannot simply import models and talents, run them on borrowed infrastructure and call

them our own. If we want to solve India scale problems at population scale, we must own the power, the hardware and the talent and the research that drives them. That is the thesis of today's

session. India's path to an AGI enabling ecosystem to bridge the gap between energy infrastructure and research. We've brought together the absolute pioneers of this field. Before we begin,

let me quickly share our road map for the next 1 hour. We will start by inviting each of our distinguished speakers to share opening remarks on their respective domains. After that we

will dive into a panel discussion and then finally we will open the floor for your questions. To guide through this we have assembled the absolute pioneers of energy compute and research pillars.

Today we are joined by Sri Gsham Prasad Gji chairperson of central electricity authority. Uh Mr. Tarun Dwa founder and managing director of E2E networks. Professor Jade Deva, GSV chair in former

HOD of electrical engineering at IIT Delhi and finally my co-founder at chariot Mr. Parth Sari to build this ecosystem from ground up starting with the very power that makes

this revolution possible energy to speak on the sheer scale of this transition and to help us answer critical questions such as what we expect AI's true energy demand in the country to be and how are

we preparing and modeling our national grid to meet it. I would like to introduce a true veteran veteran of the power sector, Sri Gancham Prasad GI. Sri Gancham Prasad Gi presently holds the

post of chairperson of Central Electricity Authority. With an illustrious career spanning over 35 years, his expertise covers generation, transmission, and power market

development. Having served as part of the G20 energy transition working group and the first executive director of BIMC energy center. His global perspective and visionary leadership are ensuring

our grid is ready for the AI era. Please join me in welcoming Sri Gsham Prasad to the DAS for his opening remarks. Good morning. Good morning everyone. All the dignitaries sitting on the desk and

off the desk. Let me at the outset thank Chariot for inviting me to be a part of this particular very very important session and almost the guiding force which is

happening for the last 3 4 days in India. I think the speaker wanted me to speak on some of the key challenges that is likely to happen in the era uh when we

are transiting from the present situation to AI enabled or AIdriven power system. We all know that the moment we talk about AI which means that it is supposed

to be data intensive and it is to be a power juggler and we are talking about the data centers which will try to enable it uh as we go along. In India we are now transiting from a

smaller data centers. Earlier we used to have 10 megawatt 50 megawatt data centers to now gigawatt scale data centers at many places particularly in Mumbai, YJ, Chennai and

all other places. So far we have a visibility of around 16 gawatt of such data centers coming in across India. The challenge remains a few particularly

if I see from the perspective of serving a large load which earlier we thought that it is going to be almost like a constant load but practically it is not and if it is not then how do we

manage such type of a variable load so far we were struggling with only variable sources that is solar wind etc. Now we are going to have something from the load side as well. A large load

getting integrated into the discom system and which is also going to have a nature which is going to be variable. Second is the kind of reliability that is that it demands into the system.

The reliability is we talk about n + 1 + 1 now which means that the same data center will have to be supplied from two different sources and they have to be slight differently

located as well. Second is even if the supply fails then it has to be backed up simultaneously by two uh uh I'll say two steps that is DG

sets and each DG set will have to be backed up by another digit sets. So we have four layer almost four layer of security of supply. It's definitely

challenging for a country like India which is now expanding and growing to provide such kind of a reliability but still we are geared to meet this kind of a challenge. Some of you who have not

seen a data centers I'll request you it's very close to Delhi it's in Noa which is coming up this that is 50 megawatt data center being built by Adani and would be operated by Google

10 megawatt has already been commissioned and rest 40 megawatt is in the pipeline you can see the the structure that is coming and the kind of challenges it is it is it is facing but

I must congratulate UP Discom who have been able to provide this kind of a reliable supply to that data centers but this is 50 megawatt but very soon you will find a data center coming in Mumbai

area which will be of a,000 megawatt yj which may be even more than 1,000 megawatt 1,000 megawatt the moment I say it the means the supply will that will be required to this particular center

will be at least 1.7 times That's the near near thumb rule. It may require I think sir is saying that it will be required two times at least but uh data center which I wasted was uh is

has been designed for 1.7 times of the the the data cent's capacity. So the challenges first is how do I maintain a variable load? How do I meet the n + 1 + 1 criteria of supply? Some of you

researchers who are sitting here probably must be aware about these kind of things before we try to design this kind of a what is further more going to be more challenging is because these

data centers are also planning to go green. That means had they taken a mix supply probably the challenge of discom would have been slightly lesser. But if you want to classify yourself exactly

green data centers then that means I need to ensure you uh that only green power flows into your data center which means a combination of solar wind battery hydro hydropump storage or any

such type of a combination which we'll be able to ensure to you and that means I need to ensure a transmission line from such sources to your place so that at least there is no interruptions in in

uh in the supply of green power being provided to you. But let me assure you that uh India is geared up for that kind of a challenge because we have started the journey of

energy transitions somewhere in 2011 or 10 wherein we started with a meager figure of somewhere around 2 gawatt. Now we are more than 50% in terms of renewable in the country surpassing 250

gawatt and which has major majority share coming from the solar and then from weight and storage is now kicking into the system.

Last year we surpassed 30 gawatt in a single year. This year in just 10 months starting from April till January we have already crossed 40,000 megawatt which means that probably in this

particular year we will have more than 50 gawatt coming in in a single year. So even if the data centers or the AIdriven systems demand green power I think the country is geared up to that kind of a

challenge. Further what we are suggesting to the data centers is please try to have a diversity. Diversity means don't have at a single location. Try to be as close to

our locations as possible slightly away from the main town and diversified locations. So far we have two landing points in the country. It is Mumbai and Chennai. But we are trying to diversify

that as well. So we can have multiple landing points in the country so that the data centers can come at multiple locations and so that at least the challenges of the discom

uh the further uh stability and since I have been asked for the international scenario as well. So India is also connected to uh Nepal, Bhutan,

Bangladesh and to some extent to Myanmar and we are also promoting to very soon connect with UAE and Saudi Arabia and uh Singapore and even Sri Lanka. So if the moment we are going towards the other

countries that means we'll try to have both not only powered but we'll try to have the communication network as well and there are situations which is emerging that maybe these countries will

like to have the data centers in India and support get get supported through that kind of a systems but all these definitely as we go along will require huge amount of balancing

power and uh and storage cap capacity. So right now we are depending on two major sources either it is hydro hydro pump storage or coming from the battery energy storage systems. Recently we

launched a report which gives us a confidence that we'll try to have somewhere around 100 gawatt of hydrop pump storage coming within next 10 years which is going to be a very good uh

support to meeting or meeting the uh 24 hours uh supply to a supply to these data centers. Similarly uh because we have to cut down our uh carbon footprint. So we are also

trying to have a road map for 100 gawatt of nuclear which is targeted to 2047 and uh but there is a visibility even as of now that we go in a fleet mode and we'll be trying to achieve somewhere

around 22 gawatt in by 2032 or 34 and then moving up forward for further uh with uh more technology kicking in and more expertise being gained particularly from the private sectors and all other

sectors. So holistically if I see uh we have huge amount of challenges but to meet those kind of a challenge we have good mix of resources in the country and the country is geared up to meet those

kind of a challenges. The country is also able to make the transmission lines in a record time as compared to anywhere in the world. If you see we are able to provide connectivity in 24 months to 36

months time frame in the country as compared to anywhere if you take US etc they take around 10 years to give grant a connectivity that's a kind of waiting list that they have if you take even

countries they also take more than 5 years for building the transmission lines so at the end I'll only say that we are totally geared up for any kind of innovations all the youngsters are

welcomed from across the world to set up their systems here and I can assure you that the country is fully equipped and fully geared up to support you. Thank you so

much. &gt;&gt; Uh thank you sir for setting the stage with those vital insights on our energy readiness. I'll just quickly ask the panel to uh get together for a group

photograph. Once we have the power, we need the hardware. You cannot train sovereign foundation models without massive localized processing power. To discuss

our compute backbone, I would now like to introduce Mr. Tarun Dwa, founder and managing director of E2E networks. Under his leadership, E2 has emerged as India's first AI first hyperscaler and

publicly listed pioneer on the NSE that is made in India for the world. By delivering enterprisegrade cloud infrastructure at significantly lower costs, he's democratizing AI and

empowering over 10,000 innovators with advanced H100, H200, and now B200 GPU infrastructure. His work is building the foundational infrastructure that enables our sovereign AI ambitions. I would now

like to invite Taran to the dis for his opening remarks. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Uh thanks so uh uh like uh thank you for this opportunity to be a part of this August

panel. So uh so building infrastructure is something we have been doing since 2009. So 2009 when we uh began our journey as E2 networks like uh most of the uh so

there is an incident even 10 years before that. So uh when uh we had a startup plan like I think somewhere around 200 uh six era or something like that or

even before that. Uh so so we were discussing three or four friends who were working in the IT industry. Oh we are going to make a website and this is what the website is going to do and

this is how the website will make money. Uh so the fourth guy asked the question but who is paying for building the website? So the idea was that like it is always

someone in the west who is outsourcing uh the development of the website to you guys and you are building the website for them not for India. So that was the uh era once upon a time in India where

we used to do everything for the world not for ourselves. So the second stage was when we started doing things for ourselves. Now the third stage is what we are doing today uh as a country where

we are saying that like uh not only are we going to do things for ourselves we are going to do things for the world and we become the innovation hub and the innovation capital of building cloud

infrastructure for the world. So uh uh with that I would like to uh uh kind of like once again uh hand over the stage back to subat. Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; Uh thank you so much Sarun for sharing

uh how E2 got started and the vision behind starting E2 networks. Uh but raw compute and energy are just untapped potential without human ingenuity and the mathematical rigor to harness them.

It is my deep honor to introduce Professor Jay Deva, the GSV chair professor and former head of department of electrical engineering at IIT Delhi. An alinist of the same department,

Professor Jay Deva is a trailblazer whose internationally recognized work bridges theoretical mathematics and practical AI. His group was amongst the first to fabricate an S SVM based AD

converter on chip. His recent work on minimal complexity machines provides astounding model size reductions of up to 300 times. His contributions to optimization and machine learning are

vital to building highly efficient indigenous models. Sir, we would look forward to your opening thoughts on how India can contribute to the research and talent pipeline for building artificial

intelligence models from the country. So thanks Satra for nice introduction and uh your kind words and thanks to Chariot for uh you know for inviting me to this uh discussion here.

So there are a number of questions I think they sort of put together uh put to me in a sense which I don't think will get covered in opening remarks but primary among them is how do we scale

this effort within the country innovation wise uh take it to the next stage. So there are two parts to it. Uh fortunately I work in both a IML and VLSI

and uh as it turns out uh there is there are a host of issues that need uh if you ask me serious discussion and brainstorming. Primary among them is uh the issue of

manpower. the entire development at one time if you remember Silicon Valley the word IC used to actually uh jokingly be referred to as Indians and Chinese. So the

intellectual uh you know innovation the innovation that came to build Silicon Valley and most of the entities that there that are known today came out from Indian universities came out from the

IITs and all you know few decades back. question is what would it take for example to build that same kind of ecosystem here and you need uh to have a critical mass of very smart researchers

doing work within the country uh and we have to supply the reasons for them wanting to do that first of that first amongst that is what's the career connect for a student

wanting to pursue his or her PhD or any other research degree for for that matter at a university here. Uh most of our uh so I should just put a disclaimer most of my all of my comments are my own

personal comments and not representative of IIT Delhi. Okay, before I continue further, but uh if you ask a student today, well, a lot of them come to us for recommendation letters and in most

cases, the first choice wanting to do a research degree would be a university outside. That has to change and it is changing but it's changing slowly. Uh what are

the reasons for that? Think of a student who decides they're excited by research, wants to do it within the country, wants to do it at university here. What's the career after that? That connect is

directly visible. If you look at a research lab, uh you look at a university research lab in the US or elsewhere, that connect is missing uh in most

places. Not because there are no industrydriven projects or so on, but the nature of those projects is different. In many of the uh successful examples that I can discuss when we have

that panel itself, the instances are where the university has embedded their researchers within let's say university along with other students uh along with other researchers and those who are

working for their PhD are already for example employees working in the university environment. The scalability of research is very difficult within the industry. It's

expensive to explore ideas because maybe out of 10 or even 50 ideas that you explore, one becomes successful and ends up returning revenue to you. It's far cheaper to do that exploration within

the university environment. We have to find models that allow universities and uh industry to work together but also to find ways so that the biggest bottleneck of IPR sharing which is really the bone

of contention or really the key point in most that you sign this particular aspect is handled more seamlessly and in a simplified fashion. The other difficulty is of course uh

with regard to the way the entire ecosystem is configured. Uh there is a deterrent uh amongst many Indian parents you know from their parents to the children in a sense why don't you finish

your you know current degree first join a job and worry about a higher degree or PhD later. Uh the difficulty with research is it's best done when people are in their prime uh when they are

overflowing with new ideas. Once they're in a job, they get saddled with other responsibilities, you know, familial others and so on. And it never ends up being the same story uh let's say a few

years down the line. This particularly hits uh women candidates harder because there's also a pressure uh you know although I don't want to make it generic statement but

there are there's a pressure amongst many of them from their parents to get settled early. So we find as a consequence fewer women in research in engineering research let's say

particularly as compared let's say uh uh to male candidates and finally uh the incentive in terms of uh what people get if they join a research career and eventually join industry or elsewhere

that incentive needs to be made far sharper and far clearer today. uh if it if a student joins an industry today after their undergraduate uh degree and works there for a while, many of them

continue doing research in the industrial setting. But as I said, exploration is costly within the industry itself. And so unless the uh student has a clear-cut uh

motivation to do outstanding research early on so that the industry or whatever career uh option offers them a significant incentive to do that I think the scalability will be missing. So I'll

stop. I think I probably have taken more time than I should have but we can discuss further. Thanks. Uh thank you professor. I think your vision for preparing the next generation

of researchers and what it takes to incentivize them is exactly uh what this ecosystem uh needs to thrive. Uh finally, I'd like to introduce uh my co-founder at Chariot, Mr. Pari. Uh

Pararti uh went to Stanford to do his undergraduate and master's degree in computer science and more recently was working um at the Google uh Gemini DeepMind team on the deep think project.

uh he was the inventor of raptor which is currently the state-of-the-art technique uh in retrieval augmented generation based on which all retrieval augmented generation pipelines today

operate on um I'd love for par to speak on what it takes to build sovereign frontier models and the differences that he has seen building these models out in the west versus what it takes to build

these models from India Good morning. Thank you Subraat. Thank you Shigan Sham Gi Tandunwaji, Professor Jade Gi for their valuable insights. So I want to talk about you know what

happens when you synthesize all of these to sort of build all of this underlying infrastructure energy talent to build sovereign frontier models right so I'm going to start with some numbers uh

India under the India mission has 38,000 I think scaling to more than 50,000 GPUs which is so much more than you know what we had a year ago two years ago thanks to the India mission and I'm sure the

scaling up will continue we'll have uh many more GPUs know but if you look at the west you know there are companies with much more uh GPUs with deals for many blackwell and rubin chips coming in

right so I was at Google deep mind I worked there on uh Gemini deep think the reasoning capabilities of one of the most research resourcerich AI labs in the world and and that this number is of

GPUs is going to go up but why does any of this matter right why is there a GPU race after all why can't we just uh write better algorithms terms and make better models. So the answer to this is

in my opinion one of the most important empirical discoveries in the his history of computer science scaling laws. So the GPT papers were impressive. You know GPT2 could write paragraphs, GP3 could

write essays. They were were really good work but the GPT papers were the Tinder. The match the thing that actually started this whole AI revolution and lit the entire industry were scaling laws.

So in January of 2020 uh Jared Camplin and some colleagues at OpenAI including Dario who went down to start enthropic uh published a paper called scaling loss for neural language models and what they

found was really simple. So if you take a neural network's loss you know its error rate how wrong it is against the amount of compute used to train uh train on it on a log scale you basically get a

straight line a very clean smooth power law right a straight line that spans seven orders of magnitude. What that means is in really simple languages every time you 10x your compute your

model gets measurably predictably better right not randomly not sometimes every single time the exponent they found was you know roughly 07 so which means for every doubling of the parameters you see

the loss drop by 5%. And you know this sounds small but at a log loss scale across many many doublings. If these you know these gains compound uh enormously GPT 2 to three was a 100x increase 3 to

four was another 100x and each jump you know produced a leap in capability right and then the deep minds chinchilla paper which corrected it said you need to roughly scale your uh data and data and

compute equally. So the reason why this was so consequential was that you know this turned intelligence into an engineering problem right you not a science problem you need you don't

really need a breakthrough you need uh you know more GPUs more data more electricity you need money and whoever has the most right so you could call the race right there uh you know if the

scalings hold they have held for five orders of magnitude so then there's a spending competition right and this was the dark picture and a lot of people would ask me you know why why are you

leaving deep mind why come back to India to build against this kind of backdrop and and the reason is this. So about a year and a half ago something changed. Uh we had the reasoning revolution that

hit. Uh you know there was the 01 model the 03 models and they showed there was a different way to actually make these models smarter. So you know this word reasoning gets thrown out a lot. Let me

you know explain what it is in some simple language. Right? In the old paradigm you would pre-train these models by uh making them bigger and training it on more data which is

pre-training. Um and you know the models will see this trillions of text and at inference time they would just generate it really fast by you know just one at a time with no ability to sort of correct

for its mistakes. And these reasoning models they started working differently. They could you could give it a problem a math problem a coding challenge a logic puzzle and you could let it think. So it

would generate a long chain of thought. It would think for a bit and then it would try an approach maybe uh you know backtrack a different approach and eventually you know reach a final

answer. So this result was a new scaling law and where you could actually uh you know spend more RL training compute and now we're even seeing that this new type of RL compute is actually even exceeding

the amount of uh compute spent during pre-training. So this was a reset and if you look at and let me explain why. So if you look at RL training right the majority of

your compute is not actually in gradient updates it's not actually in the training it's in this models trying different things out in different rollouts and this is basically inference

and this is this doesn't really need to happen on your you know top of the line 100,000 GPUs in one building with NVL link and infiny band this RL inference you know the sampling can be synchronous

you can generate asynchronous sorry you can generate rollouts on one set of machines collect them. You can make them distributed and so on. You can make them run on older GPUs on across multiple

locations. And now we have hundreds of you know techniques coming out every day to make this work right and just doing RL is one step. The other part and this is the I think the main

thing why I do think uh you know India will succeed is environments. RL environments are where majority of the training happen. you know a math pro ma math environment has math problems a

coding environment has coding problems where the ma the model tries gets feedback and improves and the key observation is that these environments you know can scale with humans and CPUs

and not necessarily GPUs you know GPUs are important but they're not the most important thing right so building a math environment requires mathematicians building a coding environment requires

software engineers building a medical environment you know could require doctors defining clinical uh scenarios and this is human expertise It it scales with people and ordinary compute which

we have a lot of in in in this country right so this is the bet I made you know India has 1.4 4 billion people. We have domain experts in every field. Medicine, law, agriculture, finance, education. We

can work in so many languages. We can build environments for problems that a lot of labs in the west don't even know you know exist like agriculture loan assessment in Tamil, legal aid,

reasoning in Hindi and so on. You know, these are problems that affect hundreds of millions of people. Then we can build the RL environments for them that don't exist anywhere in the world. Right? with

the with the you know India emission grant we have a lot of compute to actually build this frontier if we're smart smarter about these environments right and if you look at India India is

a voice first country and that's why at charity you know we're building a voice uh native speech reasoning models right reasoning over speech for all the reasons uh I just described RL trained

environment driven and inference scale so I think you know the race to AGI sort of u has begun we have with the right environments right algorithms right focus

and this distributed setup now I think with the support of a mission that's already scaling up so many GPUs I think we can we can go ahead and we can win not by outspending anyone but by

outinking them thank you uh thank you so much part uh for sharing uh what you think is the road map for building intelligence from India uh with this our distinguished speakers now

assembled I think let's dive dive straight into the panel discussion. Um folks, just want to make sure that everyone's uh mics are team. Okay, perfect.

So I have a few set of questions that I've prepared for all our panelists. Uh but people please feel free to interrupt and if somebody can go around uh uh with the mic asking questions uh please uh do

so. So I'll ask my first question to Tarun. Um I think we've all spoken about large uh GPU clusters of how they're growing in size. Uh would love to understand your perspective of where you

see uh like India's compute requirements are today. Where do you forecast them going to be? Um and where do you think the demand for the same is coming from? &gt;&gt; Sure. So a number of things. So like if

we just look at the comput requirements of say top 1500 or,000 Sorry. If we just look at the compute requirements of say top 1500 or 2,000 or

2500 or even 5,000 organizations. So are there enough teams that can utilize say 16 to 128 GPUs? Uh just looking at top thousand organizations and say that like do they need at least 128 new GPUs every

year? I think the answer is most likely yes. More likely the answer is that initially we need 128 GPUs and eventually we are going to use at least a thousand GPUs where there are multiple

teams within an organization trying to solve multiple problems and uh uh so it's not just that GPUs are used only for training and inference. They are also used for data cataloging. They are

also used for uh like many different types of u uh inference which is like available straight out of the box. So netn net uh the compute environment required by each of these organizations

is going to be of the size of at least,024 and that's representative of like uh the mid segment and theme and the higher education and research and like

literally there are so many different types of organizations apart from like uh for-profit companies. So netnet if we were just to look at like say thousand organizations wanting uh 128 GPUs each

you're looking at like India needing at least one lakh 28,000 GPUs and we are not there yet. So which means that like uh there is a journey ahead of us in terms of building the infrastructure and

having faith and the confidence that yes like uh India may be lagging maybe uh 18 months behind the rest of the world but that lag will keep coming down and at some point of time we leaprog like we

did with 5G and 4G. So when that leaprog happens the those compute requirements would explode even further. So I think it is safe to say that like India as a country with 20% of world's population

and currently having capacity of processing about 3% of world's data will sometime in the future leaprog to processing not 20 but like maybe 40 50% of world's data by becoming the data

center and the compute capital of the world. So those are my thoughts around that. &gt;&gt; No absolutely uh thank you so much Sarin for sharing that. So I think at a bare

minimum what you're saying is like the 128,000 uh GPU infrastructure um that we &gt;&gt; that's today's requirement just in India alone and we just don't serve India alone like when we build compute

infrastructure we serve the whole world because this is not a super latency sensitive like a website or a CDN kind of an environment. So reasoning models like they they think and when you add

another 200 milliseconds to the thinking process it does not like really uh kind of like add a whole lot of latency to what the people are experiencing. So in that sense we can actually serve the

compute for the world. So which means that we can build a lot more than what just India needs alone. &gt;&gt; Makes sense. Um and so uh like that's an excellent segue to my next question

which I'll direct to uh Mr. Shri Dam Prasad GI sir. When we talk about these kinds of compute infrastructure that is needed for the country, how do you forecast like what the energy

consumption of modern-day data centers would be compared to our overall uh energy requirements for the country and like how does our country for example be prepared to meet that over a 12 24 36 uh

month time horizon. See we have already as I mentioned in my opening remark we have already factored it right now uh demand equivalent to 16 gawatt we which we are projecting for

the data data centers uh but the philosophy of planning we have changed now in India and uh we are trying to uh upgrade our systems planning systems every year it has been

made dynamic earlier you used to hear something like five year plans right those days are gone so we are uh upgrading our transmission every 6 month that plans and uh the resource adequacy

plans is being upgraded every year and even when I was speaking in Singapore where US uh and all other regulators were there and they said how are you able to really manage in 6 month and one

year so I said it's a it's a computing environment that has gone in India and we have really catched catch up and we are able to do this and that has really helped if you see uh whatever error we

make in the planning process or the projections we are able to correct it within no time and that has led us to uh do a course correction immediately whenever uh we have this kind of a plan.

Second is the growing demand that the country has right now which is phenomenal. I'll say it is much much higher than any other countries across the world. Most of the Europe European

countries you'll find they are growing at either they are stagnant or growing at 1% or 1.5% or 2% at the most. Uh we are growing at 7 to 8% and some year we have even grown at rate of around 10%.

So meeting that kind of a demand unless you are you are vigilant and you are able to do it in in real time frame probably you'll not be able to sustain that kind of a thing and the kind of

kind of further further expectations that is there with the with the customers probably you need to have that kind of uh jump &gt;&gt; and s I think like one follow-up

question which I have actually both to you and Tarun is that um like these modern day data centers like the energy densities are hitting quite high levels right so one thing that we hear is uh

that do we move data centers close to where the energy generation is happening. So when we talk about these new upcoming um like data center hubs you talked about you know like sort of

uh Mumbai being one of the hubs for where these data centers are being created but like uh according to my naive opinion there's a lot of energy production that's happening in states

like Rajasthan um like how do you foresee this environment that do you see data centers moving close to where the energy hubs are like would you would be interested in building like data centers

close to these regions I would love to hear both of your perspective on the same &gt;&gt; so I am really looking forward to like uh the SMR nuclear reactors being made

uh available as quickly as possible in the data center campuses and uh see nuclear power is again like I'm shilling for nuclear power for no reason. Uh so nuclear power is like also very

reliable. So you can actually run it for like altogether for like 8 years 10 years. Now several advantages to that is like you are not transporting on the grid. So you don't have to pay the

transit fee which is very very reasonable in India but like again every cost saved is that uh savings can be passed on to the end customers and uh similarly you also don't need diesel

generators to be there on site you can just have a slightly larger battery and energy storage systems along with nuclear and you can build a data centers of the future so that is something that

I'm really looking forward to but I think like it could be like 3 to 5 years away so those are My thoughts about like wherever you are putting data centers you can put the power over there as long

as there is availability of sufficient amount of land because nuclear power requires like some uh uh free land around that facility and another advantage of nuclear power is that once

you have set up like some land for nuclear power you can like modularly increase the size. So like let's say you start with 220 megawatt then you can add like in chunks of 220 megawatt which is

the most dominant design of the SMR or like even the BSR uh designs that are there. So that's what I think about it. &gt;&gt; I think what Tarun said is very right. Uh but uh the visibility that I see in

SMR may may not be in 3 to 3 years. &gt;&gt; So maybe slightly longer period. I'm not I'm not very sure about it. &gt;&gt; Sure. And because I have I have been talking to I have been talking to uh

most of the people who are into going to be into into the business of nuclear because so far we have only NPCIL nuclear power corporation of India limited. uh but all others are also

slightly apprehensive that probably that may take slightly longer time but again what is required what he rightly said is you'll be requiring a containment zone and that containment joy anywhere

between 1 kilome to 5 km depending on the capacity that you are going to have in the in the nuclear space that means again you'll be moving away from the main crowded places right because you

require a containment zone wherein no uh habitations are allowed second is uh you rightly mentioned that we are trying to say that you are should go to as close to the resource center as

possible because you need green power. If you really need green power then you you you should have that kind of a closeness because if you take uh let's say if you you're targeting somewhere

from Rajasthan or Gujarat we require a huge amount of transmission lines and we are trying to optimize on the transmission system itself. So let it be at the generation place and Maharashtra

there I mean good thing for India is we have 8 to nine states which are very rich in renewables starting from Gujarat, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana, Andra I mean so

all these and so you have multiple choices. It's not that you have only one choice where you need to put it. Similarly if you see the the IT hubs which is getting created they are also

scattered around the country. So that and this last point I said is we are trying to have multiple landing points again. So the moment you have a multiple landing point say for example for

Singapore uh Vij or Parad or Vin Gopalur could be another choice. So we are looking for an alternative and Singapore probably is likely to be connected with the Yak. So similarly for the western

side as well. So you need to have the diversity of of this and that is how you will be able to able to successfully meet the their demand. &gt;&gt; No, makes sense. Uh thank you so much

for sharing those points of view. Um I'll move on sir to professor Deva like when we talk about um the talent pipeline for the country like would love to hear your perspective sir on what you

think is sort of the undergraduate readiness of our workforce uh for training and deploying these AI workloads and like what is your point of view on like a lot of people in our

country moving abroad to do uh higher education or moving abroad to do higher uh uh for better work opportunities compared to sort of the PhD education system in the country. uh like what

would your perspective be on you know empowering more of u our our children to sort of continue PhD opportunities to continue grad school opportunities in India versus sort of doing that in other

institutions around the world &gt;&gt; so uh it's a good question I would have done the same I did my BTE from IIT Delhi and I was all set to go abroad it's just a chance conversation with uh

one of my professors who said well uh you know you'll go abroad fraud but you won't come back. He was probably right. And he also said well you know when your parents need you the most you'll be

sending them money right and uh so somehow he convinced me and I did stay back so they curiously they offered me a job itself so you know so I just was stuck here but in general uh you

will find that uh and rightly so you know I would say visibility of a degree abroad variety of factors contribute to most of the brightest talent we have wanting to uh do well not

just PhDs but you know masters in research or all of these abroad uh that changed you know I would say when my batch we did a p a vte about 75 to 80% of the batch went abroad that

doesn't happen anymore uh most of the students are in the country but they are not typically pursuing higher And uh one reason is well of course uh jobs are uh plentiful you know for

bright students many of them and really pretty much everybody gets employed but uh we are not successful on the research front in attracting the brightest talent there. Uh fundamental

to that I in my view is well why are the students staying back in numbers more? Well, the, you know, career opportunities are better. They're getting paid more. They're getting paid

better. They have a chance to build a better life for their families. So, that has changed their trajectory in terms of where they go after the undergraduate degree.

But what's the career path if they choose to do research? uh how many firms for example within the country really want to have PhDs in numbers and hire them and is there a

clear statement being made by them when they go to universities or colleges and you know look for uh look to recruit students that I think is missing. uh well I would

I would always say there are exceptions to whatever I say you know so you should take what I say with a pinch of salt. Second is uh you do not see their visibility on campus and in the labs uh

like you do in the west. So in the US for example you would see a significant number of people from industry working within the department alongside other that uh leads to very rich discussions.

It leads to creation of you know new ideas. It uh it spurs growth in terms of uh very creative development of new ideas and very often the people discussing these new ideas end up uh you

know forming newer startups and so the chain grows very rapidly. I'll give you one success story. It's a small example though but uh just to set the tone for what I'm trying to

emphasize. In 2018, a team uh from our department won a worldwide challenge at one of the foremost a IML conferences in Europe. So Europe is a very uh premier a IML

conference and team from the department won a worldwide challenge called AutoML there. Uh how did that happen? Well, two of the people in that team uh were actually employees of a firm uh working

full-time in the department when they had this company had stationed them uh in the department and said well work for your PhD but you have to work on areas or these problems that are relevant to

them. Uh they were of course discussing with many other students in the department uh who are also in that lab and then of course there were professors uh part of that team. That kind of

success story is uh you know I would say rare and if one finds a way to replicate uh those examples in numbers I think the story will change dramatically. Uh it takes a leap of faith. Uh most HR

managers are averse to letting their employees work full-time at a university. Well, if you're working there, you know, you're not on site and therefore you're on some kind of leave.

Uh, in this case, we created a way so that they could log in through VPN and work as if they were on site. So, it's kind of a site for themselves. The the other problem of course is uh

people have to join research careers early. Uh they have to take that plunge uh early on. That's when they are most productive. uh that's when they you know can you know churn out new ideas quickly

and I think uh while the government is doing a great deal to make that happen uh I think the uh you know we need more examples from the industry trying to do that uh trying to bridge that gap and

working so if that happens in my view the story will dramatically &gt;&gt; and sir how do students today like look at PhD as a career path right out of college outside of like the other

opportunities they may have. &gt;&gt; So, uh the the duration of PhD is a is a is the primary deterrent. It's 5 years and so uh you know the there's a social uh let's say deterrent as well. Uh I

have heard from students uh you know when they get back home PhD student you know some neighbor will make a comment well you are still studying is it because you're still at you you know

still at college still at university haven't got out aren't in a job uh so it's uh you know that mindset will change in my view only if uh one you get paid more I mean if the if they're

actually employees let's say working uh that changes if the fellowships I think are far more lucrative and that can only happen with industry help in my view and uh but there is a there's a via media

there's a path in between we have something called the MS research which is like a research degree that takes about uh 2 years plus uh numbers there have actually tripled in the last

3 to four years so number of PhD enrollments uh I would say is now static it dropped after co but uh in this MS research degree the those numbers have actually tripled in the last 3 years I'm

saying for our department. So um I think we have to find you know we have to really brainstorm and I think that that dialogue hasn't happened uh in sufficient measure to be able to answer

your solution you know answer your question you know sufficient sat if I may supplement uh I think professor is saying what is the practical case but uh government is

slightly thinking in a different manner now uh and you must have heard about uh ANF RF that is Anusandhan Foundation that has been created with a outlay of 1 lakh cr rupees and this is

going to be across the country across all the segments all the sectors which will be uh almost under the principal scientific advisor of the country. Very recently we also had a meeting with him

and very recently you must have seen that we have got something like 20,000 crores under CCUs carbon capture and utilization and storage sequestration. So these are some of the projects which

are now being being identified. what are the gaps that India has in terms of a technological uh things which other countries has or can we surpass them so that's with that

objective this fund has been created and it's likely that the industry and this kind of an organization and even what we are thinking in the power sector is can we have a a university or maybe a

cluster of such such uh this already one has been experimented in Gandhi Nagar and which is doing a good job. Uh that all those people who are trying

to do some kind of a innovations can they be supported through some kind of a fund and then the industry takes over. So the gap that earlier used to be there that a PhD he does a paper or a

professor he does a paper or even his promotion is linked to the paper publication. So that kind of a situation will have to be slightly modified and you need to really take whatever

whatever you do whatever PhD that you do or whatever research you do it has to be taken forward from there. So that we what we are thinking is that it's a concept to to commercialization. So you

have to take it to that level and then only it has to flow. Very recently we also had uh a good competition of uh AI use case in power sector I think only two months back and we have identified

few companies who are really trying to have that kind of an ideas and we have given them s we have already assigned them some task that okay you do it on a nomination basis. So that's the kind of

you'll find the changes that is that the change in mindset of the government and trying to support this kind of an activities that is going to happen. &gt;&gt; So I would like to add something over

here. So uh these are great ideas that like research should be promoted and supported in India. Now academia uh does a very good job of identifying pure problems uh which need to be solved

which advances the human knowledge. uh we in industry see the build versus buyer decisions like almost every day and also we kind of like look at all the road maps of okay what needs to be done

in what amount of time so give you a few examples like basically like if you just look at say things like uh opto electronic networks uh co-ackaging of optics with electronics uh so those kind

of problems are very wellnown so to go from 100 Gbps to 1.6bps 6bps there is a certain time frame in which it has to be done and it's at a certain volume of production that it has to be done. So

which means that resources have to be deployed in a manner that it produces goal directed research in a certain time frame. So what is the considered as like a good outcome is something that we in

industry can help define but most of the time we don't always have the kind of money to deploy behind those gold director research and also we do not have our own use cases for uh kind of

like selling out that much to be able to support uh that volume of research. So that's my suggestion that uh task people like us who make build versus buy decisions to at least create the road

maps that okay this would be good to have if we can do it in this much time frame. If we don't do it in this much time frame somebody else in the world will go and do it. So that is something

we can help with. &gt;&gt; Yeah absolutely and this is the basic idea. This is the basic idea with which we are trying to have this. Just I'll give you one example. In fact uh we are

facing huge amount of challenge in uh HBDC right now in the country. We have only two companies in the world and they are really taking us on ride in terms of supply chain in terms of prices etc etc.

Then we said okay nothing doing let's can we have our own industry coming up in in India. So we have now lined up LNT and power grid corporation of India both of them are contributing 3,000 300

crores each to go in for that uh the gaps. So you'll find I this kind of situation we have already tried to identify something like 76 elements in the power sector which needs immediate

attention. So you need to go aggressive now on this kind of things. Similarly other sectors as well IT sectors matey is trying to do in mining areas in critical mineral area. So you'll find

all the all the ministries have now waken up to take up this kind of a challenge. Thank you. I just wanted to react in a different way to uh to some of these comments. So

it's not always that uh you know research needs to be have in issue. A lot of research is applied uh you know a lot of research that happens within universities IIT and so on. lot of it

actually is uh with industry but more often than not the uh industry you know uh funded projects tends to tend to be kind of at arms length it's like kind of saying like look here is the problem uh

and you know if you can find a solution &gt;&gt; so we need both types of research &gt;&gt; yeah so but let me &gt;&gt; if we only do gold directed we will never innovate really well

&gt;&gt; yeah no I just wanted to uh uh say differently Um so the point I was trying to emphasize is not about either necessarily short-term or long-term or medium-term. You need to

have a mix of all three. Certainly new ideas come forth at all possible uh you know all possible levels. The difference uh that you know

eventually an idea makes is well ideas don't make money companies make money or you know uh organizations make money. So the key is translation. It is difficult to create a an ecosystem

within a university that's efficient and let's say um I would just say efficient at translation. Uh on the industry side translation is much simpler. they're geared up for

production. As an example, if you ask a student to write production level code, it's not going to happen. It's uh not feasible. Uh and that's why one has to rethink the nature of this partnership.

It's not about funding. It's about trying to work on these problems together. Like I gave you an example what happens or used to happen say at Berkeley Cadence Labs. Cadence and you

know set up a lab at Berkeley and they had researchers from both sides working together in the same place. Now it might be a new idea comes ac you know you come across a new idea might be something

that groundbreaking will take time to scale and you want to look at that separately. There are problems that would give an edge would give an edge to a company today and they need to be

solved in the next 6 months. uh those are also problems that people need to work on and looked at and sometimes there are things that uh come simply out of the discussion something a company's

been doing for the last 10 years turns out as a far more efficient way that we could deploy in the next 6 months so all three happen uh right now I would say the dialogue is at arms length and that

if it changes uh I would say funding is less the key then really that uh you know making that dialogue happen because when that starts happening you will also see excited students wanting to say look

I I know that I'll find a career I mean I'll give you an example we had a uh we still have it's probably one of the only masters programs in the world that's that doesn't take any money from the

government it's fully sponsor supported by industry or sponsored by it's at IT Delhi it's called the VSSI design tools and technology program it was started in 96 and till today all the students are

sponsored either by projects or by industry and many of them have led to you know patents other things going on. uh two of the gold medalists of that program decided to forego all their

placement offers. They had like three or four offers in hand off campus on campus and these gold medals decided, you know, they're working with me and they decided to stay back and continue a PhD because

they realized all these companies want them. They're really good at what they do. They'll get a job and they wanted to see that chip come out. They wanted to see uh you know that develop. they

wanted to test it out and see the outcome of that. That level of excitement uh really happens when these are live projects uh with involvement from the industry or whoever else I

could be even a government entity public sector but you need the end users enshed with the problem discussion and the solution. No absolutely uh thank you so much for

sharing that uh sir and everybody I'd like to invite part to share a personal story like relating to something uh that sir just said that about people who move to the US don't often come back um and

then also like on the same side that you know like like while you were studying you decided to sort of uh take a break and sort of join Google deep mind uh part-time so what was that thought

process like it was very similar to what s described as a project as the passion of working on a life project and what was sort of um your reasons for moving back.

&gt;&gt; Oh, thanks a I think I think the thought process there was you know I was doing my undergrad and my masters and at some point you know I wanted to go on also uh you know do a

PhD and you know perhaps be in academia. I was that was definitely one of the considerations I had because um you know I got into research uh pretty early on even in my undergrad career. I think the

excitement around AI and sort of uh showing that even even a lot of um PhDs and professors uh at my university were going on and then building out companies and showing that you know this

this research that's been done for so many years now is actually you know it's been started in the 80s but now is actually paying off these dividends and you know leading to this new

technological revolution as as I think professorly that it's it's sometimes a lot of these ideas take a while to actually materialize and we were seeing that materialization

sort of happen you know in in the Bay Area there and then uh so that was at that time you know again AI is one thing that required a lot of compute so a lot of these big industry labs had that

compute which uh you know universities had some of it but didn't at this scale and you know as I said scaling laws were happening so you wanted that scale I that was my reason to sort of you know

be at deep mind to see that scale and then but really I mean you know we need that sort of same infrastructure in India and we need the same research and people in India. That was what sort of

drove me back to here because now with the mission support we have similar compute in India and actually we were seeing that you know the scaling laws sure you can scale up but you know there

are new innovations that India sort of needs um and there are there I mean there's so many smart people here so we now that we have the compute we have the people it just for me just made a lot of

sense to be back here and you know build the same thing from from India. No, thanks for sharing that part. Um, so I'll open the floor for questions. There are mics here if people in the audience

want to ask. &gt;&gt; Hi, uh, my name is Praep Subramanyam. I come from the physical world. So AI, I have been recently building an agentic AI but I come from the physical world,

R&amp;D, uh, technology etc. So my question is to uh, Gsham G and to Par actually. So if you build any infrastructure the physical layer right in terms of IoT sensors and the one which is collecting

data is the most important part. So what I was finding in this whole discussion was data centers, infrastructure but nobody talked about the IoT part or the physical collection of data right for

example the electricity uh plants that you have whether it is at the power generation at the distribution transmission hardly any uh IoT based systems or scattera legacy systems right

they are not connected end to end in terms of building a digital twin of this electric system right we built something like this for the hana government but it's not scaled to the full extent right

so where is the role of India building the ecosystem for the uh physical layer which can generate so much amount of data uh uh which can help build this AGI right so uh while infrastructure is good

how do we create China does that right China has use cases which are full of physical physical layers which are there. We in India tend to for example UPI we build it did not require much of

a physical layer so we could easily build right. I think the catch is building the physical layer. What are we doing for that for example in your area sir?

Yeah thank you. Thank you for raising this particular uh concerns of the industry and the this is definitely an issue and uh let me be honest on this. We have very good infrastructure

particularly coming from the generation side and till transmission and going up to the uh low dispass centers. Till that absolutely we are at par with the world but when it comes to the actual

concentration to and link with the customers that means the distribution and the customer link probably we are still lacking behind. So that this the physical and this is the practical

situation wherein we are at present and you all must be hearing about the uh issues of the distribution licenses uh and their financial viability. So until this they are financially viable

probably they will not kick in into the area of automation. I'm I'm coming. &gt;&gt; So my question is why is the government not supporting to create this data? I am saying

&gt;&gt; I I'm coming there only. So we realize this right? It's not that we didn't realize in the government that uh this particular segment of the entire value chain of the power sector requires some

kind of a support. We had been supporting this particular segment earlier as well and in the recent one it is the RDSS program that has kicked in uh that uh and this this is this is a

program which is reform link program. So if you are able to achieve certain goals you'll be given the money or else you will not be given the money and this is supporting in two ways two very very

important ways. One is the infrastructure that is required for ensuring reliability of supply and second is the automation systems. That means we need smart meters. Unless you

have a communicable meters, you will not be able to do that kind of a smartness into the entire value chain of the product. So the as I said we had this missing link. We had come up to the low

state load dispatch centers but going from the state load dispatch centers and connecting with the customers you needed this kind of a smartness and that is how we introduced the smart meters and it is

it has rolled out uh and uh I think so far more than around around 3 crores of meters have already been installed in the country with 25 crores already in the in the pipeline. So hopefully we'll

be able to reach this kind of a number in in next say uh 2 years time frame or maybe in 3 years time frame. What that it leads to then it leads to the the the scatter system being developed in this

particular segment as well isn't it? And right now we do have the scatter system but it is it is coming from the from other other side of the fence. So we have we have shortlisted a few companies

and we are trying to work with them so that we have our own indig indigenous scattera systems which is supporting the entire value chain. You all are knowing about the cyber security concerns and we

do in a similar manner and so we want this kind of things to be to to be developed in India as well. Now what does this mean? The moment you have the the automation in this particular

segment, huge amount of data is long going to be generated. How do you use this data? So that is how I said that we already had one round of discussion with the startups and some of the AI and and

driven companies and let me tell you their enthusiasm level and they say sir give me one year time frame I am going to map all your assets across the country. I mean that's the kind of

enthusiasm in this youngsters and we really uh salute uh these uh this this particular group and that is how my distribution team uh in ministry they are working with these kind of uh uh

people and so that how quickly we are able to take their supports map them and try to really go further further what what whenever you have this data then the data has not only to be used only

for the billing purpose right ab it has to be used for your planning, planning of network, planning of optimization of resources. I mean you can define any number of use cases the moment you have

all this kind of so this is in pipeline I'm really thankful to you for reminding me this and we are we are trying to &gt;&gt; so so my point was that uh for example geo uh tagging of all the assets of your

uh you know right from the power generation to the uh end point to the consumer it's not done end to end today right it's also a security risk for the country if some other uh uh you server

is hosting all that data. It should all be hosted in India in the data centers. All every platform at the back end including the LLM which is managing that should be completely in India. Right? So

I'm saying that the end toend deployment of AGI will happen only when we have the real physical layer generating enormous amount of secure data which is not hosted in uh outside India and lying

within the sovereign data centers of India. I mean that's the kind of thought that government needs to think then we can become uh so that's why I wanted my second question to uh part that what are

we doing to build that kind of data which will help us set up the AGI part right so uh AGI doesn't come simply from uh some small use case right you need trillions and trillions of tokens and

data for that right and you need a domain expertise and knowledge to build that how do we do that &gt;&gt; was the question &gt;&gt; before part takes Uh definitely these

youngsters have better insights than me. Uh but uh this gap that you rightly just now mentioned uh about the data being hosted

elsewhere. In fact this we came to know the moment we started uh rolling out these smart meters in in in our systems and we found that the the suppliers are having their uh resources somewhere

going out. Immediately we took that action and we said that nothing doing all the data has to be housed in the country itself. So right now whatever smart meters that we are placing in the

country their data doesn't go out and it has to be in India. So wherever we are able to plug I think we are trying to do that and trying to create that physical layer so that we are cyber secured that

is very very important for the power sector. Par I think you take over now. &gt;&gt; Yeah. No thank you sir. I think just to echo some of sir's thought I think I mean a lot of work has actually been

done on this layer right so if you look at data sets we need indigenous data sets you have AI kosh by the India mission which is solving for this right Indian data sets for Indian companies to

build these frontier models if you look at compute as you rightly said you need you know we need compute in India so if you look at the budget policy we have this data centers we have till 2047 tax

for so you'll see a lot of these data centers um you know come in there already a lot of data centers being built you know we have uh you know Tarunji who's building E2 right for

India Indian infrastructure so that this compute uh you know the the frontier models of India can be can be hosted in India and it can all be done on local compute so I think the GPU

infrastructure that that is being supported by the India emission is actually just solving for for the exact uh case that you're seeing and we already over the last two years we've

you know scaled up our GPU so much for for this so I I I I do think a lot of work has already been done and you know this work is just going to continue to solve for this.

&gt;&gt; So I would like to uh kind of like uh uh take a stab at answering trying to answer your question. I think we are still having some gaps in terms of being able to harness the impatience of the

youth to build physical stuff. So unlike software the physical stuff actually costs money and the cycle time today is very high. So you need to be able to reach the nearest 3D printer to be able

to prototype. You need to be able to uh kind of like design the chips. You need to be able to solve for all the physics problems. I think what the LLMs will do for us in the frontier models will do

for us is to reduce the cycle time of the thinking part like say you have to do the actual physical world calculations you have to do the digital twin part that part is uh used to take a

lot of time that gets solved faster but what we still need to solve is that we need to do the prototyping that is the part we still need to solve but I think like uh uh having spoken to a few

companies who do who used to do physical prototyping they have done away with a lot of physical prototyping altogether and they are just doing it on top of the data twins now so uh so I think

somewhere we will converge so that's my hope &gt;&gt; so so I am saying that imagine the next UPI uh uh innovation is say the agentic AI for the vending machines I'm working

on that but physical layer right of the sensors which pull the data for a vending machine the back end of that hardly any vending machine is connected to IoT. It doesn't have any physical

layer. It is just used like a dubar. Right? So the point I'm saying is that why the government is not enabling the the the instruments which help the connectivity of this data to the AI and

the data centers and then the intelligence can be built to automate to create more jobs. Uh and uh you know it's very counterintuitive. We say that we will build agentic AI we're going to

reduce people. No, actually the work is going to increase because the vending machine infrastructure will go 10 times or 20 times. It'll become like Japan, right? You'll have more vending

machines. But I do not think that that kind of an infrastructure private industries. I am from the private industry. I cannot build it for me dayto-day running a vending machine uh

business is I I get cheap labor. I cannot use sensors. Right? So this is the catch 20T kind of situation where most of the infrastructure that we have in India we have cheap labor we still

manage with that we cannot take the next leap. How do we take the next leap by getting the platforms like UPI to be built with physical layers? That was the question.

I think some of the answer will be given by the India energy stack. I think you must have heard about that and I I'm also a member of uh that committee and we are we are deliberating on all these

use cases and where that gaps are. So definitely I think we'll we'll take care of that. Thank you. &gt;&gt; No, thank you sir for asking that question. I'd like to circulate the mic

in the audience if other people uh would like to ask questions. People can just uh raise their hands um if they have any. I think there's one um in the back. Hello, good morning

primary sector, secondary sector and tary sector model. What about the manufacturing sector? Semiconductor industry.

What about 932? What about the manufacturing sector? Nothing is to the exclusion of another sector eventually that will feed into the other sectors. So as long as the

intent is there to be Indian and buy Indian automatically problems. Okay. Thank you. Manufacturing is very wide. Yeah.

Microprocessor units. &gt;&gt; Microprocessors. I think microprocessor data centers micro microprocessor. What about microprocessor?

Actually microprocessor mobile phone server desktop there are about like a couple of hundred pieces of intellectual property.

&gt;&gt; Now all that intellectual property So licensing India because the IP is getting developed with foreign money to volumes which are domestically available. So domestically available

system on chip IP will see a domestic market. So like I think the important part is to move the country forward. Build a large market which is interconnected with the

world. Once you have large markets interconnected with the world then youngsters who are very impatient to go and build things and say that okay it's commercializ they will go and achieve

the success. Like I said, planning. So free market allows you to work on all these things in parallel and it throws

up the opportunities. Basically we are moving gradually in the manufacturing sector. I don't have much information about the matey and other areas

equipment almost 100% indigenous. There are certain which is ranging from 50% to 80%. &gt;&gt; They are being targeted to see that the domestic content of that equipment also

goes to 100% in a given time frame. Now there are still equipments which are yet to take off. almost 20% how do we really reach to 100%. So there are at different stages

of uh indigenization and but definitely we are targeting that all these equipments must be manu manufactured in India it's same agreeil IGBT is again an electronic equipment

which is right now we are taking from outside we had the challenge here and we said nothing doing now there are Indian companies are going to manufacture this so LNT and power grid collaboration we

have given them the task for two years and they need to develop in two years and commercialize it &gt;&gt; so similarly we are taking it right &gt;&gt; thank you wanted to make a few comments

&gt;&gt; so uh let me divide up that answer into multiple parts uh what was it so um the word microp processor of course is no longer used right we don't really talk about microp processors the most of the

current a IML all runs on GPUs the architecture is very different from traditional microp processor so uh there is for at least uh space and some of the other sectors

we have a fairly successful you know operation running at semiconductor complex limited chandigar right mali so the plant atcl uh produces some earlier generation microp

processors and produces chips for a variety of other things. There are of course similar other entities around the country but most of the effort of uh what you're putting in the VSSI design

space the chip design space so to speak most of it is design uh the manufacturing most countries and I'm not saying only India most countries Europe US in fact many of the earlier

semiconductor manufacturing plants in the US shut down and are now producing solar panels right so So uh the most of the efforts around the world are fabulous design houses and India leads

in that. So if you look at u you know Bangalore, Pune, Hyderabad and to some extent some in Noa uh very significant fraction of designs done for many of the smartphones

are actually done within the country almost 100%. In fact some are actually really 100%. complete design uh that design is a major component of the cost of developing a new design. It's it's

actually the manufacturing is there but most of the cost is really uh in the initial stage really the manufacturing sorry the design cost that's happening in the country. uh scaling up the uh you

know the semiconductor design plant itself will take time but you can see it's already rapidly happening uh on the in the case of memories flash memories and so on there's already uh very large

investment that's happened by a you know fairly prominent multinational in Gujarat and elsewhere that's already taken off very well right uh there are similar efforts that probably you will

start hearing about their outcomes and outputs in the next two or three years or even less. So I think as far as the uh you know that space is concerned uh uh the Indian engineers have it almost

entirely covered. So uh I don't think that's a cause for worry right I think the uh interlinking of these parts will happen uh if you ask me organically because everything exists in one place.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. Uh with that uh I would like to thank all of our panelists uh for spending so much time and answering everyone's questions. I would like to thank the organizers for letting us go

30 minutes over the time. Um and thank you so much. I'd like to invite um the India mission um delegates to facilitate the panelists. Thank you so much everybody.

Thank you to Subat for all the moderation as well. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you folks. Thank you
