## 📝 Transcript

English guests, colleagues and esteemed speakers. Namaskar. I, Amandep Dhanova, Indian Revenue Service Officer of 2018 batch welcome you all to this symposium by the income

tax department on AIdriven enforcement for better governance through effective compliance and services. Artificial intelligence today is reshaping every domain of governance.

And when it comes to public services, the stakes are uniquely high. Understanding these stakes, the income tax department has called upon the distinguished speakers from the

industry, the academia and regulatory bodies to delve on the most pertinent question of the hour that is how can artificial intelligence enable easier compliance, lower disputes and

strengthen trustbased governance. Today's sessions are structurally uh structured deliberately into two categories. Category one of industry and academia and category 2 of regulatory

bodies. With that I would like to introduce honorable chairman central board of direct taxes Shri Ravi Agarwal. sir is a distinguished Indian revenue service officer of 1988 batch who brings

over three decades of rich experience across multiple verticles of the income tax department. He has played a pivotal role in key phases of the department's digital

transformation including the establishment of central processing center. Known for his strong digital mindset and technocratic approach, he has sir has consistently encouraged the

use of data and technology to strengthen administration and hence compliance and translate data into revenue through prudent approach. Now I request principal chief

commissioner on of income tax Delhi Shiri Anan Jasur to kindly welcome honorable chairman sir with the plant. [applause] &gt;&gt; Thank you sir.

I request all the speakers to kindly uh come on to the this side of the stage so that we may have a group photo. I request chairman sir as well as the member madams to join for the group

photo. All the speakers from category 1 and category 2 please join us for a group Are you hungry? Thank you madams and sirs. I request the

speakers from category one to kindly take the uh uh uh place on the stage please. I request Abhishek Kumar sir Romesh Ruru Shi uh T Shir Nawasan Professor Mosam

and uh Shere Martin Wilcox to take the seats please. Uh now I request honorable chairman sir to kindly set the tone for the symposium by his opening remarks.

Uh good evening uh ladies and gentlemen. Well, I'm delighted to welcome you all to today's symposium which is uh under the ages of uh AI impact summit

servjanay servan sukhai welfare for all happiness for all which speaks the theme it in in fact is a very powerful theme right how do you use AI for welfare of all and

happiness for all that's the basic intent and within it the sessions today would be AIdriven enforcement uh in this summit and it is a privilege to join a

conversation that brings together policy makers, technologists, enforcement agencies and academia on a subject that will

shape the future of governance. Now, income tax administration is at a critical inflection point especially with the enactment of the new income tax act uh 2025

along with the corresponding rules, forms, procedures which would be effective from 1st of April 26. It represents a paradigm shift in the philosophy

and procedures practices of the direct tax administration in India. And what makes it different is that going forward it is going to be a technologydriven ecosystem that would be put in place.

And that's how and that's why the role of AI becomes so important and this uh gathering today becomes all the more relevant. Now the new income tax act while

simplifying the language and procedures reduces uh interpretational ambiguity and brings tax certainty and as I mentioned uh since it is going to be more a

ruledriven technologydriven uh ecosystem the changes in the act the language in the act would help in uh also putting in place

uh the algorithms which uh through AI going forward would reduce and minimize the scope for uh different interpretations. uh the positive environment created by

the income tax act 2025 which is reflected from uh the feedback that we have received from the stakeholders and the prudent approach of tax administration that we are providing uh

since a few years uh uh since last about few years provides a robust foundation for sustaining and advancing future reform measures to reduce litigation enhance tax certainty

and trustbased voluntary compliance. [clears throat] AI has the potential to transform every sector by amplifying human capability by turning vast data into insights, automating mundane and

routine work, and enabling faster, smarter decisions at scale. for law enforcement. This means we can strengthen how we prevent, detect and respond, but only if we build the right

preparedness and capacity building through highquality sharable data, secured systems, clear accountability, strong safeguards and continuous training. And here the basic theme

anchored by the honorable prime minister in manner of vision becomes so important because ultimately what does manov reflect moral and ethical systems

accountable governance national sovereignty accessible and inclusive AI and valid and legitimate systems. So what do these words reflect ultimately? These reflect

that uh while we have in AI a very powerful tool but at the same time we need to be conscious about it as to how do we put in place and apply AI in our overall governance overall welfare of

people happiness of people while being ethical also conscious of the fact that if not applied with the responsibility the results can be uh you be uh different.

So we intend to adopt AI to support enforcement with clear accountability, build on secure and sovereign data foundations, ensure access to phased adoption and continuous training and

validate systems for fairness and lawful use. We have AI and it's faster you see developing within the income tax department even

across what we need to see is how do we build our capacity our resources because here is a solution you have some AI tools solutions but for that you need to drive the the human has to drive the AI

rather than AI driving the human and for that to happen you have to have you have to build that capacity in your resources in the human resources. We need to be conscious of the fact that okay what are

the pluses and the uh pitfalls in uh adopting AI. We have to be conscious about it when we are adopting AI. Uh one of the features I would just like to share one experience that had I I had

just yesterday. So I was told that uh through AI you can actually uh develop some codes. I didn't know about it. So yesterday I asked my son well how is it possible and uh

I was uh proposing to develop a app for our training purposes. So he told me that okay this is how we can go about it. This is the open source and so on so forth and I put in place some sort of uh

uh framework for uh the technology for this uh training module. spent about five six hours uh in the night and what was interesting was within five six hours. One one actually was able to get

a reasonably robust and matured uh you see code and a full uh you see application which uh broadly takes care of the requirements of uh capturing uh training in the department.

Now why I mentioned this example? Well uh otherwise but for this uh I would say facility development of this code would have taken months

but then uh with a you see uh with spending five to six hours one was able to come up with some code. Even if I say it is elementary, it is basic, you have a

platform on which you can build on. Right? So that is the power of AI. But can I blindly actually rely on it? The answer is no. I have to apply myself and see to it that okay, you already have

this platform. How do I build it up? And that is the potential of AI that it actually would help us to not do routine and mundane work. it would translate our effort from a routine work to a enhanced

work and that is where our capacity and our maturity would lie. So this is an opportunity for us in the tax department uh in I if because we are all here in that context but also as individuals

that uh we leverage on the power of AI but we leverage it with conscious being conscious of the fact that we have to drive it rather than AI driving us. So our approach needs to be practical

with use of proven applications for data integration, risk and priority scoring, anomaly detection, language support and workflow automation with constant testing and learning. So we stay aligned

with AI advancements and do not fall behind. Now this is also very important because things are developing and we when we talk about uh developed India 2047

how do we actually keep pace with it. So you have to actually align yourself with the developments that are taking place and each of the organizations be it in the government or outside have to align

together so that together as a nation we grow and we put uh these uh opportunities to practice and provide to our taxpayers and stakeholders. you see the best ofass uh ecosystem and

facilities. Over the past two financial years, we have applied AI in the department though to a limited extent but then it has uh yielded results. As you would all be aware targeted

nudges have led to 1.11 cr taxpayers filing updated returns with a revenue impact of more than 8,800 crores. And if you talk about foreign assets then uh the foreign assets worth about

99 99,000 crores uh and foreign income of about 6,500 crores has also been you see uh uh declared by the taxpayers on the basis of the prompts that have been given by the tax department.

So we are moving from intent to action. We are scaling AI based risk assessment, strengthening digital forensics and analytics and building AI support for taxpayer services to make compliance

easier and enforcement more precise. The discussions at the summit will help us refine our approaches, set clear government standards and scale that works to improve speed,

consistency and fairness in enforcement. I wish all the best and I I'm sure that the deliberations here would be really useful and enriching. Thank you. Uh thank you sir for setting the tone

and direction so clearly. Now as we begin with category one we turn to industry and academia the two ecosystems that are shaping the intellectual and technological

foundations of the artificial intelligence. While government defines uh purpose and safeguards. It is the industry that builds scalable systems and academia that pushes the frontiers

of responsible and explainable AI. This segment will help us to understand not only what is technologically possible but also what is practical, scalable and sustainable for public administration

and law enforcement. Now we move to session one project insight 2.0 0 where AI enabled compliance and taxpayer services are being operationalized at scale. I call upon Shri Abhishek Kumar

Sur Commissioner of income tax insights who has been instrumental in shaping the income tax department's digital ecosystem through project insight and other initiatives. Joining him are Shiri

Romesh Reauru, global head of engineering at LTI Minry and Shiri Nasanti, technology lead at LTI Minry, bringing three decades of enterprise technology leadership. May I invite all

the three speakers to take us to the next phase of AI enabled compliance. I uh I request the speakers to be mindful of the time limit. Thank you. Good evening everyone. One project

inside is existing project of income tax. So it is basically datab housing and business intelligence project of department. Under this project data is ingested from various sources. We have

varied data sources, income tax, internal data sources as well as thirdparty data sources. So as part of data warehouse, we receive data from these varied

sources. After aggregating these data, we generate various business outcomes which facilitate taxpayer journey. So first key outcome is profile view. This

aggregated information is used to generate consolidated profile view which enables income tax department in getting complete view of transactions of taxpayers

at next level. This detailed information helps in risk assessment. So as we know by comparing information available in return as well as third party data we are able to do risk assessment. We also

engage in evigation and nudge campaigns which enable taxpayers to comply in voluntary manner. It enables very key taxpayer services like AIS. AIS is annual information

statement. Under AIS, taxpayers get complete set of relevant information which helps them in filing of return. It also helps in prefilling of return of income thereby facilitating taxpayers.

So these are the existing services under project inside. Now project inside 2.0 has been initiated. So with the advancement of latest

technologies like AI, ML and LLM we are going to further enhance taxpayer journey. So let us see briefly what is the value addition this project is going to bring especially through AI infusion.

So when it comes to AIS, it is a compilation of information relevant to taxpayers which helps in filing of return. With new project we are going to expand the scope of this

information. So it will ensure wider coverage for taxpayers. Next is correctness. As we know third party agencies report information to income tax department many times there are

maybe errors in this data. So by enabling end to end digital linkage between taxpayers and data providers which enables taxpayers to give feedback. we will be able to ensure more

accurate and precise information for the taxpayers. Next important game changer will be conversational chatbot. These days people are used to querying using voice

and text using various LLM applications. So first of all, conversational chatword in AIS will enable taxpayers to query at the level of systems and understand various line items in AIS. Any issues

with information reported where ever complicated issues are involved, it will be linked with Griven's retraasal system. So if any query cannot be addressed at simple level and it

requires technical support, it will be addressed by linking it with grievance retraceal system and providing technical support. Next is prefilling of return of income. So as our information coverage

gets expanded, prefilling will become more accurate, more precise and it will take into account feedback given by taxpayers. That way making life easier for the taxpayers.

So these were the steps before filing of return. Coming to next step after filing of return how this AI infusion helps the taxpayer. So e- verification we discussed it is mainly about matching of

information reported in return with thirdparty information. With new insight 2.0 we will be able to do e- verification in more timely manner. It will bring ease of compliance

as on it processing of uninstructured data has become quite better because of technologies like LLM. So we will have capability to receive and analyze

feedback data which is in the form of free text or unstructured format. And as we strengthen end to end linkage between taxpayers and data providers, it will give better models of branding to handle

taxpayers issues and better assess their response. Next coming to campaigns and nudge. After we identify any issue, department normally sends SMS emails in

non-intrusive manner to enable taxpayers to comply. Currently, it is more static in nature with the AI infusion. Our campaigns will become more intelligent because they will learn from historical

data and outcomes. Not only that, our nudge campaigns and templates they will become more contextdriven leveraging LLM. So ease of compliance will be ensured in many ways

like we will have graded campaign multilingual campaign not just English but incorporating other Indian languages and camp a scope of campaign will be expanded by including more channels of

communication other than SMS and email. Now coming to last step, how does it help taxpayers in end to end life cycle? So first key step is quick availability of accurate information to the

taxpayers. We already discussed it as part of it will be enabled. Next, our nudge campaigns will become more effective through infusion of AI. A very small fraction of cases where it leads

to litigation. Even we will be able to do litigation risk assessment through AI infusion. With the advent of LLM, it is possible to tag issues in the assessment orders, appilate orders, judicial

orders. So we will be able to tag issues. We will be able to link judicial orders and as next step we will be able to even predict wability of the case and ultimately it will result in reduction

in litigation. So all these business objectives we seek to achieve through insight 2.0 especially through infusion of AI. These are the business objectives and how they will be achieved. What is

the technology estate proposed and how technical implementation will take place that will be explained by Mr. Rome from LTM. Thank you &gt;&gt; ma'am. I got the message. I'll make

Maggie. I'll finish in two minutes. Um [snorts] thank you very much sir. Thanks uh for the opportunity to be here uh in the August presence of all the income tax officials.

I want to leave you with three key messages. The first and foremost is the launch of Barat vers. Thank you ma'am. Barat vers second uh I'll talk about the importance

of right action and the last part of it is general intelligence in the context of CBD. So the first one u we at LTM LTM now

have this product offering called blueverse. Blue verse is the agent tech platform on which you can build your agents. Sir Chairman sir spoke about how he was

able to build these agents without writing code and hence think of it as this is the platform on which you can build all the five layers that are required for any multi-agent system to

be built. The five layers are the foundational models, the LLMs, the data layer, the knowledge layer, the orchestration layer and the consumption layer on the top.

All these layers are pre-built and hence the ability of CBD to build their multi-agent system faster is what we bring and this is what we've implemented for our global customers.

What we're launching is the Indianized version of blue vers what we're calling batworth and hence purposeuilt for CBD. Why is right action important? Right action as you might know generative AI

probabilistic in nature. It is going to guess the the next word or generate the next word or the next pixel the next frame in the video. But in the context of CBDT, you can't have something which

is probabilistic. You need to move the needle to become more deterministic. And hence our ability to guarantee that right action in every condition, scenario, criteria is what rate action

is all about. Lastly, I was uh in the morning listening to Deis Hassabis who's the Google deep mind and he said AGI probably is five uh years away while AGI which is general

intelligence humanlike intelligence is five years away. What you need is general intelligence of the CBD and hence right data right context leading to that right action. We have filed

eight patents on creating this OGI and OGI will be bundled with our barat vers that will get implemented for CBD. I'll ask Shin in the interest of time to take us through the technical architecture

but a big thank you for the opportunity. &gt;&gt; Uh thank you sir and thank you. So uh quickly like you know I'll try to make it very fast. So uh the most important thing is that you know while

he spoke about right action everything how do I do it? So everybody talks about LLM. It's not about deploying a simple LLM like what we are doing here. What we are doing is we are building something

called as your SLMs which is your long small language model along with the regular LLM which we'll be using for the uh part system as such. Okay. So if you see this the purpose of this SLM is

going to be it is going to be very very much income tax based. It is going to be for the ITD officials and it is for going to be for the CBD and we are going to ingest them with data which is going

to be your income tax laws your information data other references and anything and everything which is very closely related to the environment. It means that there's going to be data

control. You're going to have a quality vetted data. Everything is going to be within the system. It is going to be secular. nothing is going to go outside. It is going to be what I call as a

sovereign LLM for this system. So when you look at it, how am I going to do that? So I cannot be retraining the entire LM fully. It's it's not cost effective. So we use the concept as Lora

which is your parameation where you don't you can just spend you can do it at 1 to 2% of the training overall training model cost. We can do that. So what it does is that It takes

all the matrices which is related to this particular data and it starts training on that. So what happens is that you get the proper

details. Now what do I do is that still I need to create so I use metad all the details which is there related to and source citations which is going to

distingu so I want to make sure that you know we are very effective and if the last and the most important is your what I'm going to do is that I'm going

to look at your structure structure then we going to look at the sections the presidents then entities and the compliance rules everything is going to go inside this completely we are

building it for you what actually happens is that because of this you'll be able to summarize you'll be able to have multi- language Then you also have it is not your

typical legal legal contang everybody. body else you will have directly being able to use it

let me take next two minutes what am I going to do so how am I going to do this so if I I'm just going to take you two journey we going to 25 of them but I will just have two of them show you a

sample so the first thing is about your what is the first time the most important thing is that we do not want to frustrate the people because they are getting the data from external sources

we are getting external sources data and we If there is issues in that it's a problem. So what we doing is that eval so we have a proper we don't have a proper API which does that then

when you want to talk about it currently it is going to be FAQs probably and it is going to be a bunch of you know uh probably like knowistic chat is the word I use now I'm going to make it make it

more what I call as truly context and intent driven chat bots or conversational which will kind of enable them will take them through the journey for them to say how they should last.

So what we are doing is that then also we are putting in the continer. Okay. And next what we do is that we have a proper we are contining the year. So we

do a verification. So we will be able to auto detect and match the discrepancies. We are able to match the data saying that where they have gone wrong rather than telling them what is done right or

wrong which help them to do that. Then once that is done this will actually go through that and now everybody is intentionally doing it. I'm sorry I'm not using the mic please. I think I'm

loud enough to talk to everybody's hear. So I I don't know I have so this agent primally is that it makes sure that complence is intentional. We make it the template is also very very human human

based human based and make sure that you have to go. So here at the end last we have problems. So what we do is that we identify agents we look at the cases every other day and make sure that

availability is predicted. So it is going for this the entire thing you see that is being created is going to primary what I call as input for you to do this. Okay, let me go to the next

one. This is going to be general though I put as so when I talk about conversational AI system it is for anybody and everybody most importantly for anyone to look at the portals

understand where it is and then go behind them is a problem. So what am I going to do is that I'm going to have a context aware intelligent uh domain aware uh NLP chatbot which

understands and explains them what I call idiot idiot proof which is like a common man he should not get worried about the legal jarens rather tell them how what he should do step by step that

is one of the primary focus for me and we are going to use certain set of llama uh you know we are going we going to use the LLM SLMs and also SLM which your inbuilt SLM which is

going to be built across. So uh overall if you really ask me inside 2.0 will be moving away from uh like you know it is it's about more about enabling intelligence to the both to the officers

and to the uh the the citizens and making them more happy and you know as chairman said about happy for all. I think that's exactly the thing which you are trying

Thank you sir. Uh we are already running behind by 20 minutes so I request the further speakers to kindly speed up. Uh now professor Mossum founding head of Yari school of AI at uh uh Indian

Institute of Technology Delhi and one of India's foremost AI thought leaders will share perspectives on the possible usage of AI by by law enforcement agencies and the road road ahead. Sir, the floor is

yours. &gt;&gt; Thank you for the kind introduction. Um Um I was asked to speak on the usage of AI by law enforcement agencies in general and not just on uh income tax.

So I will uh talk about a little bit more general uh perspective. uh I should say that I have been fortunate to be you know involved with some of the earlier activities in uh income tax department

and I personally feel that you know the kind of uh support that income tax department in India gives to our users is much better than the support that US gives their users. I have seen that

because I've filed taxes in both countries and I feel that you know there is no equivalent of the 26 as form there. There are just so much support that we have here. we can check how uh

the work is going forward. Also, I'm not a law enforcement expert. So, I got some uh feedback from Shanka Jasal who is DJP Lakshad Pensan Manha who is director DRDO Young Scientist Lab. So, thank you

to them. Okay. So, to me this is the context per 100,000 people the number of police officers in India are much less than in developed countries like and I will

count China now as a developed country. In China, US and Germany we are at 155. they are at you know 200 300 and so on. For judges per million people it is recommended that we should have 50. We

have about 15 to 22 depending upon which news article you read. There are about 29% police cases which are still pending investigation and about 4.85 85 court cases spending for over one year with

that kind of a sentiment and I don't know how it is for the income tax but you know we are always in use of high expertise and therefore the need to use AI in India is very high because if we

need to deal with this setup that we are in we need to somehow augment ourselves with technology now of course you can use AI in various ways and the aspects to think about it

are you using in law enforcement before a crime is committed. Are you using it to predict crime? Are you using it to figure out what we should do to stop crime? Or when the crime has been

committed, are we thinking about how to investigate crime and how to make judgments for it? And depending upon where we are, all of these places EI can be used. Similarly, AI can be used not

only by income tax and GST, but also by military, by maritime, by traffic police, by other police and so on so forth. and also what kind of data are we getting in. So for most of this

conversation we are going to be talking about uh financial data which is structured data but there's also visual data, language data, speech data and bringing it together adds to

intelligence. So you can now take one from the first column, one from the second column and one for the third column and actually create new AI use cases. So for example, we can do much

better job of monitoring in traffic police if we somehow use the visual data in some ways and so on so forth. So you can actually start thinking about really really interesting possibilities here

and in the next few slides I'm just going to show you very basic some examples. So for example in the case of image or video uh in 2014 we were very proud that Sudat used to say that 27%

crime has been reduced just because there were CCTVs and there was face recognition and if three and three to four people in a known database came together police would go there and it

would reduce the crime. Somehow we haven't seen that happening in India elsewhere other than Sudat. I don't know why this is really old. So we are really poised to do this. We should really have

CCTVs everywhere so that we can do a much better job of crime surveillance. DRDO lab is doing a much very interesting job of obfuscation. If you are wearing a mask, if you have an

interesting, you know, hair has changed, can you can we figure out who you are? Uh, of course, visual intelligence for traffic should be very easy. We still see people coming in the opposite side

of the road or not using helmet. That can be absolutely automated with very simple uh imagery. A satellite imagery analysis is also very interesting. For example, the only way we know that China

has a new port in Djibouti is because of the satellite images. It's very easy to actually I mean it's not easy to analyze but we can analyze the data is there. When did we say that data is there for

all the world so easily accessible to us? Well, today it is. And for income tax, by the way, you can also start thinking about where a person is living and what kind of locality it is and how

does it light up in the night and that tells you the affluence level. And you can start using that kind of information. This was a very interesting case where US Marine Coast Guard, a

marine uh ship carrier, a flight carrier was being chased by 20 Iranian uh vessels uh in in the ocean. And we we knew because uh the satellites can see. Same for maritime surveillance. We have

so many use cases of AI today such as digiatra. We can use face recognition for searching of the missing persons. But we can start thinking about anomalous behavior like anomalous

vehicular behavior. One of the very famous car rape that happened in Delhi happened that with one car was just going on the road taking U-turn going on the road taking U-turn going on the

road. These kinds of very anomalous behavior should have easily been detected if he were doing this. Even today in taxi safety I know that women are still worried about taking an Uber

late at night in Delhi even though we have a panic button because we don't know whether the panic button really works or it doesn't work. But if there is any anomalous behavior of the taxi

driver, there should be a clear mechanism to say that the driver is not following what they're supposed to be following and it should be very easy to prevent such crime. Same for taxi bus

train safety monitoring. We go on to textual intelligence. A lot of people are interested in anti-terrorism and so on so forth. Can we easily and quickly answer questions?

For example, if I if we just killed Osama bin Laden and we gave you the laptop of Osama bin Laden, how much time would it take us to actually go through all his documents? I hope not much

because AI should be there to help you. For example, I was working on this long time back and at the time uh you know we could figure out who are the entities active in Iraq. This is what my system

gave you know 15 years ago that these are all the players who were active in Iraq at the time and if you want to know something about one part particular player you could just say what do we

know about this person and you it'll give you a quick answer a quick summary this kind of intelligence now we have at our fingertips and it should be used for figuring out who are the bad actors

whether in the income tax or in other kind of uh uh law enforcement. Uh I can move on. Speech to text for quick FIR filing. A chatbot to support citizens. We just heard about uh uh u project

insight too where there will be a chatbot. But we also need a chatbot for our own income tax department people because they need to somehow deal and work with the data and if they have to

be writing code every time it would be very hard. As Mr. Agaval said earlier AI can write code now. So we should have text to coding systems for our own IT department so that they can easily get

to the data that they're looking for and that makes it convenient for them to find the right information. on the more financial intelligence side um the input here would be more

structured data for example right so there are so many interesting new stories that are coming out which makes me very proud that you know we are we have a very very uh active department

for example it's just like yesterday or day before yesterday that 60 terabytes of billing data and 1.77 lakh restaurant ids were uncovered and 70,000 cr tax evasion scam was uncovered this was just

using the information and some crunching by the data that by AI that these people were deleting a lot of invoices and once the system recognized that there was a pattern going on you figured out that

this this is an anomalous pattern and then income tax person and an analyst can actually look at it and figure out what is going on. Similar things have happened

where large or frequent bank deposits can flag mismatches. ITR filing AI is tracking suspicious tax claims. So it seems it is very clear our citizens know that there is AI that is looking at them

but there are still scams going on and if we can detect anomalous behavior that this is not the expected behavior we might be able to find even new scams that we couldn't guess ahead of time and

if we start to put this information together it becomes even more interesting for example mule accounts. I have been told that college students have mule accounts but if we know from

their Facebook sorry I'm too old Insta pages or whatever the more recent social media is that they are just college students but their bank accounts are going through a lot of uh you know churn

it would be very easy for us to predict that maybe it's a mule account similar other cases of tax evasions and money laundering could come together if multiple sources of data from the social

media feed from the financial document from the employment feed from investment from the various kinds of purchases they do sometimes these will be invoices if these are paper invoices maybe an OCR

would be needed so there will be a vision uh requirement there are also interesting collusion rings generally we have found that people who are bad actors they support each other in the

bad acting and so if you create a graph around it and start looking at collusion rings we might be able to find these people better I think the sky is the limit there's another one very

interesting phenomenon that where crime happens more that is where we deploy more people but once we do that people who are doing the crime figure out that oh we have more people here they go

elsewhere this is a game this is a game between attacker and defender and if uh the attacker knows what the defender is doing it is very easy for attacker to change the uh the place or whatever it

is that they are doing their style and continue their game. So it is important to not just go where the crime is but go where the crime might be in the future once they get to know that uh the the

defenders are going there. Yeah, I'm going to finish in 2 minutes. So uh people have studied these security games for example in elephant poaching scenarios in uh coastal patrol scenarios

and we have found much much better uh performance because of that. Let me take the last minute and say what are the challenges in the use of AI in these scenarios because there's a lot of

opportunities. It's a lot of exciting lot a lot of excitement but we have to be careful. First of all, we cannot make this completely autonomous. If AI starts to reach out to citizens directly and

starts to make mistakes, it'll create a lot of problem. People will be unhappy. People will be worried. We will lose the trust in the system. It is important that our intelligence analysts and AI

they work together. AI brings [snorts] up the issues. AI maybe uh generates a lead but the lead is processed by the human to maintain the trust in the system. Now that is where risk

assessment becomes very important. Overtriggering is also a problem because if you make lot lots of alerts then people become immune to the alerts and we have to figure out how we can do this

in a trustful fashion. If you don't do this right, we you get into the bias of the algorithms. And it has been shown that uh earlier when in judicial settings AI was tried, uh it made

mistakes in favor of white people and opposed to African-American people. And we are a very diverse society with so many casts and social strata. If we got those biases in our models, that will be

very very devastating. So we have to be very mindful that the AI bias doesn't creep in and we have a human in the loop. Also it is important that we gather data in a centralized repository.

We are used to a system where one hand of the government doesn't talk to the other hand of the government. Project insight is trying to fix that. I'm so happy other scenarios are also trying to

fix that. We should make sure that the data comes together so that intelligence comes out of it. The interjurisdictional boundaries don't come into the middle. The other thing is that our defenders,

our you know intu uh IT personnel, the analysts, the uh law enforcement agencies, they need to be smarter than the attackers. They need to be smarter than the attacker because the attacker

will be always creative in figuring out the next attack. And if we have not been thinking ahead of time, we will be missing out. Finally, we have to make sure with all this new data that comes

in, there is obviously increased scrutiny, there is increased surveillance and it doesn't hinge on civil liberties and privacy of personnel. So these are the things that

we have to be mindful of. But I think the sky is the limit and I'm really happy that we are doing this and AI is being used more and more in law enforcement agencies these days in

India. Thank you very much. [applause] Thank you sir for uh such an insightful uh perspective. Now uh Mr. Martin Wilcox, senior vice president at Terra Data and a global leader in AIdriven

data analytics will speak on AIdriven risk analytics of financial data for the law enforcement agencies. So please &gt;&gt; good afternoon everyone. Lovely to be here. Uh I will go a little quickly

because I think we're uh slightly over time. Um so if I say anything that you don't understand or if you have any questions, do feel free to come and talk to me in the hall afterwards. So I'm

going to talk a little bit about the use of AI and machine learning for risk analytics. I'm going to focus on financial services. Um and let's skip some of the preamble

in the interest of saving some time. I'm going to give you some examples of the way we're all already using the technology that I hope will motivate and inspire you to think about how you could

use the technology yourself. And the first example I'm going to give you is anti-moneyaundering. This is a large US financial institution. Uh we've talked a lot about data warehousing when we're

talking about insight. So for for comparison purposes, this is a data warehouse that supports 200 applications, five billion queries a year and manages 10 pabytes of data. So

by any definition, it's a sizable data warehouse. But size is not always a good proxy for value. And this particular organization challenged us to help them deliver more value around

anti-moneyaundering in particular. And their way of working previously was to copy large volumes of data out of the data warehouse to another analytics environment. And whenever we do that, we

create cost, we create complexity. We do more data engineering. That means more maintenance. So we were able to demonstrate that we could bring the analytic processing to the data in the

data warehouse instead of copying the data out of the data warehouse. And in that way we can train models on larger training data sets. And that means we can train more accurate models. It means

we can reduce cost and complexity as well. And when you get all done, what that really means is you can train more accurate mod more more accurate models more quickly and get them into

production more quickly where you can catch the bad actors. I think a couple of the earlier speakers spoke about anomaly detection and anomaly detection is also a key business

challenge across very many domains in very many industries. This second example is a large and diversified European retail financial bank. It has multiple subsidiaries and as part of its

process of closing the books, it needs to roll up all the transactions from those subsidiaries and identify errors, inconsistencies and fraud. And anomaly detection is a very complex and a very

difficult problem. The first reason it's a difficult problem is it's a classic example in machine learning of the so-called unbalanced class problem. In British English, and I apologize, I

don't know how well this expression translates, but in British English, we would say we're looking for a needle in a haystack. We're looking for one bad record in millions of records. And that

means training a supervised machine learning model is a problem. The other challenge that we have is what is normal can change very frequently. And so if we build a rules-based system,

we tend to identify very many false positives. And those false positives overwhelm the human users. We have human users that are constantly chasing down false alerts instead of actually

identifying the anomalous data. And so for all of these reasons, we often prefer an AI and a machine learning approach. And in fact, in this particular example, what we're doing is

we're training ensemble models where we're combining statistical, supervised, and unsupervised machine learning methods. And we're training multiple models per segment. And that additional

complexity gives us greater accuracy. But that additional complexity also gives us a scale challenge and means we need a very scalable high performance platform to deploy at this level of

complexity and close the books faster than we otherwise would. And the previous spoker talked about graph analytics for collusion detection and this is an example of the use of graph

analytics for collusion detection. This is a major Asian bank and the particular challenge that this bank has is around credit card fraud around collusion. So they have uh groups of bad actors who

move money between each other's accounts to create simulated income flows, but it isn't actually income. It's just the same group of people moving the same group of money around accounts. In that

way, it looks to the bank that they have a high income because they have a high income. They're approved for a high without ever paying the credit card. And as the previous speaker said,

traditional analytic methods find it very difficult to identify this kind of fraud. These actors look like they're great credit risks because it looks like they have a high income. And the way

that we can break these collusion rings is through graph analytics and understanding the networks of bad actors. But to build these sort of graphs at India scale is incredibly

complicated because graph analytics is an squared problem. And so we need again scalable and performance systems and to bring the complex graph algorithms to the data in the data warehouse instead

of trying to copy samples of data out of the data warehouse. If we have to cut the graph by taking small samples of data out of the data warehouse then the risk is we miss the bad actors that

we're trying to catch. I want to talk a little bit now about next generation AI use cases. And at Terodata, when we speak of next generation AI use case, we we're

typically looking for four characteristics. And we won't go through all of those four characteristics today in the interest of time, but as a couple of the previous speakers have mentioned,

one of the defining characteristics of a lot of next generation AI use cases is this idea of multimodal data. this idea that images, audio and text system and we can leverage those data in

the kinds of ways that previously we've only been able to leverage structured transaction and event data. Um actually and I'll come back and talk about that in specifically in in a in a

moment or two. But this is another example that I thought might be interesting to some of you. This is an example from Brazil's largest credit union which is a company called Sicrey.

And the challenge for this particular organization is in Brazil there is a large unbanked population that's outside the formal economy. And obviously it's very difficult to make credit risk

decisions and lending decisions if you have a group of people that can't prove their income. So the solution for secret is a sophisticated set of income estimation models and they use those

models to predict an individual's likely income and then they make credit lending decisions on the basis of that predicted income. Now this is a model that was trained

outside of the database and we have a technology called bring your own model which enables us to consume models regardless of where they've been trained. So if you can

train a model in PMML, in Mojo or in Onyx, we can import that model and then we can use Terodata as a parallel harness to speed up the training of this model. And I think this is incredibly

important because we're at a moment now in the industry where everybody wants to talk about model training because model training is exciting and model training is cool. But actually, we don't make any

money when we train a model. We only make money when we can deploy that model to production and run inference and in this case inference at India scale to actually change the way we do business.

And this bring your own model technology that enables us to import models regardless of where they've been trained. So your data scientists can use the tools that make them the most

productive, but you still have a mission critical platform that enables you to score models in production. We get very significant speed up when we use this technology. From the numbers on this

slide, you'll see that in this particular case for the income estimation models in Brazil, we were able to run inference 25 times faster on the parallel data warehouse by bringing

the complex processing to the data instead of the other way around. And 25 times faster is the difference between running this model once per day and running this model once per hour. And if

you run the model once per hour, you can change your entire business model. you can change the cost of credit during the working day. Now this next example is an example of

that multimodal phenomenon that we were talking about. This is again another large Asian bank. This bank cares a lot about NPS about net promoter score. They consider that net promoter score is the

single most important leading indicator of customer intent. Whether the customer will leave or whether the customer will stay and consume more products. The problem this bank has is it has very

little understanding of the drivers of net promoter score. But when we were working with them, we were able to establish that they were capturing 50,000 customer chats per week from the

online banking application. the requirement for sovereign AI very very seriously. I know that's a very important requirement in this market and we'll be introducing a new and enhanced

sovereign offer later this year as well. So I want to thank you very much for your kind invitation to join you today. Thank you for your time and attention. If anything I said didn't make sense,

please stop me in the hall. I'll be very happy to take your questions. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you Mr. Wilcox. Now uh I keep the question and answers for the end of the session. I request uh member CBD

Shrimati Mona Singh ma'am to kindly present the token of gratitude to all our speakers of the first category. a big round of applause, please. &gt;&gt; [applause]

&gt;&gt; Thank you ma'am. Thank you sir. Now I request the speakers from category 2 please uh take the seats in the stage. I request the staff uh please to change the names.

So as we move to category two, we now shift from perspective to practice. Across India, regulatory and enforcement agencies have increasingly embedded artificial intelligence into their core

systems. This segment brings together agencies that are not just exploring AI but actively deploying it to strengthen compliance, improve oversight and enhance citizen centric services.

For this uh we have among us Shir Suenduati from RBI, Shri Hersh Podar and IPS officer, Shar Ganesh Ram Ganesh from Cyber Eye, Shir Amnesh Pande from SEBI and Shir Shashi Shuklaza from CBD.

All the sessions being so interesting that I see most of the audience sticking to their seats. So for the first session in this category I introduce Siri soenduati. Sir

is the chief general manager and head of fintech at the Reserve Bank of India. Sir will present mule hunter an AIdriven initiative targeting mule accounts. Sir So good evening everyone and uh thank

you for the opportunity for having me here. Uh I would uh the clicker uh I would say that I would spend some time on what initiatives we have taken

and then come to the mule hunter. uh first of all recognizing the need of uh the governance and uh financial sector has been one of the early adopters of artificial intelligence

given that it's most of the decision are based on data. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; uh RBI had constituted a committee uh with uh uh and it submitted its report

in last year in August and it has been placed on our website. It had recommended seven sutras or high level design principles. Uh and there are 26 recommendations which uh you know

13 based on the innovation enablement as well as 13 you know exactly on risk mitigation and together with this sutras there are you know six pillars under which this

recommendations are classified and these have uh I would say that these seven sutras I would come to the next slide. These have been adopted by the uh this you can have a look.

So I'm happy to report that this seven sutras which initially we started as a recommendation or guiding principles for the financial sector has now been adopted by the government of India as

the India's design or India's principles or sutras for AI governance across all sectors. So this is something and on the right side on on the left side you can see the recommendations of our RBI

committee and on the right side you can see the recommendations which are uh published by the government of India on November 5th uh outlining those uh very principles and uh so one of the

foundational principles that we are talking about is uh you know uh trust in the system any technology doesn't matter how powerful it is it'll never be adopted unless It enhances trust. So

people should feel comfortable by the technology. And there are other uh and we have another principle which cuts across every every application is putting

people first. You know customers uh people citizens they need to be protected at all times and if in high-risk areas high-risisk decisions one should talk about you know human in

the loop and things like that. Uh other thing that we have also recommended or talked about is innovation over restraint and in that unless we uh you know experiment with

this new technology or this technology uh we would never realize the potential. So there is a lot of apprehension in people's mind that it is a probabilistic model non-deterministic model there may

be mistakes but unless we still you know experiment do sandbox testing and do those kind of experiments we will never realize the true potential of this technology. So there was a little nudge

is provided to the institutions do do experiment do adopt. [snorts] Uh there are other uh you know principles I would in the interest of time I would not uh talk about them. So there are specific

uh recommendations uh sorry and these are the some of the recommendations which are available on our website in the report uh if time permits you can you know go through at

your leisure. So this one of those recommendations is talking about uh bringing up something called the AI sandbox. One of the critical elements why uh in India we need to do this is

because uh entities face constraints on account of available of compute power infrastructure and also there are constraints with regard to availability of data. So this is something that we

recognize and as a public good we would enu enables AI sandbox by making cross- sectoral data available and cross institutional data available in an you know anonymized way which can be used by

the entities and model developers and some of those things capacity building AI liability framework another important element how where the how the customer needs to be protected

Uh so moving on with uh other uh you know principles uh there are risk mitigations how the board policy should be formed, product approval process, cyber security measures, red teaming

exercises. So there are host of again balancing 13 in uh recommendations on the risk mitigation. Now let me turn to the application that uh we are talking about today. This is

one initiative. Mule accounts in the our banking system is a real challenge and given the number of the huge volume of data that we have we would never uh humanly it is not possible to do it

without the use of technology or machines. So we have developed a muhunter.ai and application which is now uh implemented across uh uh uh 26 banks. Another three

banks are in the process of implementing and it has a lot of uh you know this uh it has developed 857 features which have been identified so far and this is you know getting better and better as the

model is getting trained across institutions. So out of these 857 features let's say for a bank like State Bank of India only 50 features may be very

critical whereas for other banks like say RBL bank or Indent another set of 50 features would be important. So this itself is providing insights and based on our uh analysis our understanding and

it is you know uh relatively in the progressing stage of implementation uh these are the ways it is getting implemented over a period of time and it is currently it is deployed on prem

within each bank. So the data really doesn't go out of the bank themselves but there is a central aggregation service that we are running which should you know take the intelligence from the

features to the central aggregation model. So what we have identified there are those uh insights which are predicted and uh we are rule-based engines the

banks which were implementing so far they were giving 20 to 30% level of accuracy but this uh new hunter or AI based uh you know models the accuracy level has significantly gone up in some

institutions above 90 in some institutions above 80 uh and so on and so forth. uh as somebody said the rule-based uh systems they are handicapped they were a handicap that

human element would be required to analyze a large large volume of data but here this number is getting reduced. So what uh for example if there is we have found out that there are uh you

know patterns like around midnight when the customer support is not there lot of uh mule transactions take place. This is a new feature which could be you know found out. Uh uh similarly there are

accounts where it is remaining dormant for a long time suddenly gets active receives a barrage of payments receipts and debits happened and then it gets again dormant. So these kind of pattern

detections were not possible earlier and for example even if those accounts where it is detected like it is a salary account likelihood of getting it getting classified as a mule account is very

low. So some kind of B engine is getting filtering those kind of accounts and flagging only remaining accounts which the banks need to do a enhanced due diligence after this flag is done. We

are working closely with I4C and uh our one limited study which has revealed that those accounts which are predicted by mule hunter banks initially some of the banks

classified them as not mule after doing the enhanced due diligence but within a month or two we start seeing I4c complaints on those very accounts which are flagged and such ratios are ranging

up to 60%. That means it gives us the confidence that the model is identifying correctly the mule accounts whereas banks constrained by their own you know branch banking and you know uh

identification systems they are not classifying it correctly. So had we predicted had we done this exercise in some sample one bank we you know take as a sample we could see that around 75 to

100 crores of money could have been prevented if the bank had you know classified this as a mule on the day zero and frozen those debit freezes. So these are some of the early insights

that we are getting and we are building it as uh we progress and the future is what we talk about is a digital intelligence digital payments intelligence platform that we are aiming

at a real time transaction scoring mechanism means at the time of transactions going through the score would be provided to the banks whether to allow this transaction or not. So

this is mule account detection is a once a crime has been committed we're trying to move it to a preventive action. So this is where again AI is going to help us lot of uh you know technology and

working with the you know partnering with telecom mobile numbers which are suspect mobile numbers. So those kind of filtering and smart registry is being built. I4C is also providing us

insights. So we this is a ecosystem building as as a public good. We are not only giving directions but we have soiled our hands in building this tool which is now getting implemented or

scale. But yes there is a lot of improvements that can be made uh with the you know partnership with across all the banks. In the interest of time I would stop. Thank you. If any questions

I would be happy to answer. Thank you. So we'll take the questions at the end. If you're uh talking about the Supreme Court uh you know case uh which talked about the digital arrest cases and have

directed you know has formed a expert committee in this and uh Reserve Bank is also a part of that committee but much before the Supreme Supreme Court gave this direction. This initiative was

already on. It is not something that uh post Supreme Court direction that we have started building this. This work was undertaken almost one and a half years back. Over a period of time 26

banks have implemented this and more are implementing and it is it's a work in progress. It's it gets refined as we speak. So there are newer as I said new initiatives are also in the pipeline

and we are also working alongside the banks how to uh move from a manualbased enhanced due diligence procedure to a hybrid of automated and human intelligencebacked enhanced due

diligence process that would be the ultimate uh you know proof of preventing these frauds and preventing the money hardearned money of the gullible citizens.

&gt;&gt; Thank you sir. uh we keep all the questions and answer for the end of the session. Now quickly I call upon Shri Hersh Podar uh Indian uh police service officer and an award-winning innovator

in AIdriven policing policing and Shiri Ram Ganesh cyber security expert and founder of cyber I to present cyber crime enforcement and action. Gentlemen the floor is yours.

Very good evening ladies and gentlemen. Let me just begin by underscoring uh what a poignant moment this is. I belong to the 2011 batch of the Indian revenue service. I even trained for about 10

months at the National Academy of Direct Taxes in Nagpur. And today it's a great honor for me to represent the Indian police service here as the SP of uh Nagpur for a project being executed in

Nagpur by the Maharashtra police. So it's a it's a full circle in in many senses. Now uh ladies and gentlemen, I'm cog [laughter]

&gt;&gt; thank you sir. I I'll keep that offer in mind. We'll let my DG know. Uh uh ladies and gentlemen, I'm cognizant of the fact that the exact nuts and bolts of a police usage of an

investigation co-pilot may not speak to an uh income tax setting. So let me divide my presentation into two parts. I'll first speak about what it is that state police agencies such as the

Maharashtra police are doing in terms of being able to incorporate artificial intelligence into the investigative systems. and then I'll give you an overview of the Maharime OS platform so

that there's an understanding of what its limits are and where it can possibly transfer for application within the income tax department. Now to set the context, Maharashtra in

2024 set up an organization known as Marvel which is a special purpose vehicle owned by the government of Maharashtra. I apart from being SP of Nagpur, I'm also

the CEO of uh Marvel. The purpose of this company was to create artificial intelligence solutions for all departments of the government of Maharashtra within the government of

Maharashtra. So instead of having a vendor-driven process to instead have a system which is as per the needs and requirements of the various departments of the government of Maharashtra

at the end of 2025 through a collaboration between Maharashtra government and Microsoft we developed Maha Crime OS which is an investigation co-pilot that was launched by the

honorable chief minister of Maharashtra Shi Devindra Fadnavis and uh the global CEO of Microsoft Shata Nadella at an event in Mumbai. Mumbai and that's what we are presenting uh today.

Now uh let let me begin by first underlining the need for an investigation co-pilot. This is not an investigation co-pilot that works towards providing assistance in

investigation for all kinds of cases. So the very first step that we undertook was to outline sectors of police investigation that actually needed agentic artificial intelligence or a

co-pilot. We identified four sectors which which were particularly complex. The first one was cyber crime investigation. The second one was large economic

frauds. The third was organized narcotics distribution and the fourth was uh heinous sexual offenses. So this co-pilot speaks to those and not to murder, not to cases of hurt, not to

cases of riot etc. Why did we select this? Because under the special laws that govern each of these investigations, the investigation process itself tends to be quite

intricate and requires a series of steps that the investigation officer needs needs to undertake. So in these instances what you see is that while these the numerical volume of these

cases is quite high simply because of the complexity of investigation at every stage there is a drop which means that that there is a miscarriage of justice taking place for victims of the these

crimes. Now the government of India has a whole series and silos of of investigative data. I'm certain that's the case in tax enforcement as as well. It's the case in

police investigation as well. The co-pilot is supposed to serve as a mechanism to be able to tune into all of these silos of data and make sense and make an investigative path for the

investigating officer of uh the police. How does this work? For all of these four heads that that I just spelt out, there are intricate standard operating procedures that operate at both the

central level. So they're directives from the ministry of home affairs and because investigation is a state subject each individual state government also has standard operating procedures. So

the way say a narcotics crime may be investigated in Maharashtra would differ slightly from the way it might be investigated in Andhra Pradesh or Telangana.

The purpose of this uh investigative co-pilot is to be incor is to be able to incorporate these as well. What does it do? Let me first explain to you what used to

happen earlier and again this is very very different from h because I've been in the income tax department I know thing things are reasonably more systematized in the police things can

get quite haphazard because of the amount of law and order pressure that the organization also faces. Earlier, what used to happen with all of these four heads of crime, if you had a

narcotics crime and it was handed to an investigating officer, you had a series of supervisory meetings that would take place at the rank of the deputy SP, the additional SP in order to determine the

path of the investigation. Today what is happening is that this co-pilot is able to ingest the FIR all of the documentations of the investigation and generate an

investigative path that is compliant with the standard operating procedures laid out by that particular state government in this case Maharashtra as well as the high court and supreme court

judgments that outline what the best practices in that kind of investigation are. So put broadly what the co-pilot does is that uh it there are four essential

tasks that that it does. After having generated this path, it also sends out a series of routine legal requests that we require for most investigations. These could be asks for telecom data. These

could be asks for um forensic data. It also makes sense of digital forensics by which I mean telecom data in organized crimes as I'm sure those of you who worked in in tax investigation are aware

there are vast volumes of telecom data that that we garner which we are able to analyze using the co-pilot and then we also use open-source intelligence which again in police we use a fair amount of

so different open platforms Facebook uh phone pay um Google pay etc it's able to garner data from these that's open source available and is then able to make that a part of the the

Essentially this is what what is happening. You have an adaptive investigation path that is unique to that particular case. So remember it's not just an instance where it has spelt

out or replicated the SOP for you. No, it has adapted the SOP and the judicial pronouncements on that particular head of cases and adapted it to that case. So that's that's what what it actually

does. Uh in terms of uh in terms of case ingestion and and how this exactly works is it ingests the FIR to to start with. It also provides victim assistance, for

example, unfreezing of uh accounts and volumes of money that have been frozen in cyber crime cases. It generates case diaries which is a day-to-day progress of the investigation itself. Provides

guided investigation paths which are compliant as I said to standard operating proceeds and it also profiles people on the basis of open-source uh intelligence.

Now in my own district as SP of Nagpur rural we have trained over 233 uh investigating officers for this using which over 467 cases have been investigated over the past 6 months

before the launch by by Mr. Satya Nadella and our chief chief minister. Um the co-pilot has actually enabled us to win a series of e governance awards within the state of uh Maharashtra as

well. But that that's not not so important. What's important here and I also want want to do my hat a little bit to the training uh process. That's important when we are on boarding

systems such as this. It's important for the institution doing so to create space for for training. I know having been a beneficiary of it myself that the income tax department lays a lot of stress on

training from all ranks onwards. It's something that that we can learn within the police department. But this is something that we stressed upon very very substantially and that that's been

uh use useful and has also reduced resistance within organizations in order to onboard it and and be uh a able to use it. I'll end by concluding four basic technologies that are available um

from the artificial intelligence silo in in Marvel. That's the kind of technologies that we worked work upon. First is large language models which are uh I think it was spelt out in the first

session which is essentially artificial intelligence models that have been working with large amounts of text and are able to interact with with government uh in in a very akin to a to

a human being. The second is graph neural networks which are artificial intelligence systems that make sense of siloed sets of data and the relational analysis between them. So in organized

crime that's very useful in terms of being able to do a hubb and spoke of who's at the center of that crime. In Maharashtra we have an act called makoka as you might be aware about where

organized crime you need to be able to find out who the center of the of the gang is. Third is agentic artificial intelligence which is co-pilots such as this which are triggering workflows and

actually walking individuals through them. And the last is big data analytics where there's structured analysis of large sets um of data. That's the kind of work that that we've been doing at uh

at uh Marvel and this is an an instance of uh that. I'll end with that. It's been a pleasure and a privilege. Thank you very much. Jim, &gt;&gt; thank you sir. Uh now I introduce Shri

Anishh Pande, executive director at SEB and a national voice on technology strategy and cyber security governance. Sir First of all, a very good evening to all

of you and it's uh uh indeed a great privilege to be here and I thank CBD for giving this opportunity. Um for past two days uh we have been listening to a lot of uh uh AI based uh

initiatives all over the place but something that really had uh stuck sebi for some time back is uh the most important is to build capacity in uh undertaking these AI initiatives and and

to that effect we have uh truly democratized the AI development within the organization and uh I take quite a pride in intro introducing uh some of the uh names which I have here in the

crowd uh uh Mr. Sep Klani uh Mr. Rohit Saraf, Vikas Komera, Rajuin Khan and Promeit. Promeit is the youngest of them. And I'll tell you why this is important is because some of the

initiatives that I'm going to present today to you have been um handcrafted by these uh uh intellectual minds and uh they are not from the IT department from Sebi. So that's very important. Uh it's

truly democratized to that extent. Um yeah. So uh from Seby's perspective we have a quite a broad mandate uh to in to protect the interest of the investors uh to promote the development and to

regulate the securities market. Uh it's a fairly large mandate that we have and to that effect we craft regulations and seek compliances. So compliances are a major part of our uh regulatory

processes. We also conduct investigations and initiate enforcement proceedings uh from the data that we collect from various sources. Uh and going f forward we also adjudicate issue

directions and liy penalties. Um why am I saying this? This is to say that the v we have a varied use cases within the organization where we have started to use the power of AI.

uh there are four use cases that I would like to mention over here uh that uh have been uh kind of u doing a good uh uh uh in terms of generating valuable output for us. Uh first of all is the

radar which is a tool uh which ensures uh very proactive compliance uh for the advertisements uh that are being issued by a uh regulated entities specifically mutual funds. Uh sudashan is a very

important tool which is able to uh track the uh mis uh uh the the context that our um unregistered and misleading uh u um Finn influencers are putting onto the social media. Infomge is the workflow

intelligence that we have built to ensure that our investigation processes are more efficient and we are able to undertake that activity faster. Uh security compliance and audit com uh uh

uh security cyber security compliance audit is some tool that we have built to ensure that the cyber security compliances that are being sent to SEBI are well read and we are making some

good meaning out of it. So I'll take one one by one of them. Um well I'm slightly cognizant of the time that I have in hand. Uh so first of all is the radar which I said uh it takes care of all the

advertisement that mutual fund industries are putting in. The tool basically looks into whether the advertisement which is put in is compliant to the regulatory requirements

uh as mandated by the code of conduct. uh some of the uh uh non-compliance that this tool is able to capture is illustrated here of which most of the compliance that we have caught is in

terms of non-disclosures and uh uh not ensuring the disclaimers are adequately put. Moving next is Sudashan and which is trying to combat lot of uh financial

frauds which also includes investment frauds that are part of the securities market domain and we are directly uh involved with that. Uh we our media monitoring cell in SEBI has uh flagged

nearly one lakh instances of misleading contents on this platform. To strengthen our uh uh approach on this, we built this product uh called Sudan uh which is doing a continuous monitoring. It's a

multimodal uh tool uh and works on multiple languages as well. Uh knowing that some of these uh scrupulous guys are using the capability of languages to defraud people. It has got a enhanced uh

detection capabilities and which we validate against with the data which is present within seb. Uh by this we are able to uh uh try to figure out the financial

misinformation and ensuring the financial information integrity. Uh info merge as we call a tool that is for investigation process. As you all know the investigation process starts

from case initiation, data collection, data analysis and report generation. By using this uh uh tool, we are able to systematize all the data which is collected from various sources into one

format. We are able to look into the uh company profile designations and financials of a particular company. uh also are able to figure out what are the corporate announces that announcements

that were made during the time of uh uh the uh investigation period. Uh visualization is the is the effect by which people are able to see the pattern and the tool has got a very innovative

tools to give that. Finally the report writing from one investigating officer to another investigating officer there has been always found a variance to ensure that we have a standardized

mechanism to uh get a report and get it in an orderly manner. This particular tool let's do the last part of writing the report. Of course the reports again go for a uh for a red as human in loop.

Coming to the last uh uh uh system that we have very recently launched. Uh SEBI initiated uh uh cyber resilience and cyber uh security framework. Uh based on which we have started to get lot of uh

uh compliances which means uh controls levels and artifacts that are being submitted for those compliances. So this particular tool autonomously reads those compliances and flags where the uh audit

report has got a missing. So it have we have got a very novel u uh three architectural based uh framework so that if one uh particular model is hallucinating other models do take care

of and give the uh a reasonable meaningful uh analysis. Um so what it is ending up as um uh apart from giving a dashboards and real-time visibility it is ensuring that

at sebi we at any point in time are able to uh do a relative analysis of all our intimatories and know where they stand in cyber security uh measures. Yeah. So that was a very quick uh uh

sorry if I've been too fast but yeah the other I was trying to keep pace with the seconds that were clicking. Thank you very much. It was nice to be here. &gt;&gt; Thank you sir. Uh it ended in a in a

very clockwork type manner. Uh now we are coming to the final technical session. Um Shir Shashi Bushan Shukla, principal commissioner at CBD, a key architect behind data analyt analytics

cell and Saksham nudge initiative will speak on the use of AI for ease of compliance in tax administration. Sir, we look forward to your insights. &gt;&gt; Thank you.

Uh good evening uh everyone. Now I think we are almost at the close closing of this uh session and we're left with uh maybe five seven minutes but this is being the last session we can uh take

some more minutes I think. So uh this has this is the journey of income tax department. The income tax department uh has been pioneer in the adoption of state of art technology and

we have started using technology uh quite early uh in uh I have given the graph of last 25 20 25 years. So if we see the filing of TDS return started in 2004 followed by the filing of returns

and then uh tax net has been launched. CPC has started in 2009 and then CPC TDS and that as has been mentioned by professor Mam that the income tax department is highly taxpayer uh

serviceoriented and we sow them the uh financial information which is available with the department. We started sewing 26 AS from 201 onwards and then uh we have automated

several processes of income tax department and uh uh the department has launched online issuance of form 16 the faceless assessment e- filing portal in 2021 and national cyber forensic policy

was launched in 2024 and last last to last year we started initiative called Naj which is the non-intrusive uses of data to guide and enable taxpayers and in the first

session uh my colleague has u talked about insight 2.0 and there are several projects which are now getting updated with the state-of-the-art technology including the uses of artificial

intelligence. So uh to enhance the taxpayers's experience for filing the tax for the ease of uh tax compliance. So the department is using the technology including the artificial

intelligence keeping the taxpayer in the heart of it. So if we talk about the data what income tax department has there is a vast data which we have from the several sources

and one of for example the pan 80 cr uh people are already issued pan now it might have reached a little more itrs are filed more than 9 cr 12 cr people are paying taxes and then sft is more

than 650 cr data fields we get for this specified financial transaction which are populated in AIS which is a huge data which is available with the department and then we collect data

under rule 114B form 60 is submitted then a specified financial transaction 61E A is submitted we also receive information from foreign jurisdictions

more than 100 countries share the foreign asset information foreign income information as well uh from with uh India. So we receive around 50 lakh pieces of information every year under

CRS and FATKA framework which is automatic exchange of information and we also share information in respect of non-residents who are having the foreign assets in India who are having

the assets in India uh with the respective foreign jurisdictions. It is around 1 K pieces of information which is transacted every year. So this is a lot of information which we have lot of

data we have including the assessment order including the appeal orders this data can be utilized uh within our projects which we have inside 2.0 and uh uh ITBA, CPC for uh generation of

intelligence for uh better compliance for u uh for the awareness of the taxpayers and for the information of taxpayers for the payment of correct taxes.

This initiative which is a nudge initiative was started two years back where we are using the data which is coming from from various sources including from foreign jurisdiction and

this is being used for educating the taxpayer for guiding the taxpayer to uh comply with the tax laws and to uh correct their filing to correct the declare their correct assets and income.

So this nudge nudge has the sevenst step strategy which is uh in the word sakam which is uh meaning uh in Hindi saksham means empowered in English. So this is basically this strategy is empowering

the department as well as empowering the taxpayers for filing the correct tax. So this seven step strategy is basically how we are using the data which is a sankan basically uh compilation and

collection of data as as we have discussed we have lot of data which is coming from diverse sources then anushandhan how we are analyzing and doing research over the data for

generation of insight and intelligence for the risk identification and how we are acting on the data which is cranuine uh actionable interventions for the targeted outcomes.

Then we are doing the communication basically how the taxpayers to inform to the taxpayers that this may be which you need to review uh your filing and maybe you'll have to change your uh uh income

or your computation. So this is where we are using the behavioral insight and uh uh guiding taxpayers to pay the correct taxes and at the same time we are also handholding we are also

facilitating them uh through the fifth step which is called aak and then adikar enablement of the taxpayer for the payment of taxes. we have uh the legal changes have been brought in in the

income tax act where now the taxpayers are allowed to update their ITR by payment of additional taxes and to correct their uh income. So this is uh possible now with the payment of

additional tax. So now we use this asking the taxpayers it can be for four years you can come out with the uh right taxes at the and uh basically it is a preemptive exercise

where no punitive action is taken against the taxpayers no penal uh consequences. So the taxpayers are allowed to change their ITR which has been filed originally and then the uh

this whole cycle is then completed through evaluation where we take the feedback of taxpayers. The responses we receive they are analyzed and all these steps can be further improvised so that

the next nudge or when when we can communicate with the taxpayers with a uh better information and the better uh communication and this strategy has actually yielded very good result where

the taxpayer have responded well it has been received well the taxpayers uh the trust owned by the department has uh given a very good result so I I have given few cases case uh studies here

some outcomes uh which has also been discussed by uh chairman in his opening remarks. So if we see uh the the current foreign asset nudge which has been carried out in the month of December

and uh we have sent messages to the taxpayer stating that you may have some foreign asset which has not been reported in your ITR and the taxpayer have then revised their ITR and 1.57

lakh taxpayers they have disclosed their foreign assets which is worth 99,000 cr. So this this exercise shows that once the taxpayers are informed that this is what the department knows about and you

have missed it uh while filing your ITR they may come forward and they they can declare. So this has resulted into 6,540 cr of additional income and 99,000 of k of um assets. Similarly we have also

taken up few more exercises. Uh the other one which I have mentioned is regarding the bogus donations and the bogus deductions claimed by the taxpayers by uh taking certain um uh

fake receipts from uh unrecognized political parties and some of them are uh maybe the entities the NOS's which are not eligible for donation. So here also result has been quite uh uh

encouraging 6.96 lakhs taxpayers they have revised their ITR and they have withdrawn their claims worth 9,879 cr and uh which has given the department additional taxes of 1758 cr and if we

see how the these uh campaigns have actually resulted into the behavioral change in the taxpayer so these two graphs uh Explain it. If you see the foreign asset behavior pattern, how the

taxpayers have increased the filing of taxpayer foreign assets. Now it has increased from 1.59 lakhs which was before the nudge campaign started. Now it is 4.7 lakhs. So almost three times

increase in a span of two years by this nudge campaign. And similarly the claim of deduction has also gone down in last two years and it has reached to from almost half 7,400 cr to almost 4,000 cr.

So this this is this is what is the power of uh data and the data analytics which we do uh by using the technology and uh as has been discussed uh in insight 2.0 to project that with the use

of artificial intelligence and u better technology we will be able to identify the anomalies much faster and we can we can nurse taxpayers maybe at the time of filing of return or much before uh when

the return is processed uh this also I because there's uh many representative from law enforcement agencies I wanted to discuss this particular uh topic as well the India is

leading u one project which is based on uh the misuse and threats of AI in the um in the tax crime and financial crimes. So uh this it is a 17 uh countries group

which is being led by India and we we u request all the eleas if they have come across any misuse or any challenge of AI the risk of AI in their uh regular working and administration of their

institutes uh we can uh they can communicate with us so that we can at the international level we can uh take it forward in a collaborative manner and we should try to find solution to

various misuses. uh the misuses which have been reported so far are basically the use of gener synthetic identities for you and the deep fake documents and fabrication of

sometimes court orders. So these these are the AI assisted misuses which are happening and uh which which are basically a challenge for all law enforcement agencies. uh uh the RBI has

come out with the mule hunter uh software. Uh maybe for the synthetic identity identification also we can use AI where u it can be further uh support the law enforcement agencies in

identifying such misuses where we can take some preemptive uh measure before uh basically this attack takes place. So this is uh I'll request we will also send communication but this can be kept

in mind that this project is going on and if we talk about the future use of AI in department basically if we uh see how we we'll be able to enable our taxpayers to pay correct taxes at the

right time without any penalty or without any additional tax. So this is this is what we are trying the in the department that we we should use AI in an informative manner. It should also be

able to cross validate various data sources so that if there is any anomaly it can be predicted on real time basis and in a proactive manner. So when I'm saying real time uh basis so maybe at

the time when the taxpayer is preparing for um filing of return that time we can show the data the financial data which we have received from third party at the time of filing of return we can use

prompts where the taxpayers can be informed if they are making any wrongful claims or if they are making uh reporting any uh they are reporting or not reporting assets which may be in the

knowledge of uh the department and and then once the return is filed before the verification we can further analyze the returns and we can prompt the taxpayers to correct before the processing or

after the processing then we can carry out the uh further the nudge exercise. So all this nudge will have a complete 360deree uh 360deree program where we can enable

taxpayers right from the beginning to pay the correct taxes. So this is what uh we plan to use the AI where the taxpayer services are concerned and for the administration obviously we are um

uh making ourselves capable uh training our manpower and uh adapting the technology to uh to serve better the country and also to collect revenue correctly on time. Uh with this I will

end and uh this is the closing thoughts. So it is for everyone to read. Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; Thank you sir. Uh yes so we are towards smarter systems, better services and

stronger trust. With that I request principal chief commissioner of income tax Delhi Shiran Jaser to kindly present a token of gratitude to the second category uh category 2 speakers of this

evening. Shnish Pandi sir Shiruendu party Shashi Bush Shukla sir &gt;&gt; Shri Hers Podar.

Uh thank you sir. Thank you sir. And now I invite Shir Mahadevan K, Joint Commissioner of Income Tax for the vote of thanks. Respected honorable chairman, distinguished

speakers, eminent guests, colleagues and participants, it is my privilege to propose of thanks at the conclusion of this highly interesting session. Today's deliberations have clearly demonstrated

that artificial intelligence is no longer aspirational, it is operational. I begin by expressing sincere gratitude to honorable chairman CBD Shri Ray Graal sir for his visionary opening.

Particularly sir highlighted how the new income tax act would be techdriven to reduce the litigations over interpretations and sir emphasized the use of AI in ethical manner with

ensuring accountability and transparency. Sir said the strategic direction for a enabled sorry sir said the strategic direction for a

enabled test based governance the session on project insight 2.0 by Mr. Sinasanti Sri Abishekumar and Sri Romesh Revu demonstrated how insight 2.0 is reshaping the taxpayers life cycle

through a enabled pre-filing conversational chart chatbots behavioral nudge a based litigation risk assessment and viability prediction the vision of a sovereign SLM for the tax domain stands

out as a transformative initiative the session on a road map on AI for law enforcement by professor Maam outlined AI applications across preventive predictive and investigative domains

using visual textual financial and multimodal analytics. He highlighted use cases such as facial recognition, anomaly detection, and crime forecasting to enable intelligenceled enforcement.

He emphasized human and AI teaming and explanability, bias mitigation and civil liberties as essential safeguards. These aspects aspects brought conceptual clarity and policy depth to the

discussion. The session on AIdriven risk analytics by Mr. Martin Wilcos highlighted how data analytics enhances enforcement through graph analytics in database model deployment and leveraging

vector stores and multimodel AI for intelligent querying. The transition from a system of record to a system of intelligence was particularly compelling. The session on maha crime oa

by shrih harsh podas s ram ganesh and s vikram kali powerfully addressed the investigation crisis and showed how a enables automated crime handle extraction and guided investigation

workflows combined with the 360deree profiling integrating with the CDR and other tools particularly the emphasis on human in the loop architecture ensures accountability alongside efficiency the

session on a for ease of complaints by sashi bushan shuklaser illustrated the department's in income tax department's evolution of towards a a driven platforms

such as insight 2.0, ITBA 2.0 and saksham nut sir explained how log scale data integration and cross validation enable risk based proactive and real-time compliance support. The focus

was on shifting from enforcement systems to AI enabled trust based voluntary compliance and taxpayercentric services. The session on mule hunter by Suentupati highlighted free AI framework with its

seven sutras, six pillars and structured recommendations balancing innovation and risk mitigation. The presentation on mule hunter demonstrated how advanced ML models, graph analytics and real-time

risk scoring are strengthening mule account deductions. The proposed DPIP collaborative platform further reflects a forward-looking ecosystemwide approach to a enabled financial integrity and

supervisory resilience. The session on AIdriven regulatory enforcement by Sri Ah Pande highlighted how CE is operationalizing AI across enforcement including proactive compliance review

realtime detection of real-time detection of misleading financial content and influences and Aadriven cyber security audit compliance. These initiatives reflect how AI can

strengthen investor protection while ensuring regulatory prudence. A special word of appreciation to Simi Amadib Dano for her engaging and energizing moderation. Today's session reaffirmed

that AI enhances risk intelligence. It improves service delivery. It strengthens regulatory oversight and it enables datadriven governance. On behalf of CBD, I extendfelt gratitude to all

speakers, institutions, organizations and participants. A special word of appreciation to the principal CCIT Delhi headquarters team and the DJIT investigation team Delhi for the

dedicated support and meticulous coordination in organizing this event. Thank you all for making the session impactful and forward-looking. With this, I formally conclude the session.

Thank you all.
