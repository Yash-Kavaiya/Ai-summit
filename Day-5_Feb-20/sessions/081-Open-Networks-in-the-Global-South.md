## 📝 Transcript

All right. Good afternoon everyone. I would request everybody to please take their seats and put their mobiles on silent. All right, thank you everyone. Uh to get

us started, I'm going to invite uh Anik Diger, uh founder and CEO of Hagdarak to give us his opening remarks and get us started for this session. [applause]

&gt;&gt; Thank you, Cha. Uh good afternoon everyone and welcome to this India impact summit event open networks in the global south with AI as an enabler. Uh on behalf of Hagdash and the India

mission I want to welcome all the attending dignitaries and our esteemed speakers and all participants for being here today with us at Hagdashuk. Uh we work at the very last mile of the

digital economy where access determines the outcomes. Every day our network of women agents help marginalized citizens discover, apply for and receive welfare benefits. And what we see uh repeatedly

is that access is just not about availability. It's about trust and agency. This is why the idea of open networks resonates so deeply with us at Hakdashuk. Open networks shift power

away from closed networks and towards shared infrastructure. They allow multiple actors, governments, startups, community entrepreneurs to participate on equal terms. In our work, this means

that a citizen is not locked into a single system but can move across seamlessly with dignity and choice. Digital public infrastructure in India like UPI, Aadhaar and

have shown what is possible. Interoperatability has shown that it replaces exclusivity. But technology alone is not enough. What matters also is trust. As an example, the work we do

with uh the center for inclusive growth in Mastercard with women entrepreneurs and mmemes. So there has to be a layer of open networks plus a strong layer of trust uh in the platforms that

citizens can easily access. As we've been hearing in the last few days that apart from AI models, what is really important is also AI diffusion and how important it is to take these models and

networks to the last mile. So today's session we'll explore exactly these questions. How open networks can scale responsibly, how AI can enable inclusion without centralizing power, and how

ecosystems across the global south can learn from each other. And to begin, I'm pleased to invite to the stage our keynote speaker, Mr. T. T Koshi uh Kosh T Koshi is the founding MD and CEO of

ODC a first of its kind initiative to democratize e-commerce in India he's an expert in population scale digital transformation projects worldwide and we are also honored that he is a board

adviser at Hagdashuk thank you and good afternoon. We know open network democratizes commerce and artificial intelligence gives us an

opportunity to democratize intelligence and two of them together can really tango to change the world and I believe that the AI summit is all about this. Let me just see a little context because

we have eminent speakers here who are experts on networks and protocols and everything who will discuss things more. If you look at techn historically if you look at technology revolution brought

about industrial revolution and that industrial revolution changed the landscape of the world around. But there was one challenge. The leading figures in this tech upgrade practically

weaponize this technology and uses to conquer and coll col colonize the world. Of course there were new infrastructure, new innovation variety of uh fields like defense I mean defense, travel, textile

everywhere. But the challenge was mostly it was meant for the benefit of the conquerors. sort of what do you call um you know the uh the philosophy that was dealt by the early colonizers uh you

know of many parts of the world. The challenge was this was not inclusive at all. The digital continent that now we are creating also faces the same challenge.

It started with a spirit of democratic participation encouraging competition and inclusion but eventually it started creating silos especially when it comes to the newer areas of commerce and so on

so forth. We in India figured out digital public infrastructure as a solution to reverse the spent make us more inclusive and democratic.

When we talk about DPI, my uh guide in DPI uh you know Sujata tells me it's all about two foundational element that stand out unbundling and interoperability

that is driving innovation and competition. Now like we said the possible democratization of intelligence with AI can turbocharge every of this building

block of economic economic activity. this will attempt [clears throat] to improve the life of every citizen and not a select few. I mean that is the message as uh Nandan said in the morning

and an uh referred now it's about the diffusion for global south it becomes even more challenging because we have a scale that has to take into context the diversity

on one side and resource crunch on the other which is may not be the kind of challenges faced by the developed world. The real question becomes not whether we can scale fast or build smart system but

who benefits, who controls the system and who gets left out. That becomes a very very critical challenge. Open networks emerge precisely to address this tension. This is not a

technical option but it's a governance choice. a choice a choice which can separate infrastructure from innovation, protocols from platforms and power power from participation.

Let me take a a couple of minutes to uh sort of share the lessons that we had when we are setting up ODC in that uh four years ago. So India's experience experience [clears throat] with UPI and

ODC shows something very very important. Networks do not replace markets, it rearchitect markets. By creating common interoperable rates, they reduce entry barriers specifically for the small

business. They enable competition without fragmentation and they allow innovation at h that happens at the edges not just at the center. Inc's case the goal was not to build another

platform but to ensure commerce itself will become a shared capability. This required three things. governance which is neutral and transparent ecosystem collaboration between government,

industry and startups and civil society because it's about a social transformation from somebody with $1 a month income sometimes as bad as that to 1 billion in an hour or I mean I I can't

count ecosystem collaboration between government industry startups and civil society and a lot of patience because this is not a magic where somebody can

come a magic wand and things will change. Everybody in the ecosystem will need to work together. Now we are seeing that the new face of internet not just as a network of information but as a

network of transaction. This internet of transactions will be interoperable, inclusive, iterative because it's evolving. It has to evolve with the feedback and experimentation and built

on the infrastructure digital public infrastructure not on silos. It will offer choice without coercion, scale without centralization and innovation without exhibition.

The digital continent that we dream is not a metaphor. It's a blueprint. It is a call to reimagine digital ecosystem as open, federated and inclusive. And it is here

that we have to be conscious that it is not just something an India phenomena. It's something that is now taking global proportions. And with many countries already taking many steps to take it

forward. In fact, we have somebody from Indonesia who is talking about what is the first step in the in the ASEAN with Indonesia as a starting point. In all this thing AI is an enabler. That is

what we need to make it happen. It is it has to act as it cannot act as a gatekeeper. That was one of the challenges some of the new technologies. It became gatekeepers to create silos.

Now AI brings enormous opportunity. We have to be aware of the opportunity in terms of enhanced market access for merchants of all use not just for a select few. Better discovery for

consumer. Same thing the consumer a farmer consumer coming from a small village should have something meaningful to benefit from this network where practically very diverse kinds of

options are available and that is when we will have to have a smarter matching between the the buyers and seller and it also has to have a inbuilt mechanism of confidence building. The question is not

whether a so but at the same time it also has a risk if you're not careful that it can possibly lead to concentration like me. So the question is not whether AI should be used it

should be absolutely used the question is how it is embedded you know so we need to think carefully about where intelligence sits is it only at the edge and only at the core or it's also at the

edges is it only helping the user intermediaries primarily or it is with the uss or it is helping every users and whether it is government by rules and not my you know rules which is

applicable to the community as a whole not just a select few. So this open network gives us a chance to build enabled markets in a big way and where it also has an very important role to

play in terms of governance. Why does it all matter? Because open network fundamentally change who can participate in the digital economy. I want to just sort of wind up and give the opportunity

for all my fellow u panelists to speak and discuss. But the looking ahead we see successful open network in the global south will not be defined by the number of transaction or by the

sophistication of AI model but it is going to be defined by diversity of participation resilience in governance fair distribution of value and the ability to innovate without

concentration of power. This is not an easy work and this is idea I'm hope that my colleagues will now discuss about it. Thank you. Thank you Koshi sir for your insightful

comments. You've I think set the stage perfectly for our panel discussion. So in today's panel discussion we'll explore how open networks are transforming the digital economies of

the global south and how interoperable DPIs are uh creating inclusive payments, inclusive commerce and also innovation for small merchants. And we will also focus on the future trajectory of open

networks especially in the glo global south to see how we can uh embed AI systems in open architecture. So I'll invite our panelists to come on stage uh and take a seat. Sujit Na CEO Beckin

Labs and co-founder of Networks for Humanity, [applause] Shamina Singh, founder and president of Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth and Executive Vice President of

Sustainability at Mastercard and Sachin Gopalan, founder and CEO of Indonesia Economic Forum. [applause] And our moderator for today is Savvita Mule, CTO at Hagdar Shank.

Move one or &gt;&gt; should we move? &gt;&gt; Just move one so they'll be more centered. &gt;&gt; Yeah.

&gt;&gt; All right. Um, we have a fantastic panel. We had a great keynote to set us uh for this conversation. Uh so I hope all of you are excited about the conversation we're going to have. Uh

we're going to talk about open networks uh which are rapidly emerging as a new foundation for digital economies across the global south. India has set an example and we seeing the fusion across

other countries as well. From interoperable payments to open commerce, these networks are reshaping how markets function by changing who gets access, who participates and who benefits.

Um as we stand we're also at a very interesting point because February also saw a lot of activities with the launch of Bharat Vistar the Mahavistar and Maharashtra which are agri networks and

also the Indonesia open network uh for commerce in Indonesia. Over the next 40 minutes, we invite you to think about open networks not just as technology platforms but as shared economic

infrastructure and also about how AI if designed responsibly and like Koshio was saying responsibly and inclusively how can it strengthen their impact across the global south. Uh I want to start off

with a quick you know initial first response, first reaction, lightning question to each of you. Um what excites you most about open networks and where do you see AI already making a real

difference? Um I'll invite Sojet to start off. Um, open networks fundamentally put people in the center, people, businesses in the center and enables

um, choice and agency to them. Okay. And and and make them make their opportunities discoverable, access, offer opportunities, make farmers find market linkages faster. Um, yesterday we

were doing a a farmer was doing a peer-to-peer energy transaction from his rooftop solar. little bit of excess energy he will sell it to to a woman tailor in Delhi from Uttar Pradesh in

Mirat and that's something that we're doing as part of the Indian energy stack. So these possibilities are exciting because it it's fundamentally about putting people in the center and

AI um we are able to use open networks as a way to diffuse AI um faster because when all the talk about AI has been mostly on the supply side um and and and the bigger models are getting and all of

that but I think uh India is all about diffusion and if you're talking about diffusion we need open rails to actually go ages as Koshi was mentioning uh and that part I think open is really excited

um yesterday we had a farmer in three voice notes on WhatsApp uh do energy transaction find sell 300 quintils of onion uh from Uttar Pradesh to West Bengal uh all because of the agent

because AI hides the complexity of what could be gory details of energy trading but fundamentally puts him in the center and solve for livelihoods and and and income gains. So that's what I'm excited

about. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Fantastic. Shamina, your thoughts? &gt;&gt; I'll take this one. &gt;&gt; Uh thanks uh thanks for having me. just uh in terms of the lightning round, I

think what's really exciting is um I think the opportunity for open networks um makes us think about who gets access, not necessarily how. And that's a really important question building on on your

point. So Sug um the opportunity to lower the barriers to access to commerce is massive with with open networks. So for me I think um it's about who gets access and I think in terms of the AI we

actually had a a small pilot with uh uh an organization called Mandeshi Bank some of you may know uh Mandeshi uh they have the rural women chamber of commerce and we've supported them for many years

we put a small pilot um of those women on the open network and it was quite interesting to see I was quite skeptical but it was it was very interesting to see that they went these small business

owners went from uh a very closed uh circle of of who they could do business with to an entirely new market and we saw their businesses grow and almost real time so we've seen it in action

that's what's exciting &gt;&gt; fantastic such your thoughts &gt;&gt; thank you and uh first of all good afternoon to all of you and I'm really pleased to be here today and thanks to

Hakdarak for inviting us uh you know this um dog whistle that people have always been talking about that AI is going to take away your jobs is going to change your life etc. What interests me

about this whole opportunity is that I believe AI will unleash human potential and I think that's a very powerful word. How do you unleash human potential is by harnessing it? And if you're able to

embrace the power of AI and also the combination of open networks taking it to the lowest common denominator, the person sitting in a village in a remote area. I think that's the depth or the

reach. We should think about a remote village, a small farmer and his children staying there. how are they impacted and how can this entire technology of AI open networks unleash human potential

that excites me a lot so I feel that we are on this journey and working together will get us there if not 1 year 2 years 5 years 10 years it's inevitable there's no way we can ignore what's happening

and I'm very excited that I could be part of this journey so that's why I'm here thank you &gt;&gt; fantastic just to summarize each of you talked

talked about you know democratizing access um who gets access instead of how and you know unleashing human potential and fundamentally humans interact on the

basis of trust so I' I'd like to put the first question to Sujett um SJ open networks uh they they depend heavily on trust for establishing identity uh establishing data sharing and

verification uh with AI AI in the mix. How do you see AI either enabling, amplifying or impacting the trust equation when people access and interact through open network

in this uh AI enable you mentioned agentic AI at the core to hide the complexity for humans who are accessing the networks. Uh what role do you see AI playing in the trust uh equation there?

&gt;&gt; Yes. Um so fundamentally if you think about AI it's AI is all about data more than algorithms. So um one of the things that we do with open networks and DPI in general is um to unlock the data of of

the people and give it back to them in a way that's trustable, verifiable, tamperproof and and something that they can feed into u into these AI systems to give them find what they need to find

identifying who they are and making them find what they do. I'll just give you an example. I don't know if this is happening in any other country but in India today if you're a a consumer of

electricity very soon you will be getting your energy connection and your energy uses data as a verifiable credential back to the consumer that they can keep verified by the utility

and in an interoperable standard and you can make it available to any third party platform offering some kind of a using that information as some form of a collateral for a cheaper credit or for

participating in excess you know the excess energy in in trading We we seeing that with far with farmers farmer credentials, farmer identities being credentialized, tokenized in a

tamper proof and making available. Once you have this exhaust of data coming in at the edges for the people and you're making it trustable and verifiable at scale, the value of AI for that

beneficiary significantly improves because everything else is the complexity of how do you make the data talk reach the systems and talk to them and find the best price do the

optimization of where the warehouse is or even for a trader to locate what could be the best logistic player out there to serve maybe in farflung of the country. All of this something that AI

can do faster, cheaper, better without having for without business having to take the cognitive load on it. So once you unleash this data which is what API DPI does, it emits the data, gives it

back to the user, makes it verifiable and trustable and that enhances the value of AI and therefore AI makes it makes easier for AI to offer value back to the the end user.

&gt;&gt; Absolutely. Absolutely. Uh Chamina coming to you uh we've seen in in the payment space and in commerce as well how uh open networks have and the interoperable infrastructure has helped

scale inclusion rapidly right as we think about uh global uh financial inclusion and um uh you know lowering barriers for entry. um what principles do you feel open network should follow

to make sure that AIdriven innovation is not reintroducing exclusion because now there is either a digital divide or there is a um education divide awareness divide uh what could be considerations

that need to be kept in mind when people are building around these uh networks it's a great question and you know the um the benefit of working for a multinational in this regard is that um

the exposure that we've had to lessons uh from around the world. So as an example um the company that I work for Mastercard has operates in over 200 uh 200 markets um 3 billion card holders uh

25 million banks and financial service providers. So the scale is massive. um when uh AI you know we we're hearing a lot about AI now but actually the company's been using AI for many years

because we had to figure out how to protect transactions in an a in an in an age of data so you said uh AI is algorithms and it's and data but it's really data right at the end of the day

and so um before regulation um almost uh probably 10 years ago um we had to come up with a a way of thinking about data and um and that's a really important thing because the way you a

company or an organization thinks about data determines how your products are made and how people are treated. So for us even before it was regulation we said listen for our company at least because

we had made a commitment to bring a billion people into the formal economy 11 years ago. Um the data for us would be um from the perspective of the consumer saying the consumer would

should own the data, the consumer should benefit from the data. Um but it's Mastercard's job to protect the data. So if you look at it from that perspective, then you understand that our approach is

about of course reducing the barrier to entry through open networks. But the but the interesting thing that I find is that the cent's model is actually built on a theory that networks power the

modern economy. And so extending the networks to all parts of society is actually the trick. And so if you have the right approach around the data principles and then you have the right

approach around the how you think about networks which are extensions um out into the edges and then you bring in this notion of interoperability proportional proportional governance so

that you don't reexclude but you actually um diffuse the the data and the technology. But then you have this this piece around um contextual adaptation. And for me that's the piece that makes

the difference for what's happening potentially what's happening in India and potentially in Indonesia is the context around all of this. I was at a meeting this morning at a breakfast

meeting this morning with um uh the minister for for for railways and and the digital economy. We were talking about this and we talked about Manov because um India announced the Manov um

uh protocol uh today and at at the summit and we were I was talking about the A in Monov around accessibility and um and and you know we were we were comparing notes to say that it's really

making sure that you know partnerships like the ones that we have with with Hadart and also with Gary that are like they're creating language learning learning models from the ground up like

the minister was talking about um creating language learning model uh learning models um organic to India and that was a big piece for him he was saying we have to create them here we

have to build them here by Indians for Indians and I said you know there's a really great example because you have this organization called Garia that's actually building language learning

models using uh farmers and women and they haveundred 30,000 uh people right now across uh across the country who were speaking languages into these learning models that would never

have access uh in the US or else. So I went to visit uh Karan Bang Bangalore and we heard about uh the languages there and talked to the workers and um it's astounding to me that uh this

organization and this country has actually flipped the model in a way that allows workers to get paid reasonable wages um and work with dignity. And for me that's the context that we have to

think about AI. AI is super cool and all of that from the tech bro side, but at the end of the day, AI has to be about benefiting humanity and treating people with dignity. And that's what's really

exciting to me about what I'm seeing here. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Shamina. That's a that's a great perspective and uh very also interesting to see a global, you know,

perspective on how you're seeing use of AI in different context and in your work at the center as well. Um uh such a thinking in in at an ASEAN it is at an inflection point with especially the

Indonesia open network recently being launched. Uh what lesson from implementations in India? Uh what considerations local to you know each country in ASAN

do you see uh relevant to implementations in in Indonesia and how do you balance innovation with uh openness with local considerations on data protection and national sovereign

data sovereignty? Um if you could share thoughts. Yeah. Thank you. You know um I'd like you to give a little bit of thought uh to if you were to take a project like which is a very successful

implementation of open commerce in in India and if you were to take it to another country what would you do? No just give some thought to what would you do to bring something like that to

another place which is completely different people culture is different habits are different you know the way they use media is different so the answer lies in it's not that is coming

to Indonesia we in Indonesia looked at what can we get from India on the back of you know prime minister Modi and president praovo signed MOU for digital cooperation in uh 2025 January when uh

president prau was here as the chief guest of the republic day and 3 months into that uh a lot of people including me uh and the Indian ambassador started thinking what is it that we can bring

from India that is of value to Indonesia and to ASEAN so it started from that side looking here right it's not that India looked at putting the product out there now in that came this whole idea

of there is a pioneering concept ONDC and it comes with all the use cases, some successes, some challenges, some opportunities and we had to sit and map what we could bring from ONDC into

Indonesia in the context of what's happening there and the problems are all the same you know we have 65 million MSMES we have 300 million population the youth are disenfranchised from jobs

because jobs are getting more difficult social problems will result because if you don't unlock opportunities for the youth, you're looking at, you know, failed democracies and that's actually

where the world is heading today. So, some of us working with the Indonesian government felt it is imperative we bring something that's a gamecher, something that will really change the

way the the digital DNA or the economic DNA of Indonesia should be able to change. It has to be something of significance. It can't just be let's bring this stack here, let's bring that

product here. It has to have a social impact so large that it is something that can be made into a movement and there was only one such program that brought it to the people and that's ODC.

So we looked at and then I contacted you know Koshi and you know all the people who created Sujit I'm I'm I'm in good company here today right and uh we realized that the starting point

actually is plugging and open network ideology into what's already happening in Indonesia. So, Indonesia has about 35 to 40% of the population already in some form of

digital uh action whether they're taking payments or you know at the very simple instances you know they use QR code like our UPI in India there's curis which is the product equivalent there and

payments is leading the way the easiest thing to do right you know you do digital payments and then you're already halfway there but moving product in a country like Indonesia which is an

archip Pelago 17,000 islands moving product from a remote village in one end to the other end means logistic networks need to be interoperable. There's no way any one logistic company can be the

biggest network in the country. So you know that the problems or the frictions points in Indonesia naturally pointed out towards interoperability, inclusivity, democratization. So it came

from a need rather than looking at uh you know being social crusaders. It's not that we want to be a social crusader and therefore let's bring it to the people. No, it the friction points

Indonesia faces can only be solved by something like an ODC. So that was a you know a revelation actually for us. So we looked at what is it that we can really plug into and I'll keep this short. Uh

government programs we mapped there are uh 17,500 traditional markets. They're wanting to be digitalized. Each market gives you 500 to 600 sellers. So now we are making a plan. Let's take this and

plug it into the traditional markets across the nation. Then there are 80,000 cooperatives in Indonesia. Every village has a cooperative which brings your farmer, the fisherman together and the

president has a program for digitizing them. What better application to give them than an open network, right? Because now not only have you gone to 80,000 villages and created a small

ecosystem of digital commerce, but you interconnected them into clusters and then they become a nationwide network. Then there are 65 million MSMES who are sellers selling all kinds of products

facing huge challenges by Chinese product dumping that's taking place now. How do you revive manufacturing in Indonesia at MSME level and make their products get a bigger larger market

across regions? Right? So, you know, these friction points and the problem statements automatically pointed out that there is only one way to go and that is having open network and embrace

a model that has been done somewhere. Learn from what is the best of ODC and use the best of and plug it into programs of the Indonesian government's existing programs. So it's a very simple

start. I think it's more practical that way. We'll learn as we go along and how more complex we can be. And this model mind you I think you know Sujit who did beckon 1.0 for for India is now

developed beckon 2.0 and Indonesia is going to be the first country to implement beckon 2.0 which means the copypaste model for open commerce could probably come from

Indonesia then going to the rest of ASEAN which is 10 countries uh and then other parts of the world you can look at something which is a hybrid evolution of what India has done which is pioneering

and what Indonesia is doing which is accelerating so I think that's the route we would like I would very much be happy to get the opportunity to travel the world once we have completed Indonesia

which has implementation in about a year and I think that's a good way forward for all of us to collaborate. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Fantastic. Pioneering to accelerating that's amazing way to put it.

&gt;&gt; Uh I just want to take a step back and look at what open networks uh especially in the commerce space did right they they lowered the cost of transacting they lowered the cost of entering into

the market. Um Shamina as as AI becomes more embedded AI itself is a costly technology there's going to be cost of accessing and using AI when people are uh building and deploying open networks

Indonesia is another country um how should sustainability and monetization be approached so that these systems remain open and trusted but also financially viable.

Yeah, again it's a great question because as somebody who leads the philanthropy and the sustainability for um for Mastercard, I also know the limits of philanthropy and grants can

only go so go so far. So the way we approach it is um we call it commercially sustainable social impact meaning profit is actually part of the equation

um part of and philanthropy is part of the capital stack. So these programs have to generate livelihood and and why not like that's the whole purpose of these things. But let me take a step

back and sort of give a little bit of context for um my friends from my friend from Indonesia. um in that what makes me excited about hearing this program from you um because we have been convening in

uh we with part as part of ASEAN um we have an inclusive growth summit that we bring to the um to the region and the reason why we came to ASEAN last year at KL we're going back to Manila and then

we'll go to Singapore the year after that is because what we have seen in this region but partially driven by ASEAN is that a billion people have joined the middle class over the last 10

years. A billion more are going to be joining the middle class over the next 10. Can you imagine what that means for consumption and what that means for DC? What it means for open markets? Like

just think about that. These are people that are going from $4 and $5 a day to 14 and $15 a day. These are not like $50,000 or anything like just going from $4 a day to $14 a day transforms the

entire life of a family of a generation and a community and a country. So if you look all the way up, this is what's happening right now. So from the outside in, so as I sit, you know, in the US or

I sit anywhere else, um that's how these markets are being viewed. the the the engine of growth is coming from here. The question we're asking ourselves, I think in this conversation and in many

conversations is will this growth be inclusive or will we exacerbate the divides we've seen in the west. &gt;&gt; The opportunity with the Indonesia model, with the India model, with the

open markets model and the open platform model is to build from the inside out with inclusion at the core. And I think that's why commercially sustainable inclusion is a reality. These things are

not exclusive. So we call it doing well by doing good. Meaning your business strategy actually depends on an improved outcome for the people that you're trying to serve. So I think that that is

sort of the thing that I would promote. And then the last thing I'd say about this um as you build out the DC model and 2.0 Beck in 2.0 know one of the things that we learned with our

partnership with micro finance organizations around the world, we made a $15 million investment in a micro uh micro finance uh global micro finance platform is that um once you get these

open uh these open-source uh platforms built, you can actually start lending on the platform in itself because what are you seeing? You're seeing the you're seeing small businesses transact in real

time. So you can also see that they're good for the loans. That's the other thing we've seen is that in places when sometimes it's hard for banks to lend to small business owners, when you build

these platforms, the opportunity for small businesses to actually borrow in real time becomes real because the contracts are actually happening. You can see them. So procuring from one

location in Jakarta to an island in another part of Indonesia is very interesting because you start to see you can see that the businesses are actually creating contracts with each other. So

the the opportunity to extend the network but also to extend credit to extend affordability to extend commerce. These are the things that are, you know, from a 30,000 foot foot perspective are

really making the world look at these places in a different way. That's so interesting. So, not just viability and financial sustainability of the networks and the platforms, but also people who

are benefiting, right? So, does the user find a livelihood? Does a user find better ways to earn income? Uh better ways to access credit like you said. So, it's amazing. Uh I think as we as we

look at more deployments um suja the question to you in terms of uh especially with AI the way pace at which AI is changing and and the technological innovations leaprogging every 6 months

we hear new things coming up in terms of capabilities or uh uh models. um what AR architectural choices today will determine uh that AI enabled networks remain

interoperable and adaptable in the long run. where where what choices do we need to keep in mind today to make sure that AI is not moving us back into a setup where you know we are we having to

rewire things because the technologies move faster than we could readjust uh the model around the technology &gt;&gt; absolutely great question there um so fundamentally I think if you look at

open &gt;&gt; your mic is not on this should be good thank you thanks so yeah great question Savvita I Um, open network fundamentally is a

architecture, a design. It's it's based on a protocol as we spoke about beckend. Uh, but what's important about that architecture? It's very very important that you recognize it. It's it's totally

decentralized. It means it has no database. There's no central storage of data. The the value doesn't get stored or captured. It's always flowing peer-to-peer, end to end from the

logistic provider to the shopkeeper or from shopkeeper to the consumer. That's what it allows. It always allows the flow of value to happen. And every time the flow of value happens, the the value

is always at the edges. So if I as a consumer, I'm making an order through a network like Indonesia open network um and placing an order on a shopkeeper, we both keep a copy. There's nothing in the

center. Now this is very very important to understand to answer your question because in on this architecture we are naturally building a certain amount of safeguard for any sort of concentration

and capture &gt;&gt; or capture of value at the center uh and and with with the the way the AI is emerging there could be potential tendencies of that when you deploy AI

but which is why it's very important it's AI for us it's about diffusion it's making the AI models go where the data is because there's literally no central database from which you can say okay why

don't you give me all the data and I'll give you better inferences that's not how it's going to work it's actually going to move at the edges um what it does and this is very important um what

bec what open networks fundamentally do it has reduce the cost of formalization or onboarding into a formal recognized network where you are actually you know you're identify yourself formally and

and and declare who you are uh it reduces the cost of discovery it reduc the cost of contracting ing transaction and fulfillment. This is a very very fundamental cost you talk about and in

in that process you're rapidly declining the cost of trust. If you're doing that uh I mean on on ONDC today we do literally seven orders per second &gt;&gt; at at at and and and and the reason why

the volume is growing is because the significant cost of trust that has gone down for a shopkeeper to make that transaction and we and and it also reduces the cost of transactions so much

so that on the network today in India we are offering a 100 rupee mutual fund to that's like literally a dollar mutual fund to farmers to auto share drivers because It's not just about credit. They

should also participate in the upside of capital markets. So the driving inclusion has those sort of opportunities. In doing so, what you're what you're trying to do is that we are

not looking at a capture with any form of that sort of tendency of AI, but leveraging AI to make sure it goes and works for the people who have the data and unlock agency for them. And that's

where in many of the conversations that I'm seeing and I'm I've been part of at least five networks that I've witnessed, AI's biggest value in open networks has been to reduce the complexity of a

shopkeeper. And I'm kidding you not. I mean, if you if I I would I would encourage all of you to see some of the demos you're talking about, whether it's in the Google booth or in the ODC booth

or or even the energy Indian energy stack. We had a farmer show it to the prime minister in literally three voice notes on a WhatsApp. He has no energy literacy. He doesn't know the difference

between kilowatt and kilowatt hour. Clearly, even I took a while. I mean, of course, I'm an engineer, but it's not something that I naturally think about. Without that, he said, I can I can I

earn more tomorrow because I'm not going to be at home. I'm going to be in the market and coming back in the evening. Can I earn more? That is where AI is being valued and it's craving the

surface. The last point here, open networks as a network and not a platform because there's no central platform. It's very very important. You're moving the the

discussion of safeguards and governance to the flows, not so much as a platform. It's very important to understand that we are governing the flows, not governing the infrastructure. Which

means for example, if you're doing a banking transaction, it's like internet. You don't have to talk to internet federation to implement internet banking transactions. You have the local bank,

central bank, RBI doing it for you. Similarly, on open networks, you only focus on the flows that needs to be governed and regulated and it can embibe the existing norms and laws and we are

making sure that are programmatically introduced. So these are the ways in which I think the cost the marginal cost of adoption of AI will also rapidly collap while offering other safeguards.

&gt;&gt; Fantastic. Thank you. you you brought about governance and that leads me to my next question to Sachin and we'll try and keep it short because I'm getting multiple you know [laughter]

stairs from people because you're almost on time. Um Sachin very quickly um what kind of policy shifts do you think will be needed to drive uh more adoption more diffusion of um

open networks with you know AI as the amplifier AI as the driver for more adoption. &gt;&gt; Yeah I think I think the governments uh should really look at the opportunity

ahead of them and then base policy on that. You know this is really a very simple thing. It's power to the bottom of the pyramid and at the bottom of the pyramid you have a huge maybe 70% of the

population is there. Imagine empowering them and what it can do to the economy, what it can do for GDP growth, what it can do for you know uh the livelihoods and I think when a government which is

always elected in power realizes that here is a tool which is going to help them look good because a good regulation and that enables people creates jobs puts food on the table is good for the

governments and the political parties. So I think policy should be or regulations should be driven by being able to meet up to the election promises they have made. I think finally there is

a tool that allows you to be able to show visible benefits for the people. We always talk about benefiting corporations and large organizations. But what can you do for the people? This

is it. Open networks give you that opportunity. And I think there in lies the answer of what kind of policy and regulation should be made that truly enables people at the bottom of the

pyramid to contribute and make a significant change to the economy of a nation. &gt;&gt; Thank you Sachin. I think there there's a longer discussion that can be had on

policy and role of government and the governance of these kind of infrastructures in the country but that's for another panel. &gt;&gt; Um

&gt;&gt; we're almost at closing. We're going to take a quick 30 second each kind of round and um just want to ask what do you hope to see in the next 12 months uh in the space of open networks AI uh

from a lens of uh improving impact outcomes. We are we are talking about AI. Uh Shamina mentioned it is only useful if it helps the people for which you're doing something. So just

quick 30 second reflections as we close. Um whoever wants to go first no specific order. &gt;&gt; Um formal sustainable okay there. &gt;&gt; So formal sustainable livelihoods for

millions and millions of people um and offering them new opportunities. Um that's was otherwise unthinkable. I think um of course we all know digitization can and solve for inclusion

but when done in right way it can really amplify with AI I think we can amplify further and I think AI and open networks as a way to diffuse that potential to people and raise livelihoods standards

across the world and give them more income putting more income in the hands of people uh would be one of the things that I would look for uh and then that's exactly why we've designed this concept

of open networks and with AI we're only amplifying that possibility &gt;&gt; I think with um we talked about governments in the role of uh governance and public sector. I actually think that

um private sector has an outsized role to play here in a way that we haven't played before. And so getting it right in the private sector is I think something that we should be really

focused on. So for our part, not only did we make the pledge 11 years ago to build bring a billion people into the formal economy, we met that pledge in 2025. We've re-uped and now we have said

we're bringing 500 million people and small businesses. Um we're going to connect them into the formal economy and protect them in the formal economy on their path to financial health by 2030.

So we've moved from inclusion to access to usage to security to health. That's the recognition um that AI will bring will speed up this process. &gt;&gt; Fantastic. So I I'd like to actually see

you know this uh young people the millennials and genz's of the world be inspired to stay where they are and not have to move to a big city just because you know opportunity lies there. uh if I

can see that they stay in their towns, they stay in the villages and get into digital that's going to be a huge motivation for them to build their economy around their local areas and I

think what we are doing open networks gives them that opportunity and it creates so many new digital and technology jobs that are savvy you know that's you know it's it's in it's

trending and uh social media can encourage them to go and become the little digital entrepreneur in their little town and village and build from you know inside So I really am looking

forward to seeing that phenomenon take place so that we are able to train them, skill them, allow them to build digital economies just around them. &gt;&gt; Fantastic. That was an amazing amazing

discussion. Very very enriching. Thank you Shamina Sugjett and Sachin for a lovely panel. Uh thank you audience for being patient. Uh and uh I don't think we have time for Q&amp;A but if you have any

questions uh we can do okay. I think we have time for one question. Yes. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Actually, I've been with NITO and rural development and one of the major

challenge I mean sir has been a speaker in one of our seminar also. So the main my question is that we have a very nice open network but the problem is that uh the big giants like Amazon, Flipkarts

they overshadow. So what would be the strategy to tackle this? because uh like ODC I've been closely working but the problem is that when I talk to the people on the other side who are using

the technology they say they prefer that because so what do you suggest to tackle that thank you &gt;&gt; um

&gt;&gt; Sachin uh Sujit Koshi sir &gt;&gt; yeah maybe Koshi if you allow me no the great point firstly um I I think there's often and always a comparison between what open networks are doing and the

likes of Amazon. I don't think it's either versus or I think I think that's probably a perception that I think that's been built in. Um OND's primary purpose is my understanding. Open

networks is to drive penetration access to digital markets. Uh because even with big platforms we're talking about under 8% e-commerce penetration in the country and with B2B it's under 1%. So for a

country as big as India it's one thing to say yes I get more orders on Amazon. We're talking about very few people getting more orders. Okay. So, this is about actual driving penetration to 75

million MSMES, artisans, 100 million taxi drivers, they all they all need to find a way to to to do business effective, cheaper and in a way that also restores their dignity. So, I

think that's one of the things I wanted to clarify in terms of open network as an idea. Of course, it's a very radical thought to think about commerce. I mean in a way we think about what Mascar did

about moving money. We're talking about moving multiple SKUs, goods and services of all kinds. You know, NDC we're talking about 15 sectors from mutual funds, credit, commerce, logistic

services, mobility, transit, uh agriculture produce, all of that. Some places it works really well. Some places there are areas where I think that's requires a little bit of attention. And

most of the work has been to explore what that means. We never expected even even the early e-commerce platforms never really took off the way it works today. It came after 20 years of

refining it. We are going through that process but there's been significant feedback loops and learning. In fact, Becken 2.0 is one of the reasons why we we we wrote the next version is actually

one of the hard learnings that's come from benefiting both ONDC and Indonesia open network going forward is to solve for some of these little frictions. Um it's uh largely it's about the mindset.

It's a very counterintuitive thought for a platform builder to know that the the platform cannot have both the consumer and provider on the same platform. It's just too counterintuitive. The fact that

a consumer is on one platform, the provider is another platform and the logistic provider is another platform. How do you solve for that? But in doing that in a certain way really accelerates

the scale and what uh expands that adoption. We're doing that very well. So now I think it's a lot of those stealing troubles have been resolved. As I said, seven seven orders a second um is is not

a bad uh sort of a throughput we're looking at, but we we're hoping to increase that to 50 over a period of time. And there are significant improvements on that front happening.

But I think the key point here is it's not a a platform. It's not an Amazon versus open network conversations. In fact, um I don't know if this is formal yet. Some of these platforms are

actually joining it. Many people thought that ODC will probably um make it competitive with Uber because lot of transactions initially was for mobility. Uber has officially joined ODC. It's not

either or. Uber has officially joined ODC because they think with ODC they can actually offer multimodal mobility in the country that was otherwise broken for a long time. So this way of thinking

requires everybody to orchestrate and do well. Everybody has to do their part very well and sometimes in the early stages all these platforms having that sort of harmonious coordination takes a

little bit of time but we're fixing that quite rapidly. Yeah. &gt;&gt; In case you want to add I won't take much time. Suri I mean Sujit um gave the big picture well

because what we are creating is a network not a platform. In network some some nodes will do well some nodes will not do. collectively and then to a grow and that's what we are seeing but one

more important thing that we remember ask she was asking from niti saying what more can you do it has to become a moment that is the reason that if you look at sujit and say sachin explained

saying that when we were discussing with the team there they said the only way it can accelerate is when it become a national moment and that is something where we hope will build up here and

that is being taken as a first challenge in the Indonesia open network thank you &gt;&gt; I'll just add a small point here you know we should stop comparing it to that do I buy on Amazon or do I buy on ONDC

because that is us. We're not developing this product for us. We're developing for product people for who don't have what they actually need. So if you really take us away from this uh

equation, it's really benefiting a lot of people and we are not the benchmark. We're not building this network for us. We're building it for those who do not have certain basic functions that an

open network can give. And if you really look at those segments and what Koshi and Sujit were saying is it has really impacted lives and I that's the takeaway we should say how can we amplify those

mechanisms and take it elsewhere and a amplify the impact of that. Yeah, just a quick quiz question. How many of you know what's the cost of a business delivering a ride on ride hailing is if

I if you were to look at the numbers of all the big platforms and one of the things that was born on open networks like Namayatri the cost differences are 10 times you know there's a network that

delivers a ride the total cost of businessing I mean marketing driver retaining you know consumer onboarding all of that the cost of that is just four rupees per ride never done before

it's the cheapest world's cheapest ride hailing infrastruure ffstruure and $250 million of money has gone to the drivers with no commission taken. There's nobody in the center taking commissions. So,

we're talking about doing things. Some of these takes time to build, but we're already seeing enough green shoes for us to really scale well and fast. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Thank you. Thank you everyone. Uh

I think we are at time. I heard the buzzer twice. So, thank you everyone. Thank you to our esteemed panelists. Thank you Koshi sir. &gt;&gt; [applause]
