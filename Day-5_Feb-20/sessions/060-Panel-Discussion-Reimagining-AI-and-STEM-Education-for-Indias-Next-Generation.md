## 📝 Transcript

but also an author. Welcome to the panel sir. Let me now invite Dr. Rajkumar, founding vice chancellor at OP Jindal University. Dr. Rajkumar has played a pivotal role

in advancing global legal education in India and strengthening international academic collaborations. Let's give it up for Dr. Raj Kumar. Next, I'd like to invite Mr. Sanjay

Chen, head of education Google. Sanjay works closely with governments, educational institutions and ecosystem partners to drive adoption of technology enabled learning solutions. Thank you

Sanjay and welcome to the panel. Moving on, proud pleasure to invite Yashid Ketya, Chief Operating Officer, Shamera Vi. Let's continue clapping for all the

panelists, please. [applause] Yashid is of course, you know, we are really proud of youth taking center stage and he is building a $25 billion fund for our Indian startups.

I'd also like to invite Mr. Rabbi who's the vice president of AI business transformation submer technologies. Welcome to the panel Abijit. [applause]

I welcome Shrherit Sahu Gi, Additional Secretary, Department of School Education, Ministry of Education. Sir, please join the panel on the stage. In his three decades of long career,

Shri Sahu has had the opportunity to work in various sectors such as power, industrial development, housing, transport besides working in the position of district magistrate and

chief development officer in his initial period of service. Sir, we welcome you to the panel. Goria Agarval who's the CTO of Coell AI. She would be joining us virtually for

the session. She believes in having an agentic AI filmmaking platform which she will be demonstrating here today. Welcome to the panel Gori.

I would also like to invite Charu Malhotra our co-founder and managing director of Primus Partners. She's a leading voice in competency based learning, AI education, gender

development and skilling. Thank you Charu. She will be moderating the session today. May I now invite Shri Narendra Bhushanji, additional chief secretary,

Department of Technical Education, Energy and Additional Energy, Government of Uttar Pradesh. Sir is a seasoned and senior bureaucrat and has led policy formulation implementation across

technology and education institutions. Sir, we request you to deliver your keynote followed by joining all the speakers on the panel. Thank you sir. Please.

Good morning friends. Dignitaries on the dis. Dignitaries of the dis. Dignitaries connected virtually especially

Gori. Ladies and gentlemen, let me start by thanking the organizers, Primus partners, especially Charuji and impact AI summit partners for inviting

me here and for inviting all the panel here and giving us this opportunity of sharing our thoughts with you. Coming straight to the topic friend you will agree with me that the

real question on AI especially on AI geni etc is not that how fast AI will advance I think the question this is inevitable and we cannot talk about the speed because we

don't know what will be the speed of this but the real question in education sector is will our education systems B they will evolve to keep pace with the

system. So here can they do it that is not the question they will have to do it but how will they do it that is the question. GNI has redefined re-imagined all the expectations from our education

system especially on STEM side. We we know GNAI is using many things they are performing tasks which have been inherently performed by students. In fact our whole strength in IT sector is

now in a way is being performed by Genai writing codes you know analyzing data generating simulations supporting research and we have seen that many studies including those from IMF those

from word economic forms they have predicted that as many as more than 40% of the core skills or the jobs will get impacted by AI. So that means degrees and diplomas

they are not sufficient. Our skills like the daily bread or the daily milk which we purchase will have a best before date now that you have to come back to the college or somewhere to get those skills

renewed. So what to do? I think we must align the competencies emerging from our this ecosystem of education skilling and with a strong focus on inclusion

and also equity. I will speak about this also later on during my part of this scale. Scale is also very big. This disruption is not happening in only few sectors.

Disruption is across the spectrum. It is affecting every sector of the economy. So that means we will have to take whole of the economy approach and therefore India because of the scale has actually

not performed so well not performed so bad we are already I think churning out more than 1.5 million just engineering graduates we in Uttar Pradesh have three universities on technical education side

but many more on higher education side also so we have more than I think 3 million STEM graduates coming out everywhere. So scale as such is not a big problem but as I said earlier

alignment will be an issue where we need to focus redesigning our systems refocusing our systems and there also I I feel because of a visionary prime minister Shirin Nendra Modi his

interventions we have done fairly good we have created some base as I am energy security also we call about the base load and peak load. So we have done well on base load air because of the many

interventions taken by under the guardianship of honorable prime minister like digital India program startup India program NEP 2020 in fact NEP 2020 has already moved us from the lot ro

learning to interdisciplinary thinking to other things like flexibility tech integration has come in a big way you know you students can move out anytime multiple entry multiple exist so that

has given us some again some basics that AI enabled STEM education fits directly into our national vision. It is already there. So friends when we sit here look at things we must examine from the

perspective of stakeholders students becoming the most important stakeholder. The skill profile of steam STEM graduate is changing you know changing very fast and I said earlier also that many of the

works many of the tasks which were being performed by our fresh STEM graduates are now being handled by Genai AI. So then students has to focus on what those things which machines

cannot easily replicate. So they have to focus on systems thinking, ethical reasoning, interdisciplinary collaboration, communication and especially the ability to critically

evaluate the AI outputs. The future engineer should not be just a capable user of AI. But he also un need to understand the limitations of AI and the societal impact of AI on every part of

our society. Teachers are the most important link and there I will later on explain what we are doing in Uttar Pradesh. They are the most important link. Teachers but has to see AI as

enabler. Sometimes I see you know teachers becoming skeptic. They are telling students not to use it. You know they are afraid that students are doing homework. But I think we will have to

embrace AI. We will have to welcome AI and we will have to res redesign our pedagogy. Our pedagogy must evolve. Flipped classrooms, project- based learning, simulations, virtual labs,

adaptive learning platforms will have to be mainstreamed. Faculty development as I said is very very crucial on this respect. So responsible use of AI. It can actually reduce the burden of

teachers. These days teachers are burdened with so many things. So that teacher can actually focus on mentoring and guiding the students in this new era of technology.

Friends, coming to institutions and industry which is the most important and in institutions I will count policy makers like us also. So industry is evolving at very high speed. I will say

at the speed of the thought or you can call it a digital speed while the curriculum the curricula it moves at the speed of the institution and there is a whole lot of gap there and we have to

work towards bridging this gap. So in Uttar Pradesh we have tried to take some initiatives. Two of them are the big ones. AKTU our technical university will be setting up a center of excellence. We

are actually uh projecting it as the virtual AI university spending to start with more than 100 crores on hub and scope model where like there will be two hubs basically one in NCR region close

to Gajabad and NOA and one in Lacno at all other 800 engineering colleges other two universities will be serving as spoke and to mainstream in our like poly techchnics basically exper experiential

industry 4.0 to learning. We have rolled out a project of worth 7,000 crores with the help of Tata consortiums where they will be setting up this project in like most of our almost all of our poly

techchnics close to 150 poly techchnics on smaller levels we have rolled out some some pilots also like we have course started something known as Thursday connect because training the

teachers is an issue till that getting experts through our studios we are rolling out you know uh lectures of the students on AI etc and how to decode it, how to use it on every Thursday uh using

our like smart classroom initiatives. So we have expand we are expanding a literacy across all the streams on access also we have done we provide one tablet or mobile phone as as soon as

a student joins the higher education stream in any sector we distribute close to I think 80 lakhs devices every year. So friends, in future we need structured industry

partnerships. We have to revise the curriculum very frequently. Embedded mentorships, project based learnings linked to real world challenges will be required and I invite all the

stakeholders basically to come partner with us. Lastly, I will say artificial intelligence will continue to evolve, continue to evolve very very fast. So what we have to ensure is that human

intelligence also evolves with it stronger, more ethical, more capable and we must remain conscious of the algorithm bias, the digital divide, inclusion, equity, all those

considerations. Responsible deployment and ethical education must be integral to STEM [snorts] education. Lastly, I will close by saying that the strength of our education system will not be

measured by how many AI tools we are integrating into our system, but how we are preparing our youth to lead our country in this era of AI. Thank you very much. Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Thank you, sir, for enlightening us and we are truly encouraged by your words. May I now request our esteemed guests to please join us for a commemorative photograph before we begin the panel

discussion. Thank you. And as we capture this moment in a photograph, let's try and capture some key aspects of our discussion which we can take forward in the year to come.

Thank you Narendra Bushan Gj uh for setting the tone and you did put across all the largely in fact entirely the the constructs of our discussion and we'll take these forward and delve deeper into

these uh AI as a co-pilot we are all uh aware of it helps us in our daily tasks uh right from what do I want to eat where I want to travel how will I do my work assignments apparently u around 70%

of students data tells us AI as homework assistance and from what we heard at the AI summit around 13% of chat GPT users are from India and uh it just shows u we are relying a lot on AI how should that

reliance and dependency develop let's discover through the course of this discussion um Raj if I may bring come to you and first of all I think this is a great panel uh it brings together

policy, it brings together the academia industry uh as well as our young entrepreneurs both in form of go gori as well as uh Yashid. Thank you for bringing the average age of this panel

down Yashmitt my compliments to you. So Raj um I mean we're talking more in terms of AI and careers and uh uh I mean that's the final outcome or one of the immediate outcomes of education would be

employability, jobs and careers. How would the career services department of any college look like particularly if we have to make a material difference by integrating various disciplines and

courses? Yeah, thank you so much uh Charu and uh thank you to all of you who were part of this discussion. Since I'm the lone educator in this panel, I want to begin by saying that uh it's

absolutely important for us to recognize the extraordinary and even uncertain implications for AI in the wider realm of education. And uh I want to first say that while we're discussing reimagining

AI in the context of uh STEM education, we should definitely include STEM to include steam which includes arts as well. Uh somehow if we end up ignoring the wider gamut of liberal arts,

humanities, social sciences including uh law and other disciplines, we run the risk of not fully understanding and appreciating the consequences of it. Second, I want to say that it's also

absolutely critical that um all aspects of university governance including the office of career services will undergo a dramatic transformation. The typical approach to any career services office

is to engage with students and requiring uh you know the development of skill sets and preparation for them to be able to be available for opportunities out there. They engage with potential

employers as well. But that's the old model. What is now going to happen is that to what extent AI integration has been possible in the curriculum in the core structure in the pedagogy in the

very learning outcomes that students have which internally get transferred into the preparation that one goes to for being better available for potential employers. The biggest challenge that we

need to be conscious of is that increasingly as we know now and uh we've been knowing this for a while that a large number of routine tasks that are associated with uh human beings uh

including young graduates is going to disappear a lot of which is going to have uh you know AI based systems and already we know now data that 30 to 40% of jobs are very rapidly disappearing

the consequence of that is that we will expect higher degree of knowledge, expertise and skill sets on the part of our students and a reimagination of the career services so that they can

position these potential employees uh to the employers in a better manner. The biggest consequence of this is that universities should be cons conscious of how we are able to re-imagine education

so that the fundamental objective of any university education which is to work in the realm of ideas and to be able to build that knowledge is not undermined because all of AI is through language

models large language models which is based upon the past knowledge that we have generated our ability to think creatively Our ability to develop analytical mind, our ability to take

decisions based upon a variety of factors including ethics and compliance and other aspects need to have priority when it comes to preparing students for our future.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. I think that was so well captured in a nutshell and you did touch upon uh uh the major and gave me my cue for the next question and Dra G may I you know pose this next question to you.

Um data uh AI analyzes data right uh but it struggles with data as well. data can be confusing, it can be uh conflicting, uh it can be unstructured and it can be incomplete.

Um but students tend to consume this gen the data from these gen AI chatbots indiscriminately, right? Uh what is the plan to actually

and this is a large question uh from a policymakers perspective. What is the plan to introduce early AI thinking in schools? because this we've seen across whether it's urban schools, rural

schools, government and private. Uh how can they be prepared better to be able to interface with data with Gen AI uh generator AI chatbots? &gt;&gt; Yeah, thanks Cheru. Uh thanks for having

me here. uh the issue related to responsible and mindful use of AI is indeed a matter of great concern and uh it has seized the attention of academia, industry,

policy makers and even the parents. uh the the fear is that uh uh at times AI is throwing up biased or misinformed facts and is also reported to making up facts. So in this uh uh scenario what

could be the safeguard that one can have? Uh we need to empower our learners to basically separate the grain from the shaft to uh to actually find out what is relevant for them, what needs to be

accepted and uh um this is possible only if they uh they engage in critical thinking. If we see this then this strongly aligns with our national education policy 2020

which focuses on development of uh scientific temper and critical thinking among students at a very fundamental level. uh the

policy um says to achieve this uh objective uh through uh through a paradigm shift in the pedagogy that we have in our schools. It uh uh it aspires to

transition the traditional pedagogy of uh wrote memorization to uh to an emphasis uh on uh uh uh emphasis on uh basically uh your u more competency based uh knowledge competency

development of the students. Similarly the assessment part that is also undergoing change and gradually shifting to uh towards evaluation of the competencies of the students that are

relevant to the real world problems. Motivated by this uh uh aspiration uh the government has uh also uh decided to launch 50,000 adulting labs in the secondary schools across the across the

country uh which will foster uh spirit of inquiry and creative thinking. This is at a very fundamental level because once the students start questioning what they are seeing, what they are reading,

then they would be able to take better decisions, better, more informed decisions. Coming to the specific intervention which government is thinking about

making students uh more uh aware about artificial intelligence. Uh we are planning to introduce a computational thinking and AI curriculum from grade three onwards

and uh if uh things remain on track uh you might see this being launched from the next academic season which is going to begin soon. Under this uh uh under this curriculum,

the emphasis will be to first expose the students to playful uh exposure of uh uh uh understanding patterns, logic and

then gradually graduating to development of their digital skills, programming skills, learning through projects and uh basically use their learning to uh to uh

to actually use AI tools in real world problems. So beginning from grade three, it will go up to class 12th and then as uh my previous speaker Raj mentioned that they should not be limited to STEM

subjects only. our subject should also be given opportunity in this. So we are also of the view that uh even at the secondary level till class 10th we have common almost common uh uh curriculum at

class 12 the there is u at the senior secondary level there is bifocation. So there also we are thinking to have courses for science students as well as the art students because the AI the role

of AI the use of AI is across the board across all streams. So this is the specific uh intervention that we are thinking of making. &gt;&gt; Thank you and I look forward and we all

look forward to seeing this happen for majority of the student population in the country. Let me pick on one aspect that you mentioned which was critical thinking skills and logic and uh

creativity and with this let me ask you Sanjay uh you know we are seeing this movement from consumer to creator where AI is concerned. So uh you know just from using AI uh you know gen AI chat

bots to actually building or optimizing AI agents um how do you so looking at this shift which is which are some AI tools and we did hear uh you know earlier you know speakers did mention

speak about AI tools which are that which are the AI tools that you think students should graduate with on you know coming out from the education to the work space.

&gt;&gt; Now the obvious answer char could have been everything Google as I should say coming from Google. But uh let's &gt;&gt; I thought you would say let's ask you know

&gt;&gt; I would I I would do that. That's why the phone is right on the table listening to us and trying to figure out give me the answers. That's exactly what I'm doing. Um but but think of it this

way. I I do we have tools that I can give names for. Maybe towards the end of my answer I'll say listen to me carefully. you'll I'll throw in a couple of tool names that you should use. Most

of you might already know them from the speech that Sundar and MS gave earlier in the week. But um more than the tool, if we start thinking beyond chat bots, because using a chatbot is just being

maybe a better searcher, trying to find out information that's already there, leveraging what is already there, engaging with what's already there, right? So, so rather than just exploring

information, how do we use agents now in this agentic AI space which maybe in a few years would become AGI? It's only a matter of time uh to be our interns to be agents who do our work. Right now, I

would I would dare say this that what you want is four interns do doing your work and you could probably be at the gym. As a Googler, I would not want to say that. But, you know, if I was in

college, that's exactly what I would want. That I would prepare an agent to find the information for me. I'd prepare another agent to work on that information. One more agent to check if

that information was correct or not. Validate it and then create the workflow for me on from that agent. Right? So, so that's what we need to become. Um, and I'll probably say something that I've

done in my life, be a solutions architect or a system architect in AI where you're not just leveraging AI to explore information, but to actually outsource a lot of things that you want

to do to the agents that you're creating. So that's that's where really we need to get into. But then there are two very interesting aspects I heard. One from Rajumar on the higher ed side.

Uh, Sir also spoke about it. Dhir G also spoke about the K12 side. Now both these worlds are very interesting and uh in a way very different because I've spoken to hired leaders and they would say it's

very difficult because the kids who come from K12 are not ready for the new world. So we only have four years with them. The schools have 12. So they should prepare them better.

uh we as employers say the institute should have done a better job but we have to still invest tons of time and hours in training. So the the areas of problem is pretty much everywhere. U I

absolutely agree with sir when he said that we should start something around AI literally in K12. Um there is a big gap that we have. I'm sure all of us understand that but I

think it's a great start with ME NEP 2020 talking about the some of the initiatives around adultting lab we have been talking to the ministry and some of the thought process that Sanjay Kumar G

or the Mraan GI sir has are absolutely forwardlooking around how teachers become the catalyst in this journey for students uh we still believe uh the teacher is the guru in the room right

unlike in a lot of western countries where teachers are not really looked up to but I think in India we really look up to teachers as the guide as the gurus so it's really important that we empower

teachers in this journey and they become the catalyst for the students to understand what is right when to use more importantly when not to use the tools in higher ed it's a little

different in higher ed it's about exploring it's about uh becoming that that architect and leveraging tools to improve understanding validate data another thing that came up during the

discussion how to ensure that the data that you're looking at is correct. So higher ed that becomes really really important because these skills will help us when we go to the job world or

founders um like him we know where to take out the noise there will always be noise whether AI or human so that's these are the skills that would really help coming to the core question that

you asked now that Gemini has told me the answer um I would say two things that or two tools under the Google umbrella that everybody should look at. Number one is Notebook LM. At Google,

all of us have favorite tools, right? And and if you in the last two years ask any Googler which tool do you like, they would say notebook LM. Why notebook LM? Because that's one of those few tools

where you tell the tool where to look the information from. Very simple example, you are a researcher. You could take five of those research documents from online. It could be videos, audios,

links, PDFs, whatever you want. Put them as the source of information for you to engage with and thus ensuring there is little to no hallucination, information correctness and you can correlate where

the data is coming from. So please use notebook LM not just use it this way but also engage with it to create infographics, slides, audio, video overviews and whatnot, mind maps,

quizzes and tons of it. So please use it. That's tool number one. Tool number two is AI studio. Once you have the information that you've explored and engaged with, you need to start becoming

that systems architect that you really want to aspire to. Use AI studios to test. Make it the sandbox to create agents. Play around with it. Move the temperatures up and down for the

responses. Engage with it to create various workflows and agents that you would want. &gt;&gt; And these are all free open source. &gt;&gt; Both both of these tools are freely

available. Good to hear that. Yes. So that's the answer to the &gt;&gt; since we are racing against time as every panel is and we had this whole last panel go beyond. Um so let me just

u uh you know when we asked Gori Agarwal uh she's a young female entrepreneur stress on the word female uh from Kanie Melon and she's created her film making uh AI platform which is your most

exciting recent application uh I would just she shared with us two videos unfortunately she couldn't join real time uh the time difference I would request our team if we can play uh the

application the way they have designed and a few words from Gori uh which she shared with us. Can we play that Prime Ministry? &gt;&gt; Hey, check out this Tik Tok. Do you

think this is real or AI? &gt;&gt; Seriously, who cares? Why are these companies using AI to mimic reality when they can literally create the impossible?

&gt;&gt; Like what? &gt;&gt; What if I was in high? &gt;&gt; Or what if you were? &gt;&gt; I haven't always been against birthdays. Each one reminds me I'm a year closer to

death's cold embrace. &gt;&gt; I don't want to think about that. &gt;&gt; Don't you need like a dozen AI tools to make this happen? &gt;&gt; No. Ideally, I think it should all be

just one platform. And what about all the crazy prompting you need to do in order to generate even a single scene? &gt;&gt; No, that's the stuff we let the AI agents handle.

[music] &gt;&gt; Hi, I'm Gori Agraval and I'm the co-founder of Coyle AI, an agentic AI filmmaking platform. Uh at Coyle, we believe that directors don't want to

prompt a movie. They want to control their shots. They want to direct the performances of their actors, scout locations, costume design, and build worlds that bring their vision to life.

And at Coil, we enable them to have that level of control over AI video. We believe that AI &gt;&gt; Okay, so that is creative u so not just AI. In fact, we spoke about the creative

uses of AI and in the orange economy, such tools become very very handy. In fact, it becomes very cost- effective also. Uh with this from one young entrepreneur, let me come to the other

young entrepreneur in this room, Yashmid. You know, uh we've been hearing some very dramatic pro predictions about AI being that monster that's going to

swallow jobs, right? So, is it true if it's going to swallow jobs, what kind of jobs? And in your you've just recently passed out from the education system. So what are the core competencies in this

whole AI augmented workplace environment that you feel students should have on leaving school college? &gt;&gt; I mean thank you Char ma'am for having me and this team panel. I'm extremely

honored to be here. Uh I mean I think the first question is yes AI will be taking jobs. As uh sir mentioned earlier 40% of jobs will in some form be reskilled. uh a recent study showed that

I think uh 100 million jobs will be changed by 2030 because of AI right but we also have to take into consideration the number of jobs being created because of AI an estimated 170 million jobs will

be created because of AI by 2030 almost having a net gain of 70 million jobs right so the the point is that yes AI will be taking up jobs but the core question here is not about AI taking

jobs it actually allows people to upskill the goal for the education sector and this entire steam panel with the vice chancellor of job opendal being here is that the goal is actually to

upskill students to allow them to take advantage to work with AI and not against AI like you mentioned I am a recent student graduate so I actually have seen how pre-AI life and postAI

life has existed right so so my perspective on is it is being pushed back pushed back against by a lot of high level education simply because they don't understand it and that's not to

fault anyone. AI is in some sense still a black box. So moving on to one of the question the further question is about what kind of competencies do should students have while exiting that can be

looked favored upon by companies like Google. I think AI fluency is something that's very very important. Um AI fluency isn't just about understanding AI. It's about understanding its

limitations. Uh how it operates, what it needs to operate and even prompt engineering. Right? This goes into the next thing of breaking down complex problems. I think AI works extremely

well when you can actually box it into certain situations. So each AI does have its own competency. It they they usually work on either LLM or SLMs. If it's an SLM, you can actually hyper magnify onto

one use case and actually get a very specific answer coming out of it. So I think having that ability to break down problems into simpler problems and being able to provide that to AI and getting

good answers is extremely important as well. Uh moving on, I think iteration is probably the name of the game with AI being as easy to use and as easily accessible. you tend to be able to have

a amazing feedback loop where you try, train, test and repeat that cycle. Essentially in this case, what it allows is a lot of experimentation. It allows you to find what fits. And I guess the

final core competency I can think of is that the human AI collaboration that is a particular collaboration that people need to figure out. um to some extent you can't just give all your work to AI

as so mentioned that uh go to the gym and leave it because there is some amount of accountability the work product that comes out you can't just say oh AI made it that's why it's not my

fault if it goes wrong you have to understand what you can give what the limitations of the AI are and where to delegate and I think kind of having those four core questions or

competencies would really help someone but beyond that I think curiosity is the name of the game I mean I mean we actually work with Google through our incubator And I believe that they are

doing a great job in terms of helping uplift future generations. We have an incubator coming out and Google being a skilling partner and actually providing free credits to our startups. It really

is a a major value ad for us. So I think that students being curious will be super important. Uh job is definitely will be retrenched especially the early base level triage analysis um reporting

stuff I think that will go. We have now cloud for Excel. Cloud for Excel can do what a financial analyst does, right? And until the point uh in the next three four years until the AI is completely

refined, we will still still have analysts. But what this allows is us humans to go beyond just the base level groundwork to actually making strategic decisions and evaluating things.

&gt;&gt; Yash, just listening to you go through, you know, all the competencies. Uh I'm still catching breath. There is a lot of work left to be done both school college skilling systems whatever age group

whichever you know wherever our students are placed I think there's a lot of work to be done and I'm going to look out for the space as you build your fund for the early stage startups in India with that

let me come to you AJ and you've got data in your name how many people have that and I'm sure you've heard it said often it must be a stale joke by now um but data does a lot of work. Um you know

making meaning of it, understanding the fairness. Uh students as uh you know Yashi even said students can sort algorithms again like he said placing them in real world context to have real

world value you know for an equitable and I would say u ethical adoption of AI. We all spoke of ethics today. What is it that needs to be done? And we have policy makers and we have academia here.

This is your best chance and we have a room full of people who are going to take this message out. &gt;&gt; No, I think uh yes, she's one of the very important person in this panel

because the kind of thought process and the baggage everybody else carries is is uh very hard to break and we require a very completely different thought process and this we can be learned very

simple example that AI Frontier models do not come up from Microsoft or from IBM or from large companies. They come up from young startups and which change the world. And I think in education or

in any other sector, I think we require people who can think what is required not today, what is required now, 10 years from now, how the world is going to change, how the world is going to

transform. If we do think only what is required what AI is in front of us and start making policies and start changing I think we will do another mistake. We need to start thinking that from now 10

years from now what is what may be required how the AI will take shape. What looks completely uh fictional will become a reality and that has already happened. What looks fictional 2 years

before has become reality. Sevenyear degree, five year experience of doing a B tech and Mtech is of coding is no more required. That has become reality. I think we require a completely change of

thought, completely new way of thinking. We are entering a new world. We like it or not. We do not we will not recognize the word which we which we are going to see few years from now. But we are what

we have learned is no more valid. I think uh we require a very very fresh thinking like child and start thinking from now uh that how the world is going to shape up in every single sector. It

doesn't matter what you don't require 100 acre universities anymore. You will have thousands of universities and colleges. &gt;&gt; If AI will code what will humans do?

&gt;&gt; Pardon? &gt;&gt; No, they will they will become architects. So they they uh I think the most important skill uh which I think too which everybody should learn no

matter at what position you are in the prompt and the navigating the AI and I think this is uh this is the most powerful skill if you know how to prompt and how to navigate the tool which you

will have you will have the most powerful tools in your hand there is no doubt about it and these tools will become uh 10x from now very powerful they will replace everybody's educ uh

everybody's knowledge and skill what is there in their hand and mind right now the key is how do you navigate it how do you deal with that how do you put the address in it how do you put the ethical

and the moral guards in it how do you see it is right or wrong how do you put the agents on it so there is a complete new way of thinking probably you don't require a new architect to design a

building but somebody to navigate to design that building through AI and that's that's the very important thing people are going to uh this uh I forgot the Salesforce CEO uh yesterday uh told

one thing that it is so hard to compete with a developer who can make a who can make a Salesforce module in $20 and a month. Imagine in a month somebody can create a

Salesforce CRM in a month in $20. Now if you have hundreds of Salesforce replicas, I'm not saying there's going to be enterprise application in one

month but it is not very far to make it right now. It is going to be everybody's cup of tea. So it is extremely important for all the students all people and I think one thing which we have not

discussed charu here universities have to start thinking to make more entrepreneurs rather than more job seekers &gt;&gt; and I think this is the biggest

opportunity word has ever had because now the dependency is very low. The entry to barrier is very low. The requirement of capital is very low. You could probably create a Zoho CRM on

another application in two months of time and go live rather than mill investing millions of dollars and that's the payroll system HR system whatever applications which people spend millions

and millions of dollars and years now it is possible to do in a matter of month and go live completely automated so I am not u very doubtful to say that it's it's not very far to have unicorns of

single person. &gt;&gt; It is not very far. &gt;&gt; You agree? Right. &gt;&gt; Right. And it is it is not very far. It is not very it it is not very unreal to

think it is what will be possible. I am seeing in my company where we make softwares my software cost has gone down which we used to quote 10 lakh rupees now we are quoting five to six lakh

rupees in a in a matter of 4 months it imagine &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; and it will and I'm sure we are rushing towards zero.

&gt;&gt; Correct. It is not about uh it is not about 40% 50% 60%. I think the coding cost will almost go away. It will be very frictional. So if you eliminate the cost of engineering completely which is

done by agent now you need to just become an architect what you need and get out of it. I think this is a very fascinating word, very new way of thinking and hence requires a complete

new way of education also and I think we need to really really imagine how the world looks like 5 years from now, 7 years from now and decide our policies for our students and entrepreneurs.

&gt;&gt; Correct. And I think Raj if you can just you wanted to come in very very quickly. We're running short and &gt;&gt; I just want to say that uh predicting the future is always a problematic

exercise. A decade ago, most of the education world were confronted with the fact that online education will completely anhilate brick and mortar campuses. Five six years ago, it was

promoted that coding everybody in the world should learn coding. We promoted India as well. That went wrong after AI. I don't believe the brick and mortar campuses are going to stop being what it

is. We need a fundamental question to answer. What do we expect out of education? If we don't get that question right, I am conscious of the fact that AI will not only destroy the future of

humanity but also will undermine the ability of institutions to fulfill their goals and aspirations. Many aspects of our life including our ability to collaborate, think critically, think

analytically, even develop a sense of emotion and empathy and sympathy. These are values which are so fundamental to what education institutions are supposed to be doing and I don't believe AI will

substitute. AI should be seen as a tool an opportunity to scale up and to use that tool for advancing certain aspects of education but it cannot should not and hopefully will not replace what

universities do. &gt;&gt; Absolutely agree on sympathy and empathy part. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Now let me quickly come to you Abhijit. I know our time is running out.

Uh but as you build submerged business in India uh and from education to skilling what is the talent pool that we need to skill and how? &gt;&gt; Uh the way that uh we see it from our

lens u we looked at everyone talking about the coding and programming and AI tools everywhere around from statistics. We as data center builders for India, we

are looking at a horizon that we are today of about 1.2 gawatt of data center which will host your AI softwares to run on to be computed on to grow to about 8 gawatt in the next four years time.

Where do you want to get those workforce from? Every college, every university, every STEM is always focusing on coding. We need

talent that comes in from thermodynamics, fluid dynamics, energy conservations, sustainability. For all of this, it has to start as most of our panelists were saying. Yes, Mr.

Bush also mentioned that we have the scale. We need alignment. We need that alignment. If India wants to be the hub of not just the region but the world, we need to look at the entire span of not

just AI coding talent but also AI infraaware talent across. You need to have people coming in from coding. You need to have people coming in from systems and processes. You need

to get people from the entire infrastructure build the entire stack. the we need to have a vertically integrated education system. So if we have that India can only

produce better global competencies and global competitive people who we can export out not just for in the region but across the world

&gt;&gt; and as was rightly said earlier scale is no problem. &gt;&gt; Yes. And yes uh so we would you like to garner that's it

&gt;&gt; okay so we have okay anybody who wants to kind of uh you know take a chance at this yes sir &gt;&gt; just I want to tell everyone here please take a deep breath we will figure it out

you know as part of my surveys I was taught many things but one idea which stayed with me taught by one of my bosses that as a civil servant everything will

be excused. Your every mistake will be excused. What will not be excused is your ability to anticipate, think beforehand, plan and act. So I'm

sure human minds are capable enough. &gt;&gt; We will figure it figure it out and AI will serve us as a tool and we will remain the masters. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. I would want to add one

I would want to add one more point. Uh I'm taking it through the rapid fire stuff right now. Actually uh Jensen of Nvidiah in one of his uh keynotes had mentioned that skills on MEP whoever is

skilled on MEPs are going to be the next millionaires. So it's not just about the coding, it's about the entire infrastructure that needs to be set up and we as summer are

getting that entire skill as a part of uh the parallel even on the vocational part not just the STEM part even on the vocational part the IT uh the IM all of that or even to that matter the ITIS I

mean you have engineers out there who are in plumbing into HVAC and all we need to give them that kind of fill up to get into the AI world of it otherwise they will be just stuck to some what

something that they have been doing traditionally we need to get the entire ecosystem movement uh towards AI that that's all that I will say I just want to add that we need to the NP talks

about uh increase in GDP investment in education one of the ways by which we can overcome the challenge of jobs that we're talking about is that significant upgrade upgradation of our higher

education institutions the fact remains that the existing education model has left with a huge skills deficit at all levels in we have the asset report which talks about seventh and eighth standard

kids do not have the competencies of the third or fourth standard kids we have higher education institutions graduating students who are not employable these are aspects which require greater

attention and for that we should use AI as a tool &gt;&gt; thank you okay just one last word from you &gt;&gt; yes I just wanted to actually add I mean

all of you all are esteem industry and professionals as someone who's a student right I I think one of the faults which I end up seeing is there's not enough infrastructure or pushing toward the

everyone's mentioned over here how the cost of barriers to entry has gone down significantly right but the problem is that we aren't encouraged as students to actually be entrepreneurial often enough

we aren't we aren't exposed to people at a young age to see that what they're building and obviously you have to be realistic 90% of startups might fail right but allowing for iterative cycles

in building infrastructure which allows it. Even if the infrastructure does exist in India, I tend to see that it's not easily accessible because there are so many loops you have to go through and

there's so much in the entire program. So, so I mean just talking to everyone on this panel ensuring that students or people who want to build something have access and

opportunity is a supremely important thing that everyone should keep in mind when building further. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And I think I would just reiterate that we have government here, we have

industry here, we have academicians here. Entrepreneurial thinking, early founder thinking is something we need to embed while we are looking at AI as well.

&gt;&gt; U thank you and I'll just GMA hand it over to you. &gt;&gt; Well, thank you. Thank you so much. Um I wish we had more time because the discussion was really interesting.

Well, I'd like to thank all the panelists, distinguished panelists and guests here for their insights, perspectives, and of course sharing experiences. Your contributions have not

only enriched our understanding of AI, but also inspired us to think more deeply about making it responsible for inclusive adoption. Um, we have some momentos from the

organizers. Please go ahead. Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Thank you so much.
