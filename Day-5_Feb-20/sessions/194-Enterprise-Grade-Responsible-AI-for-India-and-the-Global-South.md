## 📝 Summary

For India and the Global South, as AI systems move from pilots to mission-critical deployment across enterprises and governments, this challenge is amplified by fragmented and heterogeneous data, legacy IT infrastructure, uneven regulatory maturity, multilingual and culturally diverse populations, and high-impact use cases in finance, healthcare, welfare delivery, and public services. This session will examine what enterprise-grade responsible AI looks like in such contexts, grounded in real deployments rather than abstract frameworks.
