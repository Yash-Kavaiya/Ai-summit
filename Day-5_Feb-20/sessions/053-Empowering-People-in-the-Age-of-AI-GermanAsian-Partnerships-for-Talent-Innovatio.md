## 📝 Transcript

the global digital transformation for partners such as Germany and India. The strategic priority is not longer solely the development uh of artificial intelligent but very much it's

responsive and effective deployment um and particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises which in Germany and in India uh and other countries uh are the these are the

backbones of our economies access to skills innovation ecosystems and trust Trusted partnerships will determine whether AI becomes a driver of opportunity for all.

Today's panel will explore how cooperation amongst governments, industry, academia and development partners can address these challenges and shape a future of work that is

innovative, inclusive and human centers uh human- centered. It is now my great pleasure to introduce our distinguished panelists. We are deeply honored by the presence of Dr. Babel Kofla,

parliamentary state secretary to the federal ministry of economic cooperation and development whose leadership underscores German's strong commitment to international cooperation sustain uh

development. Miss Kofla, please come up. There's no signs. You can choose in the middle. Sure. Next panelist I would really warmly welcome uh Mr. Gobin Jaswell uh joint

secretary at the ministry of education uh of the government of India. Um he plays a very pivotal role in advancing higher education and skills development here in India. feast.

Also, it's my great pleasure to welcome Yan, the director general of the Indo-German Chamber of Commerce, reflecting the strength of Indo-German Economic and Business Corporation.

Please. Yeah. And a welcome to Dr. August GS Azaria, chairman of the South India Human Resources Committee as ASOC uh bringing extensive expertise on workforce

transformation and the future of work. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Great. Welcome. And we are also pleased to welcome Arthur Rup um director of the German

center for research and innovation whose work strengthen in uh international collaboration science and innovation and the today's uh discussion uh will be moderated by Dr. Kusumita Aurora.

Yes. &gt;&gt; Uh, director of inner science and technology center whom we are grateful for guiding this important conversation. Please

morning. Good morning everybody. Uh thank you to GIS for this uh very special and important session. Um

so uh we have been hearing I think about all aspects of AI uh in the last few days and uh today closer. Okay. Okay, I will wait one minute.

So this session we want to talk about people in the age of AI and uh what partnerships are going to look like for talent uh which is going to drive the innovation and al also the completely

the future of work as we know now where this is a this is a forum where we are going to discuss policy intent what is required for skilling for startup needs for uh infrastructure and other

pragmatic issues where uh which are going to drive the conversation ahead and this includes and always have to include the people uh personal growth their dreams and their particular

circumstances through which they will connect to AI and to each other. So um I would request uh all our panelists for their uh comments on um the different issues to Dr. Barb Kofler.

I will ask you to just explain your views of how development uh cooperation, public policy support between AI partnerships

uh in industry, academia as well as technology providers. How will this drive productivity and drive jobs because people are scared of the jobs? &gt;&gt; Well, you're quite right also with your

last remark. Thank you for the question and good morning everybody. Start with that. Good morning everybody to all of you. Um yes people get afraid of that there

might lose uh be a loss of jobs and it's also an issue then and maybe we come later to that issue also on how decent the workshops are they can require. I think we have to take those u feelings

very carefully because there's reason for that. I think we dive a little bit deeper in that uh in the next round. What we are doing and I will start a little bit with a general remark. Uh

what we are doing is first thing is with our cooperation we try to be a reliable partner in a very uncertain world. Uh we all know how well power shifts around the globe are taking place. how um the

international order is redrawn somehow and I think what we need especially if it's coming to technological transformation which is really having a big impact on everybody's life we need

to make sure that that technology included in all the other changes which are going on on the planet is really there for serving people serving those who are in the workforces serving

enterprises serving not only big enterprises but as we are jointly uh thinking uh India Germany small medium sized enterprises um because only if we do that if we

overcome that power gap which is still existing uh the full possibility of new technology can be spread and can be used by everybody and I think that's the aim and the goal of

my ministry and that's the aim of the goal of the German government to make the new technology uh being applicable uh useful for everybody and I think we're very aligned with that with the

Indian government. So I'm very happy that colleague uh trans secretary is here on the on the panel with us because at the end of the day we are discussing about open source open data we are

discussing about computing uh possibilities about how we can make that all more clim climate friendly reducing the costs of energy reducing uh environmental impact the use of water

for example which is necessary for all those computing uh uh things. Yeah. So there are a lot of things we have to regulate I would say in a overall governmental framework to

make it then um being applicable in a very positive way for the for the people for their companies. Um one concrete example what we are doing is I've just coming back from Mumbai where I also met

Mr. Newton and where we were opening uh AI living lab uh at university rat ratandata university at Mumbai where what is it all about at the end of the day it's about making the new technology

being uh part of a curriculara of a university offering students uh the chance to get into get get close to that but not doing that in something artificially made up doing it with

concrete working examples from small medium enterprises who get the advantage then to have access to AI which is also not always there. So bring those two groups who normally don't have so much

access as a creator of AI but sometimes may yeah you may use it you have chat DB on your mobile but not really as a creator and and as somebody who is inventing then the solutions which are

needed in business which are needed also for social interaction bring that together that's something uh we are doing as government and I think that's something we can talk a little bit more

about it later on but that's something And we want to foster in a global cooperation and in an overall uh momentum we really strive to close the power gap. I was talking in another

panel about uh the chances on getting access to uh competing data centers that's totally different in the global north and in the global south. the access to venture capital. There are

so many things surrounding the setting but also then at the end of the day how are the regulations on decent work for example. So people are really are suffering from that or are really

participating. So those things are the overall uh topics we have to you uh to to solve in government. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Uh I will move to uh Shri Jeshua uh joint secretary

uh I think many universities departments are already starting AI courses or uh some centers or departments. So how do we plan to have higher education and vocational training systems orient to or

reorient to work closely u not only on the courses but along with industry and e innovation ecosystem so that uh workers the graduates uh who are coming out of these systems are prepared for AI

enabled workplaces because um having the talent pool is one of the priorities. areas nowadays. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Uh I'll start uh with some context of the first question then I

will link how are we preparing. Most of the time it has been asked about this uh afraid about the introduction of new technology. &gt;&gt; I'll give one example because there are

many person who might be interested into AI as a layman and they may not be aware. any technology whenever it comes it creates disruption in the ecosystem. I'll give one example when electricity

was introduced discovered long time back you just imagine one person who was manually doing the work of a fan for some elite or some rich person when the electricity was introduced the same kind

of question might have arised whether he will lose his job or not. But what happened the electricity when it was reduced the consequence of that fan freeze the vehicle everything the

electronic uh batteries everything came into existence but what technology does if it has been used effectively it ensures the person who never thought that he will have access to a fan and he

will get fan which he is doing manually after one or I think one or two century he might be using the same thing the quality of life especially marginal people increases with any technology.

What is the role of government and the industry to ensure that when the transition takes place they are effectively and efficiently trained for new skills and a new job role. I am 100%

sure a person who was doing that kind of job few centuries ago after few decades he might be doing better job and the new kind of thing that's that's the challenge actually and when you said

about the university and the ecosystem and the introduction of vocational training and the introduction of AI courses we are keeping that in the mind because the transition which which took

place uh in one century that few centuries ago will take in few decades. So that transition it has to be very seamless. So no one is adversely affected and any technology se emotional

agnostic it will not go with the emotion it go with the hardcore reality. So in uh government of India is already taking many steps to ensure that every one is being trained about the new skills

including AI and in the last six seven years it has been introduced after the new education policy 2020 where we have enabled all the university ecosystem especially humanities also to include

50% courses especially for the skill courses and it's a very very organized and very very structured way that we are moving in last five to eight years and especially last one decade we introduced

national education policy where focus on skill courses we started six new research park in the premier institution especially in IITs before uh 2014 it was three so now it is nine we are still

going for another nine so and the all the courses of the civil engineering mechanical engineering we have introduced the certain component where the students who are getting through the

they are also equally trained with AI. If you see about the industry academy of collaboration the recent budget also where it was announced five educational city the core word was it should be near

to the industrial corridor. It is so curated and if you go for the last 10 it is so organized way that every student of this country is getting equipped with the artificial

intelligence. Not only this either it is semiconductor, it is quantum theory everything we are trying to train our human resources equally as we are also in negotiation and we have already

having some cooperation with our German government for the introduction of AI courses and it has been launched also in some of the our portal slowly slowly we'll embed everything what I suggest

with the industry academy collaboration most of the time it is was confined with the curriculum thing we are going ahead and we are requesting not to uh not only to involve for the curriculum they

should be involved for the entrance they should be involved for the assessment they should be involved for the practical training as much as possible last month I was in Germany actually

stood and Munich I I have seen that dual education system very influential very effective way and we are also going aggressively to ensure that every student gets industry exposure

internship was made mandatory apprenticeship embedded degree program was launched entire education landscape is changing drastically. We have series of uh activity that we are doing and I'm

very much sure key students especially in high education we have around 40 million students enrolled and they will be equipped and they are equipped and in the coming year we will lead into AI

sector also. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. That's uh very encouraging, very hopeful. Uh Mr. Azaria from the point of uh view of the Indian industry uh what would be your comments as to uh

what kind of uh partnership or collaboration models already exist and how do you see uh the students coming uh into the young workforce and turning AI innovation into real you know

productivity improvements and improvements uh for companies for the bottom line as well as for sustainability. Thank you very much. Uh truly delighted

to be here this morning. Um quick commercial about me and my company. All right. Uh I work for Kindrill which is an IBM spin-off and uh we're in the space of infrastructure management which

means that every most of the transactions that you're doing banking to airline to various other things are powered uh by our technology. Uh that's my day job. I also serve as the HR

leader for south for SOCAM and that's the industry connect. Now coming to your question um as I was riding in and um my cab driver I chatted up with him and asked

him what is it about this AI conference? AI sir. AI means all Indian. Wonderfully put. Not to take the credit away from other countries but you see at that level

the penetration and the hope that AI sovereignity could happen right here where we are sitting. So that is from that level. Now the other one I wanted to tell you is the

industry academia collaboration and as a HR leader the first thing I see is that there is some chaos and confusion among the laterals as well as

the freshers. when you go to campus to hire um you don't find real AI skills except that you see the CV developed by Chad GPT

and uh when I read through that verbosity I know very well this is system generated this is AI generated and I tell them look we need some levels of originality

you get your chat GPD or whatever Gen AI system wants to generate your stuff but I want your involvement. So which means that the human element that we want to put here is to oversee

what is actually being generated by generative AI. The other requirement from the freshers is that college freshers we're talking about is not just an awareness of what's geni they know

that but for them to know certain productivity tools like copilot okay to use copilot to develop small applications or you know have AI agents running that's the level and and I would

say That's pretty basic. Is it available today for the industry? The answer is not as much as it should be. Why? Because the faculty are not trained to impart that level of AI awareness. And

therefore we saw this gap and we said hey look let us address this gap and go into colleges. The industry goes into colleges with partnerships with large AI companies. Call it Nvidia, call it

Google, call it IBM, call it Kindra. And we go beyond the guest lecture. A we start with making it competitive to them. All right? And telling the faculty and certifying them. recently in a

hackathon uh with about 18,000 people in the southern city of Mongaluru uh there were more than 18,000 students and during that time we got more than a thousand faculty certified in co-pilot

and uh I would say that our target is to go into the hundreds and thousands and millions for faculty to be trained and also to provide faculty an endowment fund so that they can innovate and they

can come up with models and patents that they can file and I suppose that is where we have a big gap and if we are able to do it we are going to the hinterlands tier 2 tier three cities in

India and that's where the talent lies and AI while uh you can call it all India it's also about unlocking talent the talent that is available able in tier 2 and tier three cities is so

humongous. I will just take 30 seconds and tell you u when we did a hiring we did what is called a blind selection and in that blind selection of 10 people who were shortlisted or finalized for a job

that was paying close to 30 lakhs peranom which is for freshers. Four of them were IITs. Three of them were tier two uh tier one. The rest were all tier two

and three. What does this tell me? This tells me that the talent doesn't just stay in our top tier institutes. It's also so common and it's socialized right across the spectrum. And that my

dear friends is the challenge that we have, the opportunity that we have and I think today it's about making sure that they unlearn the past and learn about how to cope with AI for the future.

Thank you. &gt;&gt; That is uh real wonderful to know. I mean, this is an example or demonstration of how industry is really engaging with academia and engaging on a

long-term basis, at least a medium-term basis. And I'm sure this is going to yield results at the pace that industry and academia is uh looking at. Uh Mr. uh Jan uh can you please tell us where you

see the strongest potential for uh cooperation in AI and uh this translates directly into productivity into gains economic growth. &gt;&gt; Yeah, glad to do so. Yeah. Um now now of

course we we need to bring people together. Uh we we yesterday had a a tour Yeah. around our German &gt;&gt; pavong. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And uh yeah, it's amazing what's

going on in Germany as well when it comes to AI. Yeah. So uh all India is great. Yeah. But uh AI does not know any borders. Yeah. And we need to bring we need to bring people together. Now when

we talk about application uh looking at India, Yeah. the the first thing which comes to my mind is healthcare. Yeah. uh since uh if you if you look into a u uh let's say uh analyszis of these millions

and millions of records of we have of of healthcare data if we look into uh disease management if we look into remote yeah access to patients yeah via AI systems yeah that is going to be the

future not only in India that's going to be the future I I mean across the world. Yeah. Agriculture. Yeah. Digital imaging. Yeah. Satellite imaging. And uh water is unfortunately not only used to

cool uh systems. Yeah. Water is the scarce scarest Yeah. raw material if you want to. Yeah. On our planet in the in the years to come. Yeah. How do we use that in a meaningful way? Yeah. and and

how do we protect this resource and uh how do we look at yeah uh the agricultural development in certain areas. Yeah. So all of that could be done. Energy sustainability. Yeah. Very

very important. AI will play a very crucial role in that segment. Yeah. As does yeah in the skills development remote learning. Yeah. uh we do have and joint secretary I'm very happy to share

with you you were in Stoutgard which is fantastic we we just signed an agreement with a dual uh dual uh university of Bon Gutenberg on a on a master's program yeah where like 23 yeah is going to be

handled in India one/ird is going to be handled in Germany yeah but these are the these are the concepts of the future so if you ask me where to apply it's across the board it's across the

Okay. Uh thank you. Uh Mr. Rap uh as a representative of DAD which has been supporting um academic research uh for decades. uh what would be your comments as to how

our uh programs would uh on research would integrate uh AI skills uh new directions in AI uh right from uh maybe schools uh and greater into universities and in fact lifelong

learning to equip leaders uh learners with uh skills the critical thinking to use AI for their uh personal uh uses as well as to drive uh the economy. What what would be the role uh in in

this direction? &gt;&gt; Thank you for this question. Uh good morning everyone. Um you mentioned now so many points. I think I could speak for one hour which of course I will not

do. So uh first of all please also let allow me to introduce or advertise my institution as well. So we are the biggest uh um student and academic staff mobility organization worldwide. Um we

have been active in India uh for many decades as you have said. So our office actually uh just celebrated 65 years of existence here in India in New Delhi and uh we have several offices across the

country. So um before coming here today um I did uh consult two publications that were uh that were published recently um on this entire topic of um um how is being used uh in universities

where are we standing right now so the first uh publication um um it came out actually about two weeks ago so that's quite fresh uh or three weeks ago and uh it's called AI use and higher education

and teaching a review based on empirical studies in Germany So first I would like to have a look at Germany and I will not read this entire page out to you now. So but the basic conclusion is students are

using AI they use it and that's what you just uh have stated they use it in um many many cases without actually reflecting um how do I use it um how is um the

output being generated so how do how does the come to a certain conclusion because the eye does not reveal that this process we don't know that and that would be highly interesting and highly

important for us to actually to understand how it gets to this conclusion right um academic staff is rather critical um they are skeptical careful

um and so we are right now in the transitional phase uh because there is a lot of skepticism but at the same time institutions uh do have to develop strategies and they already busy doing

of doing that that is something that is happening in India and in Germany as well of course and um We need to train our academic staff. That's one big goal, one big task. And to do that, of course,

we also need to develop special curricula and so on, you know. Um, so the second study uh oh sorry, one important point uh one very important conclusion was that there is a big risk

of dependence on non-European AI platforms and this is a threat to freedom of research and teaching. Now this is of course very much centered on Europe but this is also something that

of course applies to India as well. you know when we use um um certain systems uh and um the owners of these systems they are not in our countries they are somewhere else um um there is there is

people training the CI you know so AI is not neutral it's also biased this is another interesting aspect you know um today um maybe this application is free of charge um so I'm using it um I'm

putting my data inside so at the same time I'm training that tomorrow this application might not be available anymore and then um me as a country or me as a company um uh I will get it in

trouble right because suddenly I need to pay for something and I can be excluded um the whole aspect of um of of data protection is also mentioned in that study because there was a lot of

questions um for example when uh people today write a research proposal and they use AI to um um just just to check the spelling you know to make the sentences a bit more polished and so it sounds

nicer, right? Um they don't they don't understand I think uh the the impact it has because where does this uh data go to? I might have a new great idea, right? This might be a revolution. So um

um it could be that someone has access to this uh will extract this information at another uh end of the world and might use this might even file a patent, right? Um so we don't we don't know that

right. Uh so this there there's also this dimension. So um another study um another publication um that was uh published that's called university student and generative eye imperative

that's about two years old already but I would say it's still important and what I very much liked about it is um that um um there's basically three messages. So um I don't know if you would be

surprised but um they found out a lot of young people today consult AI on their career choice on the choice of university and uh the subject I'm going to study. So I don't ask uh anymore

maybe the um my my teacher you know or my aunt you know um um I I consult AI and then I take the decision what career I'm going to choose and then um again not a big surprise u four out of five

people use AI so this is two years ago I'm sure this number is a lot higher today and uh another um interesting fact is uh engineering used to be uh number one among uh the people uh asked and uh

uh uh today it's computer science and information systems. So this is where the attention is uh going now of course because people see there is an opportunity right uh uh this is an

interesting career path. So you can see there is a lot of uh different aspects um and we as an institution we are of course also quite active. We do offer scholarships so we support any field and

just um about a week ago um um we conducted interviews. So we um conducted interviews there was um about 100 uh people participating in this interviews for PhD scholarship and research

scholarships in Germany. So uh the conclusion the professors came to was almost all the applicants used and you can see this this was mentioned before right by the way it's written you can

see it. Okay. And then um a lot of uh people did actually have AI in their research proposal. So it was part of the title. Uh so uh we see that we see that uh that that change and uh this is

positive right because uh we will progress and uh there will be new opportunities and um just maybe also to draw a little conclusion out of these two publications that I mentioned. My

personal conclusion is um this is a disruptive technology. It's just like when robots were invented and when computers uh changed our world. Uh you might recall those who are a bit

older will recall that there was also a lot of fear. Um um there is going to be mass unemployment. Uh we need uh as the minister has said we need to listen to the people. We need to educate people to

to tell them what AI actually is. AI is not intelligence at least not at the moment. Okay, this is statistical tools that are predicting um predicting an outcome you know um so um but we need to

listen to the spheres and uh there is a lot of um opportunity um um for the entire world which has just me been mentioned before right when we look at for example how we do uh agriculture how

we do farming and so on. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Uh I think uh we have uh very interesting aspects of uh AI what it's it already means for individuals for people and what it's likely to mean in

the future as uh it has come out AI is without borders. So a few questions now on what are what international cooperations are needed and what they will do for AI for

humanity as a whole. I think AI in India and AI the actual circumstances are a little bit different but the fundamentals of AI will be very very um uh potent and very important for all

countries and all uh environments equally. So Dr. Kofla I'll come to you first to ask that how uh international cooperation programs should uh get involved for better integration of uh AI

uh for skills and innovation initiatives and to in to ensure an inclusive workforce globally. &gt;&gt; Well, maybe I start with an overall topic. I'm just coming from another

panel which was about responsible AI. I think we have to get involved in responsibility because yes it was said it's crystal clear that's not neutral. We have biases in data. We have um

languages where where millions of mother uh mother language you uh speakers are excluded because they cannot use it in their language. People who have challenges to read and write are still

sometimes excluded. So there are still things we have to overcome to be really inclusive and as I was pointing out before um it's also in the business sector that way that uh there is not the

same chance for a small medium-priced enterprise to be included in using AI or making it available for their uh purposes than it is for a big uh company. So what international

cooperation should do is to overcome the gaps. Um we formulated always that there is still a power gap a a gap in being a creator of AI uh a gap in using AI in certain

parts of the world more than in others. Dependency was talked about before. So we have to overcome those gaps. That's the first thing we have to do in international cooperation and we have to

do it in a meaningful way. So it's really to the purpose of those uh who are using it to the purpose of countries to the purpose of individuals to companies and so on. Um I still um think

we should should have a close look how those uh new technologies can support agreed internationally agreed uh ideas like the sustainable development goals because there's a lot of potential in

that technology that could help us to reach those goals. So we should do that in a general way but we also have to uh be concrete because it doesn't really help us if we have conference after

conference and there's no concrete outcome on the ground. So we have to uh make ourself uh yeah um controllable I would say as a government we have to have commitments also in an

international cooperation we have to stick to those commitments and we have to report them and discuss them with public how to develop them further. So that is quite important. It's by the way

something we try to do with our Hamburg sustainability uh our decoration on responsible AI with the Hamburg sustainability uh conference with concrete commitments by all stakeholders

governments industry academia NOS's everybody who wants to to join that to come out with very concrete uh outcomes. um there that there are outcomes in

skilling uh people to be not only users but co-creators. There can be outcomes like we were debating a little bit before how to bridge um academia industry needs uh and the needs of the

young generation of students. Um there are concrete topics we we are working on that I was mentioning the living uh lab in Mumbai we were launching that's not my ministry only or

government only it's a cooperation of government uh it's academia with university Mumbai and university in Leipzik who is sharing their insights and there are concrete stakeholders from

uh industry and especially underlined small medium enterprises who need access and need work forces who don't have to be trained for years when they left university. They need to uh come up with

solutions immediately when they enter a company. So we have to bridge all those things and I think a governmental approach has to be also on the one hand to set frameworks

&gt;&gt; to create a reliable setting uh so people can trust and know what they are doing. privacy was one of the topics. Um but on the other hand, we also have to bridge the gaps which are existing in in

in the conversation in between the stakeholders. So yes, I'm always saying I I love that with a AI and and and all India, but at the end of the day, it's the whole world. We all have to bridge

if we really want to to be uh useful for uh or make use of that technology. I think that's for me the most important thing for a government. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Uh

Mr. Jeshal, do you would you have some quick comments as to whether there needs to be other avenues of cooperation? Dr. Kofler has already said how uh cooperation has started between India

and Germany for education. Do would you like to add something to that? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Um I'll just add one point that AI is highly based on primarily is based on the pattern. So when the both the

country are collaborating normally they have a different pattern say depending upon the societal structure industry maturity small medium enter enterprises challenges. So when we collaborate we

try to complement each other because as long as we'll take to train the entire system and the train the entire ecosystem especially you said about the commitment of stakeholder that's core

thing if you want to achieve and we are working on that aspect both the country industry and academia are doing excel in some or other field and we will definitely collaborate and complement

each other aspect that's it &gt;&gt; thank you thank you we are a little bit running out of time but just one last question to Mr. Yan. How how do you think German and Indianmemes

can better integrate into this uh effort that is starting in uh in full force in fact &gt;&gt; yeah uh um thank you that is I believe a a central a very central question since

uh if you look into Germany uh 98 and a half% of the German business setup is theme yeah and if you look into India it's similar and uh what is important important to anme. Yeah. It is basically

Yeah. I I have to develop myself into a scenario where I am efficient. I'm I'm saving costs, I am innovative. Uh otherwise there's a very fierce competition. Yes.

&gt;&gt; Yeah. Which makes me very very vulnerable. Yeah. So if we now bring Yeah. this longterm experience of these German midsized and small companies and we talk about decades of experiences.

Yeah. If we bring that together with the talent, the spirit, the creativity and this innovation spirit of the Indian talents and very important if we in Germany get used to the speed we have in

India. Yeah. Then uh this is this is going to be unbeatable. Yeah. project teams. Yeah. So we need to bring people together and we need to bring people together across countries. We need to

form sandboxes. Yeah. Where where young talents Yeah. of both countries and no borders of European countries and India can really experiment. Yeah. And come up with solution uh solutions which is not

geared towards oneme but for an industry. Yeah, within the theme sector. Yeah, that is uh basically how we need to uh go forward. German companies are are cautious when it comes to spending.

Yeah. Um and they are not risktakers. So there needs to be a benefit and they need to see the benefit whether it's a financial benefit, an operational benefit. Yeah. Uh they need to see that

benefit in order to act. Therefore, I look forward to be a little bit working on the field of integration together of course with other entities. Yeah, we'll have in India and in Germany.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you everybody. And I think we have all come together. &gt;&gt; Let's make one last observation. Sorry. &gt;&gt; Here. Here. &gt;&gt; One last observation. Sorry. Okay. um uh

this thought came to me in terms of how do we collaborate and cooperate and um how well the EU has done GDPR okay uh making sure that people have that security similarly there's a lot to

learn from Germany in terms of how they improved their vocational training from elementary levels right up to mast's and PhD levels And I think today like the honorable secretary also said at the

school level we need that level of collaboration to ensure that AI is seeded at the elementary level if not at the primary level. And uh my request of course is to to this eminent panel to

enable our educational institutions and provide them the expertise that they can mature in taking this at the elementary level. Thank you. Yeah, of course that would uh make a world of difference and

I'm sure all the partners here are ready to see uh conversion of intent to commitment in the very near future and I wish everybody the best uh and uh look forward to the outcomes. Thank you

&gt;&gt; very would like to ask Mr. Goind Jesel and Mrs. Kofla to stay here and thank you very much for the other panelists for the dice and uh good luck

and wish you a good um summit. So because uh Mr. Aaria asked for followup and we will do a followup. Um we now turn to an important initiative that exemplifies the next phase of German

Indian cooperation in the field of artificial intelligence. The AI academia industry innovation partnerships in Asia commissioned by BMZ uh and implemented through GIZ. Um and uh this exactly um

addresses the widening gap between demand uh widening demand for AI skills and the um the need for uh job ready talent. Uh so um we learned about the living labs. Uh this will be all

included uh combining students, researchers, industry experts to co-create and test AI solutions in a real world setting. Um so this is all about and it's just my honor to ask to

invite Babel Kufller to deliver a her remarks on this initiative um and followed by uh Mr. the J's remarks please just for stand or &gt;&gt; you can stand also

&gt;&gt; no &gt;&gt; okay it's a little bit dynamic that at the end of the day and I'm very brief because there was said a lot about the necessity of cooperation especially on

the training sector and the training field what we all know is we were talking about world work uh places of the future and we know there is a chance in create also new jobs through new

technologies you were mentioned that also um there's a world bank study about or is it world to trade organization I think the study about uh already uh the creation job creation is 1.3 billion a

million but we don't have really enough skilled workforces for that uh sphere. So there are almost 1 million um job opportunities not really filled in with adequate uh people which at the end of

the day leads to personal loss, economic loss and we want to bridge those things. That's why we are creating this uh academic approach together. We want to bridge that and offer those job

opportunities which are already there on the ground to people around the globe and um that initiative should be a part of that and that's why we're really happy and I also I always have to read

the title uh uh that we we launched this project of artificial intelligence academia industry innovation partnership in Asia. It's through my ministry uh together with India, Indian partners and

partners in Vietnam and I'm very happy that we can do that today. &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Um actually the when we started the collaboration uh for this

project and when we got to know about this in this living lab actually. &gt;&gt; Mhm. So the name is very interesting the lab which where you incubate your idea and create a prototype a living means it

has should be all the uh attributes of a life. So I hope it will able to solve the problem of the industry and academia and it's about bringing the academic world to the closer to industry and

industry closer to academic world and academic training to just come straight with the requirement of industry. That is the major objective and I convey my wishes for this project. I'm very much

sure it will achieve its objective and we'll have further collaboration in the future also. Thank you. Thank you very much. &gt;&gt; So now now we invite you to watch a

brief video representing uh presenting the initiative. You can just &gt;&gt; Yes. I have to go to the next platform. &gt;&gt; Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. &gt;&gt; AI and digital technologies are

reshaping how businesses operate faster than ever before. For companies, the challenge is no longer access to technology, but access to people. People with the skills to adapt, innovate, and

work confidently with AI. What is taught today is often no longer what industry needs tomorrow, especially for Germanmemes expanding into global and Asian markets.

At the same time, Asia is emerging as a powerful driver of growth, dynamic economies, new ideas, and a rising generation of digital talent ready to engage with the world. This is where

German development cooperation implemented by GIS brings together German and Asian universities, businesses, and governments in a new AI academia industry innovation

partnership. The question is simple. How do we develop AI ready skills, support innovation and grow across borders? The answer lies in learning and innovation

spaces, living labs. Living labs are structured learning and innovation spaces where universities and companies collaborate on real industrydriven challenges.

Students work on real business problems. Companies test ideas, innovate, and access emerging talent in a low-risk environment. Faculty strengthen curricula through

direct engagement with industry. And institutions build long-term meaningful partnerships. For students, this means hands-on experience, global collaboration, and

improved employability. For businesses, it means access to future ready talent, fresh perspectives, a vibrant AI ecosystems, and a testing ground for innovation. More than a program, this is

a partnership at eye level, combining German expertise with Asian entrepreneurial energy and drive to innovate. This is the AI innovation partnership, uniting academia, industry,

and governments across Germany and Asia to shape what's next. developing skills, enabling innovation, building an AIdriven future together.
