## 📝 Transcript

tech and AI at Central Square Foundation. Before that, I would just request all the panelists to be seated here. Thank you. Change the name.

&gt;&gt; My name is Good evening everyone. It is indeed a pleasure to be here and thank you to the India mission and the uh India summit for acknowledging this as an important

topic to include um within the panel discussions uh scheduled during the India summit. I also hear these are the last set of panels uh for the summit. So maybe we should just close with the bang

and I see Bhanu sitting with five women. So good luck to them. [laughter] But um uh I am here on behalf of the Central Square Foundation. Central Square Foundation is a philanthropy

working in school education in India. And one of the focus areas for us is edtech and now that edtech is getting powered with AI. Uh it becomes very important for us to ensure that um we

impart AI literacy to every student, parent and child in India. uh so they they're able to become active contributors to AI rather than just being passive recipients and that is the

um fundamental premise of this discussion. uh CSF has been working on uh a program large scale program on AI literacy called AI summer and uh [clears throat] this is the first um

program with a curriculum uh for AI literacy that has been built by in partnership with the Vadwani school of um AI which is also represented um on this panel. So uh with that I will hand

over to uh Bhanu to take the proceedings forward. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you Gori. [applause] Uh good evening everybody. Uh like Gori said we are in the last few panels of

the summit. Uh and I have the distinguished privilege of moderating four stalwart women in the education space. I don't think there's any other all other panels were the other way

around where there were a lot of men and very few women. [applause] So it's my privilege to uh moderate all of you. Uh I will try to keep it as conversational as possible but you can also trouble

yourself between with questions and stuff. Right. So today's dialogue is really about uh building futures through AI literacy for India and the global south. Right. Uh AI is already in our

hands. It's in our phones. It is in our homes. It is in our classrooms whether we like it or not. Right? Uh the conversation today is really about what features futures do we want to

build of this tool which has come in into our hands. Right. I think the discussion about should AI be in the classroom or should AI be a learning tool is already passed. It is going to

be there and it is for us to figure out how to use it productively. Right? So with that as a backdrop, we will move forward into the conversation and uh quickly talk about each one of you here.

Uh Shabbana, senior product project uh project scientist from the Vadwani School of Data Science and AI IT Madras. uh Rama we all know Rama Senta and lot of other things as well before that

Tanushri co-founder and COO of transform schools and Chitra founder of uh Chrysalis right I would actually start the conversation with Shabbana putting you on the spot right so you your

journey really in the sci in computer science really started with the trigger which your 11th grade science computer science teacher parked in do in the classroom right in the in a rural school

in the backwaters of Kerala right nice place to be there but from that time to now the role which you play as a postphd fellow in uh IT Madras working in the edtech space with all the things you do

in AI uh both on the usage side design side and the regulatory side I would really like to ask you what according to you are the transformative bets AI can bring in education space.

&gt;&gt; Okay. So if we want to analyze the transformative bits, the major transformation transformation that AI can bring into the classroom, I feel that we should look at the impact that

AI has on the key stakeholders in education namely the students, the teachers, parents and the education bodies and organizations at large. So if you look at learners, I think the

biggest value add is in terms of personalization, right? because research has already shown that one-on-one human tutoring uh results in better learning gains as compared to a traditional

classroom based uh learning. But uh we know that in India and also across the global south uh the teacher the student teacher ratios are quite large which actually prevents personalization from

happening. So this was the case before but with AI in picture this can change and in fact this is changing because uh AI can help students with personalized learning in terms of customized lessons

that that is tailored according to the students uh specific conceptual gaps or misconceptions or AI can also suggest tailored uh learning pathways. It can also provide individualized assessments

and also tailored feedback you know pertaining to the performance of the students in the assessments. So that way AI can play a big role in adding quality to the learning process of the students

which definitely helps in better learning gains and outcomes. Now coming to teachers again um so so we always say that you know AI is not going to replace teachers but it is going to be a better

assistant. it is its role is going to be as assistant which can help in better productivity teaching productivity as well as the quality of pedagogy is what it brings onto the table. So for

example, teachers can use AI based tools to create better lesson plans to run diagnostic tests that can uh help uh inform the misconceptions or learning gaps for students in the class and

tailor instructions uh based on that it can help in you know uh kind of producing uh required kind of assessments and also even evaluating them. So that way uh the value add is in

terms of improved productivity and also informed pedagogy and u so so another significant uh transformation that AI brings is uh that it lowers the barrier to quality

education especially for the underserved communities. So with the voice based capabilities and uh the multilingual capabilities of AI now um quality learning content is available in

regional languages to learners which in fact um you know not only affects the teachers and learners but it also affects the parents in the sense that now parents can have a more engaged

contribution to the to their child's learning. So, so that way it opens a lot of opportunities. And now coming to educational bodies or organizations at large. So we know that data is collected

across multiple points uh including assessments um attendance systems and program implementations etc. Now with AI it is possible to collect all of these data points combine and analyze them to

give uh actionable insights such as um you know identifying uh risks of dropouts identifying high-risk students perform better resource planning etc. So that way AI is already transforming

education in a big way and it it is going to be it it has a lot of potential to you know uh play a greater role uh in education as a whole. Now uh so this kind of emphasizes the need for AI

literacy because you know AI is already a part of classroom and all the stakeholders are kind of already interacting with AI. So there is the need for uh the for everybody right not

just the students or teachers but even parents and uh generally uh for people to have a better understanding of the AI concepts how these tools work in order to use them responsibly.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. So uh I hear three things. You said stakeholders, student, teacher and maybe even a parent like a teacher. And the second thing you said is that getting AI to the last child in our

population which is equity and accessibility. The third thing which you said is for all the use cases which you talked about to be utilized there has to be AI education in the form of AI

literacy. Right? That brings us to the stakeholders right. So Tanushri you across the last seven plus years have impacted over 30 million students right. So my question to you is uh from the

government school systems point of view uh and when you go on the ground to students right especially the government schools primarily right uh how are they responding to AI in and around them in

the classrooms be it at homes or wherever they are interacting with it what are you seeing on the ground &gt;&gt; thanks thanks for that question and thank you for inviting transform schools

on this panel so um I think in past seven ers uh with our experience of working with the government schools and as an organization we work on uh improving learning and life outcomes.

uh but with the program which is AI sum we have uh seen one emerging thing that uh child is able to participate uh more in a meaningful way uh with with learning perspective that is one and I

have two great examples to share uh from our home state which is Odisha it's from the class 9 uh they're both from the class 9 uh grades uh one there's a girl uh whose name is uh shreddha and uh so

she when we asked her that you know how's her experience uh in a class uh where she's getting these lessons from AI summer so she said that I used to use AI tool as something uh you know just in

a fun way but now I'm able to crossch checkck uh my difficult subjects or the topics and if I'm still facing any difficulties I'm able to go back to my teachers and cross check again. So she's

using AI as a companion uh as as well. So so what I see here is that curiosity is converted into confidence. So that is one big thing. Uh there's another child whose name is Punam. Uh she said that

for us when we saw uh AI around us everybody was the AI was a buzz word. You know we were everybody was talking about it. Um but it was for all entertainment because uh we were saying

that okay you can you can gamify it uh you can make a cartoon movie about it all of that but when I uh see AI now is that I can get my project ideas from it. I can actually you know do my

preparation uh from it. So uh and it is very uh useful to see that because they are the first generational learners in a government school. So it's uh it's a great uh I would say uh pleasure to see

that happening in a government school and uh I mean AI with AI summer we are reaching about uh.9 million students uh in all and what we have seen as a pattern uh overall is three things one

which I mentioned earlier is curiosity converting into confidence uh second that AI is able to support uh learning um uh sorry language improving into languages and second reducing the

learning gaps students have and third is which is the most important thing which AI Samarth does is that teaching them about uh the ethics uh the biases and therefore it's a responsible engagement

so that's the most important thing which I see so I think the students in our government schools are uh ready to use AI but just that they simply need uh I would say equitable access and uh guided

literacy which AI Sam is doing. &gt;&gt; Uh thanks Tushi. It it it's it's lovely that you talk about the story of Sharda and Punam the journey from curiosity to confidence

&gt;&gt; and along that journey being able to use digital tools in the form of AI and exercise their agency as a learner &gt;&gt; and not lose it. &gt;&gt; That's correct.

&gt;&gt; Right. So that's a beautiful story and I think uh you know.9 million shas and punams. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Thank you.

&gt;&gt; And onward up for the number &gt;&gt; not more than that. Right. So uh that moves me to another dimension. Uh right. So Chetra uh you've been um you founded Crystals over 25

years back and you founded it out of the pain of being a mother of two daughters and their disillusionment in the school system at that point. my dissolution. &gt;&gt; Your dissolution. [laughter]

&gt;&gt; They were too young to be dis. &gt;&gt; And u uh the interesting uh connection here is that uh you actually started off as a full stack ICT curriculum embed provider from grade 1 to grade 12 for

CBSC. Uh and you have seen that whole wave right and we still have over 40% of our classrooms which still don't have computer labs. And now you're at the start of another wave with AI, right? So

I think you're looking at the second wave in your own journey Chris you and your team and other other people working with you right. So my question to you is uh

how are teachers in the government schools and the loy private schools in particular not the middle and upper but the loy private schools today uh you know transacting around integrating AI

into their uh life work and fun. Yeah, thank you Vano. That was uh that is a very important question to be thinking about and I can speak from a pre-ai summer and a post AI sum point of

view. So very grateful to CSF and everybody who's you know really pushed us into this wave with a very very purposeful and meaningful work and it's uh giving us a lot of insights into this

community of teachers and students. So if you look at preparedness when we entered and I think we we are now close to 200,000 students that we will be um you know um

who would have been exposed to uh AI literacy. Uh we are talking about uh the preparedness being I look at preparedness from two points of view. One is awareness about AI the skill sets

or whatever it means to handle a tool and the other is I think the sentiment and mindset that every teacher or every student has. Right? So from an awareness point of view again the spectrum is I

don't even I just hear this buzz word and I don't even want to go near it on one side and on the other side yeah I'm dabbling with it all the time on my WhatsApp. I know it and then there's

always this confusion between the thin line that AI and you know and algorithmic tech um provides. So um uh I think AI sumat has really empowered them on certain skill sets that has gotten

them to understand what is AI and how I can be putting that to use. That's from a skill set point of view. But for me I think more interesting is the sentiment and mindset point of view. If you look

at that, it's a spectrum between hope and uh fear &gt;&gt; and uh hope leading to over um you know um stimulation right and uh uh fear resistance and not really getting there.

So I think that's a very important spectrum and I think a program like AI literacy and summer kind of brings in an equilibrium. I think that's very important because and I completely you

know I can relate to what Tanushi was saying we we see so many children and so many teachers who are now telling us hey you know what I thought everything was bad about AI like I I was so fearful I

thought it's going to replace me as a teacher I now understand that if I hold the agency and I know what is what and it's not rocket science I think that's the first demystifying thing right I

It's not it's not anything that uh I cannot be conversant with and we are talking about government teachers, affordable private school teachers who have found a confidence like she was

mentioning and that has made them approach AI in a very uh purposeful way right they are integrating it I think the way we built the curriculum um thanks to uh the Vadwani school and CSF

and we've also made some meaningful contribution to that curriculum and content development We are seeing that um the use cases we build in there is a very very re high

relevance to what the teacher is doing which is very important. It's not just literacy about what is what but how it can be purposefully used by the teacher. So that's a big uh winner for us. The

second from when it comes to sentiments, we've heard um children actually children and teachers in particular tell us that you know I had a negative approach and today I walk in with so

much positivity. I know this can be engaging, this can be purposefully uh done and even that over I don't know what to call it but I think overutilization

you know where they would just generate lesson plans because somebody asked the coordinator or the uh you know educational officer asked them they just go and dabble with the LLM chat GPT and

then churn out lesson plans not even knowing what to validate how to validate and that has also been kind of equalized. So I think it's a beautiful in my opinion an equalizer

uh and of course over a period of time it'll become a leveler. I look at it from that point of view and there's much more work to be done but I think it's a beautiful start uh where there are so

many positive stories in the field that's giving us a lot of hope. I think even for players like us, you know, organizations like us. I wouldn't say we were not in that spectrum between hope

and fear. It's not only about the teachers. We are all in this uh phase of, you know, is it going to be the thing tomorrow or is it going to be you know what is our position in this world

and I think uh this is kind of now getting to some equilibrium. That's what I would say. What I hear you say is that uh you know tens of thousands of teachers are finding their balance

&gt;&gt; absolutely &gt;&gt; in the classroom with confidence and agency right and I think that's a good state to be in and we have lot more work to do India is a big country and global

south is even bigger right that brings me to Tanushi sorry Rama so Rama your journey really started off with the time you spent in Mckenzie and you actually

kind of bootstrapped the education practice for this region in Mckenzie and then from that horizontal view you actually became a falcon and then you dove into teachers and the problem of

teachers and there comes center right so over the past few years like 11 years in center from across 100 countries 100 plus countries teachers have engaged with you

and now you're at a place where you are seeing AI come into the mix Right. So I would ask you to kind of you know be that falcon fly back out uh out of India and look at the global south and kind of

talk about what are you seeing what are you hearing from teachers in AI not just from India and what you're doing with AI summer but also in other countries where there isn't any such thing happening.

So uh so one thing is that uh in in India uh we did a pretty large scale survey recently and we found that almost 70% of teachers are in some way or the other using AI and this is like across

segments uh whether they are using it well or badly different matter but in some way they are touching it already. uh you're right that that is not necessarily true in all parts of the

global south where uh overall technology penetration is not as high as India. I mean to take a simple example when we did a did one of our teacher assessments in a place in Uganda we had to do it pen

and paper which in India now is almost uh unheard of actually. So uh so so the uh so the penetration is not equally high but uh one common theme that is there whether in India or other parts of

the global south is that while usage is rapidly increasing understanding is lagging significantly. So we we also test competencies of teachers and naturally AI has become one more

competency to test and uh we are finding that there are a lot of misconceptions on uh what AI is about how to use it uh etc etc and which is where to me I think like others have said uh I think the AI

summer initiative is is very interesting because uh and and and I'll just digress for uh for 30 seconds where you know going back to going back to covid when uh covid started and teachers started

teaching online and we were also testing teachers on their ability to teach online a lot of people would ask us what do you see as the difference between a teacher's competency in teaching in

person versus online uh and interestingly the data showed that if a teacher is bad at teaching in person the same thing is getting carried over online. It's not that they became

particularly bad because of going online. And in some ways that same thing is again happening with AI that if I don't know how to do lesson planning or I don't know how to do student

assessment, it is not going to get solved automatically. On the other hand, if I know how to do it, AI can become a powerful enabler to do it much better, much faster, in a much more personalized

manner. And I think AI summer is giving that literacy to teachers at a very fundamental level. It is not one of these like quick skilluing programs of saying okay, you know, you go to a tool

and you use it in this manner, but understand it fundamentally and start building it into your life. And we are seeing as others have said that confidence emerging with teachers. Uh I

mean like in a remote part of Jharkan we've had a teacher saying that you know look I I'm I was worried that my students are getting into this world faster than I am and now with this

literacy I am able to catch up uh with with my students which is a very nice thing of her to say. Uh but that's sort of those are some of the perspectives to to start with. I don't know if I

answered uh because I was not sure what I was supposed to do as a falcon coming out but I I [laughter] tried. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you Rama. I I think uh good conversations three things to pick

right. One is the stakeholders being touched and their journey from uh curiosity to confidence for some actors and then for a lot of other actors finding the balance between the hope and

fear spectrum. Right. So uh I would like to kind of take the conversation a little bit down into the implementation and design of all of all of what we're working right I mean that's where the

rubber really meets the road right uh so I would go back to Dr. Shabbana and uh Shabbana you have been a part of the curriculum design and the curriculum review and the endless debates of uh how

should we help a a rural school uh student in Orisa understand computer vision and what metaphor would we use that and those are fascinating conversations we had in those times uh

but now looking back at the journey and looking back at what we hearing from the field uh not just ASMR but there are a lot of other literacy programs happening Uh but I would really like you to kind

of um you know focus a little bit on um moving towards what is it that you would like to see in the design which kind of ensures uh ethical judgment and critical thinking uh among all the stakeholder

the the child as well as the uh teacher. &gt;&gt; Okay. Uh so first I think we should clarify uh what AI literacy is because so um when we look at um the available AI literacy curriculums around the

world, we see that you know many of them deal with foundational AI literacy along with AI skilling. But AI skilling is more about how to practically use AI which is more uh role or context

dependent. So for example uh AI skill for a software engineer could be different from what AI skilling would be for a teacher. But AI literacy refers to the foundational set of AI concepts that

that is kind of universal that is something that everybody should know about. So um as a part of uh the AI summit curriculum right um so we collaborated together the Vadwani school

and uh CSF uh collaborated together to come up with a wonderful curriculum which I feel is like very grounded and it kind of you know focuses on the key AI foundational concepts that everybody

should be aware of and later you know you could build on top of it to do further skilling which is more tailored towards each role. So uh to talk about the AI summit curriculum we have four

key pillars. The first being understanding what is AI and what are the applications of AI like looking at um you know the everyday uh applications and identifying the AI component because

we all interact with AI in some form of the other without realizing that you know um it is a form of uh intelligence that we are interacting with. So understanding that is very important.

understanding what is AI is important and you know uh also uh you know kind of having an awareness about the some of the key technical aspects like what is data what is the role of data in

training uh an AI system and you know about vision um about NLP so so these are the basic uh AI concepts uh the technical concepts that u you know students and teachers and universally

everybody should be aware of and then once Once we have an idea about the uh role of data in training AI systems that naturally leads us to understand about the societal impacts, the environmental

impacts etc. So for example, so we we know about the uh issues of bias and fairness in AI systems, right? So we know that okay an AI system is trained based on the data. So basing upon the

kind of data that was used to try train the systems, we can have you know these issues and these arise whenever the systems are used in practice. So the third pillar is definitely about the

societal impact, the environmental impacts, what happens when we require the computations at scale. And finally about how to practically interact with these systems, right? How to write

effective prompts because we all interact with almost all of us interact with uh generative AI tools such as a chat GPT, right? So then how to uh actually uh frame the frame an effective

prompt to get the desired result. So that is also very important. So I feel that these kind of cover the basic fundamental AA concepts that is universal that everybody should be aware

of irrespective of teachers, parents or even students. &gt;&gt; So uh ju just one more minute on how do we in all of this safeguard critical thinking.

&gt;&gt; Okay. So uh coming to critical thinking. So, so when we know that an AI system is trained using data, we know that you know the kind of results that we would get on a query would depend on the kind

of data that the system has seen. So, which would make a student or a teacher or any user um you know be vigilant about using the AI uh the the results from the AI tools directly. So, we have

to be careful about double-checking cross-checking with uh valid sources and not trusting the result uh you know directly and um Also coming to the critical thinking part, it is more about

you know not over relying on AI tools and using your judgment to kind of validate the results to verify uh like I said with verified sources whether the results are uh you know valid or not. So

which is also important &gt;&gt; I think just connecting on that uh there was also a lot of exercise which was done across the curriculum to sprinkle various good ways of using AI where we

basically kind of said uh it's not about asking the AI for the answer but actually doing your own exercise and submitting your answer and then asking AI to review and improve uh which is

that critical thinking loop uh which we reinforced across multiple places right so I'd move forward a little bit to uh you know uh Chitra now. So Chitra uh I I would like to take you down into a a

teacher training scenario where your team has trained a lot of teachers on AI literacy via the curriculum and then they were cascading forward. Right. So at that level right what is it that you

have you and your team have done in terms of building confidence for the teachers who are in the training program to carry that back into their classrooms and deliver it to the children. I think

um we've always believed that teacher training is more about building an emotionally safe environment whatever topic we are training teachers on and with AI the hop in uh fear spectrum this

becomes even more relevant so I think both in the curriculum the way we've done it and in the way um we facilitate and train the teachers &gt;&gt; uh namaste

Please please uh pleasure to have you here. Uh we welcome uh Shri Krishna G from uh mighty. Thank you for joining us today sir. &gt;&gt; Chitra.

&gt;&gt; Yeah I'll &gt;&gt; so I think uh we we definitely need to look at how the confidence is built in a light-hearted way. I also want to say a lot of teachers have now started saying

we are becoming more polite in classroom. Any idea why it's nothing to do with the training but but to do with LLMs &gt;&gt; because chat GPT always tells them hey

you've asked a brilliant question so that is becoming contagious and the teachers are today like you know we've seen that happen. So that is why why I wanted to bring that was there is a lot

of role modeling that happens when there is a cascading right and I'm simply saying in LLM cascading also is bringing that politeness I hope we don't become artificially polite but then I'm hope

I'm hoping that some of these things rubs off in the language of teachers. So um I think that hope and confidence is what trainers are uh modeling and that I think is being carried on by the

teachers when they do the cascading to the students. And one other thing in the literacy I mean the sum model I feel is the capacity we are building in the teachers is actually um strong because

There is the responsibility of the teacher to go back and train the and see they are all teachers you know when we analyze why teachers resist training it's because they think that they are

the deliverers and then to receive uh becomes difficult for us. So I think I love this AI summer model, the literacy model we have built thanks to CSF and you know the whole think tank there is

that yes I'm going to learn and some of us are actually going to translate it into the to the students and so that rub off is really really working well. So I think the preparedness or I would say um

uh the teachers are are very gently handling this whole thing because for them it is a new topic. It's not like I've done math teaching for 25 years and I've found all my children getting into

IIT and all of that. Now this is a new topic. This is a new skill and they are very very careful when they are uh doing it. So there's a lot of deep um respect that they have uh in terms of

translating this into the their own training BU. So I think um in many ways this has been eye openener into how um training usual teacher training and how this AI literacy teacher training is

becoming uh is is bringing very new uh new insights into how teacher training can happen. So I think that's very very critical in the whole &gt;&gt; Thank you Chitra. Uh we would now

request uh Sri Krishna G to uh kind of address us. Secretary Mighty, &gt;&gt; I'm sorry to, you know, literally photobomb this session. It's not my intention.

Ron is a very old friend and when she asked if I could stop by, I just thought I would. Um, primarily more than anything else to thank all of you for participating in uh probably um a

historic summit, one that finally democratized AI. uh in that sense I think uh what we have managed to do is to actually bring people into the room and more than even people we've managed

to bring people's concerns into the room and I think it's very fitting that we're talking about education today which is so critical uh in every sense of the word um partly because I think if we

have to achieve anything we need to achieve we need people to do it and people who have the skills and who have the abilities and who have the competencies to actually do what needs

to be done with technology and make sure that it works for them and make sure also that they're able to participate and they're able to uh actually take advantage of it. The other part of it is

of course while we are making them capable to what extent can we use technology. I think it's nobody's case that we have enough teachers or teachers assistance or we have the kind of

resources we want for education. If technology helps us to multiply that rather than substitute it and if technology helps us to actually enable our teachers to act deliver better

nothing like it and I think those are the kind of applications that we seriously need to look for. The expo is replete with those examples. Incidentally it's open tomorrow and it's

extended up to 8:00 p.m. today. So if you haven't gone and taken a look at it, let me make a pitch. Please do go take a look. I think um huge number of social applications of uh what uh uh you know

technology can do and how it can work for people. I think all of that is something which would interest many of you. But more than anything else I'm not an expert on education. Uh and I would

not I would be the last one to suggest that we should I mean this is the silver bullet and it will solve all the problems. It may it may not but I think we need to sort of experiment with it.

But more than anything else I think one thing I do know that uh students of all ages and students in all disciplines need to be aware of the potential of the technology and see what it can do for

them and I that in itself I think would be significant. The government of India has already made a policy call that they would teach about AI from class 3 onwards and I'm sure that many states

would also do the same thing and that would form part of the curriculum and likewise in practically uh every institute or every university. I think AI needs to be taught across all

disciplines. I mean not necessarily only to the computer science people in the IITs but to just about everybody because again the jobs in AI are not just of the guys who build the models. I mean those

are the nerdy PhDs. There are probably about 300 of them across the world who do it. The rest of us are not going to do that. The rest of us are not going to be Sam Alman or Pero Amadai or Dennis

none of them. I mean all of them we saw yesterday. The rest of us are going to be more journeymen, more people who will actually figure out ways in this ways in which this technology will affect us. So

that people need to know, people need to understand even in an area like art history what is it that the technology can do to their own discipline and how they can sort of leverage it. So if uh

the central foundation and educationists and everybody focuses on this area and is able to actually train the next generation to do this, train the next generation to figure out what jobs can

work for them, that's going to make all the difference. I I or none of us are in an age group where I mean Rah and I are probably about we are contemporaries. So we are too gray and too old now to sort

of for this to make a huge difference for us. But this is a technology for the next generation and they should not be lost in this and that is something which I think we need to uh keep as central to

the message and the whole message of this summit is inclusion and bringing everyone in and we have to also ensure through the education process that no one is left behind. So thank you very

much for having me and uh I wish you all the best. Again, a plug for the expo. Try and take a look. And thank you all for joining us here today. Thanks. [applause] Thank you.
