## 📝 Transcript

I session titled responsible AI in telecom being organized on the sidelines of India AI impact summit 2026 AI or telecommunication. This event is organized by telecom

regulatory authority of India TRI in collaboration with India AI under Ministry of Electronics and IT. Today interestingly on 20th February TRI marks 29 years of its journey in shaping

India's telecommunication landscape. Representatives from telecom operators, technology OEMs, policy makers, government, academia and media are present here.

network that can detect faults even before we know them and deliver seamless connectivity to billions without interruption. This is not a science

fiction. This is the power of AI in telecommunications. Today, AI is transforming industries and as we look ahead, AI is all set to become even more transformative. From

predictive network management to intelligent customer experiences, the possibilities are humongous. Now it's my proud privilege to invite Shri Anil Kumar Loti GI Honorable

Chairman TRI whose dynamic leadership continues to provide direction and strength to the telecom regulatory ecosystem of our country. Chairman sir needs no introduction. His vision has

been instrumental in steering try through a rapidly evolving digital landscape. I respectfully request chairman sir to kindly deliver his inaugural address.

Distinguished leaders from the technology companies, from telecom service providers and industry associations, representatives from government, my

colleague members from Tri and other colleagues from Tri, ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon to all of you. Uh it's my privilege to welcome all of

you to this session on responsible AI in telecom uh by the side of India AI impact summit. During last few days we have been

listening to the world leaders from governments, technology companies, academia and civil society. AI is now and here. In this context, the very composition of

this gathering reflects a shared recognition that artificial intelligence is no longer an emerging add-on to telecommunication. It's a foundational capability shaping

how networks are designed, operated, and experienced by users. Artificial intelligence and telecommunications complement each other to form the backbone for the

intelligence era. Telecom networks are emerging as the primary carriers of AI while AI itself is becoming the intelligence layer of telecom.

In the upcoming 6G technology, AI will no longer be an application layer. It will be intrinsic. The telecom networks will be AI native. In this sense, telecom networks are no

longer mere data carriers, but these are central pillar of India's AI infrastructure. Our nationwide fiber backbones and mobile broadband networks constitute one

of the most widely distributed digital infrastructures in the world operating within mature operational and regulatory frameworks. India's scale gives special significance

to this convergence. With over 1.3 billion telecom subscribers and over 1 billion data users, India operates telecom networks at a scale

where AIdriven automation is no longer optional. It is indispensable. AI is already being deployed to optimize network performance, predict faults, improve energy efficiency,

enhance customer experience, and combat fraud and spam communications. These deployments demonstrate how AI can improve service quality,

resilience and consumer safety when applied responsibly at the network level. India is already witnessing clear gains from the responsible use of AI in the

telecom sector. Operators are stating significant energy saving with use of AI in network management. Due to the effectiveness of AI and

blockchain based filtering operators are now flagging or blocking nearly 400 million suspected spam calls or messages each day. Enhanced enforcement and improved

oversight of service providers has already led to the disconnection of about 21 200 uh 2.1 billion million spam numbers. The authority is also advancing the

rollout of a digital consent acquisition framework following successful pilot runs with the banks to ensure consumers have digital control over consent for commercial communications.

At the same time, the scale at which AI systems operate in telecom also amplifies their impact. Automated decisions taken by algorithms can affect millions of users

simultaneously. This makes trust the central pillar of AI adoption in telecommunication. Efficiency gains cannot come at the cost of transparency, accountability or

consumer rights. As telecom is an essential service, public confidence must remain at the core of AI enabled transformation. The government of India has been

proactive in addressing this balance. The India AI mission and the recently articulated AI governance guidelines emphasize a human- centric, safe and accountable approach to AI, one that

encourages innovation while embedding safeguards by design. These principles are particularly relevant for telecom where AI systems interact continuously with the citizen

enterprises and public institutions. Try has been aligned with this approach. In July 2023, try issued recommendations on leveraging artificial intelligence and big data in

the telecommunication sector, proposing a riskbased regulatory framework for AI in telecom. This approach recognizes that not all AI use cases carry the same level of risk.

While low-risk applications may be guided through self-regulation, high-risk use cases, especially those directly affecting consumers, require stronger obligations around

transparency, explanability, and human oversight. In April 2024, try further facilitated this approach through its recommendations on the

regulatory sandbox, enabling live network testing of AI enabled solutions, including those relevant for 5G and future 6G networks within defined safeguards.

This reflects our regulatory philosophy of enabling innovation while ensuring that public interest remains protected. The manov vision announced yesterday by the honorable PM of India emphasizes a

human- centric framework for ethical, accountable, inclusive AI governance. The principles of the man of vision are equally fundamental to AI governance in Coming back to the agenda of today's

program, the two plenary sessions we have planned capture this responsibility very well. The first session featuring technology developers will focus on preparing

telecom networks for the AI era and examine how networks must evolve to become more intelligent, autonomous, and resilient while remaining secure and sustainable.

The second session with representatives from telecom service providers and GSMA will address building customer trust through AIdriven operations highlighting governance, ethics,

accountability and customer protection in an environment where AI based decisions increasingly shape everyday connectivity. As AIdriven telecom operations scale

across borders, issues of interoperability, standards and ethical alignment become global concerns. India India's experience of deploying AI

in telecom at population scale offers valuable lessons. While international cooperation remains essential to address shared challenges. Let me conclude with this thought.

AI will undoubtedly shape the future of But it is the way we design, govern and deploy AI that will that will determine whether this future is trusted, inclusive and resilient.

Tri remains committed to working with all stakeholders, industry, policy makers and international partners to ensure that AI in telecom serves both

innovation and public good. I wish this I wish this session fruitful deliberations and look forward to the insights that will emerge from today's discussions. Thank you.

&gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Thank you very much chairman sir for your inspiring address. You have illuminated how regulatory frameworks and policies are evolving AIdriven

telecom sir. We are delighted to hear your perspective sir. Heartful gratitude to all the esteemed speakers and guests. The inaugural session has set a vibrant

context for our upcoming discussions session. Our first session is on preparing telecom networks for AI era. In this session, our experts will discuss AI

adoption in telecom, transparency, security, safety, sustainable AI networks and embedding responsibility by design. To moderate this insightful discussion, we are honored to invite

Shriur Ranjan Mittar, member TI, an eminent telecom policy expert with over three decades of experience in telecom networks, global standards and spectrum policy. Sriatanjan mitsurya

we are honored to have distinguished panel of industry leaders. I welcome on dice Mr. our first panelist Mr. Magnus Iverber, chief technology officer for Asia-Pacific at Erikson, a global

telecom innovator who had played a key role in developing region's long-term technology vision from 5G deployment to 6G readiness. Joining us next is Dr. Vineh Sukkumar,

vice president product management from Qualcomm, a seasoned product leader with over 20 years of experience in large scale AI, deep learning and mobile technologies across global telecom

ecosystem. We also welcome Mr. Paci Doven of Nokia who leads strategic engagement with governments and industry on AI and connectivity initiatives driving

largecale ecosystem collaboration in cloud AI and AI RAM. Our next distinguished speaker is Mr. Shanti Graham Jaganat from Tis Networks a technology strategist leading wireless

products network management system and AIdriven innovations. I request all the panelists to join for a quick photograph session uh on the demand of the organizers.

Uh you all may stand for a Thank you sir. We look forward to a thoughtful exchange on how AIdriven innovations are redefining telecom capabilities from our

panelists. Now I hand over the stage to our moderator Shri Rutanjan Mitas to start the session. &gt;&gt; Thank you madam uh Shri Lot chairperson ti my colleague

member Dr. Tangala uh doans of the industry OEMs uh your staff accompanying you if any my colleagues from TRI industry associations

young officers represented representatives of startups so it's a very important session on the how the telecom uh networks will actually evolve to AI I we saw a lot of use cases in the

last 2 three days uh related to u farming, education, healthcare but today the focus is telecom and the first session this session is on the network. The next next

session as you've been informed is the subscriber. [clears throat] So uh as a telecom network we are introduced to term access network. So that is one thing we would like to

understand how your access network is evolving with the AI. We all know that in the 6G AI and communication is one of the important uh use cases one of the six cases. Similarly going to core what

kind of a changes do you envisage uh when you implement AI especially with respect to core chairperson spoke about the benefits that are already acrewing uh for the network management when the

network management is uh getting into the AI is getting into the network uh management. Another thing I would uh also request you to dwell on is that ultimately the AI is going to come on

the handsets. So once uh AI is going to come in the on the handsets what kind of a challenge it'll throw to the networks. Another important aspect is also raised by chairperson is the security

are are we going to be challenged by the AI being used for attacking the networks and what kind of a steps we intend to take. Another one thing with the AIS it is compute intensive.

So the sustainability as also is listed is going to be important. So it will be important to know what kind of a steps the OEMs are envisaging to take care of the sustainability part of it. You we

all are uh uh kind of signaries to the or the countries are signaries to the uh sustainable development goals of the UN. So this aspect also is very important. Now without um uh taking too much time

uh I will everybody wants to listen from the experts here. I will first like to invite uh Mr. Magnus Everbring from Ericson to kindly share his thoughts. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much. It's a great

pleasure to be here now. bottom of my heart I'm very impressed by this event and the messages we've heard and I think we just heard at the onset of this very much central message

to leverage AI fully for ordinary people consumers for industries for enterprise and government functions it needs to use compute resources and

that we often attribute to the data centers and indeed they will be there but also we need to connect them and here I think India comes out h being very much in the pole position

having a well over 90% population coverage I've heard numbers even up to 99% population coverage for 5G today and not only that but truly wellperforming networks

that is a fundamental platform form to drive innovation on and to drive innovation on together with AI and looking then for the next five years to come that indeed is what what we will

see and the nations that in a few years time end of this decade are at the leading edge with the best of what 5G can do connecting their data centers with the AI applications s in devices

will be at the cutting edge and will have an advantage and they are the ones having the least step into 6G and again I think India is just in a supreme pole position to be there

the networks already today use AI they use that to a large degree but still I argue it's only the beginning We use it as the systems are being configured becoming more and more

autonomous. goal in the industry still a good challenge but reachable is to le to reach what we call level four in TM forum by 2028 many mobile operators

aspire to be there and that's beautiful that's very good but it is a big undertaking AI is being part to reach that level taking the next step

I argue is what we really do with 6G achieve that's to reach level five and be fully autonomous to cut the rope, cut the ties a bit and let it run.

And that we have in mind now as we gradually set the standard for 6G. 6 shall be AI native and that will then being a baseline for bringing on the knowledge we've gained in 5G and then to

take the next step with 6G. Lastly then networks for AI AI on the application side and here I argue it's important to go societywide. India is building its digital stack in

an impressive way. Leverage AI in that industries come in develop applications on top of it will drive efficiency locally and also will be export possibilities.

So leverage the 5G systems with AI and cloud and then drive the way into 6G. Thank you. [applause] So thank you Mr. Magnus.

I would now like to invite Mr. Please. Hi um good afternoon everyone. It's really exciting to be here um talking in

front of a full crowd I would suppose uh on the concepts of AI. Um I would say my uh journey started in AI give or take about uh 20 years ago and um quite recently till 6 months ago um is when my

65year-old mom realized that I work in the space of AI. So I guess uh there's been a lot of progress. &gt;&gt; Oh can you guys hear me okay now? Oh perfect. Okay. Um I think in the space

of AI India has definitely progressed quite a lot significantly. Um and um historically when you look at the AI space u it's always been on the cloud and uh driving inference towards a large

population of people on you know different kind of consumer or enterprise uh based applications. We at Qualcomm have been trying to really democratize AI and then try to see if you can

translate AI to resident to be resident on devices. These devices could be personal devices like phones, could be your laptop, could be your smartwatches, your smart glasses, anything to be that

you can think of. Uh but doing that kind of AI inference on the edge is not easy and especially when you want to go towards more a personalized inference. You know, I always joke with my

colleagues that AI historically lacks common sense. uh and how do you really translate that to something that's meaningful to the user needs a lot of investment um and in India you know

we're seeing this significantly change we're seeing a lot of u you know players putting a lot of um uh focus and how do we you know get it attached to the user and make more an important connection

that drives a lot of these experiences now at the same time it's also very critical of how do we look at coexistence between what runs in the cloud and what runs on the edge is what

we call is the concept of hybrid AI. Hybrid AI uh you know working with our network operators is also not an easy concept. Uh it's always been a challenge to understand you know which of these

experiences would be transition towards the cloud. How do you make that decisions and what runs on the edge? Um I think you know there's a lot of research activity happening in this

space and India is definitely leading in this front and I totally expect in the next couple of you know months we would see a strong transition wherein there's a you know fundamental element of hybrid

wherein you can have both edge and cloud coexist. And uh last but not the least is as you're trying to reach towards a large population base you know it's also very

critical on making sure governance explanability u and safety is paramount. Um and u you know as prime minister Modi has been you know quitly insistent the last couple of

days on making sure there's a critical asset as we trying to you know drive towards India AI at Qualcomm we driving a lot of these initiatives to really make sure that we can go accomplish that

with that uh thank you for the opportunity and um you know welcome for the audience [applause] &gt;&gt; thank you uh Mr. Sukumar uh I would like to invite Mr. passive from No.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Namaste. My sincere thanks for the opportunity to be here. It's exciting. It's exciting for a sake

of this AI summit but it's also very personal for me. I have been coming to beautiful country of India since 1999 and it has been fascinating to see this country evolving all these years over

these years in different locations. We were talking earlier today already in how many places I have been experiencing this uh evolution and development. It's it's

fascinating. So thanks for the opportunity to be here. It's it's very important. I don't know what to add after such a wonderful uh keynote by the chairman

after the other opening talks. I think it is obvious that AI will also impact telecommunication networks, the network evolution, the business models, the innovation, everything around it. So

instead of going deeper in the technology discussion because they were very well covered by the previous panelists industry leaders, I would focus this couple of minutes for

how not what but how. How to capture the best of AI era. And for me it comes around who is able to build the most valuerrich, most welcoming, most compelling

ecosystems. who is able to gather likeminded technology players, regulator uh government agencies to think together the opportunity,

the risks, the challenges, that whole 360 of AI. I don't believe that any player even though they would be the smartest people on the planet are able to fully

capture the 360 by playing alone ecosystem. It is how you are able to proactively define the overall value of this AI evolution and then transparently and proactively

agree how that value is distributed, how that value is maximized within that It might sound ideological. It might sound a little bit naive. But I'm a firm believer that it is key for

success. It's a key to capture and deliver all the opportunities within this AI era. It is the only way to address the security risks which are now going to be different than any time

earlier. I mean we are coming to have different access network. We are coming to have richer number of applications. Applications which are transferring more data which increased amount of data is

contributing for the security risks. We have to address that topic together end to end and let's do it. India can show the direction for whole world. There is a tradition for great collaboration

great innovation. So let's do it. Thank you. Thank you so much Mr. Pasi. Uh I would I now like to invite Mr. Shantaram from Tjas.

Hi good afternoon everyone. Am I audible? &gt;&gt; Not audible now it's okay. All right. So um my colleagues and my boss warned me that you know if you're coming number

four then you may not have much to say so think of something different um so there are few things uh you know

being from here born brought up everything in India making stuff for India so I'll try to I'll try to anchor my few comments in terms of what we want to do here.

I think the fundamental problem that uh I don't know if you happen to read this book by sir CK Praad where he talked about the economy at the bottom of the pyramid. So we uh carry with us a

responsibility of solving problems for the bottom of the pyramid primarily and Indian telecom especially has that additional responsibility of making sure that you know that access is provided to

and at a very low cost it is provided to pretty much everybody in the country. Now in this context if you want to accelerate the adoption of AI I'll leave you with a framework of

thought this is what I use to basically figure out you know what it takes. So you can either be looking at cost or you can be looking at revenue or both. So when telecom operators have to figure

out what are they going to invest in then these are the sort of the two guidelines or markers that they can use when it comes to cost it is optimization of either the capex or optimization of

opex in a simplistic sense opex would be operational efficiency there's a lot of literature which is available and my friends from you know the global OEMs are far ahead in implementation of some

of these. Uh we in India are chasing it as well. In terms of the hardware, it leaves you with again two choices for architecture. Do you find a way to completely do a AI

first AI native architecture or should we find a path that has a bolt-on capability because you know you have equipment that's already in the field and there

are a lot of investments that we are making you know very fresh unlike some of the more mature networks in the west where the capital cycle has already gone through you know 4G 5G and it's it's

paid off over 5 10 years already but in India we have made fresh investments even as early as last year now that kind of equipment if it has to be leveraged for the next 10 years how do you deliver

AI that is one challenge that we'll have to solve so there will be a choice you know do you do AI first or do you do a bolt-on if you're looking at the revenue side of

the equation again In simplistic sense, there are two sort of big buckets. There is a product enhancement where the telecom network itself is

enhanced in terms of efficiency. There's a lot of work happening in 3GPP uh bhat 6G alliance. A lot of thought is going in in terms of how do you make how do you bring in efficiency into the

product essentially optimizing the cost per bit so to speak and doing it in a way that is a lot smarter than what we did before and on the other side you have a

possibility of generating revenue by providing AI through the telecom network which Pari also kind of referred So that I see as a possibility of a

two-way business model which is you know an opportunity that's available where on one side you have all the users you have you know communities you have people you know in our villages the farmers etc who

are all on one side of it and on the other side you have startups companies that are building models companies that are building specific agentic applications s and in between you have

the telecom player and there's a possibility if we do the frameworks right and what do I mean by frameworks the very top thing in terms of framework is trust there has to be

trust there has to be some amount of regulation there has to be some amount of safety that comes with regulation and allow people to dynamically upload and you know it's like a app store model

So the telecom network essentially becomes a platform where simple models, easy models can be actually uploaded and made accessible to all the users of the telecom network. Doesn't have to be only

the bottom of the pyramid but of course the bottom and all the layers above. So I leave you with this thought and uh look forward to more discussion. &gt;&gt; So thank you so much Mr. Shantaram for

sharing your thoughts. Now the for the next uh a few minutes uh I will first uh have a round of questions uh with the panel here and then we'll throw the uh session open for questions from the

floor. So uh Mr. Magnus the first question is that we are talking of uh optimization with the AI but we always used to say that 4G 5G networks are self sonn the

concept of son was already there self optimization networks so what does AI fundamentally change now &gt;&gt; okay thank you well it's always a journey right we um for every move we

make we learn we get more insights and then we take that and move further on. So in that sense although we've done more and more autonomous parts of the systems in the past it doesn't say we

can do more in the future and we should do more of course now with AI we get a very powerful tool to to analyze a lot of data and to apply that knowledge onto a set of in the system some algorithms

and we've had some fantastic fantastic um observations there. Um one was just the in a very part that's been optimized for decades on how we do the link adaptation, how we control the

communication between the system and the device. We managed to optimize the capacity by 10%. So imagine a warding spectrum of 100 megahertz. Then you had the equivalent

of 110 megahertz by applying this optimized algorithm and that's the cutting edge of what we can do today. I'm sure we can do improvements tomorrow also on that. How

much I don't dare to state in energy efficiency has been discussed there also we in another part of the system applied AI analysis and make that part of the ongoing processing and energy

efficiency was optimized by 33% for that part and that's a enormous savings applying that on a pan India network of course so Again it is about to wherever you are how far you've been

continue to do research you understand the future potential and then step by step apply that with the knowledge that you have derived and you will continue to take

steps and climb the ladder. &gt;&gt; Thank you. So next question to you Mr. Sukumar. So in the telecom hardware and software space which decisions should be pushed to the edge and what decisions

should be at the centralized level &gt;&gt; u it's a great question by the way am I audible just want to make sure okay perfect I think it's um it's really going to come down to um elements of key

performance indicators I would suppose is um if you're looking at areas where you want to focus more on uh data privacy, user privacy, better responsiveness, better data management,

uh a predictable um end to-end performance to a large extent that's going to be happening on the edge. And this could you know look at experiences on u um you know around data plane loops

L1 L2 um user kernel space operations anything to do with PII information on user privacy all that would be edge resident um and as you go more towards cloud um I

would say the emphasis is going to be a lot more around fleet management anything to do with AI ML training as such There's a concept which historically on

the ML land was called MLOps. uh from you know from training data all the way to uh inferencing and monitoring we need to get towards elements of what we call as net ops which looks at if there is um

areas there things are you know breaking because of drift how do we go fix that uh that's where I think you know cloud definitely helps now at the same time it's not very binary equation which is

one is edge one is cloud uh there's also concepts of hybrid wherein it's going to be coexistence as I mentioning before my talk is you have to find ways how edge can complement the cloud. Um and uh it

could be elements of personalization where you want to drive towards the edge and you want to go towards more complex scenarios then you position towards the cloud. Hybrid is in a very early stage

to a large extent these days routers are very static in nature meaning those uh workloads and experiences are predefined saying XYZ runs on the edge you know and ABC runs on the cloud. But the the most

difficult challenge has been is how do these routers can be intelligent enough when you happen to have a multi-turn conversation at some point of time positioned towards the club. I think

that is something of a huge research topic and I'm hoping you know next couple of months we'll see some interesting results. &gt;&gt; Thank you. So the next question for you

Mr. Pi. So uh I'm sure a lot of development is already taking with the telecom u uh OEMs. Now what are the decisions which are taken offnet? What kind of a decisions do you

expect will be taken offnet and what are the decisions during the operation of the network while using AI you think you would be taking?

Wow. And we have only this four minutes. We have 12 minutes and 50 seconds. &gt;&gt; Okay. Okay. But on a serious note, I think jury is still out for this one. So

how we are able to and again going back to my earlier comment how we holistically address the topic how we go through the overall value and that ecosystem and

related functionality I believe more will be done by the network itself when we design it correctly it's able to do many of the security vulnerability assessments by

itself self it's alerting upstream is it going to the edge or further let's see but I I think it needs to be very intense dialogue between the network and edge

more decisions are traveling further to the regional data centers more we are contributing to inefficiency and and hence also the complexity so I would I my planning assumption is that I would

push as much of the optimization automation to the network itself and and then the limited cases to edge and less and less to the actual regional data center to put it short.

Thank you for that. Uh [snorts] Mr. Shantam let me uh come to the ethical part of it. So let's say uh a base station serves a urban area and also part of a it serves the rural area. So

how can we make sure that with the AI at the uh background the customer in a rural area is not deprived of the bandwidth uh visav with respect to the urban area. So what kind of a steps uh

do you I'm sure uh you will be looking at those things that the bandwidth is not constrained to a area or to a subscribe set of subscribers but what do you what are your thoughts how can we

check these things in a network okay so um in just the easy answer is to buy more equipment

But uh uh but that's a great question. Uh it has always been you know this question has been live for many you know almost decades. I know we went through a case

where you know we had net neutrality and that those debates also happening. So uh it's not different from those types of debates. I think um

while we look at access to AI, there is access to the central AI right which has to go through a back hole capacity and so on and obviously there one has to create different types of

network slices for different types of use cases and today's technology at least the way that we administer networks it is quite possible to do that uh and it is possible to do that with

single clicks and with AI and us bringing in operational AI it is you know it can even do it more efficiently without you having to think too much. You can just say that you know I need to

create this kind of a bandwidth for this type of an application and the network management you know the assisted network management can actually go and do that for you.

Now uh this coupled with having a lot of edge access for AI. So you know I'll give I'll share an example. Um in the US they recently launched uh an application where the telecom network can actually

sense your voice uh metrics and identify you through that. So imagine that kind of an application here in India where you know your

identity etc can actually be verified by the telecom operator not just by your number or by a digital information but by analog information that you are actually communicating and these types

of applications can actually be launched on the edge of the network. So short answer step one try to have a lot of edge AI

and step two use lot more sophisticated network management capability to clearly separate out different types of use cases. Uh well thank you so much. We can have

uh though the I and note that the time is up but still we can have one or two quick questions. Uh yes Mr. somebody can [snorts] respected panelists. It was a wonderful

discussion but as I will try to keep myself short as I was hearing all that we are having around 118 crores of mobile connections in India built up over a huge network of say fiber and

wireless and uh le circuits and everything and once we are trying to introduce AI in that as we know it's not AI native we have to build up in the form of external like apps and all and

any single minute of uh disruption causes a huge resentment and a loss of the you know all the time and this thing resources. So how do we invisage to actually progress from this 118 crores

and we want to feed through the AI what is the vision in front of us that we can really carry forward from here. I will from any of the panelists. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Perhaps I can start. Uh thanks for it is

a wonderful question and sorry if I sound like a broken record but without thinking the network evol evolution end to end you are not able to address it. So it comes to this ecosystem of players

that you are able to model what the change is introducing to the network and optimize the network end to end. I I think it is the only way otherwise you are going to put patch fixes here and

there based on certain application behaviors and you are not able to evolve the whole network. &gt;&gt; You would like to also substitute &gt;&gt; yes please. Um

so I think so essentially what you're saying is that it's a journey uh and um like how do we sort of chart out that journey um there are two three thoughts on this

I think one is that uh that today we our telecom networks are mostly catering to human users. Of course there are enterprises etc. uh 3 four years 5 years down the road I

do expect AI users to be starting to dominate. So the business model and the regulation has to support that kind of an evolution. I think that is that is step

one. We need to sort of think through what is you know how do we handle so today we have 118 crores mobile phones 5 years from now we might actually have 500 crores of AI agents

uh which are doing various things but they're still communicating either with each other or with central data repositories and so on and we need to basically figure out how do you charge
