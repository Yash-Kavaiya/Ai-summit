## 📝 Transcript

How's the for you? &gt;&gt; It's been good. &gt;&gt; Most folks are here. Yeah, just staying up for this.

I can't easily So, Okay. &gt;&gt; All right. We'll do it that way. &gt;&gt; Hello everyone. Uh my name is Oh, sorry.

We've got a photographer here now. So, we're going to take our photo. False start. Sorry. Bear with us. Well, now that now that we've got the most important thing out of the way,

we'll get started. Uh, hello everyone. My my name is John Tass Parker. I lead policy partnerships at JP Morgan Chase. uh and just wanted to firstly thank everyone for being here uh to uh for

this very important conversation. Um when people talk about AI, the conversation tends to focus on model breakthroughs, speed, capability, but in finance, which our wonderful panelists

here represent, that's never been the real question. We're really moving from this era of frontier AI in our world certainly to an era of institutional AI. And in this phase, the hard problem is

not actually the capability itself. It's legitimacy and trust. Financial services is one of the most regulated sectors in the global economy

and yet it's consistently been one of the earliest adopters of AI and all technologies. Why? Because in finance, trust is not a feature. It's actually the business model.

Institutions only absorb systems they trust. The seauite can only scale what their boards can govern. Regulators can only enable what they can supervise. And increasingly, those that can demonstrate

reliability, auditability, resilience, not just model performance will be the ones that are rewarded. The more important story is coming into focus in rooms like this. It's the

infrastructure enabling institutional AI, model risk management, oversight, explanability, cyber security, regulatory engagement. Finance has h has had to learn how to

deploy these incredibly powerful systems inside real world guard rails. And that's why conversations matters beyond and and that's why this conversation frankly not only matters for our

financial and banking sectors but also beyond that. If we want AI to drive productivity for small business, for farmers, for teachers, for local government, for state government, for

international across the global south, then trusted deployment is what unlocks it. Capability is increasingly being commoditized. It's the legitimacy that is the scarce attribute here.

Today's discussion is about how we build systems that institutions will actually absorb and how finance can help shape a framework for responsible, scalable adoption. With that, I'm delighted to

hand it over to Barat uh to set the broader context for how we think about safe and trusted AI globally. &gt;&gt; Thank you uh John. It is my uh honor to moderate this discussion with a truly

distinguished panel. Uh so without further uh ado let me just jump straight into it. Uh capitalizing the artificial intelligence moment for finance. Uh the financial sector as we all know is one

of the most regulated sectors in our country in India and in most parts of the globe. Uh so I think it's appropriate to turn to the regulator from India Mr. Suvendu Party from RBI

who's to my right. Uh so Wendu g the the financial sector has been one of the earliest adapters of AI despite being one of the most regulated sectors as I mentioned given this dichotomy how is

India approaching AI regulation in finance. &gt;&gt; Yeah thank you Vat and thank you everyone for having me here. Uh I would begin by saying uh we are not

exactly the phrasing I would entirely agree with uh that regulating AI but I would say that uh we are here to sort of uh enable responsible adoption of AI in the financial sector. uh that would be

the overall approach uh to this uh technology I would say what Reserve Bank of India you know understands and why I would say that uh it is clearly we recognizing the you know

potential of this new technology uh although it's not very new in that sense but it has really come to a limelight over the past five years uh and uh that's because uh you know

data is one of the key ingredients which it thrives on and we had constituted an external expert committee of which I was a member uh to look at this sector and look at the this technology how it can

be embedded into the financial services segment. So our approach uh when we looked at uh you know we wanted to be a slightly more nudging towards enabling innovation in

some sense and unless we play around with this technology experiment enough you would not ever utilize the full potential of it. So uh so the basically it is concentrated towards you know uh

innovation enablement as well as risk mitigation. The risks that has been talked about bias, accountability, auditability, explanability these are pretty wellnown and this needs to be

managed in a way so that we ultimately we come out with the the principles of enhancing trust which was also a you know fundamental attribute of the financial sector.

And in terms of regulation, a reserve bank's approach has been largely techneutral. It's uh tech agnostic in some sense because most of the times you would you know new technologies, new

things should keep evolving. But uh the for example the safety or the consumer protection not doing consumer harm is a good stated objective to pursue irrespective of what technology you

adopt. Similarly on uh IT services outsourcing guidelines on you know managing concentration risk there are already existing guidelines which do provide the guidance to the uh you know

regulated entities like banks and NBFCs how do they manage their affairs. Uh so in some sense uh the consumer protection guidelines also do cover some of these safety aspects that we would generally

talk about. So in a in a uh some sense there is a regulation which is in place there is guidance which is already in place. It's only that because of this transformational technology if there is

a need to look at it from a new technology lens any additional guidance that needs to be incremental uh guidance that needs to be provided and that's a precise point we have come out with as a

uh uh in this report and one of the things that we expect uh institutions to go forward is with the entire life cycle management of AI should be and uh thought process

uh the the institutions need to look at the liability and accountability framework in a much different way. Uh our expectation is that customers needs to be protected at in all cases. So it's

not a question it's about the model deployed by the entities rather than the model developers. The responsibility should rest with the model deployers and which are the regulated entities in this

case. And therefore uh there are three or four additional dimensions which need to be looked at in terms of supervision in terms of the internal audit assurance framework. How do you audit or how do

you validate your uh improve your product product approval process to capture the uh additional incremental risks on account of AI. So these are some of the additional things that we

are looking at to provide some nudge and one principle that we had you know come out with in the report. There are seven principles or sutras that the report talks about uh and these have been

adopted. I'm happy to report that these have been adopted by the government of India for uh you know implementation across sectors. So these are generic principles and they have found

acceptance. Uh so one of the principles that we have talked about there is innovation versus restraint. Everything else remaining constant. Entity should prioritize innovation

rather than restraint you know. So that is a nudge that is an innovation enablement or a nudge that we are trying to give to the sector. They should feel comfortable with this. So the uh our

whole approach is optimistic. We want people to experiment, adopt it responsibly h but think creatively in terms of uh liability framework, revisiting the accountability framework,

have a board governance uh policy in place and improve their internal systems and processes to give the comfort to not only their own set of employees but to other stakeholders about this new

technology. All said and done, this is a probabilistic technology. there are bound to be some mistakes here and there. So we need to have a very tolerant and differentiated approach

when we embed this into the financial services where people's money is involved. I will stop here but we'll talk something more later. Thank you so for that insight. U if I could now turn

towards the global view. Our employer JP Morgan Chase is one of the world's largest deployers of artificial intelligence. Um, Terara, in terms of trust, what are some of the most

impactful use cases trusted AI is being leveraged for in finance in your perview? &gt;&gt; Well, I don't think &gt;&gt; we joke that we shouldn't worry about AI

until we figure out AV. So, I guess this is a perfect example of that. Um, thanks for the question, Arat. I um I think maybe the first thing to say about this and this probably isn't news to this

room especially but AI has been used in finance in deployed settings for over a decade and at JP Morgan Chase we've been using it um spanning use cases across our bank uh you know starting first with

the era of analytic tools u moving into machine learning capabilities now in the direction of large language model deployment and sort of looking directionally towards the era of agentic

cap capabilities and beyond. Um and spanning all of those we you know I I think the most impactful use cases that we have seen um certainly in fraud and scams remediation um which is just a

huge priority for the entire sector um payments there's some really uh really exciting applications and in markets as well um and uh and honestly in compliance use cases for us too just

given the focus that we have on um ensuring that that we're being compliant with our regulatory requirements. I think I also I just want to pick up on a couple of things um that were previously

mentioned that I think are worth underscoring and um one of those points was the point that you made um Mr. PI about the um the one of the strengths of the financial sector regulatory approach

being the principlesbased technology neutral approach that our regulators have taken and I think it has allowed banks to experiment to a wide degree with the types of techniques that

I just talked about um while thinking about the proportionate risk of each one of those use cases um as as we are deploying. So I think that's been really key and I think the second point to

underscore that you had mentioned previously which I think was a really good one for us to address as well is that there are I think because of the strength of the financial sector's

approach to AI governance really um useful lessons that can be exported from this sector in considering questions of oversight and regulatory innovation to other sectors and I think that speaks to

the sutras that you mentioned being adopted more widely across the economy um in the RBI report that um that I think are really well aligned to wider consideration just beyond um you know

the banking sector specifically with respect to balancing innovation with um that kind of risk management and oversight that's really key to seeing scaled adoption in large enterprises

especially thank you Terra and I think now we move to the more important issue of putting putting money into this particular industry Ashoto is one of the leading

deployers uh of uh finance in the India's fintech ecosystem. Uh what makes AI so strategic in your view for the sector and what are some of the best practices you see being adopted uh by

fintexs to build particularly trusted AI? &gt;&gt; Super. Thank you so much u for having me here. Um I think over the last two three four days folks in this room have

probably attended 5 10 15 such sessions maybe more and I think if there's one takeaway that you have taken with you is that AI is going to change almost everything and so it will the financial

services sector and I think this is equally in fact more importantly applicable to India. India in a in a in a bigger measure than anywhere in the

world and the reason I would say is three-fold. The first is unit economics. Um let's take an example. Indian credit market is $2 trillion in value. We spend anywhere

from 3% to 5% on OPEX. So just on OPEX we invest 60 to hundred billion dollars a year. and what AI can do strategically to improving productivity and therefore making these businesses much more

healthy. It's only a beginning of of of of the of a journey we are taking. I think second second strategic point of strategic importance is risk. Um a large section of our economy in

India is unformalized. What I mean is that um in credit parlance it's called a thin file issue which is that for a large section of

society we don't have enough data points enough metrices to make the file thick enough for you to underwrite them. Now with AI because of um the the technologies ability to um use

unstructured data you can actually very quickly um and in a very cost effective ma way make that thin file thick file so again I think underwriting risk for a large section of society in India will

be possible now with this and I think the last not the last one of the one of the more important other points is reach Uh buying a financial product is not like

buying a shirt on Myntra or ordering food on Swiggy or ordering a sari on Misho. This this is a complex product. It needs engagement. The app or whatever platform

you're using asks you bunch of questions before you even decide. Today again for a large section of Indian society it's very hard to engage with that app it's complex now imagine a world tomorrow

where that where you can speak to that app and therefore now that enables reach of financial products financial services to again a very very large sectional size so I think it's it's extremely

extremely strategic from that standpoint as for best practices look we are too early I mean we we can only talk about practices rest or not only time will tell. So, so I mean look and look

because we are early and because of what sir said um this is this is a high impact transaction for anyone a financial services transaction um and and

therefore having a bot run a bank I think is not advisable. So one of the practices that good fintech companies are using is keeping a human in the loop. the technology can prepare a file

but in the end it's a human who kind of does that. The second thing is again is is data is while data is of primary importance in the in the AI world but this is a lot of sensitive data that you

as a fintech or financial services product provider you have that so ensuring at all times that you are following the DPDB guard rails I think is again something which is this is just

a start will evolve uh but I think these two are interesting things &gt;&gt; thank you Asho to turning now to the person who's actually deploying the money uh which is which is herself uh

that's the pointy edge. Uh do you really believe that this is AI's big moment in in finance? I gather at Razer Pay you are rolling out AI based payment solution models. How do you think this

will transform the the payments landscape? See first of all uh just from a back end usage right like uh like my colleague spoke about I think finance typically

deals with large volumes of data and large volumes of data it's generally harder for humans to really screw through. So we've always has to use machines and software to run through it.

AI makes that job much much easier. So I think anywhere where large volumes of data has to be interpreted, inferences to be drawn, I think you need systems to do that and AI is a system that allows

you to do it at far more data points than it was possible in older systems like you can you can see you can do as much analysis on Excel sheets or at best software but with AI you can do

thousandx more. So I think just this advantage of that in things like underwriting in risk management in identifying fraud in multiple things that finance uh ecosystem has to do

becomes increasingly important. So I think that's why finance has been one of the earliest adopters because it's just natural that the system is so much much better than the previous systems. Coming

to payments, I think one of the things that we've done is we like as we've taken a very early bet on agent eiccommerce and the reason is fairly simple that there are 300 to 400 million

Indian consumers who are on UPI today on digital payments today. Uh less than 200 million of those actually do shopping online but if you go peel it even further and this is based on data that

we see at Razer less than 10 million of those users do 70% of all commerce in India. Right? Just 10 million in a country of a billion and a half do 70% of all commerce uh online. And that's

because like he said the commerce systems that we have built so far are not natural to most people in India. So we built apps where all the access is available but while the access is there

accessibility is missing because like Indians don't buy stuff the way Americans do. So the way we have built our apps is how Americans shop that is like a supermarket. Everything is

available. You pick and choose yourself. Uh Indians shop on retailers where you go and talk. You say hey I want to buy this. It tells you that hey why don't you buy this and so on. We are

conversational in commerce and that's why the app ecosystem we have so far has only penetrated 10 million or maybe 15 million. The rest of India needs conversations like take example of

travel. Uh there OT is available everywhere. $50 billion of travel is purchased through agents on the ground because people want to talk before they make a booking. 95% of insurance in

India is sold through offline offline brokers. there's policy bazar and there's so much so many brokers available which will give you far cheaper which will not missell you

insurance people still trust their local insurance broker because Indians want to converse before they buy they want to ask 20 questions about what they're buying and that's hard to do in the apps

that we have so far and I think agentic commerce is that next wave which unlock the next form of commerce for the next billion people who've not really come in spite of all the apps being available

are not really shopping online we're not really consuming online they maybe think they're paying their bills online but that's it just because they don't want to stand in a line but everything else

they're still doing through offline channels and if we can bridge that gap through agility commerce which is voice first which is multilingual which is conversational I think we can unlock

commerce for a large volume of Indians who not come online properly today &gt;&gt; thank you Ariel uh I think the the the next angle which I'd like to touch upon is u elevating deployers as key

custodians of trust so wendu um the RBI has traditionally been ahead of the curve in comparison to some other sectors due to you know key initiatives which you've promulgated such as the

free AI committee and its uh very progressive policy recommendations. Uh if I may ask is there a distinction in your approach for regulating AI developers and deployers.

uh see under the uh remmit of the you know mandate given to the Reserve Bank of India the under the Reserve Bank of India act or the banking regulation act our remit is towards uh the we can

regulate only the uh regulated entities like the banks non-banking financial companies or fintex or uh so and so forth. So model developers would strictly fit into the uh IT or

technology companies. So in our remit uh uh or the official mandate that we have we really cannot uh sort of regulate or prescribe rules for them. So what we are looking at is uh from a

deployment point of view and uh so our regulations or our guidance I would refrain from using the word regulation in this sector but uh in this context but our guidance would be towards the uh

deployers which are the regulated entities and these as I would say are more uh already some are in place through various you know uh guidelines I have talked about IT outsourcing third

party dependencies and uh uh also on the customer engagement uh and things like that. So what we are looking at is uh how does the regulated entity uh be you know accountable

once once the regulated entity is providing a service to a customer. It is the complete responsibility of the entity to ensure the uh transparency, accountability, the way the customer

engages with a AI system or a service. So from uh you know if I may loosely put it from a typically black box is something which is associated with AI systems. You really do not know what

happens inside and the result is produced. But as far as the regulated entities dealing with the customers are concerned, we would like this to be a not a black box but a glass box. It's

completely should be customers should be knowing what they are getting. When they are engaging, they should be clearly told up front that they are engaging with an AI system. If they choose, they

should have the freedom to opt for a nonI based engagement and transparency. Similarly for the accountability the institutions should devise their uh audit systems to capture incremental

risks arising out of the AI. How does the bias get removed? Is there a model drift? Is there a model degradation? Does it get addressed periodically? So those kind of checks and balances

regulated entities need to put as part of their board policy and set the implementation and some things like understandability by design. You know the codes itself should ensure

implementation. These are some of the things we have talked about and we would over a period of time we would like that this you know gets addressed and gets refined and gets embedded and

implemented across their uh processes. Thank you. So gi uh Terra uh deployers are also you know fast emerging as key custodians of trust in the AI ecosystem. Uh and you know frankly it's the

responsibility to the global economy to get AI integration right for large financial services firms such as JP Morgan. So how is u how is JP Morgan positioning itself in this debate?

Well, I I think AI is not made useful unless it's deployed and it can't be deployed at scale without trust um and transparency. And so the way that we're thinking about these questions um really

rests on again the strengths of the sort of I think the culture of risk management and oversight that we have grown into in financial services and deploying technology of all sorts not

just AI but certainly AM more recently as I mentioned and um and and having there you know really be a sort of a use case focus on the risks entailed in every single one of our deployments. I

think a lot of the lessons that um can be learned in financial services risk management again are applicable widely to other sectors as we've talked a little bit about this afternoon um

including in sort of AI life cycle oversight and management in um model risk management guidelines and principles um in the principles and practices of real transparency and

auditability um that we've spoken to up here and um and and many many others. And so uh I I think what that allows is as we've spoken to banks and financial service organizations are sort of

uniquely positioned in many ways given the nature of the data estates that we sit on top of given the necessity of the business model um given customer de customer demand and market demand and a

host of other um issues that I I would say surround kind of the innovation envelope here. But I think the riskmanagement practices that we have um are a huge strength there too. So um so

yeah, I would I would say that that's all really key to engendering trust with customers and um and making sure that we're doing right uh by the products and services that we're delivering to them.

&gt;&gt; Can I just quickly supplement uh &gt;&gt; uh I would also you know add to that point that uh all all applications all services need not be classified as very high risk. You know there are certain

services which should be probably figure out figure in the low risk. So we need to I mean organizations as well as the supervisors and regulators need to have a very differentiated approach for

various levels of risks that this while high-risk applications for example you are underwriting you are making payments you are really taking a high value financial decision that should involve

ideally a human in the loop kind of a stuff. But if you are just providing a service like summarizing a document, providing what information they need to fill in while you know account opening

those kind of summarization effects may not be you know subjected to very very elaborate uh degree of scrutiny or risk uh testing or you know template uh those kind of processes. this is what I would

feel personally but yes uh &gt;&gt; and just to make this more of a conversation I'll add one additional point which is side. If you're a large company uh is

competing with a small let's say retailer and let's say they've opened a new supermarket opposite to them. It's hard for a small retailer to compete because they don't have the intelligence

available to the large uh supermarket in terms of what to put in, what things to deploy, how do you what marketing ideas to deploy and so on. But now you can really open a chat GBT app, ask it to

prepare a business plan for you, tell it how do you how do I fight this and it can really help you compete. So the advantage of having intelligence on demand really I think balances the scale

uh than what was available before because it reduces the cost of intelligence. A large company could always afford that intelligence but now it's available. uh similar examples will

be a available let's say it's a farmer on the ground who is unable to figure out like what which crop should he purchase this season right like they're and I met companies recently who are

essentially doing that that they're deploying AI models to be available to farmers on the ground that hey you can ask it it can tell you information that is generally not available to you uh so

I think that's that's on the general side of things now if you come to finance side of things one of the biggest problems in finance is misselling right uh like or fraud and

fraud like sir for example I have told my dad my dad is 70 years old and I've told that hey if you're making any expensive purchase decision just give me a call I don't know if you're getting

frauded if you're getting digital arrested I don't know if you're getting insurance sold which you don't need or a financial instrument you don't need but like AI allows me to put something

smarter than me in his own pocket right so he doesn't need to call me now he can open and I taught my dad how to use chat GBD now he opens it up and asks it in his voice that I'm going to buy this

should I buy this or should I not buy this I can imagine a year two year from Now all of us will have an AI agent who is essentially your assistant working with you. So when you're shopping

something, it's searching for the best prices online. When you're buying features. Is this a best product? Is something else the best product? It's doing a research on Reddit. It's doing a

research on Twitter telling you, hey, don't buy this, buy this. Or you are on this website which is miss which is clearly misselling, which is fraudulent. The price looks too good to be true, so

don't buy it from here. I think having that intelligence available to every person on demand is massive advantage. And I think the impact of it in society will be fairly fair fairly positive. I

think the I think the people are worried about frauds happening because of AI and I think that's true in the short term when the ecosystem is getting prepared but in longer term frauds and

missselling and all of that will go down significantly because everyone will have an intelligent agent who extremely smart and who can tell things far better than a human can. So I think that can really

bring down massive positive impact for the society. Just just in case hersel you ask your dad to be aware about hallucination. &gt;&gt; Thank you Arshel. Uh innovation and

commitment are key in any new technology as we all know. So Ashoto, what are some of the promising business models you are excited about in in fintech and with the AI space? Which ones do you see gaining

more traction in the global south? And in your view as an investor, do some key gaps still exist which are currently unressed and could benefit in in some way from an AI solution?

&gt;&gt; I'm always excited about interesting ideas for so like um now with that said I I think the the adoption is all across um all across the subsectors of financial

services. um in in subsectors where India has naturally been at the forefront of innovation and payments come to a mind right up is a is a very good example I think I think India is

leading the innovation wave even with the advent of AI right about the time when the Indian e-commerce platforms were getting embedded or connected with the large foundational models

About the same evening, Indian payments companies were launching products as Hershel said that could enable you to buy from within the models or even within the chat experience that you're

having in the commerce app Swiggy or Flipkart whatever you call it right. So, so within payments we are at the forefront talking generally I think the the most

use of AI I see today is in two areas. One is productivity. This is related to the the unit economics point that I made previously. I think that's happening but more importantly also in customer

experience and I'll give you two examples. Um in UPI we are now moving from this kind of OTP world to a biometric world u wherein you don't need to just using

your biometrics you can make a payment right in part that is enabled by AI and imagine how nice the customer experience now will be with this rather than waiting for something to come to you

in lending almost 60 to 70% of collection for the first 30 days is now moved to a AIEL agent. Us as humans we get irritated calling 20

people all day and by the end of the day the human agent is upset and and the customer is upset and the conversation is like it's the collection is not happening.

Whereas with an agent, the agent can be empathetic. Agent will call you, can remember this is the time when Ashtoh is free, let me call him. And so I I think I

think we are seeing a lot of kind of movement there in the customer experience um domain as well. Um as for gaps I think there's one thing that I feel um where India is slightly slightly

kind of behind is that the west has probably 50 60 years of customer data whereas in India UPI credit card all that is a new phenomena so for us to and there is no right

answer or there's no immediate answer to for us to get to levels of underwriting which are closer to what West may enable with AI that ability of uh or that that availability of multi-cyclical

deep data may be something we have a lot of data of hundreds of millions of customers but the depth of that is something that I think we need to consider as we build these models

&gt;&gt; well as the saying goes data is the new gold so you need to keep it with you as as much as possible and I think That's that's going to be something which is going to be challenging for a for a

country of a billion and 400 million. Uh so Wendu G you know are there any engagement pathways which RBI is using to engage and partner with the industry to promote AI adoption in in finance and

you know in the Indian startup ecosystem are there any specific initiatives you've seen to promote AI adoption that banking sector can support this diffusion?

Yeah, good point. And uh first of all, during uh the last couple of years uh we have had uh multiple engagements. In fact, we have a scheduled monthly engagement with FinTex

and that's titled as Finquery and Finteract. So these events uh do take place at very regular intervals and across cities and through a hybrid channel as well. and uh roughly about uh

you know 2,000 plus uh entities have engaged with us in the last one and a half years and specifically on AI we did a survey across uh uh more than uh close to 600 entities including banks and

NBFCs that was a dipic dipstick survey and deep engagement of about 1 hour each with around more than 75 entities to understand the their adoption and uh what areas they see the potential

implementation and what challenges they are witnessing. So there is a constant and after the report uh freei committee report has been released on our website in August we have had around three

rounds of uh consultations with various stakeholders including fintex to take their inputs on board so it's a continuous process it's a constant engagement and I would also like to draw

attention to the regulatory sandbox framework which has been put in place since 2019 and uh entities are welcome to partner with us and experiment ment under the regulatory sandbox whenever

they require any regulatory dispensation or a regulatory relaxation. Uh and as articulated in our recommendations, we are one of the key constraints that we see especially the

smaller fintexs uh is the lack of uh access to the uh affordable compute infra as well as the lack of access to data based on which they can you know innovate and build models. So this is on

top of our mind that we are uh sort of committed to design and operationalize what we would call that a AI sandbox. Uh that's not exactly a regulatory sandbox but it'll have access to the data and

compute and sort of with the overall aim to democratize AI across you know smaller institutions. A bank like JP Morgan or State Bank or HDFC may have their enough data

bandwidth and resources to build their models. But what about the smaller fintexs and other entities? So with that vision, we would be operationalizing the AI sandbox which would uh engage you

know put these people have access to those resources to innovate and on top of that we ourselves are you know building models like mule hunter.ai AI which is already implemented across 26

banks and it's you know getting implemented across other uh entities as well. uh and that this engagement is uh it's a continuous process and we would like them to you know partner with us

submit proposals and work with us and we also expect the industry bodies like the self-regulatory organizations uh which has already been rec one has been recognized they have to come up with uh

we expect that they need to come up with the toolkits or benchmarking services which the AI you know uh the models can sort of test themselves and see that whether they uh you know bias free and

they meet the expectation and transparency standards. So it has to we expect that fintech industry itself uh comes up with those kind of standards and the benchmarks and toolkits which

would support the innovation. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Um as we all know regulatory engagement is critical to promoting innovation. So Hershel for a company such as yours, what are the key

regulatory challenges uh you are facing in the deployment of AI in finance and and how does your engagement with government and regulatory bodies actually address these and do you find

any public private partnership model which could be helpful in taking the industry to the next level? &gt;&gt; See I think the core aspects of regulation as s said I generally don't

go into technology or which technology to use. I think there are general principles of regulation and then you can use any technology to apply the same principles. I think in most cases we've

been fairly successful in deploying AI models and while meeting the requirements of regulators I think the few areas where it sometimes comes to challenge is I think uh we have very

strong data residency requirement in India which is rightly so and a lot of AI models are coming from the west which don't meet the data residency requirements today for India. So I think

in that context having and the open source models are all coming from China which makes it harder to require. So I think we don't have the right like we don't have enough deployment of the

cutting edge models in India data centers today and I think that sometimes delays deployments because we can't really use them uh as a regulated company. Uh I think the good part is I

mean there are three language models that were announced in the AI summit today which are uh from India. So I think that can be a good way for at least financial companies in India who

want to deploy models within India data centers and within Indian boundaries. I think they can at least those models are available and that can be a starting point and then we are hoping that the

global companies will bring some of those the cutting edge models to India data centers as well. So they can be deployed I think that's that's a one challenge but just on the infrastructure

itself that the cutting edge model infrastructure is not available. So we can use it for coding, we can use it for multiple internal purposes, but we can't really use it for anything that touches

customer data, anything that touches PI, we can't use those models till they're deployed in India data centers and uh hopefully that is going to change. The second aspect is like related to it is

there like as a financial company as she said I think the biggest challenge for you is controlling where the data goes and where it flows out. I think AI models as uh somebody said earlier that

it's it's a black box. Once the data enters you don't know where it comes out and when and I think drawing clear boundaries on that is hard. So uh that is one big challenge just with LLMs but

there are other forms of AI where that works fine because there are other forms of AI models or specific targeted models that you can apply where those guardrails are available. Just LLMs

don't have guardrails in terms of where data goes in and where it comes out. And the last problem is hallucinations. Anything to do with financial data, trust is very very critical. So I like

I'm okay if the system fails 10% of the time, but it should not be wrong 10% of the time. So it's okay if the system says, "Yeah, I can't do this analysis." But if it gives the wrong analysis and

you use it as a source of truth and you act on it and then you deliver that information to the customer and you say a payment is successful but actually isn't, uh, even if it happens 1% of the

time, it creates a massive issue for you. So I think that's the third piece and I think it's less to do with regulation. It's just how the what is expected of financial uh players that

you can't be you can't be saying something that is not true and LM's model by default can say things which are not true and even if it happens in 1% of 2% of cases it can become a

massive liability risk for financial companies. So I think those are the three big aspects and I think the solutions available to the some of those. The first one is fairly easily

solvable and global companies will probably solve it or Indian sovereign models that get there. The second is partly solvable because you can put guard rails around and use the right

kind of AI models that where that is possible. The third is a fundamental problem of how LM models LM models work. So I think that that part is going to be harder to solve. Yes, there are newer

models which hallucinate less but as I said even if is less less than.1% I still can't deploy an LLM model till I'm certain about it and I think that part will require us to either use alternate

means or wait for L models that can solve that boundary to um you know because you're looking at investing companies across the spectrum not necessarily only in finance but in

other areas which are using artificial intelligence in your view what are some of the key regulatory gaps uh highlighted by your investing companies in the fintech sector

And going forward, what progressive regulatory measures can the government consider to promote this more smoothly? &gt;&gt; I I think RBI has in general been a very kind of progressive uh not regulator but

guider in this in this in this situation. Um the seven sutras have been really helpful for people to understand at least what the direction of travel is. Um and also I think the the one um

one acceptance we need to make is that just the way we all are learning about AI its use cases etc etc the regulators also learning and things are changing fast and therefore I think the end

situation of what the regulation looks like may be very different. I have a I have a slightly different sort of ask policy ask to to adding to what Hersel was saying. Uh I I think compute for my

companies is a bigger problem than regulation. Um and researchers for my companies I don't think we can solve this by the way. I mean like through regulation of policy but I I I think you

were asking what do companies struggle with? I think those two things are are are bigger problems at this time. Thanks. Uh I I'm conscious of the time and u you know I would use my

moderator's prerogative to ask one final round of questions I think to all our uh distinguished panelists. What is one big bet you would like to take on how AI will transform finance in the next five

years? We start with Suji. &gt;&gt; Okay. Uh I know the really time is up but yes it's not a it's not a bet it's a wish list rather uh already I'm glad that Ashotosh has already covered some

of that in very very elaborate way one thing I would like to see is that how AI can bring about substantive improvement in financial inclusion you know bringing people to formal institutional credit

which uh through alternate uh data analytics and bringing uh new underwriting models how we can bring them uh on board and uh it'll be a big unlock for a country like India. Second

aspect I would like to emphasize is which already hersil has also touched upon is we all our fintech apps or everything are now designed for very very digitally savvy people. How do we

use AI to bring language, voice-based banking, conversational banking, payments? I don't have to fill a form. I just need to instruct and that translates. So, uneducated but literate

or sort of uh logical-minded people who are using WhatsApp uh voice and all that to transmit messages. They should be able to you know come on board and using AI uh come to the financial fold. uh we

should focus more research on assistive technologies for example a disabled person person who can't see can't hear how do we use AI to bring them or provide uh make them access financial

services in a more efficient manner these are the areas where this technology is going to play a role and we would like to see this uh you know getting to that point where it really

bridges this otherwise so-called digital divide which is you the risk is widening. We should bring it back to that and AI can prove a you know point and uh there I would say very very very

optimistic about this but a lot of work needs to be done in this areas. &gt;&gt; Thank you Harel. &gt;&gt; Yeah I I completely agree. I think the uh the ability to bring the cost of

servicing down significantly so that like you can deliver personalization with the N of one like with a at an individual level I think can have varied impacts right from like so I said

typically in India for example when HNI's open a bank account you don't fill a form a guy comes to you fills the form for you just ask for your five documents and asks you for a signature and it's

done like but the actually the what who needs this most is the villager on the ground because he really can't fill a form But he's asked to stand in line, fill a form. AI can allow us to deliver

that experience to the villager on the ground. And I think that is going to be the one biggest change that finance can do is allowed the cost of servicing to come down drastically, personalization

to happen at a individual level and then voice based interactions to drive and as somebody said earlier like that's what's natural to us. That's what's natural to Indians that if we can make it all voice

based. &gt;&gt; Harsh to &gt;&gt; I think AI8 financial services leading us to Vixit Bharat would be my bet.

&gt;&gt; Uh I think that's an aspiration for all of us and we uh Terra there's a lady on the on the panel the last word is yours. &gt;&gt; I would underscore all the answers already provided. I think the financial

inclusion potential the accessibility potential here is massive. Imagine a world in which um we can not just expand the credit envelope but put a financial adviser in every single person's pocket

um that normally only the wealthiest in society today are able to afford. So I really I look forward to that world being materialized. &gt;&gt; And the last word if I may slip it

language. India is a country with diverse languages. We can leverage on you know our language AI to play on the language. Well, I'd like to thank our distinguished panel for a truly

enlightening discussion and I think um the the topic was supercharging AI adoption in the global south and I think many of the thoughts of this panel would go a very long way in achieving that

goal. Thank you very much once again. &gt;&gt; Thank you.
