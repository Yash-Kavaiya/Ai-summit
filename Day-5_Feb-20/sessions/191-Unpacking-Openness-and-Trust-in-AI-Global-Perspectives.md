## 📝 Summary

This high-level panel explores a central tension in AI governance: openness can enable collaboration, innovation, and trust, yet may be constrained by commercial, state, and security considerations. The session examines how openness can function across the AI stack - compute, data, models, APIs, and applications and how to prevent misleading claims of openness. The panel also aims to highlight meaningful openness for emerging economies, balancing innovation, intellectual property, and national security.
