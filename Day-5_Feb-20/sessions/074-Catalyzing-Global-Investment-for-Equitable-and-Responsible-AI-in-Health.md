## 📝 Transcript

was useful. We've confused sh at the end. So, think about this. You've done all your hard work. You've made your notes. You've written your

prescription. You've answered the patient. And now you press AI assist. No thank you. All they did was to move the AI assist button earlier on and give the user the

option to use it whenever it made sense to that user and the results changed. The third level is to what extent is the improvement actually going to yield an improvement in health outcomes. The

reason we're all here is what's fundamentally going to shift? Is this going to help us get diagnose TB better or help with adherence in diabetes uh etc. So these

are some of the fundamental questions and I think we've got caught up with investment at levels one and two. Let's just check how this model works. Let's just check the product and having

thought through and given enough investment into how this gets integrated into the workflow. Um and then ultimately, you know, how how does this shift outcomes o over time? I think um

Elaine, can I take one more minute and talk about verified AI? Should I come back to this? &gt;&gt; I was thinking to myself and probably a bad analogy, but I'm going to put it out

there anyway because I'm flying this this this evening. Um that's why I didn't want to use it. But if I said to you all,

would you fly if the the likelihood of the flight arriving safely was 95%. Why fly? You fly. If it was 95%

&gt;&gt; if it was your if it was 96 97 or 98 would you fly? No. Even if it was 99 just think for a second if it was 99%. That means every 100th flight taking off

from Delhi airport would crash. Who would fly? I think we're all right or we'll take some other means of transport. And the reason I'm emphasizing this is that when

it comes to healthcare, the bar should be 0% risk of failure, 0% risk of error. And so Elaine and many other partners we starting to have this discussion with is

how do you get AI to be verifiable so that you know that whatever the input is you can document that it's transparent and we spoke about this which is can we shift the narrative from

black box to glass box &gt;&gt; can we really know why did the model make a particular decision we gave it x input the patient had these criteria.

Here's the logic model and it gave that particular output. But when it gives that output, can we put some safeguards in place that makes 100% sure that it isn't prescribing something the

patient's allergic to or that's going to end up in a catastrophic event or that's fundamentally flawed in its logic. And that's where we'd like to, you know, invite partners to work with us on a a a

pathway to verified AI. &gt;&gt; Thank you. And I can see Justice Sing also Justice Singers was nodding her head because I think, you know, having that

that chain of proof is something that we look to have in legislation. So, you know, it's it's always it's always nice when there's a a trail to follow to uh to that decision. Z we couldn't have

queued it up today because our next uh person I'm going to ask is professor Das Gupta who [snorts] is a clinician and an innovator um I'm sure you've experienced the

recalcitrance and challenge of shifting medical practice and and you know nurses and doctors are are are well known for being entrenched in the way of of doing things and and changing those those

welltrodden paths of of workflows and clinical decision pathways are very difficult to shift. So, so what kind of investment do we need to make in in clinical research

and evaluation and evidence to shift those those welltrodden paths of practice? Professor Bas Gupta namaskar namaskar if you to realize that I am a working

surgeon. So in addition to invention and innovation, what I'm really interested in is implementation. I want to make a difference to you that if you may be

patient someday to make a difference to you. I come here on behalf of responsible AI UK. a major investment from UK research and innovation not just in AI in the UK but

into an international ecosystem including the greater south. We have put AI champions in every hospital and we are trying to expand into our partners in India and in Africa where it

is needed the most. Let me give you some real well examples of how we are doing this. Responsible bouquet for example funded an evaluation of ambient AI writing those notes

shortening the operating time saving a month of wasted time in the operating room. The British Association of Physicians of Indian origin realized that wouldn't it

be wonderful if our parents, many of whom are living in India, my mother is 87 before she has a heart attack. Wouldn't it be nice if a message on my told me

something was going to happen? The reason is because the data is not diversified enough. Without diversity of data, you're not

going to win this battle. Let me give you another example of investment. That's inequity. Two weeks ago, if you look at the British Medical Journal, there's a major article from us on teley

surgery 2.0. It means today the technology exists for a surgeon to operate from two and a half thousand kilometers away using a web with a time delay of 60 milliseconds

or less. When you do this, it feels like you're in the same operating room. Imagine this investment being one of the solutions to the 5 billion patients who do not have access to equitable surgery.

That is an example. Let me give you a third example and this is an automation. My own group in Kings has funded and invested in automation big time. The levels of autonomy in robotics goes from

zero to five. Zero is no autonomy. The most autonomous machine is level three. You map with the ultrasound the prostate. All the men in this room have a prostate. As we grow older, we have

difficulty in peeing. You the middle of the prostate with an ultrasound. You press a button. A vapor jet creates a hole in the middle of the pre-state so that you don't have to wake up 20 times

at night until last November when University Alan presented a paper on a robotic system which can operate on pig gallbladders. Pig gallbladders with 100%

memoria 100% accurate. Five days after this I was at the Royal Academy of Engineering a group like this with the people and I said hands up everyone who is going to allow this machine to

operate on them. So hands up everyone who will allow a completely automated machine 100% accurate in pigs to take out your gallbladder here. &gt;&gt; Any takers?

There was the wrong in the room on vication. There was a single hand in the gul as well. So I went to the trials but they are saying not yet. We still want to hear them

still today. So I to you companies of course we have to visit them. Countries including the global south but civil society the three C's. If we do not bring our patients with us, all this

investment is going to fail. And the final investment out is in skills. How do any medical or nursing schools in the world which have AI in the curriculum? If we do not have this

embedded in education of the next generation of healthare workers, we are going to fail. So those would be my parting thoughts to you. Thank you. the panel a few more minutes um the

systems that need to be upgraded in order for them to be robust for the future that's coming and then for me about AI as a gamecher finally we should be not just thinking about technology as

a band-aid but technology as a pillar at health systems of the future But we shouldn't confound as Zamir said shiny and impressive with impactful. Focusing on things that get used and work in the

real world. A benchmark might be the wrong thing not accuracy but actually impact. And then of course you know the the the challenge that uh professor Gas Gupta brought to us that you know it

does take time to to change behavior but uh it is possible as long as for the moment we have humans in the loop. I'd like to give each of you one sentence now just to wrap up as you've heard

others. What has changed your thoughts and what's the one message you'd like to have P folks uh lead the room with? And let me just go sequentially down the road.

leveraging our diverse skills and strength and priorities uh into collective action that is partnership. So, so and recall some years ago with

partners with funders we developed something called the principles uh for donor alignment for digital health because of the fragmentation. I would like to revise that those

principles to be able to work together to to achieve behind countries priorities. At the same time, countries need to be to have and strategies and deliberate investment in enabling the

environment. So donors cannot rally behind nothing. We are asked to rally behind countries priorities. Then countries need to have priorities. So it goes, right? So for

donors we need coordinate. countries need to develop strategies, priorities and investment so we can rally behind. &gt;&gt; Fantastic. &gt;&gt; Yep. Thank you. Uh I think we asked to

respond in one sentence. So I was going to say something. So let's see the &gt;&gt; but um I haven't changed my mind but uh one point which resonated to my heart

which I was not able to mention in my uh opening sentence but one thing I'd like to highlight is that okay we can leverage artificial intelligence with human being at the center of those

utilization. So that's what I want to highlight. Thank you. Does this sing? &gt;&gt; I'm going to actually say one sentence. Here's to a healthier world

with AI and technology. [snorts] We really hope to have a world. &gt;&gt; Fantastic professor &gt;&gt; for for

patience. I urge you to follow what we call the reason test which means do not just think about what these machines can do for us but think about what are the societal effects of these

machines. The change has to go from the turing test to today the wizen round test. Very nice. L I think for for me, you know, the question of how do we move from promise

to progress is underpinned by I think a theme that I'm seeing at the conference and the change that we need to support through that process. And so my appeal is

we need to keep humans at the center of the AI revolution. &gt;&gt; Fantastic. So before you've been patiently these uh wise words from our panel, I'd like to give you the last

word to uh to bring this home and everyone the audience with a food for thought before they go for food for their stomachs. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much. Uh good afternoon

to all. Sincere thanks to all the I think it's on. Yes, sincere thanks to all the distinguished panelists for this very thoughtprovoking and very interesting uh conversation around AI

and health. Um I think today's conversation makes one thing very clear. AI in health has reached an inflection point and for years we spoke about possibility.

Today the conversation has shifted to investment, implementation and impact. I think that was really uh highlighted and emphasized by all. The question no longer the question is no longer whether

AI can improve health. The question is whether we will invest in the right foundations to ensure it improves health for everyone not few. Over the past hour several themes have emerged and the

first is around investment. Investment must go beyond innovation. It must flow into the systems that make in innovation safe, trusted and scalable through governance and regulation,

evidence generation, workforce readiness and also workforce capacity building which can very clearly data systems and long-term partnerships. These are not optional. They are the enabling

conditions that determine whether AI becomes a tool for equity or a driver of new inequalities. Second, uh predictability builds confidence. When countries strengthen

regulatory and legal frameworks, investment flows in. When evidence is generated and transparency shared, investment grows. When partnerships are built across sectors, investment scales.

In short, trust is the currency that unlocks sustainable investment. So, I think uh these are some important points that uh I could take out from here and we look forward to working with uh

different partners, investors, donors, government agencies to take AI and health further uh for the benefit of all the populations. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Fantastic. Let's give a round of

applause to our audience. on panel and we're going to get a quick picture. So, please let's come to the front and uh thank you all for your patience and apologies for going 1.2

minutes over. &gt;&gt; Excellent. &gt;&gt; 32 Hey, how are you? &gt;&gt; Hey

I'm next. Thanks so much for the previous session. If you're not staying back for the next session, we kindly request you to retain the sing

please take your seats a polite reminder the first four are reserved for special invitees from city building commission and dudarat Here you have

Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; Good afternoon everyone. Sincurest apologies as is the case with Chad Summit. uh and with so many exciting conversations

happening in every room they tend to run. So we'll be starting at the next session very soon within the next 2 minutes. I kindly request everybody who's to attend the event on AI for VIX
