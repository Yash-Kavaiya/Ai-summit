## 📝 Transcript

all around the bat mandapam. So once again, thank you very much for your time this afternoon and for choosing us to have a conversation with. Uh to start off, I would like to introduce

John who will make some opening comments from for the World Bank. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much. We've heard from a lot of world leaders, tech leaders, experts across

across many many countries about how AI is fundamentally reshaping our world, presenting not just a technological shift but a structural transformation with profound implications for economies

and societies everywhere. For emerging markets and developing economies, as for all economies, AI could be a gamecher. Oh, so sorry that probably helps. [laughter] I thought the mics were on.

Um, so you know, for all countries, but especially for emerging markets and developing economies, AI can be a gamecher, a unique opportunity to leapfrog long-standing development

challenges. It offers clear opportunities to enhance growth and productivity. uh we recently did some work in South Asia at the World Bank Group to see what sort of impact uh AI

was having on jobs in the region and we found that approximately 15 or 16% of jobs here have strong complimentarity with uh AI AI enables people in those jobs to expand their skills uh and their

effectiveness in delivering the products and services that they are trying to provide. Um it also helps uh you know very very diverse groups of people in many many different sectors of the

economy. It helps farmers to identify pests on their crops, diseases in their crops uh and also how to address them. It helps nurses to identify the ailments and illnesses that their patients may be

suffering particularly the ones that they're not very familiar with but that they can uh research uh using um appropriate uh AI uh applications. It helps u financial institutions to uh

understand better the ability of uh borrowers to to take on uh loans. Um which of course expands the ability of the borrower to expand uh his or her business.

Um so there's clearly enormous potential for AI to fill skill gaps um in the areas that I mentioned also in education in health care services to detect patterns to generate forecasts to guide

uh the allocation of public resources and so on. Of course at the same time on the flip side AI also creates a number of challenges. Uh one of them is there will be some job losses uh particularly

sort of entry-level jobs that are very much knowledge or document-based uh performing relatively w uh work that can be taken over by uh by uh automation and we're actually seeing this in the World

Bank group. uh if we if we went and looked at the number the types of jobs that we are advertising uh these days compared to a couple of years ago and what we found is that that layer uh sort

of at the bottom of the professional classes in inside the bank group there's just fewer of those types of jobs being advertised in the World Bank group today than there were a few years ago. uh at

the same time you know particularly for developing economies and emerging markets there many of them are going to struggle to harness the potential that AI offers uh because of very basic

issues around uh the foundations for effective AI use uh they may not have reliable electricity we can start with that very basic one they may not have uh an internet backbone that's sufficiently

strong uh people in these countries may not have very very basic basic skills of literacy and numeracy that enable them to work effectively with higherend uh devices. They may need to use very very

basic devices uh not even smartphones and rely on uh voice communication asking a question and hearing a response. So there may be struggles of that kind in developing countries and

emerging markets and I'm not even talking about all the governance and and and and regulatory safeguards that uh that could can also come into play. So the question of course is

how can how can um emerging economies developing markets uh harness the potential of AI and avoid the the pitfalls and for us in the World Bank group we've been very very focused

recently on basically small AI small AI meaning practical affordable locally relevant AI that addresses specific problems s and also works where connectivity,

data, skills, [snorts] infrastructure are fairly limited and this is extremely important in countries like India where all of those conditions can apply and yet there's tremendous

potential for people to expand their to grow their productivity if they have timely access to information of the right kind in their local language uh tailored to their specific

circumstances. So, um that's that's what we are trying to do in uh in in uh South Asia today and across the the globe actually. And this is really about uh some of the

examples that I mentioned earlier having bespoke uh applications that help farmers to do very basic um uh investigation of the types of issues that they're facing. um using their

phone to analyze what's going on, to identify it, to find out how to address it, even to find out who within their local area in their market uh space can help them uh by providing the tools or

the products that are necessary to address whatever they're running into. Um so India of course is a very strong example of what's possible. Uh India has been a leading country in digital

innovation for quite some time. Uh after the United States and China, it has the largest if you like digital universe uh in the in the world today. It's got some very good foundations. There's the um

the digital identity program as well as the digital payment platform that currently exists. There are lots of Indian firms that are innovating in AI including in these small AI applications

that I've been talking about and the government the governments of India have an objective of ensuring that there is AI for all. So they are very very aware of the challenges that need to be

overcome to make AI accessible to a to a very very broad spectrum of the population and not just the very rich that in to some extents need assistance. the least right it's the it's the poorer

parts of the country that benefit the most because they they will be leveraging a tool that they are not very familiar with and have not been using uh that much in in the past so we're

working in India we're working in a lot of different uh states um Utar Pradesh Maharashtra um Kerala Harana Telana on some of these um different aspects working with

governments to to work on the the foundation ational elements. Um interoperability um uh you know making sure that um that uh

that the the accessibility is possible that programs can run uh offline as it were so that people who aren't able to get online all the time can can benefit and so on. Uh and then we're also

working with private sector uh investors who are developing apps. I mean, we're not what we're we're not actually developing many apps ourselves. That's not really in our comparative advantage.

Our comparative advantage is the World Bank Group is to do the more advisory work. Make sure that the backbone information that's embedded in the application is reliable and trustworthy

because of course that's critical for ensuring successful uptake. But we are helping governments to create the space that enables experimentation in AI sandboxes to develop the different

applications that uh people in this incredibly creative country are coming up with to uh help people get on with their work and become more productive. Um so um

I think it's important to recognize that you know if we're going to if we're going to make effective use of this tool we need both a public uh facing uh effort to address the standards uh and

the other issues the interoperability and so on that I mentioned before but also a private sector facing effort because it's the private sector that's actually generating creating uh most of

these applications that are working particularly in the small AI I uh area we're doing a little bit on on bigger AI. Um there's obviously a connection between the two. Big AI can through

computational power uh generate new knowledge um that can help us to do things that we haven't done so well in the past much much better. But for countries like India translating that

into small AI will also be very very important for uptake. So I'm looking forward to hearing from all the distinguished speakers in this panel uh about their thoughts on what's happening

today in this sector. So thank you very much. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much John. John spoke about of course uh the use cases for AI and on the other side of the spectrum we

have the large language models. We have the foundational AI but no matter where you sit on the spectrum, no matter where your interests lie, innovation never disperses and never diffuses equally.

Today on this panel I hope to unpack what determines whether AI narrows the development gap or whether it widens the development gap. Especially we're looking to talk about the real world.

What should policy makers in the real world think about and keep in keep at the top of their mind as they go ahead preparing policies considering AI. Before I start just setting the stage uh

to a man to a woman everybody I spoke with who's attended the first AI summit to today this is I think the fourth AI summit being held the first one was held in UK in the UK and without exception

all of them made it a point to tell me how the first session was full of fear it was oh my god AI is this terrible uh technology which is going to steal all our jobs make us redundant

and when they come to India. They see the hope that technology and AI brings and that's the spirit of the discussion this afternoon to figure out how can we balance both of those extremes hope and

concern and go ahead in a pragmatic policy first way to prepare for the real world. So if I could start with you, how do you think about AI and especially where do you see areas of creative

destruction to foster the innovation that we need? &gt;&gt; Uh thank you very much. Um so of course creative destruction is is an important driver of economic growth in the long

run. Uh so that's why you know it's it's an interesting question how AI will affect creative destruction in general. Um, of course, we are at a very early phase of uh AI and it's a GPT and

typically, you know, when GPS are emerging, there's a huge surge of new businesses and this should not be misleading. I think the main question we should be asking ourselves is what will

happen to the creative destruction in the future? How does the future look like in terms of creative destruction? And I'm a macroeconomist. So that's why I like to look at this with a you know

bird eye uh uh view and I would like to you know separate advanced economies from emerging or developing economies. So when it comes to advanced economies there again we need to uh split the

issue into two layers. One the foundational layer and the other one is the application layer. When we look at the application layer it's great you know the entry barriers are low. Small

businesses can do what only large businesses could do in the past and you know they can do you know their accounting marketing you know there are so many opportunities now the entry cost

is is the the entry barrier is low as a result this suggests that you know this is going to be more you know uh friendly for creative destruction on the on the application uh layer but then there's

also the foundation layer and I think that's exactly where the bottleneck is when when we look at the foundation layer better layer there the the entry barrier is really really high and you

know the compute is it's it's very compute heavy it's it's very data heavy it's very talenheavy so as a result you know this uh market at least this layer is very concentration

of course it's very early but uh you know normally we have to be uh we have to be concerned about the the foundational layer and how things will pan out because this is the upstream to

the application uh layer which is downstream to to foundation layer. So that's why whatever will happen at the at the foundation layer will potentially spill over to application layer two. So

that's that that's why I think we need to look at early indicators but you know in the interest of time I don't want to go into the the empirical evidence yet maybe we can come back in the second

layer when we look at the developing countries so I think you know I agree with you on you know I think uh AI is creating fantastic opportunities uh so that's why I think it's really

important to understand the opportunities as well as the risk for developing countries and together with the world bank we are working on the world development report 2026 which is

going to be on AI and development and these are exactly the issues that we are focusing on. But I think before we go into you know into those uh details we should ask ourselves one major question.

Why was there no entrepreneurship and dynamism before the AI revolution in emerging economies? Why was you know why when we looked at the firm's life cycle for instance why

was it not up or out? Why was it not you know very competition friendly? Why did the best predictor of firm size in emerging economies or developing economies was the size of the family and

or the number of male children? These are still lingering issues and AI is not you know uh will not bring magic unless we we we understand and fix the business

environment in in in these economies. you know AI will just create new tools but at the end of the day we need to make sure that the business friendly environment is there for entrepreneurs

to come in and exercise their ideas &gt;&gt; and that's a very interesting leaping off point the real world and the intention of this panel is to get exactly there so if I may turn to you

quite literally turn to you Michael and ask you about the real world you're obviously doing a lot of work on the ground where do you see the potential for AI to spur gains

And are there any really transformative breakthrough areas that you're looking at right now? &gt;&gt; Yes. Um &gt;&gt; thank you. Thanks very much. Um you know

I I don't while I don't want to minimize the existence of forces that may widen gaps. I think that if policymakers primarily at the national level but also in multilateral development banks take

appropriate actions and make appropriate investments then I think AI has the potential to substantially narrow some of the gaps and um you know I think the which policy actions could to take can

be informed by thinking through relevant market failures and relevant government failures. Let me give a a concrete example or two. So, you know, private firms have incentives to develop and

improve applications of AI that can generate profits. But there are some very important uh applications of AI for public goods uh for example that um that will not attract commercial investment

to measure it with their needs. [snorts] And that's an area where I think governments and multilateral development banks can play an important role and I think some of this very much echoes what

you were saying about a small models but also I'll mention a link between between the two. So um you know an obvious example where I think India's been a leader for the world is in the

development of digital identity systems. you know this is will enable as uh as Zufuk was saying this enables a lot of work by uh individual entrepreneurs a lot of other applications so that's a

huge success and I think multilateral development banks together with India can help bring that to many other countries let me take you another example one that's you know not as well

known but picks up on your comment about farmers so you one thing that's critical for farmers they have to make a bunch of decisions that are weather dependent you When do you plant? For example, what

varieties do you use? A drought re resistant variety, another variety um that most farmers don't have access to state-of-the-art weather forecasts around um you know around the world. I'm

not I'm not talking about one country in most in low and middle inome countries. They don't have access to that. Now, there's a huge advance. We tend to think of large language models, but obviously

AI is pushing science forward and that includes in weather forecasting. It's really a revolution driven by AI. But weather forecasts are non-rival. They're largely non-excludable. They're

the classic definition of a public good. So there's a strong rationale for national governments in some cases supported by multilateral development banks to make investments in producing

and disseminating AI weather forecasts. Again here um India is a leader. So if you um India in particular India's uh the Indian government distributed forecasts to AI weather forecasts to 38

million farmers uh last year and you know the evidence suggests that farmers both from India from this particular case that in area so the I'll say a little bit about last year's monsoon it

came early in in Carerala and southern India but it then there was a unexpected delay in the progression the AI forecasts got that right. That was the only source of information that

reached farmers with that in the areas uh we did a survey above above that line and farmers are responding and they transplant more they use hybrid seeds more evidence from around the world is

consistent with this uh farmers respond to these AI weather forecasts. So I think that's one example but many others and and happy to discuss them in education and traffic enforcement and

elsewhere. &gt;&gt; Michael your answer should be read the book. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; We've we've spoken about the use cases

of India but setting up digital IDs of course is a sovereign decision. It's something India could do unilaterally. When it comes to the large language models that's not reality. The large

language models are concentrated in the US in China. Now with deepsek anu in a world where you largely have the rules being set by the two large powers the US and China arguably there's there's of

course the EU as well and you've done a lot of work on that who sets the AI rules for the global south. Is there even the possibility for the global south to talk about sovereignity?

So I think the glo global south uh has the same kind of incentive for their own AI sovereignty including then regulatory sovereignty to design the rules that better work for their economies for

their societies for what the public interest in these jurisdictions calls for. But regulating AI is a a really difficult even for very established bureaucracies. You need to be able to

then make sure that it is an innovationfriendly and yet you at the same time need to be carefully managing the risks for individuals and societies. So even very

established regulators like the European Union found it one of the the most challenging tasks to come up with the AI act. So there's probably something to be learned from these jurisdictions that

have gone ahead and and done the kind of thinking that had then resulted into some of those regulatory frameworks that we have now in place. So if you think about the choices that India has when it

looks around, one of them is to think about okay how does the EU go about this? The EU follows what I would call a rightsdriven approach to regulation. So what is really characterizing this the

first uh horizontal binding so economywide regulation that the Europeans enacted it is a regulation that seeks to protect the fundamental rights of individuals the democratic

structures of the society and that also seeks to ensure a a greater distribution of the benefits from AI revolution. So the European approach is very conscious that it wants to also h share some of

the benefits so they don't all go to the large developers of these models but individual users society at large smaller companies benefit from AI as well. So there's something I think the

Europeans can teach in terms of that regulatory approach in addition to maybe then some details of how that regulation in the end was constructed. But just one word, India is a a formidable economy

that doesn't need to take a template and plug it into the economy as such. I think India is in a very good position to take the lessons that serves its needs yet make the kind of local

modification and variations that are more reflecting the distinct priorities of this country. &gt;&gt; Anu before I turn to a quick follow-up question to you. as India makes its own

rules, where does the trade-off lie between regulation and innovation? &gt;&gt; So, this is very interesting because often um I am based in the US but I'm initially from Europe and uh these two

jurisdictions are described as the US develops technologies and the Europeans regulate those technologies. So in many ways does India want the innovation path or the regulation path and I think there

are many votes who would go for innovation but I really would like to debunk this myth that to me it's a false choice to say that the reason we don't see these large language models being

developed in Europe is not because there's a GDPR the general data protection regulation it's not because there is AI act so the reason there is a perceived innovation gap between the

United States and Europe is I think four things. So first there is no digital single market in Europe. It's very hard for these AI companies to scale across 27 distinct markets. Second there's no

deep robust capital markets union. 5% of the global venture capital is in Europe over 50% in the United States. That explains why the US has been able to take much greater steps in developing AI

technologies. Third, there are legal frameworks and cultural attitudes to risk-taking. Europeans have some of the most punitive bankruptcy laws in the world. I wouldn't encourage you to

replicate that because it's very hard to innovate on the frontier of technological innovation because sometimes you fail. But you need to be then given the second chance. And the

fourth I think the the sort of foundational pillar of the robust US tech ecosystem is that the US has been spectacularly successful in harnessing the global talent that have chosen to

come to the US including many Indian data scientists engineers who think that US is the place where they can start their companies, scale their companies, fund their companies, US universities

can attract them. So the idea that choosing to follow or imitate aspects of the Europeans's rights protective regulation would come at the cost of innovation. We need to understand better

what drives the technological innovation and whether regulation uh should be falsely accused as the impediment to innovation and I don't think that's the case.

&gt;&gt; Thank you Anubal. Turning to you, you're working in an area of the world, South Asia, where what is regulation, what is enforcement? At the risk of sounding like a provocet

here, it's it's the wild west a little bit. Um, and therefore, we talk a lot in our part of the world about small AI, about targeted AI. My question to you is that what should policy makers keep in

mind when decide designing AI enabled interventions, especially when it comes to small AI and the targeted use cases? Yeah, thank you and uh thanks Venta and others for inviting me to this panel. Uh

I think the the focus you know so jal for those of you who don't know is a is a is a development center that was founded at MIT's economics department. Michael was one of our founding

affiliates with a very very simple premise which is we have spent decades and decades of uh work in development economics and development policy to kind of fight poverty. Can could we can we do

better if that action is based on rigorous data and rigorous evidence and so kind of what are we seeing in terms of that application of all of that to the AI intersecting with development and

social good matter I think the first thing is that we have to keep a laser focus on impact and final outcomes. Uh I'm so heartened that the topic of this summit includes the word impact in it.

uh and I think that is what really sets this apart and by impact I you know I often tell social enterprises NOS's I sit on the board of some of those I said you did not give up careers at uh

high-tech firms you did not do these degrees from top universities to count the number of downloads and count the number of clicks and count the number of uh engagement. You did this because you

wanted to change the lives of people. You did this because you wanted improvement in health outcomes. You wanted improvements in education outcomes. So are you really measuring

the impact of your work in the field, not just in the lab? And I think the the gap between what works in the lab and what works in the field is really quite big. And we have 50 years of working

with tech uh in different sectors whether it is one laptop per child or digital finance to know that those two things uh kind of are different. So for instance, randomized evaluations can

help you get to that. Uh the second bit is that you have to uh unpack who benefits from this technology. Oftentimes average treatment effects you know yes I applied this AI I did a

randomized evaluation and I found that this increased the learning outcomes by.3 standard deviations great but who did it benefit if it benefited the top of the class and left the others behind

then that is not what we were set up for. It's a it's it's a good it's a good outcome for those who are at the top of the class. But anyway, schools in in many LMIC's including India are already

set up for that. And then the final bit on this which I always think to your point about how do we think how should governments how should everybody think about is am I designing for scale or am

I designing for just proving my impact. Uh and if you design for scale then very much like Johanna Johanna said earlier you are thinking about the resilience of the technology. you're thinking is this

the minimum possible technology that I need to do and at the same time you're also thinking about is this a is this a solution chasing a need or is this a problem that needs a solution and I

can't tell you how many times uh that goes wrong uh u I think this is best illustrated by one quick example uh from letris uh I think there are lots of examples from India so I'm going to

focus on one from Brazil uh this context is very similar to India in Brazil there is a standardized examination test uh that every kid has to take uh in middle school which affects their decision

where they will land up in uh after that but as part of that there is an essay that they have to write and that essay grading evaluation takes forever. So let us uh worked with us and with google.org

to basically design an AI tool which you simply scan the essay and then it take it it helps grade the test. Now what that did is in one of the poorest districts of Brazil it moved the ranking

of the public schools not the private schools. So the most uh uh vulnerable public schools all the way from 11th to becoming the second best performing uh state in just a matter of two or three

years. Phenomenal results, right? Like but then you start saying let's unpack this. What was this thing doing? The first thing that they find out is that you know a lot of people are like oh

does this mean that I don't need teachers anymore? No you still need the teachers. What it replaces is the road task of the teacher having to correct spelling mistakes, calling you to the

room and saying, "Hey, you forgot your comma, you forgot to capitalize. Instead, AI takes care of all of that." And now the teacher can sit with you in the free time and say, "How how did you

set up the structure of this essay? Did you think about this analytically or not?" And that's the first insight that comes from evaluation. It frees up the teacher time. Everything that we do in

the field ends up adding to teachers time, adding to the nurs's time, adding to the Anganoi workers time. Very few things free up time. So if your AI application can free up the time of the

health frontline workers, first of all, that's a winner. The second thing that uh uh is really important here was that this is a demand-driven thing, right? Like there was a demand by the kids to

improve their essays. There was a demand by the teachers to free up their time. But most importantly, there was a demand by the school districts to show progress. So I think those is that

letters is kind of a great example of how everything comes together if you think about it ahead of time. &gt;&gt; Ladies and gentlemen, a topper of India's uh notoriously difficult civil

services exam. So take take more seriously than you would as just a normal &gt;&gt; Thank you. I thought that was history now. [laughter]

It's it's never history in India but Michael turning to you almost almost as equal uh in in accomplishment by winning a Nobel as as um what risks should multilaterals like the World Bank keep

in mind or or let me rephrase that actually. Is there a risk that multilaterals are moving too slowly relative to the technology? Um, you know, I I think there certainly

I think there certainly is. Um, I, as I noted before, there are certain areas where the private sector is going to move, but there are other areas where they're not going to move quickly and

this and it's going to be very important for uh, governments and for multilateral development banks and for philanthropy to move. Um, I think there are a number of approaches to this. Um, one way is by

encouraging innovation by setting up uh institutions like innovation funds, particularly evidence-based uh to to to echo I think uh um evidence-based innovation funds. So, I'll give you one

example of something that I'm involved in uh development innovation ventures that was initially set up in the uh in the US government uh but it's now been relaunched independently. It has tiered

funding. So there's initially very small grants to pilot new ideas. Um um then there's somewhat larger uh grants to rigorously test them as emphasized and then for those that are most successful

there's uh funds to help transition them to scale up. Um I think why is that important? Well, that's important because if if we're thinking about the services that public services and there

there are other sectors where this is needed, but there's probably going to be insufficient competition. Govern private developers are going to come up with innovations, but then they if they have

to sell them to the government, they're facing a monopsinistic buyer. They're not going to probably not going to get rich doing that. So some support to generate more more in that market

generate more entrance in that market market will um I think is very important. It'll also mean that prices will go down and quality will go up when the government does that uh does that.

Uh let me I'll just again let me give a example of the potential of how you know we we tend to focus on certain examples time after time here. Let me give another another example that is uh um

you know something that I doubt many people here are thinking of when they think of AI. You know one of the things that you know traffic safety and we've all been exposed to traffic in the past

few days. Um you know traffic is a real problem interfering with urbanization which may drive growth. There are a lot of deaths from from traffic. A lot of citizens around the world have very

difficult and uh painful experiences with traffic enforcement. Well, you know, you can have automated traffic cameras that have the opportunity to improve uh improve traffic outcomes but

also improve people's perception of fairness in government. India's uh moving in this. Let me mention another thing that within traffic safety that's being done. Microsoft Research India

developed a program called HAMS. Um that is for driver's licenses and that it automatic it uses AI to test are the are the drivers uh are they actually passing their exams. They when this was

introduced it's been introduced I believe in 56 uh sites across India. Hundreds of thousands of people have taken tests this way. We took a leaf from uh Eggball's book. Uh we we

followed up the um we got information from Ola on uh ratings on on and the number of drivers who were rated uh as driving unsafeely that went down 20 to 30% where hams had been installed. So

you know that's something that was developed not by Microsoft's main business but by Microsoft research. If we can just create some support for more ideas like that to be developed to be

rigorously tested that can benefit India can benefit the whole world. &gt;&gt; We are we are running out of time. Uh probably this is this is one place in in India where time is really respected and

and we have to end in time. So I had I had I had a list of wonderful questions but if I could now move to a space where we are really giving shorter answers and quicker answers and the deeply deeply

interesting uh ones about who's winning and who's losing. Uh Michael if I could start with you actually uh we've seen many promising technologies fail to live up to their promise. How should we think

when we are evaluating AI interventions? How should we think about it? What should be the metrics that we use? Okay, first model evaluation. So AI companies typically do that part. How

good is the model output for specific tasks, you know, forecasting the weather? Does it do a good job? Does it match your local language? Well, second, user impact. Here I think there's a role

both for sort of initial pilots akin to a medical efficacy trial. If you put the work into trying it, does it lead to improvements and outcomes for the users? Second, scalability and usage at scale.

that's more like an effectiveness trial in medicine. Um that it's important to think not just about the tech but also about the human systems. Are the teachers actually going to use the

product? I think is an example. How can you get the teachers to use the product? And then the fourth area is continuous uh improvement. You want a system that improves the underlying models. So I

think in procurement we might want to think about requiring continuous AB tests uh publicity about what the uh what the impact usages and impact is and perhaps even thinking about requiring

open access uh uh as part of the procurement package. &gt;&gt; Thank you Michael. I want to flip that question to you. Where do you see where do you see hype

in the promises of AI that you don't think will play out &gt;&gt; everywhere? [laughter] &gt;&gt; I I think hype is natural because the the technology is exciting. It's a

general purpose technology. It's evolving so quickly. The marginal cost of deployment for the next users is very low. It's multimmodal. You know, today you're doing it in text. Tomorrow you're

doing it in video. Day after tomorrow you're doing it on audio. Everybody who has a smartphone has it. So I can understand the hype, right? like I why where it is coming from. But I think

what we really need to do is separate the hype from the reality on the ground and the reality on the ground is that many of these technologies are not having the final impact that we are

having. And I see kind of two you know like once again my job at JPAL always you know sitting at the top is like to say not worry about one professor's evaluation or one researcher's

evaluation but say when I connect all these dots what am I seeing and I'm seeing two patterns. One is about trust in technology and the second part is about the the reality of the policy

world. Let me elaborate quickly on both trust in technology. uh there are studies which found that even if you give doctors and frontline healthare workers access to diagnostic tools

including radiology tools using AI AI enabled uh prediction of the diseases often times it doesn't lead to an improvement in results and when you try and unpack that even though this

technology worked even better than the human intervention in the lab right so some of these diagnostic things can work have better predictability in the lab but in the field they end up decreasing

ing not only is their efficiency lower but it lowers the efficiency of the doctors because we have not trained them enough as to which parts of this uh thing is suggestion versus this is a

required thing to do how do you adapt that so this trust in technology yeah helping people understand that is very important and the second thing is the enabling mechanism the world around us

we just assume that just because the technology works even if it works in the field the rest of the system will adapt to it no you have to adapt the system to the rest of the world. So this example

quickly comes from India where in with one particular state government we try to improve the collection of value added taxes. It's called GST in India. There is a whole worry about bogus firms that

are created to get these GST or value added tax things. the the the machine learning algorithm is able to increase the uh uh probability of predicting a bogus firm from 38% to 55% in one shot

at a very very low cost. When it came time to scale up this program by the government, they refused to scale it up because you think about it, you have taken away the discretion of the human

to decide whether they should raid Michael's firm or they should raid Ibal's firm. That is power. And if you haven't thought through that point, what is the point of technology?

&gt;&gt; I I won't terrify anyone in the room by asking why the they didn't want to scale up this tech. Uh but but talking talking about weeding out the bad actors, talking about firm level decisions,

moving on to U of does the firm firm level evidence show productivity gains diffusing evenly across? So uh you know just going back quickly to to the earlier model that I highlighted I think

it's important to understand what's happening at the upstream so that we can then uh understand where things will be going in the future and the evidence there the the early signs is a bit

worrying. So first of all you know when we look at for instance the dynamism or market concentration in the US it's been market concentration has been increasing since 1980 but in an accelerating way

after 2000. So that's the first set of evidence. The second set of evidence comes from how innovative resources are allocated across firms. And when we look at the inventors who are creating the

creative destruction and technologies, there's a massive shift towards market incumbents. And when I say incumbents, those firms that are that have more than,000 employees in around 2000, 50%

of employees used to work for incumbent firms. In just 10 years, that shifted to more than 60%. A massive reallocation of innovative resources. And the final piece of evidence and we are going to

release this study next week. Uh we looked at the universities how AI is impacting uh uh universities and we look at the AI publishing scientist and AI publishing scientists in academia the

top 1% used to make around $300,000 in 2000. It went up to 390 uh over two decades. Similar people in industry used to make around $550,000. Now it went up to 2 million and there

has been two break points. One of them uh was in 2012. The other one was in 2017 of course image uh uh processing and then the the foundational model revolution in 2017. The more worrying

part about this which brings me back to the foundational model side of things is that the out this created a massive out migration from academia to industry and after 2017 especially when the compute

and and infrastructure became so important. The target or the destination is large incumbent information companies which again highlights where things are going in terms of the concentration and

the the worrying part also is that when people are moving to industry from academia their publication record goes down by 50% they start patenting by 600% more after they move which means that we

are moving from open science to more protected science now spillover is extremely important for creative destruction for the future of innovation. So that's why and if we will

keep the the the foundational layer contestable I think the the fundamental players there will be universities and keeping universities in a healthy way is extremely important but there's very

little discussion on this which I think before it gets too late because you know once you start buttoning the wrong button and then the rest will follow you know wrong as well. So that's why I

think we have to have this frank conversation early on in the game otherwise it might be too late. &gt;&gt; What what you spoke about boils down to something Ibal mentioned as well power

because power still makes decisions in this world today. So Anu before I move to the final section of this this panel if I could ask you if the finance minister of a developing country let's

say India comes to you and asks you Anu how should I think what would you tell her? So today if you think about how much political power but also geopolitical power is shaping our

conversations around AI it is something where I think each country is now pushed towards greater technism techno protectionism uh AI sovereignty has become almost a sort of uniformly goal

for for everyone but I would remind even when encountering players like the United States and China that nobody in today's world will be completely sovereign when it comes to AI space. If

I just take one layer of the AI stack as an example, what is now driving a lot of the global AI race is this idea that we want to do frontier AI. We want to have these powerful foundation models. That

means you need to have a lot of compute. You can't have a lot of compute unless you have access to the highest end semiconductors. The US is well positioned there. It is

hosting the companies like Nvidia. The US leads in the design of But who is manufacturing them? We really need to think about the role of Taiwan there. But then the Europeans have ASML

in the Netherlands that leads in the high-end manufacturing with the equipment uh needed for manufacturing. But that is dependent on chemicals where Japan is leading and the entire supply

chain relies on raw materials from China. So ultimately all these choke points can in principle be weaponized but that is not ultimately a sustainable strategy. Even President Trump had to

walk back some of the export controls to China because Chinese were saying okay then the raw materials are not coming your way. So there are uh the potential ways to weaponize these

interdependencies that ultimately make us all poorer. So as a finance minister of India when approaching other middle powers the great powers I think it's good to remind ourselves that ultimately

for this technology to benefit all of us we need to find a way even in this today's protectionist environment to get along and find some ways uh to collaborate and think about what our

collective AI future looks like and to remind the reminders of the limits of that sovereignty may be one way to begin that conversation. Easily said than done.

&gt;&gt; Our final our final final section is of course the rapid fire round. We we all love this in this room. In one sentence in one sentence if I could ask all of you and Johannes you're not getting away

easily. Um you're going to answer this as well. So in one sentence if I could ask you we're sitting in New Delhi 2035. Could you predict one development outcome that will have dramatically

improved with the use of AI and one risk we'll regret not addressing? Now I guess you already know my second answer. Uh I think the the the concentration the the the future of

market concentration uh is is something that we should be concerned about and we might regret not having discussed this sufficiently uh in in 10 years uh on what might uh what will change in a

positive direction clearly healthcare and education I think it's it's a no-brainer &gt;&gt; I know &gt;&gt; so first of all it's so inspiring to

hear all the use case examples whether we talk about traffic for agriculture or education because I often talk about the risks and the downsides. So, it's a really good reminder. I'm personally

very excited especially what happens in the education space but also in the health space. In terms of the risks, I think one thing that we are not paying attention to and what I would even call

a systemic risk is the idea that many worried about AI getting almost too smart. But I am more worried about us getting dumber as a humanity. There is a temptation to start skipping steps,

outsourcing your thinking and your creativity to these models. And as an educator, when I think about how I will teach my students to use generative AI to enhance but not substitute their

capabilities, we would just make a tremendous mistake if we just forewent that hard work that that the beautiful moment of thinking hard problems and creating and investing in our own

capabilities and all that just cannot be so outsourced because otherwise we don't even know what kind of questions we should be asking the AI going forward. Michael

&gt;&gt; you I agree I I agree that there's huge potential in health and education. I think we'll see big improvements in that. But the risk is that the public sector won't adopt

these and therefore the poor won't have access to them. And that's because the the public sector aspicated the government systems and the government workers may not adapt to use

these. the there's also risks of copycat regulation that are overfocused on certain problems that other countries may be worrying about but might not be relevant for uh for emerging economies.

And then the final risk is that the procurement systems are just set up in such a way that we don't get sufficient competition, we get lock in and then we don't have have uh and we just don't

wind up with with good quality. &gt;&gt; Thank you Michael. the buzzers down but I'll take a risk and quickly run through the other two. &gt;&gt; Yes. Uh I I think I am much more

optimistic about the government actually adopting this thing. Uh whether it is the when you call 1000 your call is going to get answered very quickly. The PCR van is going to be at your house

much faster. The hospitals are able to be we will be able to link your health record. So I think the government sector productivity is going to improve leaprogs. Uh the biggest risk I think is

definitely the labor market. If there was a dial where I could slow down the adaptation and give time to the labor market to catch up, that's my biggest worry. You talked about entry-level

jobs, uh, an entry-level coding job might be an entry- level job in the United States. It's the aspirational job that created gorgos and noidas and moujali of this country and those people

are going to be running out of jobs very very quickly and I think the labor market whether it is ESI provident fund gratuty we are piling on and making it harder and higher harder to hire labor

when on the other hand capital is not taxed we are giving incentives to people to use AI and we are taxing them through provident fund and labor market regulations to hire labor and I think

that is for me is the biggest risk actually. So I think that um for the first time in human history we may actually have the tools available to enable us to target

uh poverty reduction poverty elimination uh initiatives on individuals and that could be tremendously transforming but at the same time I do worry that we will not get the governance right or we won't

be able to make that governance sufficiently robust to prevent uh abuses. Thank you very much to all of our panelists and to you for your time and

attention. Once again, I had the very rare fortune of being able to peek into Michael's screen while he was speaking and I saw all the messy human notes. Our panelists are definitely not outsourcing

their thinking anytime soon and thank God for that. Thank you ladies and gentlemen. [applause] Yeah. Yeah. She's also &gt;&gt; Hello. Uh we please uh would request all

of you to take this conversation outside. We really need to get the next session started.
