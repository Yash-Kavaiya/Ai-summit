## 📝 Transcript

chose to be with us. So, thank you. We are here because we believe in AI's transformative potential and I'm certain you've heard a great deal about it over the past few days. Today, this session

is about something deeper. The digital divide is rapidly becoming a compute divide. AI today is not constrained by imagination. It is constrained by infrastructure, by who has access to

GPUs, to cloud capacity, to scalable compute. And that uh that divide will determine who shapes the future of AI. Democratization in the in this context is not about catching up. It is about

expanding who gets to lead. It is about ensuring that the next generation of AI breakthroughs are not concentrated in a handful of geographies but are shaped by diverse talent, languages and live

realities across the world. And here India is not waiting for permission. India is showing that it can be done differently. Through the India AI mission and through the compute

capacity plan mobilizing more than 38,000 GPUs as public infrastructure, India is building one of the most ambitious public interest compute ecosystems anywhere in the world. This

is not incremental reform. This is infrastructure at scale. This is sovereign capability combined with openness. India is demonstrating that public interest AI infrastructure can be

built in the global south by the global south and the global south and for the global south. And this leadership matters because equitable access to compute is not just about hardware. It

sits alongside access to data, open-source models, talent and institutional capacity. India is proving that you can design AI ecosystems that that are both globally

competitive and locally grounded. At the Rockefeller Foundation, we believe this moment requires moving from diagnosis to action. Philanthropy's role is to be catalytic

to reduce risk, unlock capital, and convene unlikely partnerships that accelerate progress. Over the next hour, our discussion will unfold in three acts. First, what exactly are we

democratizing? That's an important question. Second, how do South South partnerships and catalytic financing accelerate progress? And third, what concrete commitments can we land this

year? If India's example shows us anything, it is this democratization is not theoretical. It is operational. It is scalable and it it is already underway. The question now is how we

accelerated together. Before we begin, let me take a moment to acknowledge a few leaders in the room. Shri Abishek Singh who unfortunately has been pulled into another meeting but his leadership

has been amazing. His steadf steadfast partnership and support has been something that I'm extremely extremely grateful for. His vision of guiding this important work with clarity has been

just um spectacular. Dr. Sarab Gar, we are honored by your presence. You've been in sessions uh since this morning and thank you for your leadership. It's truly a privilege

to have you with us today. My colleague Andrew who has joined us from across the world, one of the sharpest minds at the Rockefeller Foundation and truly a force for good. Thank you for being with us

today and stewarding this conversation. And of course I want to also thank Charu who's been working endlessly and very hard to kind of get us to this place. So thank you Charu for your leadership.

Martin Velas Sean and Dr. Shiko, thank you for lending your voice and expertise to today's discussion. Your perspectives will help ground this dialogue in both ambition and action. And I know all of

you actionoriented folks. So we're going to have something really cool come out from here. And last but certainly not least, our partners at Kalpa Impact, Susant, Anish, Jennifer. Thank you for

being extraordinary collaborators and for helping shape today's session. It is now my pleasure to hand it over to Mr. Dr. Gore. Please over to you, sir. Or maybe I'll hand Okay.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you, Deepali. Um when I mentioned uh the report hope you're okay when I mentioned the report uh I fumbled the name so I'll go again opening up computational resources for

new AI futures uh new AI world is possible and this is something that the team has worked really hard over the last uh few months and today is an opportunity when we release a working

version of that report and invite inputs feedback comments and suggestions which we will work through over the next few months. This research uh helped us think through and work with the

democratizing AI resources working group under the leadership of uh Dr. Sorup Ger and he's here. So it's a pleasure and a privilege for us to invite him and the other panelists to release this report.

How are you, sir? Please hold your camera. Thank you. U may I now request Dr. Sorgh uh for his keynote speech and when I thought of uh you know who could be the

best person to deliver remarks today when we are talking about uh opening up computational resources or in fact all resources that are necessary for development of AI in public interest and

for real world impact. I could think of no better person than Dr. Professor Sorov Ger under whose leadership I think we have come a long way in not just the intellectual thinking but as he will

tell you in terms of operationalizing how we can bring this to life for billions in the global south and also the other countries in the world. Dr. Sorav please for your keynote.

&gt;&gt; Uh thank you. Um and uh colleagues, panelists, uh great to be here and uh great to see a large the the kind of attendance that we've seen over the past few days in the

AI summit. Uh [clears throat] there were seven working groups set up u under the AI summit uh umbrella. Uh and one of them was on democratizing AI

resources. I had the privilege to uh chair that group along with Kenya and Egypt. So I'll obviously talk a bit on that. But before that uh uh just to say that uh I think uh all of us are uh of

the opinion that AI uh will definitely transform the world. I think the question is whether that transformation would be equitable, would be inclusive and aligned with public interest. And I

think that's really the issue which uh concerns a lot of people. Uh the AI summit itself was built around three guiding sutras the people, planet and progress.

And uh therefore the concept being that AI ultimately must serve human welfare, advance sustainable development and enable shared prop prosperity. I think uh these would be key uh background in

the way these sutras were developed and obviously um democratizing many of these resources would be key to that. Uh during our working group discussions, we had uh the opportunity to talk to a

large number of countries uh uh people from academia, civil society and other international organizations. And I think one consistent message was that uh most countries are not really

seeking only uh access to AI but also uh seeking agency in AI and I think that's uh key and how the AI systems uh need to reflect uh each country's own development priorities, languages and

social contexts. Uh from these discussions there were six foundational pillars that uh we uh thought need to form the backbone of the collective road map for the future. Uh

compute uh capability, collaboration, connectivity, compliance and context. And I'll just briefly speak on each one of these a bit. Uh compute no doubt is today's defining

barrier. uh the access to GPUs, accelerators, high performance clusters um is a ma major issue for all AI ecosystems. But the issue is how it can be made

distributable, affordable and reliable across and not concentrated in a few geographies. And this would no doubt require us to look at whether compute can become a shared infrastructure in

future a kind of a which supports public interest innovation and to the extent that we are focusing on innovation uh how that part can be uh a public interest uh infrastructure.

Secondly, infrastructure would not be sufficient. Uh there is a widening skills skills gap. So how we can consider capability diffusion focusing on joint research, shared standards,

open platforms and mutual learning. Uh what needs to be done for this responsible deployment is so that we can link innovators to compute resources and citizens to trustworthy AI enabled

services. Equally important would be governance. uh that the governance framework needs to be robust enough to build trust yet flexible enough to adapt to diverse

social and cultural uh contexts. Uh open source and maybe modular AI stacks would help in enabling localizing with localization without creating dependency.

Uh so [clears throat] looking at some of these issues uh on what mechanisms can be done to facilitate accessible and affordable computing resources by improving

utilization rates and reducing transaction costs and also to lower barriers for access regardless of geography. The working group uh looked at how this

can be taken forward through a collaborative platform uh designed to expand access through shared shared access through to compute data and partnerships

and the uh platform has been termed as MERI which is friendship in Hindi. Uh Maitri Mi Tri standing for multi-stakeholder AI for trusted and resilient infrastructure.

to be developed as a a digital public good that countries can adopt uh customize and build upon and obviously uh it is non-binding voluntary modular approach depending on the context of

each country what kind of uh compute and what kind of uh methods can be used to have accessible at least for innovators and researchers looking at data sets that can be uh put out uh which are uh

take care of the national laws and uh national uh protocols in place and uh look at models what which are open source and which can be uh placed. So this uh this we envisage would help to

at least uh ensure that portions of AI are a global public hold because we we we are focusing on innovation and research out here and uh this would go beyond just a focus on hardware and

platforms but also in skills institutions and governance uh uh capacity. uh I would just [clears throat] like to uh mention uh one area that

how perhaps it might proceed in future is also the fact that uh while infrastructure or compute seems to be the biggest constraint going forward as of now that's perhaps also based on the

present models requiring large amounts of uh compute capacity and energy. uh going forward would models retain this uh system of algorithms that they have or would there be obviously small domain

specific niche models. Uh I think yesterday uh there was a very nice remark made by uh Vishal Sikka uh who mentioned that unlike in when we talk of compute infrastructure we are

talking in terms of gawatt nothing less than that of whatever but when you talk of a human being you talk in terms of only 2,000 calories requiring a human being to sustain

itself which is not more than a 100 watt bulb for a for a So, so what so are we are we missing something out here and and and I think I think that's a very important point that

he made yesterday and that's why the focus I think we need to have much more on the models and that itself might solve a lot of uh the areas that we are and when we talking of democratizing AI

perhaps that's that's the path forward. So I'll stop here and thank you all thank you for this opportunity. We now transition to the panel discussion and uh may I request Andrew

VP at the Rockefeller Foundation who is the moderator for the panel please join us here on the stage. Um may I request other panelists Dr. Shiko Gau Martin Martin Tisnney uh Villas to join us on

stage. Yes. And Sean. Um, sorry &gt;&gt; Andrew, over to you. &gt;&gt; Great. Well, thank you, Dr. Gog, for those inspiring remarks and for the

framing, insight, and perspective that you bring to this conversation and all of the many conversations that you've had throughout the course of the week. So, we're excited to continue and deepen

the conversation today and very excited that we have five of the world's brightest minds to discuss this topic. Um, these are all people that have been in the AI arena for decades. This is not

new to them and all people that have deep regional expertise and global perspectives. So, very excited for this conversation today. Uh, we don't have a lot of time. We have about 25 or 30

minutes for the conversation. So, we're going to dig in. And we're not going to have a number of speeches. Dr. Gerg's speech will be the only speech that you've heard today. Um, but we'll have a

a short series of provocations, but with actionable ideas for how we can move this agenda forward. And so hopefully this conversation can be, you know, uh, informal back and forth banter. I think

we'll have one round of questions, but it'd be great if we could kind of feed off of each other's questions and energy because I know we all have a lot to say here on the panel and a lot of expertise

to share. So I'll briefly introduce the panelists then we'll we'll dig in. You you've already met Dr. Gerg. He's the secretary of the ministry of statistics and program implementation for the

government of India. He has been instrumental in shaping India's AI governance and previous led the technology stack for the transformative adar initiative. We have Martin Tis uh

founder of current AI and public interest envoy for France's AI action summit. Martin has spent 15 years building multistakeholder initiatives like the open government partnership

that we had talked about earlier today to govern technology based on democratic values. Have uh Villis Dar, president of the Patrick J. McGovern Foundation. Villa serves as on the UN Secretary

General's high level advisory board on AI and leads one of the world's largest philanthropic commitments to AI for public purpose. My friend Dr. Shik Gatau, founder and

CEO of Kala AI, a visionary from Kenya. She established Safariccom Alpha and has been a leading voice in ensuring that digital transformation in Africa solves real problems in education, healthcare,

and agriculture. And finally, Sean Siao, CEO of Philanthropy Asia Alliance. Shawn is working to catalyze collaborative philanthropy [snorts] across Asia, leveraging deep expertise from his time

at TESC and as CEO of Media. So, we'll continue the conversation. First question will go to Dr. Gurg. Um, uh, India has launched the India AI mission with a target of 38,000 GPUs.

If we view compute as a public utility much as we do with water and electricity, what is the governance model that India is envisioning? And should be should compute access be

rationed or priced differently for public interest applications? &gt;&gt; Yeah. So I would [clears throat] I would say that uh the focus is not on rationing but on intelligent

prioritization. I think uh that's that's going to be the focus that uh the impute capacity is an enabling uh platform. Um and as as I mentioned as a as a digital public good at least as far innovation

and research is going so that uh we focus and and I think that's where a lot of the philanthropic organizations would have a large role to play given that uh their focus is also on

ensuring that AI benefits all. So uh with that focus in view how governments, philanthropic organizations and uh the private sector can collaborate to ensure that uh affordable compute capacities

are accessible to all. Uh I think that's the models uh that uh we are looking at and uh uh and and that will ensure experimentation going forward. &gt;&gt; That's great. Thanks Dr. G. Martin. I'll

I'll go over to you. uh through current AI and the Paris charter, you've convened governments to discuss public interest AI. How do we move nations from being consumers to genuine co-creators?

And quickly, you've also spoken about this looming data bottleneck. Uh what do we do to unlock data sets for training without compromising privacy? &gt;&gt; Okay, two big questions. Thank you. Um

so, as you mentioned, we launched current AI last year. Um, we'll be launching just this afternoon our first product which is an open hardware product looking at linguistic diversity.

I think I'll be a little bit provocative to maybe start our session. I think comput is critical um for obvious reasons. I think that from a financial from an innovation and

from a sovereignty perspective it is also possible to overplay it. I'll tell you what my worry is and I'd love to know what the panel thinks. I do have a worry that we could end up in a few

years time in a world where we succeed in having compute capacity in inverted commas in a number of countries including in the global south but where effectively the data centers are not

used. We've been talking to colleagues around the world. You do also have data centers that effectively kind of white elephants and that are not used at full anywhere close to full capacity. And so

I think for countries to be able to exercise sovereignty, we need they need to have contextual AI. They need to have contextual data in their languages with all of the diversity and the incredible

richness that typifies their cultures available in order to create contextual localized AI that actually serves outcomes that people care about. And so while the compute piece is important, I

think it's one part of the issue. we need to talk about the data piece and we need to talk about the second part is the open source one. So briefly um I think throughout the event people talk

about open source AI that it's a really good thing that we'll pro it. I think we also need to talk about how from a philanthropic perspective we resource the open source ecosystem. The reality

of open source software is it's mostly the top tier of open software is funded by large companies that are using it. Right? Linux is partly funded effectively by volunteers working for

SpaceX that are using it. There's a bottom tier of dependencies in open source that are run on a shoestring you know by a few like critical amazing people working overnight as volunteers

and there's very few organizations one of them which is a partner to current AI roost which looks at robust open source trust and safety that are funding those critical dependencies. So I think that

um for for for states across the world in the global south in the north to really be able to exercise sovereignty and I'd love to talk about this a bit before but I don't want to hog the mic.

We need to talk about compute but also we need to be realistic about what the compute is going to be used for. So I think the data piece and the open source piece are really important. I think I've

probably run out of time to talk about the data bottleneck. So &gt;&gt; go for it. &gt;&gt; Go for it. Well I so the number of people in the room I've worked with for

a long time on this issue. Vas you're you're one of them. So shant another I won't name check everyone I think it's um fantastic that there's been so much innovation in compute and we've seen

such change over the past 10 years in contrast I think it's a complete tragedy that we haven't seen as much anywhere near as much innovation when it comes to data and specifically the ability for

people to be able to share personal data in ways that are both respective um sort of respect privacy and contribute to outcomes and and that's effectively it I think we need huge amount more sort of

like resources and thought both when it comes to the technical side of the issue and here other than the side I think that partly it's solved but enterprise users of AI have access to these kind of

like technical safeguards in a way that private users don't and there's a story there we can talk about if we have time and then on the governance side so for example Velas you and I have talked for

a long time about difference in Sashant and others different um forms of data stewardships whether data trusts or others to the day I haven't seen one that really scales to the level that we

would want to see it scale to. And that I think we need a lot more resources, a lot more thinking. Um there's been work done, but if we could harness even 20% of the sort of like brain capacity of

the world that's going into compute right now, I think we would be in a very different place. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Excellent. Thanks, Martin. Actually, Villis, I'll go next to you because I

think this reminds me a little bit about a recent article you wrote about the Indian Premier League as a model for how India builds worldclass institutions. I reread it this week in preparation for

this conversation. Um, is there a similar IPL playbook for public interest compute or is the window for building these public institutions closing as commercial consolidation accelerates?

&gt;&gt; Well, I can't think of a more controversial topic to spend our time here in this conversation than cricket. It's been a it's been a good week all around, but I think many of the people

in this room probably know. Um, before I start, I just want to say Dr. Gar, I want to acknowledge in particular your leadership on this work. Um, I spend a lot of time with senior decision makers

across governments and the conversations that we have had have really given me great hope for the combination of technological competence but also understanding what this means across an

ecosystem. And so I want to acknowledge your leadership in particular. Thank you. Um, look, this question around the IPL I think is great, right? I mean, let's not torture the analogy and take

something really fun and then try to like tie it to AI. But, um, here's what I'll say about it. I think in many ways um what we need is a new institutional framework that goes from the elites who

are participating in their own places to something that feels deeply participatory and I think around compute infrastructure in particular we are stuck in a model where we keep

re-engaging and renovating old concepts and try to describe a new world. I will tell you sovereignty has been the buzzy word of the moment, right? Everybody wants to talk about sovereignty and

diffusion. Sovereignty as a Westfailian concept that goes back a few centuries tries to take the idea that ownership of pieces of silicon somehow magically results in outcomes and impact that

transform lives. Now there are logical links and of course there are codependencies but to simply say that we will site compute in a particular geography and so figure out a way to

disconnect ourselves from the interdependence of the 21st century doesn't really bring us to a good outcome. I'll tell you the second part of this AI diffusion. If you haven't

heard this already every tech CEO here this has been the buzzword of the moment. I spent some time yesterday with the prime minister and a number of tech CEOs who wanted to talk about their

investments in India. Those investments in many ways followed the playbook of the PR press release. They were we're going to build a new data center. We're going to invest in a new compute

capacity. But when you dig deep and you ask the next question, who will this really benefit? What value does this create for public impact and outcome? How does putting a large number of

servers in a particular place result in that community finding an economic uplift, a benefit in economic opportunity, a sense of dignity? The conversation sometimes call falls flat.

So AI diffusion to me in its core concept, the idea that you hyperconentrate technological capacity compute data and somehow the rest of the society benefits

sounds a little too much like something that as an American I know too intimately as trickle down economics. The idea that if we made the rich as rich as possible, somehow the benefits

would filter down to everybody else and would work. AI diffusion is a passive concept. It starts on the premise that we build technological capacity for a few and somehow it works out for

everybody else. But there's an alternate model and it ties directly to this report that's been issued today and the work that we've been talking about. For AI to benefit everyone requires a direct

and active impact. It requires us to step in and say what are the institutions we have to build that actually physically and metaphorically transform the idea of compute

infrastructure to be something that everybody can use. It requires us to build the institutional layers and the capacity that lets a community that's trying to solve a local problem know

that compute isn't the thing that holds them back. Rather, the conceptualization of the problem, the aggregation of the full stack of resource sets as Martin described that include compute that

include data governance mechanisms that include the political agency of communities to participate and let us then turn that into that final app solution infrastructural development

that actually leads to the outcome we're solving for. In many ways, I think this is the great role of the institutions that are represented here on the stage and in this room for philanthropies to

transform the capital landscape in a way that says great entrepreneurs and leaders like my dear friend Chico here and so many here in India that are building open-source public access AI

stacks don't have to worry about the resource constraints of the private capital markets that they know that they can access governmental and substantive structural resources that let them build

the tools that they want to and know that they have equitable access to the markets. as well as a matter both of policy and as a product that they can go out and get to consumers and creators

that they can provide a service that let people use it at scale. And the last part of this and I have to say this is this doesn't happen as we've discussed in the private market but it also

doesn't happen exclusively by going to frontline nonprofits and saying now you're supposed to be the builders. It requires us to innovate a new institutional set of intermediaries. I

think of groups like Kulpa impact which I think is an incredible example of a combination of technical sophistication, policy impact, support for government that actually sits at the layer that

connects these different elements and lets us build on top of it. I think this is the work that's ahead. If we really think about pragmatic outcomes to this conversation, Andrew, I think one of the

questions we might ask is what are the institutions we need to build in the next 12 months that connect the dots around all of these different pieces and support this transformation at scale?

never short of ideas or insights or provocation. Thanks, Villis, very much for for that. And I think I'll go next. Uh uh Dr. Shiku. Um I came across a recent article that you put out there

saying that for the west AI is a matter of efficiency, but for you it's a matter of life or death. Um you've been a champion for AI access. You were very active in this summit. You were very

active in the Kaggali summit. we were together at the launch of the first ever AI factory for Africa together in April and Kaggali. Um you've also talked about global tech companies if they want

African data they should provide compute infrastructure in return. How do we formalize these reciprocal agreements and what does a true India Africa partnership look like that doesn't just

reciprocate global north south models similar to what Villis was just talking about. &gt;&gt; Awesome. Thank you very much for having me. It's always uh fun to listening to

everyone here on this. So, I was hoping somebody's going to preempt some of the work that I was going to talk about, but lucky for me, I have some stuff to talk about. Thank you, Vas. Um, so when we

when you talk about compute, it's this amorphous thing. In fact, we launched an AI research lab in Nairobi and we have some GPUs there. And one of the key things was like a demo showing up what u

what a GPU is. And our PS was like, "Oh my god, this is what a GPU." Because he's never seen a GPU. and asked and then I made sure like every time I'm speaking I'm asking how many of you have

actually have seen a GPU not on the internet touched one maybe five people and this is everywhere every single room that we're talking about compute we ask the same question

have you ever seen a GPU and sure enough five to 10 people so it's this thing that people talk about we need GPUs we need compute we need all of these things And for us it is very important as an

African continent. We had like a research colloquium for the global south a few days ago. Same question. How many of you about 10 people had ever touched a GPU? How many of you need uh compute?

Everybody raise of their hand. But what does that actually mean? In fact, one of the panels the starting point was like when it comes to compute, we all need Jesus. And I thought how do we quantify

this? So we and I think we have already spoken to Kalpa about this. We're working I think on the same time about a framework. So we just released a compute demand index because we realized every

time you speak about compute people have ideas they have thoughts they have proposals they don't have the numbers to to say that we need GPUs how many we need megawatt and the gigawatt megawatt

conversation. What does that a gawatt of compute actually mean? So we went ahead and said for Africa we need to every time we having conversations with these governments this is actually what you

need but you actually you need to put money into it. So we we our first index was digit demand index and the second one is is your country country ready for this compute which is we're calling AI

um investment readiness index. So I'll give you some numbers. Africa needs 2.5 million hours of GPU hours a year. 7.5 million for the next three

years to be able to start competing. Well, this is for training as well as research that is something that I can work with. So when I come to India and say I need

2.5 million GPU hours a year how many of them can you give me and we had this conversation with the UNP and Italy and they said oh we have 1.5 million GPU hours that we can donate we have 1.1

million more to go no Cava is saying we are putting 2,000 uh GPUs how many hours of GPUs with those GPUs hours not not actual physical how many hours of GPUs without those 2,000 GPUs actually

provide for the continent so we need to be starting very practical rather than being arbitrary on what we we want. Of these 7 million 7 million GPU GPU hours we need in the next three years, Africa

only has 5% of that. So we were doing the maths that's we we only have 125,000 of these GPU hours a year which is like times three of that for the next three years. So when you're

solving you're not when I go to vas I'm saying I need this GPU hours. It's very practical is I'll say I can be able to do half a million GPU hours. So it's not just going with an arbitrary number. I

need GPU hours to be able to put this and for us that is important but for me it is the conversion about investment and that's the conversion that you asked. How how do we have this south

south collaboration? How does do we have this India collaboration? How does it actually look like there's the paradox everybody as he said as Martin said everybody wants

sovereignity. Everyone wants to talk about dusion of of of uh of AI, but what does that actually mean? Do we actually need it? Yeah. So, I I I'll give two examples of my two favorite countries.

Hopefully, none of them is here. Actually, Nigeria. So, there's something we're calling the Nigerian paradox. Nigeria is the number one country in the compute demand index. Why? Nigeria is

doing very well. It's 110 million uh internet users, a huge population. They're doing very well in terms of like e-commerce, finan financial services. So they're up there when it comes to why

they need compute and we've seen this in India. India is very high there as well when you you're doing the same exact thing. But what about investment readiness and investment readiness is

are they able to or capable of running a compute facility? Do they have power? Do they have uh the talent? And and I love I think both Maten and the and the minister spoke

about what we think about when you think about comput you don't think about just GPUs. It's a whole stack of of things. It's talent. It's governance. It's all these things. And you're thinking about

investment readiness when it comes to compute. You have to look about all these things because I can give you GPUs as he said and I've worked in digital transformation for the last 20 years and

I work for the AFDB as a digital transformation lead and we'll buy computers and go three years later and they have never been powered at all. And that's the case that is

going to be with GPUs because you're going to give countries these GPUs. If they don't have talent, they don't have the power to run it, they don't have the data sets, they don't have models, they

have use cases to build on top of it, you're wasting that money. And that's where the uh investment readiness comes in. So we're talking to countries and we've had this conversion to African

countries is there's no point of investing your all your dollars in putting a compute facility. Get your talent ready. Get your data sets ready. Have strong use cases that

people can back. Then when with all of that then can we then define what a demand demand you need. You don't need a gigawatt. Kenya you do not need a gawatt of of compute to be able to run. Maybe

you you need a 200 megawatt facility and that's where we want. So coming back to the question how do we interact with India is looking this is our demand burundi might need 50 megawatt

of GPU can India be able to facilitate that but it's not just about facilitating the GPU it's what is the GPU in service of solving for health education agriculture

and when you have like clear use cases then the GPU demand becomes an obvious ask and I think bridging that and convincing governments especially or bridging gaps that gap [clears throat]

is what we need to be able to do and then the governance um framework actually comes to play. Thank you. I know that's a lot. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's great. Thank you. Thank

you. Thank you, Dr. Shik. Uh we go to Sean and then you know I want to keep it kind of informal for the remaining 10 minutes after Sean speaks. So any reactions to any of the comments and

then we can do a lightning round if we have time. But if we if we don't have time, that's fine as well. Um Sean, over to you. The the Philanthropy Asia Alliance brings together. You have 80

members and partners to address Asia's interconnected challenges through collaborative philanthropy. Is there an opportunity for Asia's philanthropic networks to coordinate shared compute

and infrastructure pulling resources from places like India, [clears throat] Indonesia, and other nations rather than competing and and what would unlock that collaboration?

&gt;&gt; Thanks, Andrew. The advantage of coming glass is that I could say, "Oh, I agree with all of them." Actually, I'm going to add to the much maligned word called compute. Maybe we could we could end the

panel right away. I'm going to join Martin in actually agreeing that um compute is actually a bit overrated. The ownership of compute especially. So, when you think about the stack, I'm

going to add another way to frame the conversation. Jensen Hang's uh AI stack. When you think about energy, hardware, compute, models and applications and the top layer applications is really what

will drive and value capture for the economics as well as the impact social impact. really the stumbling block is probably energy at the bottom level and

thankfully for many countries in Asia um the costs have been driven down because of the abundance of hydro solar and and wind um then when you think about the next layer of hardware I mean that's

obviously dominated by China Chinese and and American players and when you think about the compute level then I I understand why we fast over compute because the Americans own what 75% of

the GPU cluster performance. Uh the Chinese 15%, Europeans maybe about 4%. And the rest of us are only like not.1%. I think even India is just up 1% of that. But I think the issue is actually

deeper than just the ownership. I mean if you think about what it gets what it needs to get the work done is more access. So the question you've posed me about sharing of um compute for example

between Indonesia and India um I live in Southeast Asia and that's why Indonesia is like couple of hours away from from where I live and uh we know the situation in Indonesia quite uh

intimately there's data residency requirements and that's why there's a buildout of data centers think also of the physical limitations of actually the latency of

sharing compute between India and Indonesia for example 10,000 kilometers apart when you think about the latency of what 50 to 100 milliseconds it's not just not going to

work uh for the sharing of compute between Indonesia and and and and India attractive as the idea is it doesn't work I think they're just physical limitations data sovereignty privacy

issues that prevent that from happening so I just want to look at the positive side of what's happening when you think about the cost of compute is coming down when you think about the emergence of uh

new clouds uh GPU for a service I think these developments are actually going to be good for the unleashing of AI for social impact for economic capture. So the way you can think about it is how do

we then make it a little bit more accessible uh for startups for impact organizations. Maybe the way to think about it is really how do you think about aggregating demand so that you can

actually negotiate against the with the new cloud providers and get a cheaper pricing. How do you then think about philanthropy coming in to subsidize some of the compute costs? And I think I

can't agree more with the observation that you really need to go beyond just infrastructure. you need to think about the ecosystem you're building. I think the skill uh gap in Asia is actually

huge and uh that could be really what's stopping us from really optimizing maximizing the power of AI in what we want to do. &gt;&gt; Great.

&gt;&gt; Is that too long? &gt;&gt; No, that's that's perfect. Um not sure if anybody wants to react to any of that. Martin, I see you uh scribbling furiously. Maybe first your reaction to

you. &gt;&gt; No, I am scribbling. I I'm thinking I'm scribbling because I'm thinking about your points. I'm thinking about the points of the panel and I'm thinking

about the term sovereignty. I so my scribbles are philosfelian concept of sovereignty that's about the ability to make law within your territory right and it's a

very global north concept and it's a notion of territory which has like physicality and I'm just what I was scribbling was the physicality of the territory it's like we're very focused

on the physicality as you were saying on the GPUs of the bricks and mortar. So, we're going to be okay because we're going to be sovereign on this data center. The data center, it's on my

territory. And what got me thinking is other concepts of um of sovereignty such as when I was spending a lot of work working on on data collaboratives and data stewardship thinking about

indigenous data sovereignty which is a different type of concept. It's a more relational concept than a territorial concept, right? It's about a pre-existing an inherent authority, a

relational authority over that which makes up a people. And so when we were studying, for example, indigenous data sovereignty in the Mari context in New Zealand, the Mar community,

any data that in any way involves Mari, the Marun's um legacy is part of the MR community. So I think that there's something here in thinking about a very in some ways a

quite rigid approach to sovereignty which is about control right as mentioned and one which is more about agency and which is more relational. So that's what I that's what the panel has

got me thinking and and it's I've been doing some writing and thinking with with colleagues and friends around the notion um not of a sort of like a controlled national stack but a global

open open resilient collaborative stack and that's not one at all and just I'll finish with that that doesn't mean that like all the data is open and anything goes and anyone can extract your

personal data and you're back in a sort of Zubof you know surveillance capitalism world. It's one where it's a question of choice and agency and the what you wish to access exercise

authority over and how that might that's my scribbles. &gt;&gt; I love this and &gt;&gt; thank you. &gt;&gt; As you can tell when we get on a panel

with people you love and respect the conversation just flows. So I want to build off this point and a little bit of what you said Chico. Um I want to take a different tack to this question of

agency which is um if I had asked any development leader in the world 10 years ago if you could have your dream of an extra gigawatt of energy capacity in your country what would you do with it?

&gt;&gt; I can't imagine that any of them would have said well I want to use it to run a bunch of computation on things that may or may not have short-term economic value for my country. Andrew, your

organization has been incredible around the world at building capacity in grids, in power production, in ensuring that people can use power for development and yet somehow I think for many of us um we

are surrounded by conversations where now the question has become how many megawatts and gigawatts can you put into compute for AI. &gt;&gt; It is a fundamental challenge when you

think about what are our priorities in development. Again going back to core principles of human rights and dignity and participation to say governments who have limited capacity should now all of

a sudden be focused on this topic. It brings us again from this question and the shift. Um in many ways I acknowledge that the traditional conversation around compute is one of breaking over

dependence on the American AI stack on other international players that are coming in. But the response to overdependence isn't internal dependence. It's interdependence.

It's saying if there are places that have incredible capacity and even potential to drive as Chico said the availability of compute hours, how do we build interconnectedness that lets that

be a mutual value exchange? Not merely again clients who have to go to another country and say please give or let us buy compute but rather the products of that compute are going to be the build

the infrastructure that you can then use in your own country to allow for centers of excellence that allow for local capacity and local competence to drive what gets built and to allow that to be

the new tokens of international trade in a way that leads to a much more connected and shared prosperity rather than descending back to that 200-year-old concept of how do we make

sure that we're competitive in an adversarial frame. I recognize that what I've just shared with you is maybe not where the dominant private sector conversation is. And to those who would

oppose it, the primary critique is, well, that sounds quite naive. And yet, we've seen it happen, right? We're seeing it in the few areas of hope in the multilateral system where we're

actually finding that technology governance is something that brings everybody to the table that lets people engage in meaningful shared outcomes. We're seeing the seeds of it. The

question is whether we're going to let them sort of die out in the sun or if we're actually going to water them, invest in them, and let them grow. &gt;&gt; Great. Uh Dr. Dr. Gugg any uh any final

insights that &gt;&gt; I know I know there's a little time but just one thing I would say that perhaps we need to spend a bit more time going forward on the frameworks uh that will

help ensure public interest frameworks looking at things beyond compute looking at models looking at talent looking at uh data how that can be shared and interoperable and in a manner which

takes care of public interest so I'll just stop it out there &gt;&gt; well well thank you thank you to the Indian government Uh thanks to our partners at Kalpa for putting this

together, especially for the authors. This is uh now officially out there. I think you have until March 31st to read the copies are available out there. You have until March 31st to review the

document and submit your uh reactions. Thank you to the panelists. Really appreciate it. Enjoy the rest of the summit. Thank you. &gt;&gt; [applause and cheering]

&gt;&gt; I think the India team wants to uh hand over some souvenirs from the panel.
