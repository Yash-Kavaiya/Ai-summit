## 📝 Transcript

Convergence of AI, telecom and data sovereignity all weaved around the digital public infrastructure. I'm Dish. I represent GSMA. I'll request Julian Gman, head of APAC

GSMA to give his keynote address and then we start with the panel discussion. Julian. &gt;&gt; Good morning everyone. Um warm welcome distinguished guests, colleagues and

partners and the speakers who joined us today. Uh it's a great honor to actually open this session for GSMA. Uh GSMA for those don't know is the global organization uniting the mobile economy.

Um mobile that means mobile operators and the ecosystem uh to unlock the power of connectivity so industry and society thrive. And uh this session really goes to the core of that around intelligent

networks, intelligent telecom network for digital public infrastructure. A topic that sits right at the intersection of where the telecom industry is heading and where national

digital public infrastructure um are being built. Of course, India is really at a pivotal point in its digital journey and a key player in this space. uh they've been on the digital public

infrastructure journey for a lot longer than the rest of us, but over the last decade uh we've really seen the rise of uh digital public infrastructure recognized um from identity and payments

to digital commerce and data empowerment and has shown the world what is possible when scale, innovation and public purpose come together. Um it has delivered inclusion, trust, economic

impact at a level few countries have achieved. But as we enter this next phase uh which is shaped by AI, real-time data and increasingly autonomous systems, we need to ask a

fundamental question and that is what are the role the telecom networks play um in this new digital infrastructure. For years, networks were viewed simply as connectivity providers. Uh and that

view is changing. Today's mobile networks are becoming intelligent, programmable, and trusted layers of the national infrastructure. And they're shaping how AI AI models perform and

will perform and how services are optimized at the edge, how fraud is stopped before it happens, and how digital identity remains secure in a world of growing complexity. In India,

networks already support core DPI functions, identity verification, payments, emergency response, and major public service platforms. As AI becomes embedded in these systems,

the networks don't sit back anymore in in the background. It becomes part of the decision-making fabric providing context and priority for tokens or the critical elements of data which digital

public infrastructure information is the predecessor of. Through this, the network becomes a contributor to governance, resilience, and trust. And that brings us to the second major theme

of the day, digital sovereignty. In an AIdriven world, sovereignty is no longer just about where the data is stored. It's about having strategic control over the infrastructure, the standards,

increasingly the intelligence that underpins the national digital system. Countries want to know how do we build AI enabled public infrastructure that is safe, interoperable and aligned with

national priorities while still remaining connected and interoperable with global markets and innovation. This is exactly where global standards matter. fragmentation whether technical,

regulatory or geopolitical slow us down interoperability, open APIs, harmonized frameworks help countries scale uh conf confidently while staying part of the global digital economy.

India is uniquely positioned to show how this balance can be achieved. Open yet sovereign, scalable yet secure, national in ambition but global in design. And our goal today is not just to talk about

these themes. It is to translate them into direction to identify practical next steps to create space for collaboration and to learn from India's experience in ways that matter for

economies that are at every stage of digital development. So I'm looking forward to the discussion and to the concrete actions we can shape together and I look for the very very big

contributions from the panel today and also to hear more from the audience later. So thank you Debish. I hand over to you. &gt;&gt; Thank you Julian. [applause]

Thanks for the opening remarks. Uh am I audible? Looks like yes. So uh let let's begin. We have uh you know a fantastic panel here of experts.

So uh let let's start uh with this discussion. So what we have seen over the past you know few decades that uh telecom networks have evolved. Yeah, we evolved

a lot from just enabling voice to powering mobile broadband to becoming the trusted digital infrastructure that we use today underpinning the modern economies, right? So today's network are

no longer passive carriers of data, right? uh they are becoming intelligent platforms where AI is deployed either as an add-on or embedded already into the network where digital identity is

authenticated where fraud is mitigated where sovereigntity over data and decision-m is increasingly exercised as India's advances in digital public infrastructure and its AI ambitions you

know the key is how we ensure these systems remain trusted interoperable and globally compatible while avoiding fragmentation and duplication And that is the conversation which we aim to

explore today. [snorts] Let let me start with uh Rahul who is the chief regulatory officer for AEL. Rahul we often talk about uh digital public infrastructure as uh you know

applications and platforms but at the foundation sits the network you know which you drive. So from ATL's perspective, what makes the telecom networks uniquely positioned as India's

trusted infrastructure layer beyond just connectivity? &gt;&gt; Thank you Debashish and uh GSMA uh for this particular session. It's a session of particular interest uh to me uh uh as

a user in the digital ecosystem and of course uh to the entire uh uh you know digital fraternity uh because if there's one thing uh which India is doing great it's really the digital public

infrastructure to the extent that president Mark yesterday actually mentioned about it it's the biggest export which India has done you know across the globe. So let's talk

[clears throat] about what's really happening uh today. If you look at the data of January alone, uh India transacted 28 lakh crores rupees of money uh through its

UPI infrastructure. Uh it was spread across a billion people and all this is happening on what? On what is the foundation layer? It is the foundation layer is the connectivity and so for us

at AEL uh this is not just a plumbing job. It's the very heart of the foundation we are laying for trust. How are people transacting this much amount of money because they trust the

ecosystem through which they really want to do this. And so beneath this layer is really the connectivity which has powered the country. Look at the numbers of connectivity in a country

[clears throat] like ours. We have got more than a million BTSs powering the entire uh uh you know country. uh we have got more than 500 lakh kilometers of fiber running across in various

shapes and forms across the country. Uh we have got as a industry more than a thousand edge and large hypers scale data centers. Now can you imagine each of the mobile switching center carries a

load of at least 30 to 40 to 50 million people sometimes or even larger at times. So this is the scale with which you know the infrastructure is becoming the layer with which uh we are

operating. What is all this enabling? Let's look at that. What it is enabling is every transaction you do there is a OTP or a SMS which is coming out. Right? So this OTP and this SMS is what it's a

layer of trust that people are trusting the message which they are trying to get on their system. Let's look at uh the Aadhaar enabled payment system. More than 500 million rupees done on that

alone and how is that enabled through a connectivity which is happening in less than 2 milliseconds. Right? Right. So this again is an example of that same ecosystem. Uh let's go further. What's

really happening and how are we doing? I don't know how many of you actually visited the ETL stall. We have got solutions where banks can use the telco indicators to make a smart choice about

giving you loans. Right? We rank a person's history based on a low risk or a high risk which enables the bank to be able to take a smart you know decision in a matter of milliseconds. Remember in

India it's not the large loans which matter. lot of loans which are happening in this ecosystem are less than 200 lakh rupees right just two lakh rupees or below are also the large amount of loans

which happen uh there is a financial risk fraud indicator which the department has created banks can dip into that risk indicator and also get a score out of that to say okay what is it

that we are really you know trying to get out of this all this is what the layer is uh let's look at what we as telos are doing as telos are giving you trust to say that the call you are

giving call you're receiving is spamfree or not. Right? We have got a at least three products launched over last one year. We first launched our uh uh you know solution which warned you about a

suspected spam. Right? Then we went ahead we started blocking fraudulent links you know bases the large database we created with you know global players like Google and openfish and mavenire.

At the third stage we just launched around two weeks back. a very powerful product uh you know one of the reasons uh for spam is urgency that I'm calling you please share your OTP urgently right

and to remove that now we have created a friction right if you are on a call you get a flash message saying please be careful you are on a call you're receiving OTP this may be spam so it

creates a friction for those 30 seconds to say do you want to really do this or not all this is what this is uh reinforcement of the trust we want to create in the ecosystem

Let me go a little larger. Uh we are operating in large countries uh uh you know uh across the globe and one of the things we have been doing wonderfully well in Africa is to really take the

digital public infrastructure blueprints from India and take them to Africa. Uh so it's all about identity. It's about payments, you know, it's about how they are able to transact. And we have got a

solution called DPI inbox, right? Which we are in conversation with lot of African leaders to be able to transplant the India stack onto the African ecosystem. And how do we do that? We are

giving a bundle of hardware and a software. We are giving a very aircapped cloud to do that. and we are creating the entire ecosystem for them so that they are able to uh you know implement a

digital public infrastructure stack in their countries. So really uh Dashish it's it's it's it's about trust which we try to create with infrastructure layer but get smart and make people's life

easier and customers life easier is what we are really focused on. Thanks Rahul. Those were very uh uh key messages which you gave in which uh the network is being used for uh citizen centric

services. Um and that's how the network has evolved you know over the last few years. U coming to you Martin. Martin represents Boron idea. Um you heard Rahul speaking about how the network is

being used for you know various citizen centric services for fraud mitigation for you know u taking care of spams. [clears throat] A lot is being done by the mobile network operators, right? But

my question here is there's also a growing discussion globally today about avoiding parallel digital infrastructures. You know, India is building new DPI trust layers for

authentication and fraud prevention. How do we ensure that the efforts which the Moss the mobile network operators are are making adding layers how do we ensure that there is no you know that

these complement and not duplicate the operator capabilities like open gateway APIs that you know GSMA has. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So um in fact I uh was part of one of the entity which set up uh and

contributes to the largest GPI infrastructure today. I used to earlier be associated with NPCI uh and then moved on here to telco for the past 5 years now. So um the overall DPI infra

if I were to go by uh I would want to answer this in uh by bringing in four key words that I want to associate myself with in this one uh context and enrichment and the second thing that I

wanted to touch upon is serviceability and purpose. So when the entire DPA infrastructure evolved for the country it evolved with two core purposes to be addressed with right. So we were wanting

to take uh the entire digital infrastructure uh to reach the last mile civilian. We also had the objective of financial inclusion to be driven by the country. So the DPI framework was

created to meet these two core objectives. The role of a TSP in this uh by and large was to ensure that the goal of digital India and financial inclusion landed up reaching the masses. That's

the role that uh tsp played and with every net new tech evolution that has happened there are various things that come in fraud evolved. So because uh banking happened in doorstep fraud also

started happening in uh doorstep. You don't have to go and loot a bank today. You can loot uh thousands of uh individuals in the most easiest manner and fraud evolved that way. Right? So in

each of these context uh while we realize the digital India vision and the financial India uh financial inclusion for the country as a whole uh the DPI networks played a role TSPs played a

role to ensure that these realization come in handy. Now uh Rahul briefly touched upon few of them. Uh we are limited TSPs in the country three four of us uh comprehensively who work in

conjunction uh context. uh amongst us three we land up working together. So I still remember the those days when as from my previous entity going to TAI asking them to land up setting up how do

I find out fraudulent mobile numbers today we look at it as FRI which is exposed by uh the devote themselves today to multiple other financial institutes which can go and look up into

and then take a decision inclusive decision. uh there is something called as digital intelligence platform which again uh amongst all three collaborated uh TSP data which is uh converged and

provided by the DOT themsel to rest of the financial institutions to uh look into now all of these I will bring back my word around context right so these are information that multiple of us as

TSPs are able to provide collate and make it available who can consume any of these provider because fraud is not happening to me as tsp for me if there is a call that is connected between a

person A and a person B it's revenue to me but for a bank while in call something else is going that is a context and this context is something that you can provide back to enrich the

data and with this enriched data making a decision making for what do they want to I see an Aadhaar verification happening live from a location called uh A while At the same time there is a call

happening uh showing that the presence of the person is in B doesn't matter to a telco because for me both are actually revenue but for a authentication entity and versus a entity which is approving a

financial transaction they may consider them as a fraud. So the context and reenrichment of the context associated with the data tsp today has the ability to provide a large amount of

contextdriven information to these individual players whereby they can consume them for their own utilization and make active decisions. So that's the way that I I would want to try and

comment. One good part is at least uh all three of us four of us are operated in converge platform. We have done the experience with DT that we set up during the earlier days of spams. Uh now spams

spams were those days only un unwanted telemarketers uh messages that were coming it has evolved to spam. Now spam has become scam. So now we are working towards how do we overcome scam. Uh

beyond scam whatever comes now there are digital arrests uh humongous money being lost. So as TSPs we work in conjunction put them in order collaborate with the likes of COI and DOT to set up

infrastructure as open APIs and then allow these APIs as interfaceable for institutions who would want to take uh decisions appropriately. Rahul touched upon digital lending right so there is

not only if you look at countries serviced today by more than 1100 member banks across the country. We might be knowing as sitting in metros we might be remembering only few banks but uh to

service such a large nation we have 1100 member banks. Imagine these guys don't have to always go back to civil only and provide lending. You may want to relate back by postp consumers uh the quantum

of money that they pay frequently etc is an inclusive decision. Those are open APIs we are able to set up and India is in forefront to set it up uh and we have operated it way too well uh already is

what I would want. By by the way your team is also working extensively with the GSMA team on &gt;&gt; absolutely on on the GSMA open gate APIs many of them have been even certified

now I can tell you that &gt;&gt; thanks for you know that uh &gt;&gt; context in which you are talking about &gt;&gt; contextualization of data uh you know that that's again a you know unique

perspective that you're talking about moving on to Deepak Maheshwari Deepak represents CCP center for sentence uh center for social and economic progress is uh Deeper you know you have been

attending uh uh and speaking in this conference for the last couple of days uh you know data sovereignty I'm sure you is a term which you would have encountered several

times you know I I want to ask you uh this Deepak how should India define data sovereignty in an AIdriven DPI era beyond just data localization and control uh but control over standards

decision-m systems and long-term strategic autonomy. &gt;&gt; Thanks and thank you GSMA for having us here. When we are looking at this whole issue about digital sovereignty, data

localization, etc. And data localization itself, we could look at it in uh different ways. For example, it could be about just the physical location of the data. That's one that's very pretty

obvious one. The second is also about data context as uh matan was just mentioning in terms of what is a local context. So for example a lot of people think about data localization only in

terms of local languages but suppose you are seeing weather and it shows you weather in Hindi here in Delhi but of New York probably it might not be that useful. Okay. So you also need local

context and then beyond all these things off late what is happening is and again this is not such a new concept of of sovereignty as such. So people have been talking about sovereignty for a fairly

long time. Uh in of course the terminology the lexicon has evolved but this whole notion has offly become much more important. For example, even in India, we had the digital when we looked

at the previous versions of the data protection law. If you look at the previous reports which never be has become the policy which is the non-personal data framework again in all

those things we had this notion that India's data should remain in India. Another thing I mean in February 2019 7 years back we had something called draft e-commerce policy. Now the tagline of

that however was India's data for India's development it was not about commerce it was more about data okay so from that perspective when we look at today and even when I was member of the

mis committee in 2018 when first time the government set up a committee on AI again this whole thing came up that okay what about data here now this is something that we need to look at in

three different ways one is yes there's some sort of data which India should have within its own physical as well as administrative control. Okay. So

obviously things related to defense, national finances etc. you would like to do that. Second is as far as citizens data is concerned. Some of the data yes so UIDI voter database etc. Obviously

that type of thing yes but there's other type of data for which citizens themselves may like to exercise their choice and may like to their own agency in terms of using that data not only in

India but also outside India for example if I apply for a visa to another country I'll have to provide my data to that country okay so there's no way that it can happen without that and then the

third thing is in terms of business aspect when we look at now in terms of businesses on one hand we are saying in India and we are very proud of it that for past three decades we have emerged

as a global outsourcing hub where we are the global hub for data coming from all over the world and which is being processed here but at the same time if we try to create these walls around us

that okay India's data cannot go outside but we expect that outside data should continue to come in I think there's a challenge [clears throat] in that there's a dilemma in that there's a

datomy because these are walls if you create these walls and these are not walls because in fluid dynamics if we go back to our school physics the walls Walls

are something that do allow oneway traffic, not two-way traffic. But walls are two-way isolations. So that's another thing that we should keep in mind. So when we talking about digital

sovereignty within the context of AI, yes, obviously there are things that we do want to have here and we should continue to do that. But there are also things where we do need more

collaboration. So for example, one of the terms that you used was about control, standard control. I would like to control the standards so much as contribute to those standards. So for

example whether it is GSMA or CGPP ISO ITUL E etc. I mean so many other standard organizations uh whether they are plurilateral whether they are multistakeholder in whichever form they

all have certain mechanisms of people and countries to participate in that decision making. So rather than controlling that standard the effort should be the endeavor should be about

contributing to that standard making as a participant as a contributor and then evolve it. Obviously when you are contributing and you're collaborating you won't have everything your own way.

you'll have there'll always be inevitably some give and take because sovereignty by itself in a globalized world has a challenge because the moment we talk about any international

organization whether it is UN whether it's WTO whether it is ITU whether it is an organization like GSMA if you want to work there they'll have to we'll have to give up something to get something the

important thing is how do we create an institutional mechanism that we have are in a position that we whatever we are giving we believe that we are getting more than

that okay so there should be some sort of incentives around that and the last thing that I want to mention is that yes of late we have been talking about that uh India's uh digital public

infrastructure itself is sort of there's a massive digitalization which is happening but actually it is not so new it's more than one and a half centuries old because the

original telecom networks that came was in the telegraph era and that was also in Dawson dashes. Okay. So it was a binary world even at that time and people may or may not believe it but

India got its first submarine cable in the same year that the US got okay and that was in 1858 just four years after the first submarine cable came up first time

between UK and France. India got its first law way back in 1854. The first Indian telegraph act came in 1854. I've written a lot about this in this report. I mean it's available online at ces

website if people are interested using a 3C framework. So carriage content and conduct but what is more important is in this world of AI is not just the carriage which is of course fundamental

as I mentioned the carriage is fundamental because without that you just won't be able to do anything content what's going through it but more importantly in terms of conduct how do

we do things? Thank you &gt;&gt; Deepak. Beautiful insights and uh thanks for taking us back to the concept of walls and walls right [laughter]

um I I'd like to come to Many now sitting here is representing the World Bank. uh Mani from World Bank's uh you know experience uh you know we are talking about standards and you know we

are talking about uh you know [clears throat] the DPI era what are the risk you see when public digital infrastructure and private digital capabilities you know

Matan spoke about it briefly uh when these two uh you know the public digital infrastructure and private digital capabilities are built in silos and why and and why are global standards

essential in accelerating creating inclusive digital outcomes. &gt;&gt; Thanks and thank you GSMA. So I think a lot of it was already said may not have been articulated but the

there are natural uh there's this natural convergence that happens bringing people and companies and institutions together. One for trust that Rahul spoke about a lot. So systems

coming together help build trust and therefore having independent systems means there are more points of more vulnerability in the system. So systems come together to build trust. Systems

have to come together for efficiency. I think biggest economic argument against a lot of things that you were saying about why banks are coming together, why is data coming together. So, uh that is

the efficiency is the other thing and the third which was mentioned but again not articulated was innovation. So how mobile data is now becoming a source of data for lending. I mean why are we

using that as understanding credit risk and fraud risk uh and not something else. So there's innovation happening on something that was never understood to be for that purpose. So uh systems that

operate in silos whether it is the public sector or the private sector. &gt;&gt; Close it. &gt;&gt; Whether it's the public &gt;&gt; maybe it's

&gt;&gt; Oh, I didn't have it on. I'm sorry. Um I have a loud voice though. I I hope everyone was able to listen to me. But uh &gt;&gt; guys

&gt;&gt; uh so uh I I think the the risk of building uh systems in silos whether it is the public sector or the private sector is essentially missing out on efficiency capabilities, innovation

capabilities and bu building trusted ecosystems which is actually nothing but the foundations of digital public infrastructure. Uh you used standards uh I think the word bank works more towards

the ideas of blueprints. We've been doing a lot of uh work on trying to develop blueprints which are slightly more flexible, adaptable but bring together best practices from different

countries and see how they can be made more adaptable uh to different context. Something that uh Deep Paka was saying in his initial remarks that you you want to make systems that bring you the uh

operational ideas and principles but don't necessarily be prescriptive in terms of how they need to do some. So when you have a standard you know it's prescriptive and that's how the networks

are running. So for that you need a standard but when you're building systems I think the world bank is approaching it more from a blueprint point of view. So last year the bank

came up with a digital public infrastructure and development report where it articulated what it meant by digital public infrastructure. What are its principles? What are the objectives?

What is DPI? What is not DPI? uh and I think that's the way we are going to go ahead even with AI AI commons building common infrastructure [snorts] to be able to determine the pathways for the

future which countries can adapt to in their ways it need not necessarily become I mean I'm I'm just trying to distinguish between standards and blueprints here because standards then

get into ideas of commercialization and you know there's a there has to be a process uh around it and there's a whole private sector play here there's a private sector play and a public sector

play but the idea to work more on the approach than on a particular way of um running something. &gt;&gt; Thanks man. Um Rahul I come back to you. You um you heard about blueprints, you

heard about standards. Uh Deepak took us to walls and walls. Uh I want to bring the operator perspective uh back um for data sovereignity. So uh I'd like to ask you as EI moves deeper into uh network

operations, right? not just at the surface level. What does data sovereignity practically mean for an operator in terms of data storage and control, edge processing, um cloud

reliance, control of u the AI models. &gt;&gt; Yeah, thank you. Uh I think uh one of the biggest misconceptions we all have today is uh uh you know what exactly uh is is sovereignity.

uh and a lot of people confuse to say that any hyperscaler cloud if it is housed in India for example or that country becomes a sovereign uh you know infrastructure. I think nothing can be

away from truth than that statement. Uh why do I say that? I think if I have to define what is really sovereign for me, I will at least take three or four slices uh you know

into it. First slice for will be is the data residing in the country or not and the answer to that may be yes you know it may be residing in the country it's it's it's not a big deal hyperscaler

clouds do reside in the country uh the second indicator for me will be is there a digital sovereignity uh you know in that data and digital sovereignity for me will be is the

control plane of that cloud within India or not in India right uh how are you really controlling that data and the cloud and the answer to that is not a single hyperscaler will have the control

plane in this country. That's a that's that's the fact. The third indicator or a slice for me will be really about the operational sovereignity. So you are saying that you want to upgrade the

network, you want to put a patch on the network, right? You want to put a software in the network. Where are you doing it from? The fact is you are not doing it locally again. most likely you

are again doing it outside. The fourth indicator for me and a very important one is the jurisdictional sovereignity. Right? Today under the US cloud act for example is it not true that if the US

government so wants they can demand data. Now why should any other territorial power have a control on my data? Right? So for me while the answer for data sovereignity may be it is

locally residing but the fact is the control pane will not be in this country. The fact is that we will not have even the patches coming up within this country and the fact is that we'll

be subject to jurisdictional controls. So how are Telos you know getting aware about this? Only last week I read about DT you know Dshi Telecom uh and they just launched a sovereign cloud offering

in Europe. Why did they launch? And by the way 6 months ago Airtel launched its own uh sovereign cloud offering and the answer to us was very simple. We were already managing data of nearly 500

million people in our network and we realized where is this data housed? We said we are within our own networks. So we really have the capabilities to manage that complex data set. Then why

is it that I cannot offer the same thing to my customers right and that's where this whole sovereign and that's why Telos are having a renewed interest into getting into uh you know uh this the

sovereign situation. Why is it important? Uh and and let me be very selective about this. Do we need hyperscaler clouds in the country? I'm saying yes, we do need because if there

are efficiencies of scale, if there are better products to be used, why not? But tell me, why should a KYC data of my customer be sitting outside with somebody? Why should the health record

of citizens in this country be sitting outside this country? Why should any critical data set which relates to defense or security agencies sitting outside this country? I think we have to

get selective. We use the efficiencies of scale to the best party who's available to give that solution. But we should get selective on what data should reside and remain in control within this

jurisdiction. I think that is important part and that I think is a discussion we need to do. If I go to the market today, there are lot of players selling sovereign cloud but really I mean there

is there is no sovereignity which is involved. But I think uh AI rests on data right and we cannot take the right decisions on data if we cannot really control uh you know it in

the proper sense. uh we require dynamism in our regulations and policies but we also require uh you know sovereignity to be practiced uh in real sense for us to be able to do that cloud which we made

we do around 140 cr transactions per second that's the bandwidth we have built it was very interesting that day when the prime minister came to stall he was asking uh Rahul what is the capacity

of the thing you have created and I told him you tell me sir what is the capacity you want us to create right it is it is really up to you you have to guide us and say we want to have these multiple

use cases you know lining up the country and and we are most happy uh you know to do that. So I think we are in a very good place uh we have got very robust infrastructure and how do we now uh you

know navigate this world of AI uh uh and uh you know provide a real opportunity and sense to our players within the ecosystem is what we really looking forward to. you you reminded me from

this uh of a conversation which we were having just a couple of days ago when someone was talking about data sovereignty and he said you know it's so utopian to talk about you know data

sovereignity where if we you know slice and dice then you realize where's the sovereignity and you know you touched on that thanks for that point uh Martin I'll come back to you this was actually

meant for a but you know you have to leave with this uh so from uh vphone ideas uh you know uh regulatory lens. What are the biggest policy frictions emerging as networks become AIdriven

platforms? If you see any regulatory challenges, how can these be met without slowing innovation? So, I'll try and answer them in uh two perspective. Uh we heard uh our

honorable PM mentioning uh AI being responsible and reasonable AI, right? The word he used was reasonable in nature, multiple occasion, right? So this brings in and there are multiple

other context with reasonability that comes our way. One being uh explanability uh another being accountability and so on and so forth. So today if you look at uh we as uh tsps

uh tsps are governed under the ambit of what we want to call oursel with uh unified license which is narrated by uh do uh in some of these examples that we uh with Rahul touched about I touched

about and whatever world bank team as well uh related back we are able to see that our portfolio has expanded beyond the conventional tsp governed under the UL license and uh today looking at

expanded approach that we are offering to market whether monetization not monetization uh thank god at least the data privacy is enacted now um apparently I'm also the DPO uh for the

firm so uh by virtue of which when we touched upon this area called data localization or uh what we would say is uh data sovereignity I think we largely misinterpreted uh is my personal view

around that um data privacy uh the DPDP at least clarifies that data collected has to be defined with a purpose be put in with a purpose. Now uh thankfully although I'm a TSP uh basis we falling

under the ambit of a significant data fidiciary most likely uh we will be also governed by the data privacy uh laws of the country. So there are regulations which are governing us uh possibly

properly uh well. So if I narrate this in three or four uh broader perspective of looking at accountability and explanability when we leverage AI, we would want the AI to come and explain.

Now is it covered under the uh ambit of UL or in the data privacy? Maybe no at all. Right? So we would want uh somewhere uh Manzi actually narrated it very well which is we would want

somewhere a referenceable standard coming our way where all of us can relate back easily and apply back. Uh it could be blueprint, it could be playbooks, it could be uh so such

framework does it exist for easily adaptable manner. The larger entities like us, we will be the first one possibly to invent the way to do through make it as a playbook related back to

somebody who can make it as a blueprint and make it as a standard then apply back to the rest of the industry as a whole. So that's the first and foremost. So the role of a TSP also is changing

today, right? So from a conventional uh telecom provider today we are talking about uh the previous example that I highlighted as an intermediary providing additional data inside. Now there is a

law for digital intermediaries. Now the purpose for which a civilian has shared the data to me is for some other purpose but the purpose beyond the purpose that he has shared to me if I

have put it to from a monetization standpoint do I apply the ambit of digital intermediary also on me that's a that's a I wouldn't want to comment as should my regulator look upon that and

then put that also as applicable to me but those are evolving space that uh we are looking at and the last very famous topic uh amongst telos that is floating around is on uh the spam and the scam

protection right so here let's look at uh from again uh honorable PM's perspective which is reasonable AI uh most of us associate reasonable AI back to explainability now imagine uh we have

deployed scam solution which autoblocks things and we would want that AI to explain why did I block you if it were to be blocked then what am I looking at I'm

actually advancing the ability of uh scanning hamster to know why am I blocking him so that he refineses himself to not get blocked. So that comes in the context of security. Do I

do I make a framework? Do I make a guideline to tell here I would not want to have an explanability where security becomes a far more important element as compared to so frameworks have to

evolve. We need to have standards but standards do not have the ability to make it universally applicable in all possible manner. So standards are taken applied back as per individual

enterprises and the context that we have to put them to use and then make it work. Uh so I look forward regulators will be uh innovative in allowing us to make the choices as appropriately while

regulations can continue to evol appropriately. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Thanks Martin. I'll take this conversation slightly global uh u with my attempt uh deeper uh how h how do you

think India can leverage its DPI and telecom uh digital architecture to provide a credible scalable model for the global south particularly countries seeking digital sovereignity without

technological isolation. &gt;&gt; Okay. So when we are looking at uh somebody offering any technical solution to someone else typically it comes with certain sorry

&gt;&gt; okay it often comes with certain intellectual IPRs okay intellectual property rights so for example somebody is using a particular technology so there could be patents there could be

copyright etc. Now when India is offering its DPI model nothing of that sort is going okay so countries are able to adopt it's a framework it's a philosophy and there's a open protocol

so they can adopt it they can adopt it and they can change it the way they wish so it is really open in that sense okay so that's one very important uh difference compared to let's say some

other country or company offering some particular technology but then it also involves certain type of monetization in terms that okay this is what you continue to pay us if you are scaling it

to let's say 1 million population this is what you'll pay us if you're doing it for 10 million or 100 million this is what you'll do India doesn't ask for that type of thing so that's one very

strong distinction the second thing is in terms of the enablement the enablement is also happening not just in terms of offering this as a techn technical sort of thing assistance it is

also happening through multiple other organizations so for example we have a research and information systems think tank under the ministry of external affairs. Another is Indian council of

world affairs. So they are also doing a lot of work in terms of developing intellectual frameworks and capacity to do this as a ma matter of diplomacy itself. So that's another dimension

which is not often seen but it's again a matter of soft diplomacy. So for example uh 3 years back in 23 at ICW again I had proposed a framework called EOSS uh which was again basically about taking

DPI in India. I mean you can of course create a different acronym etc. uh globally and again the focus was more around interoperability security etc there. [snorts] The other aspect is

about standards. So Mani did uh systems or blueprints as she mentioned but one very important uh document I would again refer to a world bank only. So of course she did mention about the

DPI report but even more recent document uh which has just come up couple of months back from World Bank is the world standard development report on standards. Okay. So I mean we all you

look at traffic lights okay the three red amber green uh this traffic light the current traffic light standard came up only in 1968 it's not very old okay but it did happen

uh and this has become globally acceptable and uh but the way the design is yes you can put it vertical you can put it horizontal and there are other variations but so this is what it is

doing there so I think the way India is doing this is something that we are doing a lot of enablement of the across the global south. In fact, I just published an uh policy brief called

global south AI pivot uh by CG of Canada uh just last Friday. Again, it talks about three things, equity, ethics and ecology. So India is not only talking about things like okay it should be

reasonable, it should be uh responsible, it should be explanable, it should be inclusive, accessible all of that but also looking at things in an from an efficiency perspective. Efficiency is

not just financial efficiency here we are talking about resource efficiency. So how do we manage these things in with minimum ecological footprint of material of

energy water things like that. So and this again goes back to something like the prime minister keeps on talking about this life which is lifestyle for environment. Now this whole philosophy

of lifestyle for environment life could also be applied for in the case of digital domain including AI. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thanks [clears throat] Deepak. I'm conscious of time u mani last one to

you. Um, you know, India's approach to the DPI built on open, interoperable and scalable digital rails is increasingly influencing the global conversations. How do you see India's DPI model shaping

digital development strategies across emerging economies? &gt;&gt; Thank you. I'll keep it really short. I I think uh uh you know at the bank we started working on ID for development

and G2P and fast payments even before this whole big DPI push happened in India and particularly that became more socialized through the G20 process when many other actors came into and uh

across foundations, think tanks, technology companies and started to socialize the idea of the of DPI and the DPI approach to digital transformation. India surely for the vast amount of

experience and scale and heterogeneity that it has offers excellent evidence on what works and what doesn't work. Uh and it's really great that a lot of the people who were part of the foundation

and building of the DPI have now gone ahead and tried to take this to other countries in a way that is adaptable to them. So and there's so many organizations without taking names lest

I miss out on other important ones I don't want to take that chance but there are several organizations who are doing a fabulous job of doing that and um and the government itself so whether

actively or uh uh you know indirectly they are also trying to uh talk to the world about how uh the DPI approach works and more actively you know in in UPI and NPCI as Matan was mentioning

there's active collaboration on making these fast payment systems work in collaboration with BIS to see can we actually uh uh think of the fintet the idea of the fintet that came up with uh

bis so I I don't see this dying down I think we have a lot of like I said evidence of the foundations as well as now sectoral applications so there are uh just and particularly because this is

GSMA session and mobile I don't want to forget mentioning this really important part about how uh the department of telecom has begun to think about utilizing mobile data while the Telos

are thinking from credit perspective and uh you know fraud management they're also thinking of it very actively in terms of using it for planning and mobility and uh which uh which I think

is really fabulous it's not as if other countries haven't done it but the DPI approach that they are taking towards it to scale the access to data uh to make models available to provide compute and

build that whole stack is not something that has happened and obviously it's going to evolve I don't think it's perfect and uh we shouldn't feel the pressure of making it perfect at uh at

go but this learning experiences will surely inform how other countries can &gt;&gt; yeah some of these things we are trying to do it at population scale &gt;&gt; yes exactly

&gt;&gt; so I think uh if I can just um have one question from the I can see three hands already I how much time do we have do we have a question for two one question

gentlemen Please please uh state your name and to whom do you want to address this question to? &gt;&gt; Uh my I am Vijay Agarwal and I am

interested in AI. Uh by profession I'm manufacturer of jewelry. So what I wanted to propose was why don't we have a uh a product like a Aadhaar ring kind of

a product where the privacy data the KYC data resides on that physically only on that item which is on the body it if if it leaves the body it leaves in an encrypted form only with and it can only

be uh collided with another key for the purpose for which it has been uh uh consent has been given and uh there is a blockchain record to it. &gt;&gt; You wear it in the form of a jewelry

ring. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. So we have Aadhaar ring for every Indian and it will uh uh store the KYC record, the medical record which could be accessed in case of emergency

but there should all these control layers that you are talking about could be in the form of cryptography. &gt;&gt; Quickly quickly &gt;&gt; a very quick one.

So this &gt;&gt; yeah the concept of data embassies right as part of the discussion on data sovereignty so is there a good case for

uh you know maybe India to offer data embassies with obviously it'll be on a multilateral but any thoughts on that &gt;&gt; so I would say yes if it is on reciprocal basis

&gt;&gt; it'll always be on &gt;&gt; let me uh try and address the first part which you were trying to say. I I think uh uh today uh it's not the problem

of your data being insecure with Aadhaar. I think it's very secure right there are a lot of things uh which Aadhaar does. Uh there is also the masking which they have started. So the

leakage of data or you know p private data is really not the issue out here. The data going out has got various other forms and factors. Particularly the way the government is taking the data from

users. It is the government which has to really start looking at do they require for example Telos are required to share the subscriber data every month in physical copies.

&gt;&gt; Why would you do that? &gt;&gt; Right? So it is not really the digital aspect which is a problem. It is really how you are managing the data is a problem. And I think quantum work has

already started sir. I think Aadhaar itself is is is working on that on data embassy's u uh uh Vikram I think I completely endorse uh uh you know Deepak you know it it cannot be just me right

look around and have it and so let's play it right but you cannot expect the world's largest data creator and consumer to be the ones to start offering this first it is a

two-way street right for too long I think uh as a country we have been you know in a sphere where We are supposed to give and we are not supposed to take anything and that has to change.

&gt;&gt; The organizer is already standing on my head. &gt;&gt; I just wanted to say one thing only to what R mentioned in terms of government taking data. So about 20 not now of

course now IRCT doesn't do it but till about 15 years back or so if you're creating a IRCTC ID for first time it used to ask even your marital status and there were

apparently no benefits or disadvantages but and it was a compulsory field. By the way that time [clears throat] &gt;&gt; I would like to thank each of the speakers here to make it a very uh

engaging conversation. Thank you man, Rahul, Deepak, Matan for your time and to have this uh you know session. Thank you very much audience. [applause]
