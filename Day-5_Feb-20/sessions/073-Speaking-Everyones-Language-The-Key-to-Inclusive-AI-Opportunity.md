## 📝 Transcript

to make AI work in more than 40 African languages. This is a brilliant genuinely African-led initiative which helps people to access

AI in the languages that they actually use in their everyday lives. Second, we're investing in Africa's first dedicated public sector AI computer cluster at the University of

Cape Town. Too many African researchers are held back by costs and a lack of access. And the hope is that this new hub will give them the computing power to build and

train models locally. And third, we're launching the Asia AI for Development Observatory. This is a new network to support responsible AI governance, to protect rights, and to

ensure AI reflects the realities of people's lives across the region. All of these initiatives are effectively part of our AI for development program launched when we hosted the first of

these AI summits back at Bletchley Park three years ago and made in partnership with Canada's international development research center and as part of a wider collaboration to coordinate investments

with the Gates Foundation, the governments of Germany, Japan and Sweden as well as community Jal and as part of our partnership with the GSMA Foundation,

we're proud to announce the support to four additional startups. And these innovative businesses will harness responsible AI to support the needs of underserved people across Asia and

Africa. They include uh torn AI in Morocco, which creates voice interfaces to local dialects to help low literacy rural users access digital and financial services through

simple spoken interactions. And all of these initiatives will make a real difference to people across the continent of Africa and Asia. But I hope they'll do a bit more than that. Uh

yesterday I spoke about the choice the world faces. The two paths before us. One which sees AI take power and opportunity away from people and sadly divides us and one

that sees AI use as a force for good to solve problems and uplift all of humanity. and the projects I've mentioned, the ones we're going to hear about today and the many new

institutions and coalitions that are now emerging can help make sure we go down the right path. Um, and that is a path of a safe AI, an inclusive AI, and importantly an equitable AI for

everyone. So, let's turn now to our panel. um an exceptional group of leaders from across India and Africa. Um and I'm going to get an introduction to our panel members and

then I'll start with the first question. Very good. [applause] Thank you. It's my pleasure to introduce joining um our deputy prime minister um

on the stage we have his excellency ambassador Philip Figo special technology envoy of the government of Kenya we have Dr. Beal Kofla, Parliamentary State Secretary to the

Federal Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development of Germany. Um, we have Shea Sa Subramanian, CEO of Radwani AI and Chennai chair, director of the Masakani African Languages Hub.

&gt;&gt; And and so to the first question to um Phillip. So we're beginning to see um an attempt well we're all we all experience how

large language models are affecting our lives on a daily basis. I certainly use um a I don't use chat GPT but I use a secure network which isn't taking my stuff because obviously for obvious

reasons as deputy prime minister of UK I had to be a bit careful but I I'm using it to research and you know usually really get quickly to a fact that I don't fully understand. Um, so as we

move this on to local languages, dialects, um, and across Africa, we've got an estimated 2,000 um, languages. How do you see AI in

local languages shaping the next phase of your your countries digital development? Um um having been to Kenya many times I can and and known the many groups that are there. Uh how

does this really work on the ground? &gt;&gt; Thank you so much Right Honorable Prime Minister. Um I think this moment is so profound and I don't think you guys are realizing um what is

happening here. I think the first thing is to understand that we actually in the age of intelligence, right? So it's not about ICTs or technology. It's about our AI shaping how we live, learn, work,

collaborate and engage. Um, from our point of view, it is a civilizational discussion. Um, the global south has never lacked intelligence as we know, right? So, what it has lacked is the

power to define how that intelligence is recognized, recorded or transmitted because our entire cultures values have been coined in language. Uh, the global south is largely an oral civilization.

And so the current models lacking our language means our civilization are at risk almost existential to be extinct. And I think this initiative in our view begins to ensure that we are represented

uh in the current age of intelligence but also our intelligence is part of our global collective history and memory. And so I think um which means then how we engage in this is that now with the

capabilities like masaki it means that when I get into chip that you refuse to mention um is that young people in Kenya who are the number one users of chip by the way uh are not only seeking

emotional advice or guidance from these models but then when they engage with these models it actually also represents their cultures and civilizations. I think for me that's how it works

practically on the ground. First of all is representation and existence. The second part of course is it also works when we have the entire stack and you know you mentioned a couple of things

around funding the models but I think it'll be interesting to see how we fund the compute the the talent that then influences develops the data develops the language the research and

development capability which I was in blood in in the first instance and that was an amazing initiative because then we need to build research capacity and capability because talent development is

the first uh instance of sovereignity then The final point of course is the specific use cases and languages especially in the African context. Again you say 2,00 so. So each of the 2,000

are very context specific. Kisuilia and Goruba are not the same and neither are the applications in health in in medicines in in in in even our history and cultures in Africa. So I think that

capability as diverse as it could be um also ensures that our diversity in the African continent is represented in the future models. I mean that's wonderful and the first

point you made is really about sort of seeing yourself in this story that the global community is going to be telling in relation to intelligence. Um and we know that too often in the

past Africa has been written out of that story. So it's hugely important that the African languages intellect history over thousands of years um is in this story book. Um so should I tell us then how

the masakani African languages har is addressing these issues and really working and is a tangible real thing. Thank you so much honorable minister. So I think I I I want to say that I am

proud to be representing the masakan community that started in 2019 um wanting to see their own languages represented in the global domain and they did it by the bootstraps. No one

wanted to fund them and they came together and said hey how do I ensure that the language that I speak is captured digitally. So, the Masaka African Language Hub emerges from that

community-driven initiative where our main goal is to impact 1 billion Africans through 50 of the most spoken um languages with relevant AI tools that will allow for economic growth, health

and social benefit and also working towards uh the preservation and also capturing the evolution of African languages. the 2,000 plus are growing and so then in even the as um honorable

Philipo mentioned the diversity of the languages themselves like I speak Shauna but the Shauna I speak in Harare is not the same as a Shauna spoken in Mutare. So it's really capturing that diversity

and nuance of that work. So what we do um with support from the funding collaborative and the partners that we have is actually think about enabling the ecosystem through um partnerships

and grant making. So we specifically focus on four pillars of work which is around data. So expanding uh and diversifying high quality data in 2019 there wasn't as much data but the

masakana community actually started building up that data based from the JW300 Bible data set that had been created. Secondly, we're also looking at research. So it's important for us to

take it on as an ecosystem adventure where we are looking at developing at refining inclusive AI machine learning models but also thinking about the tooling that's resourcing there. So what

we are working on specifically that is having uh a benchmark project where we're actually then going to create a relevant African benchmark looking at speech and text because the current

benchmark models out there do not nuance the realities on the African context and then also looking at innovation. So again a lot of the questions that we've seen is when you create the data where

does it go? Is it taken up in the market? What's the impact? And so for us, we're actually working 40% of the funding that we have will go to creating use cases and impacting use cases. And

one special mention I want to put forward is actually that we are working on a project called project echo which means enhancing communications for her opportunities. This is a gender

responsive intervention that exists in the context of high gendered inequality on the continent. And what that does is it will provide um relevant use cases in African languages that lead to impact on

women's economic empowerment and health. And that's a significant part of us recognizing the context we exist in. And then lastly, we really are thinking about sustainability. And right now

we're in a moment where there is resourcing, where there is funding and we also come from a moment where people were doing it without funding. So we're thinking about institutional capacity

building for the African NLP community which will actually then see businesses coming up from these open source models, people innovating off this data that's created and sustainability beyond the

masakana community which has been happening right now. But then this funding allows us to actually have African-led AI which is built for impact.

&gt;&gt; Thank you very much. And um &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; centers um Africa but also importantly the fundamental um inequality and gender issues that sit

at the heart not just of Africa but but making sure that women are a big part of this story uh Shakar bringing India into this and thinking of uh Wadwani AI and um we're sitting here in the the

most populous country um on the planet. Um there are also lots of um languages and um tremendous diversity but also innovation um and range across um this country. Um

tell us um how um Wadwani AI is working at the heart of that innovation here in India. Thank you. Um first uh the work we do is applied AI.

Um which means we solve for problems in health, education and agriculture. And we've been doing it for the last seven years. Um the moment you work in India, the very first design principle

that you start with is the ability to be all inclusive and and embrace the entire population. So the dimensions of population you're looking at are language. So you start with at least 14

to 16 languages. You don't even think of an application otherwise. Second, you also think of complete inclusivity which means you need to think through the divide between rural

and urban. The kinds of applications that will be delivered to people which will be of use to them. Third, our applications fundamentally must be useful to people. Then they open out

their ability to learn languages, changes that better interface with technology that can actually be of use to them. So that utility value sits at the heart of everything that we do which

drives a lot of behavior both by us as well as the ecosystem. Just as an example, we do media disease surveillance. We've been doing it for a while which picks up every article

published in India. It runs four hours and it picks events of interest in health across 16 languages and it's been running for the last two and a half to three years. It uses AI and it tells you

in this region this many people got this disease at this time. It runs every four hours and it tells the central government if it's a disease outbreak what should you do another completely

different example. We collect data from children in a couple of states and that will expand to 14 to 16 states where we have the largest data set of spoken local language

and which again in of itself of no use. But when you provide something called oral reading fluency which assists the poorest child to read a paragraph and the AI tells you what you read well,

what you did not read well and assists the teacher to cohortize the students and provide them insights. Suddenly the language and the application you cannot distinguish between them. It is very

important in human contexts to provide some value to the person in any interchange. If you can work the value then the adoption is easy. If you divorce the two people don't understand

why I'm doing what I'm doing. It looks like an encumbrance. So for us at the heart of our innovation is what does it mean for the person? independent of which we do analysis on

various languages. We've done one on Tibetan where we've preserved their entire culture by taking we worked in Dhmashala as well as in Karnataka. We digitized their entire library system

and allowed the communities there to gain employment using it. Likewise, we plan to work on multiple less used languages span India. We believe it's our position that the more

and we've got agriani healthi everything that we do is multilingual everything that we do [clears throat] collects data we have the largest data sets now incidentally of the work we do it's not

what we do it comes as a byproduct of the work that we do over a period of time it is my considered and humble opinion that these models using AI will take time

we should be ready to guide this for a period of time. We should be ready to invest in deep research and or very utilitarian based approaches so that you can take the community along with you.

That is super important. The theory is interesting. The practice is different. There is a theory as to how to design roads in India. I will keep quiet after that.

&gt;&gt; Very very good example. Um obviously I talked about the UK as a donor country doing this in partnership um uh with others um Canada, Sweden um but also the German government um and

we're joined by Barbell Coffler um just to bring the donor perspective really to this and why this is so important. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. [laughter]

Thank you very much. I should put it on first. That's true. Yeah. Um well, thank you very much, Deputy Prime Minister. um I wouldn't talk if it's coming to AI

in um in a manner of donor and recipient because at the end of the day I think it's a new technology where we all have to bridge if we really want to make it useful for everybody um and that's also

our interest of course from the German side uh we see that um AI can only be really uh the game changer to overcome income inequality to fulfill the promises of the STG and

that's for every country important not only for global north or global south that's important for everybody uh can only be that game changer if it is inclusive uh that starts with data at

the end of the day and how biased data is and if you talk about bias and data language is quite close to it you were pointing out how important it is and how you differently speak in very variations

of your language. I really understand that I don't speak standard German normally. So I also use a dialect and that's quite different from Hamburg. Uh so we all have something to include also

which is con uh connected with a cultural uh momentum and we see so many languages neglected totally neglected dialects cultures because it's not only the language it's what the language is

transporting also which is neglected and that's why we really um try to be part and we're very proud to be part of your initiative also um we were starting in 2019 19 uh with uh discussing those

topics working on an initiative called fair forward that's part of the initiative and working also with partner countries like India on collecting data sets so really to collect the necessary

data on those uh local languages which at the end of the day is offering then or should offer service to citizens in their mother tongue in multilingual countries or contexts for example. Uh so

for us it's it's of utmost importance. Happy to be part of the initiative. We want to stay a reliable partner on that and we will be part of that initiative and I hope uh the idea is spreading and

growing. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much. [applause] &gt;&gt; Thank you. Um we'll now have a small um changeover in our panelists. Um if I could ask um if we could have another

big round of applause please for uh his excellency Filipo Deafla [applause] and Shika Su Bramanian and now uh joining us on stage uh we will have

we will have anora chief strategy officer um and president of the Africa and India office at the Gates Foundation &gt;&gt; Uh Julie Deahanti, president of Canada's International

Development Research Center, [applause] and Natasha Crrampton, Chief Responsible AI Officer at Microsoft. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much. Um back to um Shennai. Um my

understanding is that Masakani are announcing a new multi-million pound partner or an open call today uh for Lingua Africa. So can you tell us a little bit more about this initiative

and the gap that it's designed to close um effectively and then why this moment is so important for African languages as a whole um and AI.

&gt;&gt; Thank you so much deputy prime minister. So yes I do have the honor with my esteemed panelist to actually announce um Lingua Africa. So with Masakan um which I've me said means to build

together. We've been working with researchers and communities across the continent to close the gap in how African languages are represented in the AI systems. Um what we've constantly

seen is that and I think I did mention this is that it's not just about data. about whether the res language resources actually translate into tools people can use um particularly in healthcare,

education, agriculture and public services because those are the developmental domains that we're likely to have significant impact with. So together with Microsoft uh AI for good

and the Gates Foundation we as well as our AI ford partners Lingua Africa will be a multi- partner open core focused on open communitygoverned language infrastructure which will directly

enable Afric real world AI applications I think a lot of the times as we're developing AI solutions the question becomes if we're building them in a lab will they work in the real world and

that's also consistently part of what we're doing with the benchmarking So how we'll do this is actually then it will be a use case or impact focus specific approach where we will do model

development. We will collect targeted data in those specific domains and then also support strong pathways for deployment and adoption. So this is us working with multiple entities the

academic community our partners here on stage with us but also the tech entrepreneurs who are actually building up these solutions. And then for us it's quite simple. The goal is to make sure

that language is not a barrier anymore into including and um people into these solutions. Particularly if you think about digital public infrastructure interventions. They need to be in

languages that people communicate with because you will leave behind a majority of people if they are in languages that they do not understand. So that is our most significant contribution right now.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. And obviously we're very pleased um in the UK to be partnering with the Gates Foundation on new support um for linguistic diversity across AI. Um but

just explain um uh anchor the role that the hub has effectively in that wider impact uh on the global south. Is this on? &gt;&gt; It's on. All right. Languages matter.

Um, can you first join me in giving a big round of applause to uh Chennai for this amazing movement. [applause] Um, it is kind of brilliant uh where we

where we are in this moment in time. Let me talk about three W's. One is why I care about language. The second is why I care about investing in language. And the third one is why I care about

investing in initiatives like Masakame. The first one I think so everybody knows but it's useful to repeat it and many people have talked about this before. Um because we want to make sure that the

power of AI actually changes lives. History is not going to remember us for the models we developed or the speeches we give here. History is going to remember the impact we all had. Um,

we're talking about mothers and babies not dying. We're talking about the next generation growing up in a world without infectious diseases. We're talking about hundreds

of millions of people escaping the clutches of poverty. Those kind of things matter and the solutions are there. they can get better but we need to find a way of

these solutions getting translated for these use cases. So that's why um we need to care about this thing. Why invest in language? Because the markets are broken.

The markets are broken. The private sector companies are investing in models developed in English and Mandarin. And it makes sense for the markets to do that because that's where

the economics work. But just Because the economics don't work for the small resource languages doesn't mean that we shouldn't be investing in this. And that's the point why all of us need to

get together and say we need to do something about it. When markets are broken, funders can get together and invest in public goods. And that's what we all are

doing right now. UK government, Canadian government, the Japanese, Microsoft, IDRC, everybody is getting together and making the point that we need to invest in public goods

because these markets are broken and this is an important thing. And so I'm quite excited about the fact that we're all sitting at this panel, people in this uh audience and saying we're going

to make sure that as we think about tomorrow, the important thing of developing solutions in the right languages that can solve the problems we care about

will be a problem that we will tackle. &gt;&gt; I've got to say as a politician I like the idea that the state intervenes and doesn't just leave it to the marketplace [laughter]

uh to determine where to put the funds. um I've got to say um uh but obviously we are and you have to in terms of the innovation um work at the cutting edge and that cutting edge um is most often

in the private sector as well uh taking those risks to develop and innovate and here Microsoft and cloud computing is hugely important. Um Natasha um and um it's important to understand

that interaction between the cloud um the Masakani hub as it has been described so well by um Shennai and how important it is um that computation and cloud technology helps the innovation of

these local languages. Could you say a little bit more about that? But there is another subset to this which is getting the balance right so that um the languages and often the

communities that we're supporting that are at the front line um have equity in this and don't lose um their own sovereign capabilities which has been a theme of this

conference. So um I wonder if you could just reflect on that as well. Absolutely. So we're here in India where it's been clear that the Indian government has chosen to put uh

supporting the global diffusion of AI in particular to the global south at the very center of its agenda and from Microsoft's point of view from the data that we can see this is an urgent

priority. uh our own analysis shows that we have uh AI diffusing in the global north at roughly double the rate that we have it diffusing in the global south at the

current time and that is exactly why we need partnerships like these um in order to start to put the right infrastructure in place to close that gap. Now, language is particularly important in

terms of um overcoming that AI divide as we've heard many speakers uh say today. Um nobody is going to use AI uh if it does not speak the language that you speak and importantly that it does not

work in the context in the specific scenario in which you need to use it. So language aware and scenario aware um AI is incredibly important uh to empowering people to put the technology to work in

the use cases that mean the most to them and that's why we're so thrilled to be uh partnering with Masakan as well as the Gates Foundation um the UK government on this Lingua Africa

initiative. So how does compute come into all of this? I think quite simply compute is the enabler of making language and culturally aware AI. It's a crit critical component of it. So when

uh we take a a base model that may have just been trained like most models on on data sets that are predominantly English, we need to make sure that we can do this responsibly

locally led data collection that Shana was talking about. earlier and then we need to do some further work on the models to essentially um ingest that data and make it well represented in the

model. All of that takes compute. Then it's very important once we've actually made the the model language uh linguistically and culturally aware, we need to make sure that we're testing it

with uh local um language speakers and in the right scenarios. That also that that also takes uh compute and then finally the day-to-day use of this technology it also requires computing

power. So we're really here today as an enabler of an Africaleled effort by Africans for Africans to create this linguistically aware and and multiculturally aware technology and

compute fundamentally is just the enabler of it. I think my last thought uh to offer up here today is I think these types of initiatives just really reinforce that um trustworthy AI is not

going to happen by accident. It's going to happen because of the choices that we make, the ways in which we choose to build and test and deploy these AI systems. And for us at Microsoft, um,

it's really important that we do take all of those steps to represent the world as it is multicultural, multilingual, and deeply interconnected. So, we're thrilled to be part of this

initiative. Uh, and Julie, so we've very much described this journey that we've been on since Bletchley Park. Um, uh and talked about languages, talked

about computing. Um in a sense AI that's a foundation stone um for communities. Um but just to round off this event, how do we see the opportunities going forward

um uh particularly, you know, where do we need to get to? &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thanks everybody for being here. the deputy prime minister for for welcoming us. We're incredibly proud at

IDRC to be part of the AID initiative with the UK government and to be partnering um with the Masani uh African language hub as well as the um the African compute initiative. And I think

going back a little bit to the Microsoft views on it, I think it's very similar for us researchers in lower middle inome countries really have to strong computing power to be able to uh do the

kind of cutting edge AI work that I and others are doing. But right now, of course, they do face a lot of barriers. We did a study that showed the incredible uh increased cost of getting

compute um capacity, the difference between getting it in Germany and getting it in an African country, the costs are exponentially larger. So that computing cost and how much it is the

local infrastructure that might be limited the uh the GPUs that are the hardware that's really driving the the um that powers modern modern AI is also very difficult and hard to access for

African countries. So it really makes it difficult for them to fully participate um in global AI innovations. Uh the African Compute Initiative is going to change all that. We hope it is be the

first um dedicated high performance uh computing cluster for public institutions in Africa. It'll be based in South Africa at the University of Cape Town. And that initiative is going

to include modern GPUs. It's going to have faster and better storage capacity and and much faster uh networking. And it's that kind of computing power that is essential um

it's it's essential for training large AI models. It's essential for uh testing new ideas more quickly as you mentioned. Uh and it's been essential and will be essential for things like the Mass

County uh African language hub. Both the initiatives that I'm talking about are really um responding to the foundational gaps. So whether that's compute capacity or the kinds of representative and

robust data sets, both of those things are absolutely necessary. And if you don't have those foundations, uh, then you can't contribute to AI systems. And if you can't contribute to AI systems,

then you can't shape the AI systems. So it's absolutely critical for Africa's AI AI innovations to have those foundational elements uh that exist. Uh, and I think the lessons that we're going

to learn through a lot of this programming is going to help other regions and other uh lower resource contexts to do that the kind of work. And in terms of the the next steps or

what the things that we can do with that, I mean you can imagine some of the obvious things. Some people have already mentioned it but things like having language services, health services in

local languages through mobile apps, having education platforms in local languages, having extension to agricultural workers in their own languages. All of those applications

that we'll be able to do as a result of having both comput and the language models. &gt;&gt; Thank you. And let's have another big round of applause for our panel and

and um we'll now try and do a short group photo with the panelists. If I could ask you to maybe gather um here to the side of the stage. Thank you. invite Phillip and uh

back up and others. &gt;&gt; Yes, please. Members from our first panel as well. Sorry. I'm suspicious.

&gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; maybe
