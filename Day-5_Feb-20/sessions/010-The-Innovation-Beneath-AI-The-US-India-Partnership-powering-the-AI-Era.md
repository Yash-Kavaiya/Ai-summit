## 📝 Transcript

historic bets on this infrastructure right now and closing the gap between commitments and capacity. This is where the real opportunity lives. Moderating today's

session is Kumar, founder and CEO of Quantum Alliance and co-founder of Cognacy AI. Quantum Alliance works with universities, industry, and governments to get top talent working on the

foundational problems beneath AI from critical minerals to energy to semiconductors. He will be joined by Duan Ho, Unicorn founder turned venture capitalist, now

partner at Xfund. Jeff Binder, serial entrepreneur with multiple Fortune 500 exits now at Harvard Venture Partners. Prince Tavan, I officer and executive director at RECC Limited under the

Ministry of Power. Rashali God, global director of climate operations at Google. Dr. Tobias Halbeg, VP of innovation at NXP Semiconductors. U over to you.

Oh yes. Uh we'll start with a quick uh picture for the panelists if you can all rise. mic works. &gt;&gt; So we can start.

Uh thank you everyone. Uh we are up against YAN. we are up against a boss. So but let's have fun in this panel and the broader idea like uh we we have been

hearing all about AI models what AI can do and this panel is more about we are talking about AI at scale now what it needs what it what it would make fulfilled

when we talk about AI like AIdriven companies when we are talking about AIdriven solutions Let's talk about this now as EI is forcing creative destruction of how the

world builds infrastructure, energy, semiconductors, critical minerals, physical edge systems, data center. US and India are now building this together. Rare earth corridors in Indian

India's union budget. Google committed $15 billion to India and accelerated focus on clean energy. Jensen at Devos called this the largest infrastructure buildout in human

history. Two weeks ago, 54 countries launched Forge the first global framework for the minerals that power AI. Yesterday on this very summit Sunda Pichai laid out

Google's 15 billion commitments to India a gigawatt scale AI hub in Yjek four new subc cables between US and India the models are getting attention the infrastructure is getting the money and

we exactly have the right people to figure out where is all this going and what do we need further to to start with Tuan

Xund was the early investor in Vulcan elements. Now it is backed by 1.4 billion US government partnership to bring America's rare earth magnet supply

chain. what according to you the US India critical minerals corridors look like from the investor side. &gt;&gt; Uh first off uh thank you for having us

here. I I'm really glad uh uh you pulled the uh this panel together. I I think your points earlier about um the uh the focus that uh we we tend to put on discussing AI AI models and

everything in the model layer. um uh but we don't really talk about what exists underneath that is actually is actually really unique topic to cover and one that I'm that I and uh and Xf fund has

generally been extremely excited about. Um so the way I look at that is that you know in this strive that we have to build intelligence uh we tend to talk a lot

about the industrial revolution that it will create. Um well we oft have to understand have to look at the industrial revolution that will be required in order to support the the the

creation of the the creation of that infrastructure right there are a lot of inputs required for AI infrastructure so um you've got energy you've got uh you've got energy the power grid power

generation has to be clean sustainable renewable um and uh you know the the demands for AI infrastructure um are going to require us to really solve uh uh large problems as to how to uh supply

that power. Um you've got uh you know everybody's talking about critical minerals. Now you mentioned Vulcan elements, right? Um uh you you know Vulcan elements was a business that we

invested in. It was a it was a a Navy veteran out of out of Harvard um who had uh who' spent a lot of time looking at supply chain issues for the uh for the US military and noted that you know 95

over 90% of of uh you know magnets uh rare earth magnets were coming through China. It creates a strategic vulnerability for the United States. Um, and the reason why it creates a

vulnerability is because if you think about it, there are so many things that we need that we build that require magnets. You can't build hard drives. You can't build motors. You can't I

mean, nothing that moves um can be built without them. We talk a lot about chips. You can't manufacture chips uh without magnets. Um, and so I I look I look at uh you know problems like that and for

the first time um uh I think you you've got guys like me, venture capitalists looking at the opportunity to invest in building up that type that that type of

infrastructure to solve those sorts of problems. Um um but that's just one right you have to figure out how do you how do you source it? You know where where do you get the

materials from? Um and so when you look at things happening on the geopolitical scale uh you know for the first time we are you know at least in the United States we're looking at these trade

deals to try to figure out where we're going to supply the materials like how are we going to completely re rebuild our our power grid. Um how are we going to build up the the capacity for you

know refining those materials? Where are we going to source them from? Where we have to get them from? um as we're looking at data centers um how can we make them more sustainable more power

efficient right um you know uh in order to support the AI needs that we have right now like you know uh you know power uh power uh uh power consumption for for data infrastructure is already I

think it's about it's it's approaching 10% plus um um how you going to meet that demand right and so from an investor perspective Um, yeah, like we're we're going to look

at all of the, you know, cool AI products that entrepreneurs and that entrepreneurs are looking to build. But on the other side, what is very exciting for us is looking at all the lowhanging

fruit that exists for all of the inputs of industries that have not been innovated in for decades. um you know power grids that have not been uh that h that have not been

upgraded for you know the better part of a century right um it creates huge opportunity from for for us as an in for us as investors and uh and and you mentioned US India um I I

find I find a lot of opportunity in the US and India working more closely together to try to figure out how on you know on both sides of the world we can uh you know we can build great companies

to uh to meet that need. &gt;&gt; Thanks John. Uh you spoke about the needs, you spoke about the innovation, you spoke about uh uh what the early stage startups

should be focusing on. I'll move to Jeff who has built companies from scratch and made multiple Fortune 500 exits. I would ask him what would it need for young entrepreneurs to build and scale in this

space and do it successfully. &gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Thank you for having us and putting this together. And I know that we have more people here than Sundar has at his

keynotes. [laughter] So, um I heard Sam Alman only had 10 yesterday, so we've already outdone him. So, uh you know, it's um I I think it's it it's such an interesting time. Um I was there

in in the early web days in 99 and 2000 and 2001 and um you know the excitement around the internet obviously fueled a like a a massive tech boom and ultimately a fiber buildout and

infrastructure buildout and it took years for all of that infrastructure to be absorbed and ultimately it was um I think the difference this time around is that the tool sets themselves that

entrepreor reneurs have available to them are smart and they can bridge some of the challenges espec es especially since we're talking about partnerships between

the US and India you know often times especially when you get to things like user interfaces there are cultural differences from the development work that would happen in India for an Indian

audience or the US or China um that's always made it more difficult for collaboration sort of on the front end and many of the products that entrepreneurs are working on are often

you know front-endf facing consumerf facing uh at least initially they they're generally not building a lot of B2B platforms that happens later when you get the experience as to what's

necessary in a business environment and I think that AI is going to change drastically the ability to leverage sort of crossborder talent in particular

with India and China and other places that you were harder to leverage before. Um it's certainly from a quality perspective um SQA and back-end development I think entrepreneurs have

been able to leverage India and and other places for the last couple decades but it's been harder to get the front end of a product to sort of match the cultural

necessity of a given market. And I think that's going to change. And I think for entrepreneurs, it means that they have a massive amount of leverage that they didn't have before. Um, and it means

that we're going to have a flood of new ideas that are actually brought to market and work fairly well. Um, and allow entrepreneurs to deliver products with probably a tenth the capital,

depending on the product. Obviously, if you're doing magnets, you're sort of stuck with the the the physical properties and and refining and some of the things that you can't you can't do

from an IT perspective. But um I think for entrepreneurs it's it's a it's an extraordinary opportunity and those that will win in my mind over the next few years are going to be the ones that

leverage the tools most quickly because it's not possible any longer to develop in the way that people were developing two or three years ago. If you do that, you're going

to be way late. Um, and so now it's about not so much your product, but learning what the state-of-the-art is, which is literally changing every day um, in AI. And, uh, it's it's a golden

age, I think, for entrepreneurs. I think it's going to be much much more difficult for investors um, as an environment because the wealth of ideas are going to get

much further along. Um and that makes it more difficult, not less difficult I think to be an investor because you have more mature products.

Um the entrepreneurs will have more leverage. Um and they may be able to make it to market um much earlier than they would have otherwise. which means where they might

have gone for a second round of seed capital, they may be able to get to market and be into revenue with with with a single small round of seed capital or no seed capital. Um, and that

makes that whole early early stage ecosystem of angel and venture investing much more challenging. Um, and so so I think it's a it's just a great time. I I do think that there's a huge risk and I

don't think it affects entrepreneurs or young entrepreneurs, but I do think there's a huge risk of an overbuild and I it feels a lot like the the the leverage

in terms of optimizing hardware and infrastructure is only going to get better. Um, and it's potentially going to leave us with actually a I know right now we're worried about power, we're

worried about compute, we're worried about data centers, but I I would project if we sat here two years from now, um, we'll be looking at a grand overbuild with a real challenge around

ROI and how to make um how to make all these investments work. And so that's going to be another positive for the entrepreneur because those resources are going to become very inexpensive

relative to even what they are today. And so in that sense I I think it's a it's a great day for for young entrepreneurs. &gt;&gt; Thanks Jeff. [snorts]

Picking up from you about uh leading from some of the AI tools going to market faster buildout ROIs. Now we move this right time actually when you spoke about otherise.

One of the thing I was very curious about all the world leaders coming here and putting big bet on India. So like we just heard Sunda yesterday

talking about $15 billion new Cables between uh like uh with India new innovation hubs. Rousali you are leading the clean energy transition with Google.

I wanted to understand what's Google's AI's scale demand basically in terms of energy and why you are placing such

heavy bet on India. &gt;&gt; Okay, good. Thank you. Um thank you all for joining and I appreciate it. I I am being pitched against um you know my boss. So I'm going to try and keep it as

entertaining and as nice and and valuable as I can. Um that's a very interesting question you know in terms of like the scale and and why India. But I'll I'll build on a few things that um

both of you spoke about. So one of the interesting things about this particular uh AI innovation time frame you're looking at is it's what I call across the full stack. So you're looking at a

lot of things that are happening which typically we talk about software AI models applications that's the shiny objects everybody talks about and um very exciting but then the amount of

work that's happening on on underneath that which is why I loved this session too is beneath the AI the physical infrastructure layer of it um is is fascinating and that goes from

everything from the foundational layer that you're talking about which is your your materials your data center construction your access to energy to water to um you know to all those

foundations to then how do you construct things the right way? We forget about the physical these are all buildings quite a few of them. How do you construct them the right way and then

how do you operate them the right way and then the use of that and so what we are seeing is just tremendous value and innovation across the entire stack of AI which I which I as an engineer find find

very very fascinating. Um so in terms of Google I think the the privilege and responsibility that Google has is how do we bring about the most value across that full stack um both from a business

perspective but also from the impact perspective and so a lot of the investments you're seeing are you're seeing across those pieces right so you always we um if you walked across this

summit you would hear different pieces of it our expo was mostly featured on the product side so AI for education AI for healthcare AI for agriculture, how do you use AI in domains, contextualize

it? Um, and all of that has a layer of a country and where that context is. And then the the announcements you talked about were a lot more on the physical side. So it's what's required for data

centers. You need good design, good builds, but then you also need network. And so the subc cable announcement is is part of that. Um, and if you read a little bit, it's fascinating. It's an

India America connection but it goes one way we are building is across Africa. So that's a big region to bring on board and then the other way it goes from Singapore and Australia. So it's a

fascinating network um which again it's only you can only build build data centers but what's the point if you can't actually use it and network and be bring them closer to wherever the edge

cases are. So super excited about about those pieces. Um now going to your point about why India. So you know why not India I think is is what I would start with but most people know it's a billion

plus users. It's a great growth market. It's a lot of young population who we think are going to be the frontier of the growth. Um it's a lot of population who also is very eager about tech and

tech adapt you know adaptation. So if you think about what happened with fintech and how and the phones and digital tech like a lot of the AP pack countries Asia and global south jumped

ahead you know they um I see people who didn't even have credit cards now everybody uses GP and UPI and all of those right so there's a whole revolution where you can skip and build

and I think that's another big exciting part of investing in India is can a generation of in you know innovators come about who don't have the the the linear growth that we've seen in other

regions when and leaprog it. Um and I from a operational perspective feel super excited the same way about clean energy and you know you can talk a little bit more prince about um about

that but India is one of the fewer places where the math on clean energy just works um there's growth so there's tremendous demand lots of solar wind potential tremendous research going on

in battery longduration storage um good policies um and then the biggest issue what we've seen in you know in the in the US is grid Um but they're trying to build a high frequency girdier which is

fabulous which then you kind of if you bring in the innovation on that layer and that's the unblock right and if only you could solve permitting issues then then you're you're solving the whole

stack. Um but that's the excitement is it's where the math works where the business case works where you've got the talent and the innovation potential and then you also have the users.

&gt;&gt; Wow that's amazing. I I do understand now. Thank you. Uh &gt;&gt; that's why I said that. &gt;&gt; Thanks. So uh moving from that side we

heard about the demand side and uh I'd love to take uh um the ins uh the insights from Prince who is actually building the digital public infrastructure for the

power sector and uh they have been doing some incredible work in which I've seen in past few weeks particularly about P2P trading and uh friends with all the initiatives about grid reform forms and

um and the trading platform which you are launching at this summit. How do you think the EI's energy demand going like or like how how are you supporting it? Yeah, your insights.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you Joel. Thank you everybody for being here this morning. Um let me uh first start by uh putting u the AI compute demand in context. I I honestly

resonating from what Duan had also said in his remarks. I feel that AI essentially will not scale unless your power is programmable. Okay. And that is so the AI AI uh I would say uh I I don't

want to call it race but the AI build will depend a lot on not on chips as we might think. We we do have the capacity and capability world over to solve that problem. But I think the binding

constraint would be uh grids. It would be how intelligent and resilient your grids are. And uh I believe that is where uh uh what is going to define uh the development of uh most of the

compute infrastructure. Now uh what India has essentially started doing is we are redefining the architecture. Okay. So we are redefining how we view the grid. Uh India already has uh one

nation one grid which is essentially meaning one frequency and now we are also having one digital interoperable layer that is being brought in by the India energy stack. Uh so what what does

this mean? What does the what does the stack essentially do? Um so the India energy stack it basically creates the interoperable rails for systems to interact with each other. If you have an

data center, it is not just creating high demand but it is creating high peak demand that needs the grid to respond intelligently and that is where you need coordination

at scale. So what is going to be scarce in the times to come is not electrification. As as Brushali said, we have enough uh math works when you talk about solar power, when you talk about

wind, even hydro. So uh that is where the math does work. But what needs to be ensured is coordination at scale and that is what the India energy stack is essentially doing by laying down those

foundational building blocks. Now what we started with was a first showcase of how you can use the stack to essentially source energy from distributed energy resources like the solar rooftop panels

which we have on on top of our households. uh we can literally transact in energy the same way that you know we transact using GP UPI payments or using you know other other such

applications PTM phone pay etc. So similarly just imagine that the data center instead of relying on long-term PPAs and then hoping that the grid will deliver

can essentially source its power from millions of such distributed rooftop assets dynamically at scale. Just imagine the power of that happening. So it it can uh literally be generating

livelihoods for a lot of people who may not even be in geographical proximity to the data center. So individual retail households can essentially monetize their rooftop solar power by supplying

to uh such such data centers. How how does the stack enable it? The stack lays down standard rules for measurement, identification and settlement all in near real time. So

that's how the architecture of the grid itself is changing. Let me uh uh the the grid uh evolves generally in decades as to said we have not invested heavily in the grids world over might be that China

is an exception there but India has started doing the plumbing work it has started doing the hard work on that layer and uh generally AI evolves in quarters but the grid would evolve in

decades. How would you how would you keep pace? Right? And so that is where uh the India energy stack comes in where we uh push that development frontier and we enable people uh uh to to to to

talk to each other on the grid. So AI would need not just electrons but not just chips, not just electrons, it actually needs intelligent electrons and that is that is where the India

energy stack sits in. I think that should be in the times to come one of another reasons beyond economics that companies like Google or other companies would take bets on India. And uh let me

also tell you you know you did uh recount uh Sundar's message about $15 billion but there's also Reliance's message about a trillion dollars in next seven years. So let's not let's not

forget that uh as well right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. [laughter] Do you mind if I &gt;&gt; I'm just putting stuff in context. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Uh

&gt;&gt; two two minutes to &gt;&gt; Okay. Okay. So, um, what I love I I think what what I really love about the my colleagues here is I think you've done a really great job just sort of

illustrating what gets me so excited as an investor. So, um, you know, uh, XFund or, you know, I'm based back in in Harvard Square. Uh, so we we invest in a lot of founders coming out of Harvard

and uh, and MIT. And uh a joke that we we I've often made with partners um or in the community there is that 10 years ago when you were looking at uh university founders starting businesses

a lot of them would have been looking at like social media using computers to put bunny ears on on on people's people's heads. Now so many of the founders we meet want to

work on these problems. power grid, right? Uh there's a lot of frontier research that's being done for the first time. Uh like I in Massachusetts, there's a there's a

company uh that came out of MIT, Commonwealth Fusion, right? There is so much excitement about the frontier research that we can do to solve these infrastructure issues and it's like

real. It's happening now. And uh and um and um you know I and I and I I I see the opportunity too with working with India is that you have uh you know we can do some of this frontier research in

the US. We can partner with with countries abroad um like India and by the way India is very very well represented in [laughter] in Cambridge which is how I probably met

half the people on this panel. Um but it it really does create these glob these global scale opportunities to to reinvent to create this other to uh to support this other industrial

revolution beyond just what the AI and the intelligence is allowing us to do. &gt;&gt; Thanks John that yeah that's exciting. Now with that like we want to move to Dr. Tobius. We have been talking about

physical layer infrastructure. He has been working in semiconductor innovation since last 20 years building it across US, Europe, India. I wanted to ask him

what does the next innovation looks like to you or what are you working on at this point? Where are you placing your bets? &gt;&gt; Yeah, thank you very much for the

question and thank you so much for having me here. It's great. Um, and I would like to build a little bit, Jeff, on what you said earlier where you had this are we on the right track? What are

we what the heck are we doing? Um, and let let's zoom out for a moment. 1942, the head of IBM made a statement,

there's a world market for about five computers. He was right given the kind of computers he was looking at. We know better now some years later there's laptops, PCs, there's mobile phones or

there's basically a computer in every device. There's billions of computers. Now what we discuss is hey AI huge disruption power hungry like hell. Shall we buy

build some nuclear power plants or how do we run it uh with renewable energies? And I get this neging feeling, is this really it or are we missing what came after these five computers in what we're

discussing? If I take benchmarks like here's my brain and it takes 20 watts. There's a fly which is a pretty agile

intelligent robot below a millatt. There's something there's something which is going to happen which is different than what we are discussing here at the moment and that is what's

driving us as a semiconductors company in building on what starts now and driving it out into the real world. So we today have products where on whatever 10 watts or so you can run very

meaningful LLMs you can interact you can drive the intelligent into the edge into our real world that goes hand inhand with what's happening around AI moving from hey I

can perceive something is it a dog a cat to I can think of generative AI I can create something out of those models to the point that I can create agents the stuff which acts on my behalf out

there in the real field which drives the intelligence and this disruption you're looking at here at the moment and which driving all these conversations drives it close to us into the real world to

the point that these devices these robots these whatever you want to call it will be able to learn so what we discuss here and this is a huge challenge I totally agree with all

statements made before will see a next phase it will see this moving in the real world, moving close to me, moving into autonomous systems which ultimately change my life and change industries.

And there is this second wave building up. And my expectation to some extent my hope is from where we sit alo as a company is that this huge thing you're already discussing with data centers is

the five computers. And what is coming is this billions of edge devices which we will also see in the AI space. And just giving an example I'm running marathons with a watch with

me. I charged it before I left in Germany and it still stays 12 days battery power and there's a lot of intelligence in that watch. This is where we are going. So the one

is feed the beast and make it happen. The second is avoid that the beast is hungry and look at totally different models which will come in the next phase.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. Uh this is uh very interesting. Now we are talking about taking AI out of data center. Now any comments from the fellow panelists? &gt;&gt; I I agree with him. I I think that it's

[clears throat] that the IBM analogy is a very good one. Um I think we are all focused on the core and centralization and as we've seen in many markets they move from centralization to

decentralization to hybrid approaches. And so that's I think an incredibly astute observation. I do think edge devices ultimately have to be the um core component in the full proliferation

of AI. And so that means that [snorts] you know as he said small amounts of power can generate lots of value. Um it doesn't necessarily have to be tokens in the center of a data center. So that

that that's that goes to my concern that um I think that and I look I think all of the resources that are being built will eventually be consumed. That that's not a that's that's a given. It's a

question of when and what on what ROI they'll they'll deliver as they're being consumed and used. And I think that's a huge risk because um agents at the edge, which is a are

probably going to end up being in the end a much more likely um modality a decade from now and um it'll be interesting to watch for sure. &gt;&gt; Okay.

Yes. Uh &gt;&gt; I I too have a small uh and and I completely agree actually that's truly as as Jeff said that's it was an absolutely astute observation but you

know [snorts] where you can see this being played out in practice even today and that's when you talk about finance okay so finance world knows this so today because I work for a non-banking

financial company and one of our main products is infrastructure financing where data centers is are a product that we finance but and Roshali was in a panel discussion that spoke about uh the

trifecta of AI energy and finance but you know the finance bros they have figured it out because today if you go for financing of a data center you won't get debt financing for GPUs GPUs are

mostly financed by equity because there is obsolescence risk in GPUs you would get debt financing for the brake motor maybe even for sourcing power but you won't get that financing for GPUs and

there you have it because because they are seeing the big picture being played out there so completely on board there. Yes. &gt;&gt; Okay. Rousali has has been

&gt;&gt; No, no, no. I I we want to hear from you. Please go ahead. &gt;&gt; No, I think I I think the risk of strata assets the way you said and the ROI is real like in the sense of where you're

investing and what but I think your point is very astute. There are portions of this will be obsolete. there are portions of this which will be very easily replaced uh whether it's on the

chip side or whether how you write the programs even the models right you went from large scale smaller uh how do you build them but the also there are what I'm hoping is the bets on some of the

hard infrastructure are just good things to do like I think to me the fact that we are seeing a transition to renewables or seeing a transition of the grids being operated in a better way some of

the boring bits that people didn't pay attention to is how do you run things efficiently like those I think are good pieces of this. Um, and then it goes to, you know, you right size it. We'll get

over the FOMO and like the the extra investments and then probably get right sized into where in the stack you really want to invest with the ROI. &gt;&gt; Very cool. So uh with this like uh I'd

like to uh take it uh a little bit more deeper like we spoke about some of the opportunities we agree on something we may not on some Tuan you invest early on founders

I wanted to check with you and understand with you how do you can you tell us that is there a mismatch between what is getting funded and what needs to be funded

Is there a good question is there a mismatch between what's getting funded what needs to be funded? Well, I mean um &gt;&gt; probably &gt;&gt; yeah I mean uh

I I I think well okay uh you know going to the theme of this I think there is a there's more likely to be a mismatch between what is getting uh uh what is what is getting funded in the sort of

like the the pure AI world if we're talking about the foundational models, right? I think um Jeff, I think you had made this comment a little bit earlier. You look at a lot of the AI companies

out there and it's a little bit like the dot era where you'll see a hundred companies and the reality is that in five years, you know, and there will be five of them that are left, right? Um I

think um uh and one reason why I like uh focusing on infrastructure type businesses is because I think there's more durability

and clarity to exactly what the problems are that you're trying to solve. And every great startup um begins with a really well understood problem um and uh and a

product they call it product market fit like you know a founder that's able to build a great solution uh to that problem uh that is uh that is validate that has some sort of market validation

and need um and what I find really exciting about infrastructure businesses is I think the problems are a lot clearer in terms of what you're trying to solve right to your point right um

there's there's a lot more risk in the GPUs there's a lot more risk in the models that you're building uh that you're building around them and the reality too is that those things are

also going to change a lot faster right um I mean if you look at a data center like you as an example like a data center ultimately is a a a giant box that you know provides a lot of power um

at scale and it needs to be able to efficiently cool what's inside of it terms of what GPUs or or compute you put inside. I mean that that can change over many many generations. Um but the but

the the utility of the infrastructure you've built there will will always have have value. Right. So I don't know if that answers your question but &gt;&gt; yes.

&gt;&gt; Yeah. And to add to that, I think you know that if you look at the dot era measuring with with the exception of hardware companies which were in switches like Cisco and other players,

um it was very difficult to determine whether a product was good or not. For those who remember MySpace before Facebook, um it looked like MySpace was going to own the social media space. Of

course, most half the people in here probably don't even know who MySpace is. Um it's much different now. Um there's a measurability component in all aspects of AI that didn't exist in the dotcom

era. You know, you had you had commerce platforms, but it wasn't clear what made a com one commerce platform better than another, right? The consumer would ultimately decide that over time and

through iterations. And you remember Amazon for a long time was known for, you know, one-click ordering. Well, none of us really want to do that because we [clears throat] don't want to make a

mistake and find out that we bought the wrong thing. Um, I think now it's different. Almost every aspect of artificial intelligence deployment from the foundational aspects all the way to

the top of the stack are measurable. Um, and so that's going to make the success and failure of businesses much more clear, much sooner than it was in the case of the dot error. And I think

that's going to be the the the the ultimately the element that shakes out companies very quickly. And then to the point about obsolescence and GPUs, we don't know what the hardware road maps

look like even inside of a Google or a or um uh Jensen's company Nvidia uh or somebody else that's out there and and power which is the fundamental thing I think we're talking about foundationally

can be grossly disrupted by those advances because if somebody break has a breakthrough on chip design that's now 10 or 50 or 100x what somebody else deployed their data center is now almost

instantly at least from a financing perspective obsolete and so that's a huge danger I think for investors um in those foundational areas &gt;&gt; thank you

&gt;&gt; soft areas &gt;&gt; Dr. Tobius like you have also been involved in the innovation ecosystem very strongly what is your take on this like what are you seeing because you are

also involved in in India like uh seen your company running hackathons and competitions. I'd love to know more from you. &gt;&gt; Yeah, adding to what just was discussed,

um we have a tendency to overestimate the next two years and impact and underestimate what's happening in 10 years and uh at the moment we are going into this with huge bands which even

maybe have these ups and down swings uh even much bigger. Um from my perspective what all What we are discussing on AI is absolutely real. This is a huge disruption. This is

changing industries. This is changing lives. This is changing professions. Wherever there is data, there's change. And that in the end is driving what we doing by developing the products we have

which is semiconductors products by being in India for that since literally decades. development centers um well from our DNA history as a company of Motorola Freescale NXP here in the NOA

Delhi region in Bangalore and so on. So very much working on that and on your question from an innovation perspective. Well, we all know the hype cycle and that's tough because it always means

that there is this trough of disillusionment and we've seen it for all major breakthroughs where especially when there are being hyped up like hell. There's the self-driving cars, there's

other things. In the end, these things get real. They have the substance. they happen and they transform things and AI will the way there and also in the question hey what's the risk what's the

bad and what's coming from the sidelines I think we will see still troughs of disillusionments and surprises there was one some while ago when this wave had a deepse moment

such moments will come again and there will be a recovery from that I'm also sure so I'm in innovation since literally decades. I love it. It's a roller coaster. We overestimate, we get

shocked, and we get it right. &gt;&gt; Thank you. With that, I'll go to S. I was very excited when I saw Google launching Google Climate Technology Center. Okay. I'm uh and I would uh like

you to quickly give your insights like what is it about and what would the the innovators be looking for it there? Yes, thank you. So, super excited. This this week we um announced in partnership with

the office of princ uh principal scientific advisory for the government of India Google's center for climate tech and what did so there's a couple you know how did how did we get here

because that's interesting to you is um we see a lot of innovation I you know I live in Silicon Valley I was raised in India cross back and forth I've lived across the world there's different

innovation which comes from big institutes big academic settings big companies but there's also innovation that comes from different corners of the world. What we loved about the the PSA

philosophy was they're trying to get more tier 2 and tier three cities and also um a wider spread of universities and academia that that can get involved in this. So you know besides your your

premier ones so that was very enticing is how do we take innovation down to the roots uh which I think also helps with some of the hype cycle right because you're bringing it to the you're making

it local and you're also making contextual to where where those uh cities are. So in that in that uh with that in mind with what our center is looking for we have a couple big pillars

one is skilling we think there's green skilling you know a lot of focus on AI skilling but like you know in terms of uh green skills which are decarbonization clean energy in terms of

just we are looking at materials chemistry there's a lot of new things in those spaces which haven't been um brought into college curriculum or university curriculum so we want to

build upon that um a lot of the construction and investments are happening in tier 2 cities. So we think it's a great way to get a more diverse pool skilled in that. So that's number

one pillar. The the the second one is a lowcarbon materials. So you know you go to emboded carbon something we're all very passionate about. So how do you drive innovation in construction which

is going to be huge and again it's not just data centers. What you learn from data centers can be for real estate for commercial buildings. Um so it's it's to do with lowcarbon steel, low carbon

cement and low carbon materials as you as you see them go through that construction cycle. And the third one we we have looked at is right now that we have is sustainable aviation fuel. Uh

which is a little different from data centers. It's not that but I think it's like a good growing area which we are again one of the philosophies we have is where can we find first of a kind pilots

and places where we can build bring the Google brand and innovation and we think sustainable aviation fuel in a growing country that is like like now has one of the fastest growing airports and air

traffic that would be a good one too and our hope is as we go through this um we're trying to see very outcomes based so not pure research but pilots and actual update

&gt;&gt; thank you very quickly Tuan do Do you have any closing 30 seconds? [laughter] &gt;&gt; I was going to say there uh one one thing that I I don't think we had a chance to really discuss as much but is

important especially as we're uh at an event like this is um uh uh government financing the degree. I think what's really another thing that's been really exciting about this is

having a tech conference like this where you have the prime minister you have the prime minister and multiple heads of states coming from around the world um to say like this is these are things

that we need to invest in these things that we need to support um is is I think for from a from a tech VC side of things something that we're we're not used to seeing but I also think is very exciting

right both in the United States you're seeing you know hundreds of billions hundreds billions of dollars being being invested by the by by the by the federal government um into infrastructure,

right? And you're seeing similar investments being made um in uh in countries like India um countries outside of you know China's been doing this for a while but you're seeing this

uh happen around the world and so um yeah I think uh I mean where are we right now um there is the industrial re like I said at the beginning there's the industrial revolution that that AI is is

ushering in but there's also the industrial re revolution that the requirements of AI are also going to require or or is also going to usher in it. So,

I think it's it's going to be a bright future for us all. &gt;&gt; Thank you. That that's uh I I think that's great closing for us and uh I enjoyed talking to all of you. I really

had so much fun. Thank your insights are amazing. Hopefully uh the innovators looking here like got something out of it and we'll see some new people coming to all of us having the innovations.

Thank you. [applause]
