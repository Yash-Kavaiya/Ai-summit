## 📝 Transcript

institute. Then we have Rafael Loa, data scientist at the German Federal Office. We have Dr. Shahini Yaktyamani, senior officer technology program at the

German Marshall Fund. And we have Norman Schulz, counselor at the coordination staff AI and digital technologies at the German foreign office. And to kick off the conversation today,

um, so we will cover both AI as a topic and as a tool. I would like to first start with the tool. So going to Rafael who's a data scientist. How do you use AI in your in the foreign office and I

also know um that you have data labs data and AI labs in the foreign office. So could you maybe share a little bit of your day-to-day work and um yeah actually how could AI be used in

diplomacy? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Um thanks so much. Um yeah, maybe to get uh or to take a step back um and answer the question how like someone like me as a um as a data scientist by

training ends up in in a foreign ministry. I think that's uh something that at least when we talk to colleagues around the world is still rather um rare. Um we had kind of the lucky

coincidence that um uh I think in 2021 the German government decided to start uh data labs in uh in all of its federal ministries. Um so in the coming years since then 2022 or until 2022 kind of 16

data labs have been founded in the German federal government. Uh and I was uh lucky enough to um be part of the one in the German federal foreign office. Um yeah and uh I was uh yeah working on AI

ever since we started more on traditional data science I would say. So tearing down data silos between governments or government institutions in Germany and of course um ever since

uh CHGPT and the AI um revolution we have been working mostly in on AI tools and I think the big advantage that we see is that we are in the ministry itself and have very very short um

contacts uh and uh short paths to our colleagues who are working in Berlin and of course all around the world and I believe in a field that is as fast moving as AI that is so important

because it doesn't really work um to develop these tools in sort of a traditional IT way of doing things right we used to have IT development projects that take

two years have huge teams cost a lot of money but that are just not fast enough to deliver on um an AI solution that our colleagues are experiencing themselves in their

private lives, right? And some of them even um in in in some uh official uh aspects. So what we think is is the big advantage that we have and what we uh kind of from our experience uh would

always advertise for is kind of this fast co-creation from within an organization. Um and I think that is for a topic like um diplomacy that is the best way of of of leveraging AI and I'm

happy to go into more detail about that. Thank you and I will later ask you more on concrete use cases but first I would like to switch to the geopolitical dimension. Um so shining switching over

to you taking a backs a step back um AI is now in the political landscape more or less present everywhere from the arctis um but also here at the summit. Can you

give us a broader picture? How is AI shaping diplomacy or foreign policy in general? What is the debate and where are we at the moment? &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you for the question

and also the invitation to be here. um which is actually also me being in my home country. So you've invited me to my home country which is an interesting interesting space to be in. Um but at

the at the broader sort of geopolitical level um AI is shaping not only sort of how we use technology in our strategic communication as countries as well but as a tool of technology diplomacy and I

don't necessarily think [clears throat] this is particularly new. Um throughout the history of international relations and foreign policy, technology has always shaped our foreign policy. So

this is the AI revolution. But if we take it back to the industrial revolution, if we take it back to the nuclear revolution, if we take it back to the space race, technology has always

informed diplomacy and today it is artificial intelligence. So the technology is not is new yes but the tactics aren't. Uh and today we are here at the AI summit and this is also

India's way of communicating that it is being a part of a particular technological revolution um which in its previous histories because of colonial encounters and things we've been

excluded. So in this space, this is a way in which countries from our parts of the world are also trying to kind of claim a space in uh global technology diplomacy and this is through AI. Um and

what I would also kind of want to just qualify is what we're seeing in this particular sort of AI race is narratives of competition. So if you look at sort of policy documents coming

out of the United States, coming out of China, there's a clear uh connection between uh kind of winning an AI race or getting securing leadership in artificial intelligence. And if you are

a country of that size and you are the country that has invented the frontier technology and you've been sort of the first movers in that specific kind of geopolitical leverage

which countries like Germany and India perhaps don't have because we aren't at that frontier capability. But that being said, we're not powerless. we just have a different form of power expressing

power and that is when the entire middle power conversation comes into play. Uh both India and Germany can see themselves are in fact arguably uh middle powers and they have different

ways of using uh their specific leverage on an AI value chain as geopolitical leverage. So for in for Germany historically this has been through rules and through regulation and regulatory

power. Um for India now it is making a case for uh applications. So India and we've seen the the fact that the summit has changed from the AI action summit which was the French uh presidency. Now

we're seeing India framing it as the impact summit. The slogans of the summit are very much to do with aspirations to deployment or aspirations to impact. So that is really a way in which a middle

power like India is also trying to kind of claim its position on the stack. So what you're seeing are the great powers who are competing at the frontier level and then there are middle powers who are

claiming their specific power on the AI value chain in different ways. And I'll stop there for a second. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much. And I would like to pick up this segment that you said the

tech um isn't new but the the tech is new but the tactics aren't. Um, so I have here a diplomat sitting next to me. Would you would you agree with the statement? And how do you govern AI in

the Ministry of Foreign Affairs? Um, and would you say is this still the right approach to AI? [gasps] &gt;&gt; Oh well, the the short the short answer would be no. But uh the the topic is so

broad that obviously I could give you a four-hour talk about it. But as a diplomat as you said uh one has to uh start by saying that uh the AI impact summit here in in Delhi where we are uh

all gathered uh showcases uh the broad uh variety of AI and and the broad picture that AI is now uh part of uh everyday's life of all uh uh of all strands of life um uh that it is a a

tool in uh agriculture in in in industrial uh uh entrepreneurship in finance uh and also in uh diplomacy and foreign policy. So um uh the uh uh the I I find that uh very interesting what you

what you alluded to that uh we have these revolution uh revolutions all the time like the industrial revolution like the nuclear revolution after the second world war uh or and uh where do the uh

foreign ministries where do foreign policy comes in? I mean the the technological revolution created uh uh frontr runners uh like the UK maybe a little bit like France. Uh but uh there

was a point in time when people saw that only uh being at the front and and adapting the frontier models is not the way to success. But we have to find a way to regulate things because otherwise

uh uh people will lose their lives. uh uh it's not work safe, it's polluting the environment. Even back then that was a problem. Nuclear power, the same thing. Um there was a race uh uh in the

50s and the Cuba crisis beginning at the 60s uh showed to the world that the nuclear race could not go on uh like it was. But we need international cooperation to uh mitigate somehow the

risks of it. And I think uh AI is at a at a similar point. uh um maybe uh it it needs a a couple of more years when uh uh the US and China will actively come together and work out uh where uh what

uh limitations and regulations we have to put on the technology because the risks in the end are outweighing uh beneficial uh uh possible and potential benefits. And the other great question

is where do the middle powers come in? And this is uh what India and Germany are are talking about. Uh well we had the the speech of Marani the Canadian prime minister and divorce uh where he

actually uh actively called for middle power cooperation. Um uh I think India is is at a wonderful place because you uh you are a digital powerhouse uh uh and and you have all the structures and

and all the workforce to also become an AI powerhouse. I would also make the case that Germany has also some uh advantages. We have uh uh yeah we have infrastructure we have uh the money to

uh invest into AI and we also have industrial data to uh be a for a frontr runner even if we didn't succeed at the stage of large language models maybe when it comes to robotics uh and

embodied AI Germany will still have a role to play and obviously uh we at the foreign office are there to um to accompany uh uh the the development of this and to to uh uh prepare the ground

for c international cooperation and I will leave it at that because others &gt;&gt; thank you thank you I would like to turn now to the tinten perspective um the prenav institute works at the

intersection of emerging technology public policy and society from an India first perspective um How do you see um how do you see potential room for

cooperation between India and Germany? Like we hear now the middle power both are middle power. I hear a lot at the summit that India is leading in a AI adoption. Um I wouldn't say so maybe in

Germany maybe my German colleagues would agree or disagree with me but from your perspective where do you see cooperation like potential cooperation and could you also go a step back and um explain to

the audience where you see India at the moment maybe also in light of the AI summit. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Can you hear me? I think that's a very challenging question to answer.

Where is India at? India is at a very interesting place. Certainly um India is not lagging behind. India is not yet at a place where we can build frontier models. I think the infrastructure

capacity for that is very high. I do see some interesting innovation coming out of India. uh when we saw those 14 models that serve released over 14 days and very very interesting in the sense that

this is innovation which is grounded contextual it's coming from the grassroots you able to find native language use cases you're able to do inference at scale at much uh an order

of magnitude cheaper costs so you're seeing uh technical innovation which is more context appropriate coming from India there is of course a large workforce which is talented in

technology and there is an upskilling possibility that certainly exists when into AI and that's a very large pipeline. Um so I think India is in a very interesting place. India is

adopting, India is innovating, India is building applications and use cases which is a very useful way to think about the technology in its early stages. Right? Because there is a huge

possibility of investment booms and busts that can come in when you go in a technologically challenging direction without being adaptive. So I think the focus on saying what can we solve is a

very useful way to think. I think the councelor did allude to industrial AI. That's a fantastic use case of cooperation where you and India could possibly ind German cooperation would

certainly work out in that sense because there is uh industrial expertise, there is automation expertise in Germany, there is industrial data, India has the capability to build technology, build

models. So I think if we were to identify and not worry about the race for frontier models because transformers are not going to be the only technology paradigm out there and you know not play

the game that uh leading powers are but to really think as middle powers do as Shahin said and say that can we focus on sectoral expertise for example AI and healthcare is a fantastic opportunity

for Indo-German cooperation there is fantastic data available uh India performs 10 times the number of surgeries uh that other countries do so there's very interesting data available

Germany has the capacity to invest can we cooperate Germany has expertise in automation India has you know people who can build AI models can we cooperate so I think there is possibility for

bilateral cooperation that you know gives an argument that is more than one plus one in the case of some of these and I don't think it's a zero- sum game that US is winning or China is winning

and we all left behind I think the focus on applications is really where uh differentiator is possible and that need not come at frontier level costs &gt;&gt; thank you and I would like to focus now

on this application side because this is maybe the way to to react um to big tech or or like us as a countries being in the middle between these mentioned countries. Um Rafa, can I hand over to

you to share a little bit how you at the foreign office approach? I know that you're working on a negotiation tool and to what extent can open source also be a solution or might be a solution to the

situation where we are at the moment. &gt;&gt; Sure. Um yeah so I think it's exactly as you said um that um the focus is on application we have made a um consequential consequential but I think

important decision at the beginning that when we are implementing AI we are focusing for most of what we do on open source technologies not just the models themselves but also a lot of the kind of

scaffolding and applications around it. So um on the one hand for example we are reusing applications that for example come from one of our state governments who have done um like um kind of a

general um chat and knowledgebased application that we are reusing. But of course we have specific applications in the foreign office like supporting negotiations. A lot of what diplomats

nowadays do is not necessarily sitting in rooms and negotiating face to face but actually um digging through huge uh piles of documents and trying to um understand the positions of other

countries um the impact that NOS's academia corporations bring into huge negotiation processes and of course that's as we probably all know is a great uh chance for artificial

intelligence um to to leverage I One important point when we're talking about AI um and open source AI in governments is that we have seen a big trend shift or a shift in the trend last year where

we have seen that a lot of the um kind of leading open source AI models um and actually also the ones that have been adopted in many parts of the world are coming from China nowadays. I think

that's an interesting intersection between my position as a as a technical observer here where we're looking at the numbers and seeing that really like um you know the world is adopting Chinese

AI models at the moment and of course the consequences that that might bring for a country like Germany or a country like India on a global scale if maybe some of our partners are are um

implementing uh implementing Chinese AI models. So um that is something that uh when it comes to open source I think it's really important that countries like India and I think India is at a at

a great position and I'm super excited to see these new Indian AI models as well these Indian NLMs um uh to see if there if there can be pushes uh that you know offer

alternatives to these uh to these Chinese models. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Um I would like to come back to this impact aspect. Now we heard impact in the

public sector but maybe also reflecting on the summit AI impact summit. Um what are your thoughts on like how will we now continue the conversation um regarding impact regarding really being

concrete and not only writing governance um formats or governance uh I don't know how to call it frameworks. So um how can we make this cooperation very concrete and also continue where we

are and uh face this geopolitical challenge journey. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Um I like that all the geopolitical questions then somehow come back to me. Uh um but I I don't blame you because my

background is is in international relations. So that that does that serves very well this purpose. But I want to kind of also connect your point to what you just said about open source and the

China connection. Um I think uh we're reaching a stage in international relations in which geopolitics and technology can't be separated. um when we are integrating uh artificial

intelligence into our daily life um and into our government systems um we can't really separate the security risks that come with it. Uh and I think every country um has a unique security

situation. Um for Germany obviously um there is the concern with Ukraine. Uh with India we have uh broader security challenges uh as well. uh we have territorial disputes that are very

significant and have very serious national security implications. So the kind of technology we deploy into our systems and if it's open source Chinese models or any other form where we

perceive or any country would perceive a national security risk that needs to be factored in and that is why even in our technology decisions and they are they have to factor geopolitical risk which

back in the day was not something that say companies would have to do but now every single company that I see has now a position for a geopolitical risk advisor. And that really comes from the

fact that we are living in a world in which if we are using technologies so so seriously in our lives, we do need to factor in how those technologies can be weaponized in a particular geopolitical

situation. And and then that kind of brings me back to also some of the points that were on um you said you know where we you foreign office would like find it helpful for reports to be kind

of processed to AI. As a think tank I think tank I'm a little bit hurt. I have to say because a lot of our work is producing a lot of those reports but we will force you to read them. We're very

persistent at the German Marshall Fund. We will reach out and invite you and make you read them. Jokes aside, um, uh, it is really, uh, we're aware also that our ability to consume information as

well, um, is is is kind of short becoming shorter, but the world is getting more complex. Um and there therefore we are also kind of preparing uh even in the think tanking that we do

or even in the way in which we uh kind of do our daily jobs to factor in that there will be an AI in this in this system and we kind of need to put that into consideration as well

and since there will be an AI in the system we have to make sure that we can trust this AI and that it's um also inclusive and that it's um yeah ethical in a sense or trustworthy

um regarding to standards. So how do you and the government react to this? Could you also share more about the global digital compact? Um what is this panel about this scientific panel I think it's

called? Um and how do we make sure that from this governance it goes to the system to the AI system like how do we make sure that the systems are aligned with our values?

&gt;&gt; Well, that's a big question. uh the the best way to align uh the systems with our values is to develop uh to develop them ourselves right and not uh just um uh procure them from uh from outside and

uh I couldn't agree more with the point that you made about the the uh the Chinese models uh that uh even if it it is open source even if it uh runs on our servers there's there are still Chinese

models. They still have the uh Chinese ways and and uh the Chinese ways of of of thinking um which comes through maybe not all the time. So uh uh using AI to do diplomatic

work uh will not be the way because then every report will be the same, right? Um so uh I hope that uh Germany will not go the way to write the diplomatic reports now only using AI or or or summarizing

it. Uh but we need our diplomats to to in insert that in innovative thinking and in innovative thinking does not come from AI because AI is much rather uh replicating summarizing in my

understanding. the the the new ideas still come from from the human side as far as I I uh make it out. Global digital compact. Thanks for the question. Uh the foreign office was uh

the the lead uh in Germany to uh negotiate the uh global um digital compact and um obviously you can make a point that this is a UN um uh a a UN compact uh and the UN system is

under the immense pressure at the moment. So what does it achieve? Uh and I I would make the point that despite all that it has at least produced uh two valuable avenues for future in uh um uh

for future uh cooperation and discussion, two platforms. the one uh the first is the AI panel. I think it's called Independent Scientific International Panel on AI, but I could

be wrong with the two eyes. Uh it's it's rather complicated. Um but it was just yesterday that the uh UN secretary general made the point that the AI panel and the second one the

dialogue I will come to in a second are the two major things where the UN is coming into the picture and the panel has uh uh the um has the task to put our discussions that we have on a global

level about AI on a scientific basis. So they those are experts and I'm happy that uh there are two experts from Germany on the panel. Um only the US and China has have also two experts. Uh I'm

terribly sorry I don't know how many Indian experts on on the panel but we'll find that out. True. Um so they will uh produce uh a first report a sum a summary of uh uh

where the AI uh science is now standing in time for the first uh global dialogue on AI governance uh which will happen in July in Geneva in the margins or backtoback with the uh AI for good

summit at the international telecommunications union. Um and this dialogue serves uh the other big uh uh purpose of the global digital compact which is to make the AI discussion

inclusive. And so it's it's also the the UN secretary general nonetheless that said that AI cannot be a discussion among the few uh the the ones that uh are the front runners like the US and

China. They should not be the one to they should not be the only one to set the rules. But it has to be a truly inclusive uh uh discussion about AI. And up until now more than a 100 countries

were not part of this discussion because they were not members of the European Union, not members of the Council Europe, not members of the G7 or the G20, but they are the ones that will in

in in that will use AI, that will adapt AI, and they will also uh feel the the the bad results if AI uh is is not doing what it is supposed to do. So it's good that they have a voice at the table that

all UN member states will in July come together and talk about AI on the scientific base that the panel has provided. So that is something that the global digital compact is doing. Uh and

of course we can talk about geopolitics uh all the time but uh I think that's that's a way forward and it's it's to make a point and I stop here and make a point. Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. And Gian let me turn to you now. Um what I see sometimes is that we on the one side talk about multilateral cooperation and it also becomes very

concrete also with these panels um about including everyone in the discussion but at the same time in more or less many nations um we hear sovereign sovereign AI or European sovereignty it's called

in our continent. um does it contradict these approaches like we have the GDC inclusive all together working together between nations and on the other side we all want to have our own so so how do

you see it um and where where are we and how can we as Germany and India collaborate uh even though maybe our frameworks are not the same or maybe they are the same

&gt;&gt; no I think that's that's again one of the most difficult questions out there right that's the typical classical uh you know IR conversation between realism and uh you know and more ideal approach

that we're looking at but u I do think there is a value for multilateral uh engagement. I do think initiatives like the global digital compact are really important. I also think it'll be

short-sighted to assume that we are going to have uh sort of you know a G2 race and everybody else does not matter. I think that's that's a framing that is convenient and it's not often true. The

longer arc of technology looks very different and the longer arc of adoption also looks different. Middle powers certainly have a say as Shahini put it and I think that it is an opportunity

for countries like India and Germany which do share a conviction that it's not going to be only a geopolitical race but it needs to be inclusive. India frames it as saying that you know the

global south has to have a voice. We need to have inclusivity and I think that's one of the moss of this summit as well and I think the focus even on AI application instead of saying making it

a frontier model race is also an important way to frame it such that it becomes a more inclusive dialogue. What is the benefit that we can look at instead of saying forcing every country

into a sovereignty race where billions are called and you know the it the framing itself can change and I think the framing of making it inclusive framing of making it application

oriented is something that is important. The idea that Germany and India share I believe is that a respect for the rules based order, a respect for international institutions and the fact that there is

not a zero sum game in a lot of this. I think the idea that we can work together to bring the you know a larger voice beyond the worries of um you know two countries or three countries which are

able to compete at the top. I think that's something that is shared and I think the role of middle powers in in bringing a more inclusive conversation is really important and I think indoor

German cooperation is an opportunity for that including for example industrial AI that uh you know the council mentioned or other opportunities where we can practically create tools uh like what

Rafael is also talking about where we can practically create tools that are beneficial and maybe open source. Why should open source models only come from strategically challenging sources? there

could be you know indoor open source models smaller models not frontier models that could be beneficial. &gt;&gt; Yeah I can maybe react to that directly because I think it's a super critical

point. I don't think um you know some people believe or make us believe that the AI race is already over or kind of only being decided between uh the US and China. I don't believe that. I think

we're more at the start of what's going to come and I can I think we can feel this at the summit and GA you asked the question what comes next. I think next comes

building and implementing um AI in all these uh kind of fields that we have. I think we see so many ideas around here and first steps towards that but we don't

really see widespread AI adoption in every field of in every in every kind of part of life. I do think this is going to happen over the next five years and I don't believe for a second that this is

only going to be done by the US or China and yeah I think um that when it comes to uh middle powers Germany India I think we are going to see um much closer collaboration in like smaller groups um

that don't try to kind of um build dependence right making you dependent on us making us dependent on you but rather ensure that uh every country can bring to the table what what they are

particularly good at and make um make the results um kind of improve the application of AI for everybody involved. I do think there is there is a strategy for that and I think um yeah

the way forward you have asked is uh to start with it and to build um AI together. I think this aid is a great um you know a great rally cry for that. &gt;&gt; Just one.

&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Please uh Rafael, you uh led me onto a very interesting trail, so I had to interwe. I think one of the interesting moments if you think about technology again uh in the 1990s was the

open source revolution, right? And when you really saw operating systems which are considered the frontier technology of that time being built by volunteers at a fraction of the cost. It diffused

the race in a certain way or diffused the dominance in a certain way but also enabled accessibility across the world. So I think even coming together as middle powers, the power of open source

in democratizing and reducing the factor costs of access to AI, it becomes very powerful if you draw the middle. &gt;&gt; And now you uh led me on to a trail uh as well. Um I just want to kind of

contextualize the sovereignty thing as well. Um and I do think that when we talk about artificial intelligence, it's not just one application that we see when we use our phones or interact with

a particular model, right? It's an entire stack. Um and the question of sovereignty or the concerns visav the sovereignty debate is also born out of geopolitics, right? So we don't want to

be as uh a particular country in which suddenly one day we wake up and our technology is not available to us because of something else that happened in another corner of the world. So the

sovereignty debate is coming out of geopolitics as well. That being said, we don't need to be beholden to it. Uh and I fully agree and I really like the point on us understanding what our

strengths are. in Germany had a high-tech strategy that came out last year. There's also an emphasis on Germany being a space for data as a data hub. Um um it has and India is trying to

do that as well. Germany already has that. One of the things China is really good at actually is industrial data. Um because they have been collecting this data for a very long time because they

automate it quicker than a lot of us. Um, and that's something where we can collectively build competitiveness. So, I do think we need to reset some of the inequalities in the AI stack and that

sovereignty as much as I kind of understand where that comes from. I don't always think that that's the best uh language to talk about where we are at. I do think we need more

sophisticated and nuanced ways of kind of talking about uh a managed interdependence where I have a certain value on an AI stack that is my strength and the likelihood of you weaponizing

that makes it very limited. So that's why I have leverage and I do think uh leveraging a country's strength on a specific AI stack is a prominent and powerful middle power strategy.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. So these are all beautiful closing remarks but I would like to open the floor to the audience. Are there any questions? Yes, I will walk around. &gt;&gt; The guy behind us.

&gt;&gt; Yeah. Hi, I'm Sriang. I'm a student at Ashoka University. I have a question for everyone in the panel. Uh feel free to to answer. Um the question is what are some parts of foreign policy research,

decision making and implementation which can be automated by AI or that will use a significant uh significant uses of AI are to sort of do your day-to-day tasks. [clears throat]

&gt;&gt; Maybe I can quickly answer this question. Um well I certainly don't think that AI will make any any decision in anytime soon. So there's always going to be the human that is making the

decision. And it's not going to be me. It's not going to be my boss. It's going to be a a uh um collaborative uh um uh decision by the government and and the legislature and all of that. But and but

our job will also not go away. We will use AI to make our job our job easier to uh consume data to consume I would like to say information but it's nothing else than data. uh consuming information

easier, quicker and uh which in turn will free diplomats to do the other time which is connecting which is uh connecting the dots uh which is uh thinking out uh innovative ways of

cooperation uh which is uh it's basically like drinking coffee and shaking hands these type uh traveling to India and and learn a lot about the situation here. So AI uh will free us

from tedious tasks of skipping through uh these very valuable documents uh uh written by not only NOS's but also governments and will make our lives easier but our work will not go away.

Thank you. &gt;&gt; Okay, one more question. The lady maybe in the back &gt;&gt; please also introduce yourself. &gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, no problem. Hi, I'm Sanjini

and I work in radio journalism in the UK and my question was for you Nan. So uh [laughter] specifically you so uh Nan and Shereini both of you actually. So uh when I was doing my masters in

journalism I was studying about how journalists were framing the Russia Ukraine war and what I observed from how the narratives were changing based on different outlets but something when you

were talking about how AI is coming into play do you think AI will help change narratives for the better and I'm not speaking from journalism point of view in general geopolitically do you think

the narratives will be framed in a way that's unbiased or how do you I think it will help in that. I didn't take a stab. I'd be very curious to point a question actually to

you because one of the things I've been really intrigued in in my line of work is how AI has been being deployed in the media and newsrooms and I'd be very interested to have a chat after to learn

how how you're doing that in terms of methodology. Um but uh to your question on AI shaping narratives, I would not let AI shape narratives. I would hope we shape narratives as human beings uh

depending on sort of what we think and feel and analyze through empirical evidence about the world. Um and I would be very worried in a world in which AI we allow AI um the the space to shape

narratives especially on geopolitics because then that would depend upon what that particular AI model that is doing the narrative shaping has been trained on.

But that being said, um I would also see um how AI can do the harm in terms of amplifying incorrect narratives or or geopolitically challenging narratives and that's when we know that AI cannot

replace society and it cannot do. So I I I do think that we are in a world in which uh if AI we allow AI to shape narratives that's not a world we want to live in. Um uh but at the same time if

it is a world in which that can happen we need to find the right mitigation strategies to do that. Um one thing that I know India is doing Sham we talked about it earlier which is these bias

detection uh technologies that are critical. Um AI is a technology that on one hand we do need strong regulation to make sure that we can prevent the harms from doing what they can but at the same

time we need also technological tools to deal with some of those harms and push uh a democratic innovation as well in in AI for exactly these harms. And I'll stop there

&gt;&gt; just uh one one sentence. Uh if you if you let AI uh um um write the newspapers, they are becoming incredibly dull because it's going to be repetitive all the time. But I agree with your

point about bias. This is something that we all have to challenge and to to uh face. And AI is helping us. That's a good thing. AI is not only a risk, it's also the opportunity helping us detect

bias and then contravene it. Thank you. &gt;&gt; And maybe just one sentence I want to add because I found your point so important. I don't see any risk that AI is going to shape the narratives itself

somehow. But of course, it's an incredible tool for actors trying to shape narratives and we have seen this on so many fronts already. We have colleagues in the foreign office who are

actually monitoring this and seeing that you know it's for example used to amplify certain messages across social media increasingly now across you know faked websites that with the help of AI

you can pull up in seconds and suddenly you you don't have one of them or two of them but you have thousands of them um and that is something that AI is already used quite heavily um as a tool of

certain actors who are trying to influence geopolitical disc discussions in exactly that way. &gt;&gt; Sorry, we are running out of time, but I'm sure that the speakers stay here a

little bit. So, thank you for your um for listening to our panel discussion. Maybe a big applause to our panelists and in case you have question, they will be around here so you can ask them

directly. Thank you. What is the next?
