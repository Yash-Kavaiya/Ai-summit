## 📝 Transcript

minister. What do you mean? The future is being written by algorithms, data, and the choices we make today. At the center of policy research and governance, CPRG, the

future of society initiative was launched to ask a simple but urgent question. How will AI and emerging technologies reshape the way we live, learn, work, and govern? The initiative

brings together policy research, engagement, and capacity building to ensure technology serves people ethically, responsibly, and inclusively. CPRG's flagship state of AI in India

report offers one of the most comprehensive assessments of AI adoption across sectors from education and healthcare to agriculture law and tourism. But the future is not abstract.

It is unfolding today. India's first ever reports on AI in school and higher education by CPRG examine how young Indians are already using AI to shape aspirations.

The findings sparked national debate and wide media coverage. Recognizing data as the backbone of AI innovation, CPRG launched the data initiative and the data as a service reform. Exploring jobs

and opportunity in India's AI ecosystem. Beyond research, CPRG convenes dialogue from PAI1 in New Delhi to global forums in Belgrade and Paris. CPRG brings policy makers, educators, industry, and

citizens together to reimagine AI and the future of society. The initiative is guided by a simple belief. Technology should expand human potential and strengthen society.

age of religion. Hallelujah. Yeah, I am. Thank you. Uh thank you everyone for joining this

session. uh session start or future of society joint in center of policy research and governance

policy think tank policy and governance emerging technology or society. Future of society center develop

under future of society we are continuously working on the you know various sector uh producing report doing a lot of uh stakeholder consultation is see light may just one year before we

have published one report uh usage of AI in higher education. Now we have just launched going to released uh one more report usage of AI in school education. In next

month we are going again going to launch uh report future of job fear acquired next year.

What kind of future skills? What kind of future jobs are coming? But next month is AI in school education stage.

Now we have a short presentation with some salient findings from our study. So AI in school education this is a report this is a survey report that we have conducted late last year as part of

our ongoing internal activities on mapping AI usage among students in India in various sectors in India. So over the past year CPRG has now released two reports on AI adoption in education. So

last year we released a report on AI adoption in higher education. This was the first ever survey based report in India on mapping everyday AI use among college students. Today now we are

launching our new report on AI adoption in school education. Both studies have been conducted in Delhi where we have actually gone to students interviewed them to understand what are they using

AI for, how often they using AI for and what are various challenges and opinion on usage of AI. So firstly if we just compare our broad findings what we find is that AI use

among school students remains relatively high though marginally lower than what we found among college students within the same city because both studies were conducted in Delhi yet what we find is

that nearly 50% of students and these are of course these are students from private schools in Delhi that's that was our limited sample almost 50% of them use AI based tools tool. These could be

generative AI platforms or other AI tools all multiple times a week. What are patterns of AI or edtech use as per academic stream? So what we're finding is that while AI use especially

generative AI platforms such as tragicity, Gemini remains relatively high. What this is also leading to is also leading to some sort of a challenge to traditional methods of learning and

edtech platforms that had become extremely prominent and widely used over the past few years. Then what are students using AI for? So apart from asking how often are students

using AI, we also go tried to delve into what are they using AI for? And what we find in our study is that AI use is essentially concentrated for generally searching for new academic for academic

information while studying or writing assistance and this of course varies across streams because some students may be more engaged in practice solving question solving and EI use depends on

uh depends on usage but however what we find is that among science students for instance while there's high AI usage for learning concepts there is very limited usage for structured tasks like

calculations or calculations or solving questions because that is where various AI platforms still have relatively low accuracy. Now what is perceived helpfulness of AI

for school exams and entrances and here what we interestingly what we find are a few things. One there is relatively high perceived helpfulness of AI platforms for both studying for school exams and

entrance exams. While especially for entrance exams, students who are in the science team are more likely to engare for entrance exams are still more dependent on offline classes or edtech

platforms. Yet the level at which we are seeing perceived AI helpfulness. It means that there's a emerging challenge that is coming to edtech platforms through free usage of generative AI

platforms. AI support in learning and performance. So what are we how do students rate AI based platforms or AI based tools in terms of their actual impact and what we

find is that apart from of course learning complex topics improving their time management there's a there's a substantial proportion of students who are actually attributing improvement in

their academic performance to use of AI platforms at the same time students report issues with accuracy and challenges in var challenges in AI use. One of the major

challenges with with respect to AI use is that students a significant proportion of students regularly encounter AI hallucination or are able to identify that they're getting

incorrect information. Then secondly, as I mentioned, when it comes to accuracy for logical or numerical subjects, there is relatively lower reported accuracy. Again, this is something that various

platforms are still working on in terms of trying to improve their performance and accuracy. Next is apart from their overall planning and understanding overall AI

uses, we also tried to compare AI platforms and their performance with other tools. So what we did was we asked students number one is a are AI perfor AI platforms better than YouTube or ICT

based learning and there what we find is that there's still overwhelming support for YouTube video or ICT based learning tools. Secondly there's a whole question of adaptive learning and AI addressing

individual needs. Here there is an overwhelming evaluation by students that while AI might tools might be helpful, they are not necessarily providing solutions that are specific to their

needs. And this of course might be because of the nature of AI tools that students are using which is in most cases free models of generative AI platforms as opposed to specific AI

tools that are actually able to undertake adaptive learning. And then finally we tried to ask the we tried to ask about AI versus human interaction. So what so the idea of AI tutors or AI

based learning tools replacing in-person teaching there again there's an overwhelming support to there essentially overwhelming support for the idea that students still prefer

traditional human interaction based learning. So what we're finding in our study is that while AI is definitely emerging as in ter AI use is definitely increasing significantly among students

it is still considered as a supplementary tool as opposed to a main dep as opposed to a replacement or substitute for traditional teaching. So these were some of the finding we have

more detailed findings in our report and at the end I would just like to thank our team that worked on this report. I would like to thank Nitan Ma and Miss Suchraati for their guidance and oversee

of this research and I would like to thank our team members Gori, Shria, Anupria, Rashi, Mika and Sugal for their active involvement and participation in the study. Thank you so much.

&gt;&gt; Uh thank you Prjik for the presentation. Uh today as a panelist now we have professor Kik Agraal sir president South Asian University. We have professor Panka Jaroda sir

chairperson of national council of teacher education. Sri Suresh Yados sir, executive director, Commonwealth Secretary. Andra B. Patil sir, Edson Secretary

Higher Education. And we have Aditi Nanda, director Education and Industry, Intel. And uh Agraal sir you have seen uh you know

the transformation during IT movement or correctly if I can align university develop and maybe because you are

and you are in the process to develop a new institution. So initution develop mind for the how you know it is going to challenge those you know kind of uh traditional or conservative approach of

you know institutions. Now again you are the president of South Asian University. It's a you know one of the iconic institution in India and again you are facing new challenge you know from the

AI. So how you are you know how you are finding this AI is different from the I you know past IIT because in your lifetime you have seen two movement first IT now AI and at the same

time you are developing two new institutions because before you SA was you know not in that position but now SA is leading so how you are finding &gt;&gt; thank Thank you Raman G for the

question. Yes. Uh in a way when I was uh asked to develop the very first university in Delhi Indraasta University and it was a challenge because it is the first university in the country and

you're very right it movement was also in the offing. uh it probably happened by coincidence that the vice chancellor which is me which was appointed at that time uh belonged to the secretary of

this was probably never a calculation but it happened but it happened for the good of the country and the university I believe because you could got to get two in one kind of uh person to develop uh

so we we made sure that right from beginning it is uh that was the time And if you remember I saw the students in Delhi. Incidentally I think this was the first

uh university in Delhi for the students after Delhi University who was an affiliating university. So number one so I was seeing the student go to the Delhi University colleges they are not

satisfied with the employment and in the evening they go to a tech company and do a course there. Now that was very much disturbing to me why the students should feel not very satisfied at the end of

the formal school or formal college and then try to do that. So my first thing was let's combine the two. So our curriculum itself should uh integrate both if the students have a job in IT

sector why should we not realize this and make sure that every subject is more IT saving and so on and so forth. Now when I am here the challenge obviously as you say is AI. AI is fortunately

being adopted by the youngsters even faster uh which was expected. It was also adopted by them faster than the elders. AI is being adopted much faster uh than elders which is a good sign.

Only thing which one has to see is uh uh as I said in the whole process of using AI let's make sure it supplements our our creativity it does not give us a shortcut to creativity and thereby

reduce our thinking powers that is a challenge which we have to face in academics short of that it's a good opportunity for Yes. &gt;&gt; Uh so sir u while working with the

president Mukharji you have introduced lot of you know technological tool and you know lot of innovation not only you know in the field of in the finance ministry but as a adviser of

president you have lot you have introduced lot of you know educational innovation as well. And I think that was two before 200 uh time of 2014 and 15 after the covid-19

the educational situation has been changed and it is you know getting changed very fast. How you know you will analyze and how will assess this kind of change and what

would you kind uh what will you suggest you know to to educational institution and to the head of the institution to you know kind of to address those challenges posed by AI and other

emerging technology. Thank you very much and u first of all a big congratulations on this u fantastic report which u talks about the AI and the school education and also your

previous reports which talks about AI and I think it's a very good documentation to understand where we where we stand as a society as a country as an institutions in the emerging

landscape. uh covid changed ramanj drastically the way the word look at the various way of doing the things I mean going to the office was normal now not going to the

office is normal so there is a fundamental shift it's very difficult to get the people back to office and and the argument is that if I can do my job better while sitting my home why do you

want me to come to the office so these are the fundamental shift which we have witnessed postco and then if you look at the artificial intelligence it's a paradigm shift it's

not only 180°ree it's a 360° shift we don't know which direction and what direction we are going any organization any society any institution which is not live and kicking to this new emerging

reality will be fossilized remember we have in 180 controlling the almost onethird GDP of the world and it was not the country which was leading it were the institutions it were the

institutions of that time which were producing the skill which can produce the goods and services and the material which can dominate the world so it was the role of the institutions of course

the government has now tried to recreate nalanda which is coming out very well so the point I'm trying to emphasize is that the role of educational institutions is of paramount importance.

No institutions can dominate the world. No country can dominate the world unless the institutions dominate the world. If you look today, US is dominating the world. Not because of the military power

but because of the higher education system. If you look at the China, the Chinese universities are coming on the top. The number of research in field of computer science, AI, machine learning,

computer vision is dwarfing the research being done in United States now. So that's the level of the shift. So when I'm talking about in your topic reimagining the education system in

India, I'm not talking of today, I'm talking of India of 2050, India of 2100. And one thing I keep saying that um India a lot of people say it's a $5 trillion economy. They are very happy

that we are the third largest in PPP, fourth largest in the other term. But I'm not happy because India as of now of 1.5 billion people if you look at the European standard of GDP per capita we

should be more than 70 trillion. If you look at the American standards of GDP we should be more than 150 trillion more than the size of the world economy. So that is the level that is the where we

have to think that what kind of institutions we need what kind of infrastructure we need what kind of student we need is it the degree the undergrad degree master's degree PhD's

degree I got all the degrees I studied in India from IIT Indian school of business I studied in US UK Germany Sweden everywhere I have just to educate myself that how the things are different

what are the fundamental friends. So that is something which we have to realize and not do the reforms. This this is not the time for doing the reforms in the higher education system.

It's it's like reimagining. You see what we imagine India in terms of digital India. We are getting the dividend. We are a a country which is entirely on different level generating billions of

transactions on the digital UPI system which was unheard. So similarly we need a higher education system. We need an general education system which can give an exponential bump to India's story and

that's not going to be the normal system is going to be something very very different and that is going to be based on the foundation of the technologies we have been talking that is the first time

in the history of India though it has been tried several time in the past to link the north and south language barriers always existed but AI dismantles the barrier Here I was in my

village. We set up AI lab. We set up AI chopal and my message to the villagers you can speak in your bhpuri to to to us to Russia to Japan. So that is the first time a fundamental shift in connectivity

is happening around the world and India being a young nation a people of you know a country of young people almost 40 44 million student in the higher education ecosystem almost running

parallel to China. We have that power and potential to change and the moment we are able to use this technology I'm sure that we will realize the potential. So I say in terms of

potential I say I am number one economy India is number one economy not third or fourth. So that's the mindset because I have to reach to my potential and I will reach the potential only when I know my

potential what is exist. So there is a huge responsibility of the Indians of the present generation not only for themselves but the Indians of 2100 Indians of 2050 and if we are not able

to capitalize this AI boom will be left behind. If you see the geopolitics around the world we say it's a new war and all but it's the technology war it's the AI war. Countries are understanding

that those who will dominate AI they will dominate the world for the next century. So we have to lap it. We have no option as a nation and the education system which is one of the biggest in

the world will have a very catalytic role in realizing that dream of India of 2100. Thank you and over to you Raman G. Uh Panka as a head and dean you have changed the curriculum of University of

Delhi. You have also you know you know introduced lot of skill-based course during your time and make it you know uh outcome oriented but the AI challenge is new uh you know and now as

a chairperson of NCT you also seeing the lot of diversity among the institutions from the Java to Delhi and you know it's a multi-layer system and as uh you know chairperson of

NCT, how will you introduce kind of you know ensure institutions they can respond in the same manner to the challenge of AI because there are lot of diversity in

India and there is a lot of diversity you know about the having those kind of resources because AI also need lot of resources not in only in financial term but in the term of technology and kind

of having electricity and other thing. So how do you see and how will you ensure? &gt;&gt; Thank you. First I would like to congratulate CPRG

for bringing this much awaited and meaningful report on school education AI in school education. My compliments to Ramanand and his team for bringing it out and organizing this panel discussion

on reimagining education in the age of AI. See um AI is gradually, steadily and very calmly finding its creating its space in our daily life whether we like it or no

whether we are with it or not but it is finding its space it's in very subtle way it is uh becoming part of our working also whatever profession we are following

if we say that u epistemic shift in education then we must say that structural and epidemic shift um epistemic shift is not merely technological it is fundamental change

that how knowledge is pro produced assessed and evaluated in the day-to-day life of a student if we look at teacher education yes in CI uh during my headship we brought new programs we um

revised all the curriculums of BH, MAD, ITEP and during those changes our focus was to meet the expectations of young learners in 21st century. Young learner is into technology uh throughout. When I

was doing my college those days computers came to the world and we were very scared of computers. We were told that unemployment will increase because computer one computer will work in place

of four five people. So as a young student we protested against this technology but today reality is different. Computer is giving us multiple new avenues of employment in

our daily life. So u when you revise curriculum two things I would like to mention here. One uh curriculum revision exercise at University of Delhi took place in 2019 and this entire exercise

was technobased. We did it through dashboard system without human intervention without having formal meetings and budget of laks of rupees to meet to eat to TA to DA and everything.

So zero penny was spent when 72 programs were revised for LOCF curriculum framework. And then in CI when we took up this exercise again I followed the same model techno oriented technology

supported revision took place in a record period of two months we revised almost all the courses in education at University of Delhi. Now uh if we look at role of a teacher

what type of teacher we need for to meet future generation. uh in my family I have teachers who are dealing with class three students, class 7 students and senior secondary classes as well as

university teaching. They all are saying AI is posing a threat to cognitive development of the learner. Yes, it is posing a threat but at the same time we must realize that AI is not uh uh is not

going to replace teachers. teachers are always there and here I say they both complement each other no challenge no competition between two they complement uh because a teacher after the use of AI

based technology or video or some other context a teacher is the person who can uh create sensitivity in the class related to the topic as well as allow diverse opinions on the same topic so AI

can assist AI cannot be a faster. It is a assistant. If we use it for ethical reasoning, if we use it for creativity, collaboration, adaptability, I see teachers will increasingly function as

mentors and learning designers, not learning followers and ethical guides and facilitators of inquiry in a classroom situation as well as in writing textbooks and developing

curriculum. AI based output demand AI supervision. AI supervision I mean AI uh cannot be left free to design any curriculum. We need to supervise it. When I say uh uh uh we all know

difference between governance and leadership. Governance uh I call uh like governance means compliance manager. If whatever is coming to you, you are implementing it in a organization

whether it is a college, university or any other organization people and if you are a academic leader then you make a change in that compliance. Compliance will take place because governance is

essential but at the same time you bring change according to the needs of your institution, needs of your students, needs of your financial resources etc. Similarly in education we must not

become AI followers we should become AI leaders for the time. Yesterday honorable prime minister said we have tremendous potential to become AI leaders for the world.

In those lines as NCT chairman we have got two new programs NPST national professional standards for teachers and NMM national mentoring mission. Both are designed on on a digital platform on a

digital world and AI is helping us analyzing people's queries their questions their anxiety and helping them to identify right mentor for them and mentor mentee is always a guru shisha

context which is very meaningful and useful. I will close my this remark by saying now we are moving away from treating technology as one of workshop rather

than we should shift towards multi-semester AI spine. AI is spine of entire education system nowadays and our new program IT have multiple context of AI based technology. We must transition

from product only evaluation to process rich evidence of learning that is more meaningful. In 2012, CBSC brought continuous comprehensive evaluation. Now AI is helping us to go for process rich

evidence in learning. Risk landscape is there. Bias helonations are there but uneven access to technology is also a challenge that should be taken into consideration. My last closing remark is

AI plus education can take us towards Vixit Bhagat 2047. AI cannot be um is not a choice. It is a part of our life and uh providing us multiple new methods of research, new methods of industrial

internship but education which is providing uh culture, language and humanistic approach both need to work hand in hand for better future for Vix bag 2047. Thank you.

Uh Patil sir as a admission secretary school education technology co embedded and through technology you have been you know track not only but other platform

learning outcome focus. Now you are in higher education and higher education is a very diverse sector and the same time you know in contrast to school education higher

education controlling power school education is subject to sometime you know incontract list so that's why to you know to transform those higher

education institution in the age of AI not not only for the students but as well administrator as well or time planning how will you you know address those issues.

&gt;&gt; Thank you sir. Thank you so much for giving me the opportunity. I would like to ask few of the I think I'm seeing lot of students here. So can somebody tell me that how much time

telephone took to reach to 5 uh subscriber or users? Any guesses? 30 years a good guess. Anybody else? Quickly. &gt;&gt; 50 years. Okay, good. Some more.

&gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. Somebody's telling right 75 years. Yes. So, it took five cr people. It took 75 years. It took 38 years to reach this radio took 38 years to reach

to 5 cr people or charge GPD. Any guesses? &gt;&gt; Germany took 60 days to to reach to the PR people

whereas charge took 40 days to reach to 5 crore people. So this is the I think there is a quantum jump or whatever you say it is a huge jump and with this it is a big challenge for the educationist

and both school and uh higher education. I can just uh read some figures for benefit of you that in world we are having around say mobile users in the world there are 749 cr people whereas

India 120 crore people internet 600 cr people they're using it in India it is 100 cr in Google world 580 people 580 cr people are using Google whereas in India it is 80 cr and charg world it is 80 cr

this is last month's data out this month. So around 7 cr people they are using charg in India and 1 cr in Germany. So around maybe by this time 10 crore people will be using charg and

giny here. Now the challenges what are coming up I will come to that I'm not pessimistic at all but if you see in the education ecosystem as sur also has told and uh uh other speakers have just told

this is very important see how what is the uh this cohort around 25 cr childrens are in the school education and 4.6 6 cr childrens are students are in the higher

education. So around 30 crore we can say now 15 lakh schools are there in India and right now if you see the infrastructure around four cr uh sorry four lakh uh schools only having the

computers ICT labs and tablets and other things. So it is a huge challenge to take the AI revolution to last mile which is we are aware as also told I worked in school education now in higher

education. So we are having integrated approach and we are working on that but we need your help. Second one if you see in school education around 1 cr teachers are there right now and most of them are

women so which is really good change is happening there but how many are AI savvy or yeah literate we are working on that and sir NCD NCT chairman sir has already told on that panka has told on

that now coming uh to the different this the digital divide Delhi schools If you say and the remote area schools, the tribal areas or rural areas you can see madam is also from Bangalore. I last

week went there. There is huge development. So the cities the way they are catching up EI is huge. Humongous progress is there. But the rural area and other places it is a big challenge.

Now central schools like KVS, NVS they are doing really good in uh catching up with the AI using the AI technologies. Even CBS is coming with the AI curriculum. Whereas in the report also I

seen like Andra, Assam, Tamil Nadu and few other states they're using the AI curriculum and AI tools for implementation in the education system whereas other states are yet to catch

up. So there is little bit divide in this and it will take time for India to catch up but yes all of us are now agreed yes AI is not going anywhere. AI has to be used. AI is useful and the

same time AI is not enough. We should treat AI as a machine not as a human being which is very very important. AI if you started uh taking as a human being then it will be problem. There

will be huge uh mental stress on the students and other uh users also. So we are aware of this. That's why school education has taken very wise decision to introduce EI curriculum in third

grade. It is not to teach the AI, it is going to teach what is EI, what are the uh uses of AI and whether it is good or bad. So children should know about it which is very very important. So coming

generation, coming up generation, new generation, young generation must learn AI because it is very very useful. Yesterday as Pangazar has told that prime minister has told that AI India

has to become hub of AI and yesterday evening yesterday full day we had the meeting with Spain universities today again we are having the meeting with the Spain universities like that a lot of uh

uh meetings are going on are happening you may be knowing that IIT Madras has developed one tool where Dr. Dr. Kamakoti has spoken in Tamil and it has been translated in 11 languages of India

as Sur was also telling that when you speak in Bhjpuri it can get translated in others. So there is huge potential. I seen from Sika Lokam they shown me that in again in Bihar the

villages the women they're talking about dropouts why I got dropped out why my daughter is getting dropped out what are the issues they're talking in the local language and EI is actually summarizing

in English and various other languages. So they are talking and with it that there is no typing nothing else it is getting summarized classified and as a administrator we can take decisions. So

AI is a boon if we are using it very properly and AI will become a bane if it is misused or unethically used. As sir he was asking me about the challenges in EI. Yes, there are many challenges. What

we are doing right now is updating the curriculum. We're doing educational governance also is coming up. Uh many uh IITs they brought AI schools in their campuses. They're having uh this MOUS

with Google, Microsoft and various other places and Wadani Foundation has also started one AI school in one of the IITs. Lot of investment is going on. We are already started EI co in education

and IIT Madras is hosting that lot of work going in that ser is also helping us in those initiatives. But yes there is parity there is uh disparity we need to sort out those issues and it AI is

not only for the stem that we are understood and we are implementing that way everybody has to understand what is AI and how we can take it forward as sur has told about economy I think we both

has worked previously in ministry of education they say ministry of finance together I got his guidance there so the way he has told you can see it Now we are talking about reimagining the

education. So whatever you imagine what is your vision you're going to achieve that. So we should not limit our vision. I think 140 crore population and plus it is coming up. It is required to have

really big vision but same time necessary skills skills are required and one of the report suggests that if one year of schooling is happening the 24% there is output increase in the labor

output actually labor can the output will increase by 24%. And in India we are having this certain issues. If you see what labor force is giving the output in US, what is given in South

Africa and what is given in India, there is really we need to think about it. So year of schooling is very very important. We are having challenges of dropouts also. Luckily Vidya Samisha

Kendras and other tools were using to this uh uh trace the dropouts and bring them in the mainstreaming. You you can also see around 5 cr childrens are dropped out

and various state governments are working on that to bring it down. So European Union few countries may be having this population of five cr. So challenges in India are more but much

more but as madam was asking me what will be the impact of AI summit. I think it will be huge impact on us. Next two years we can see what the way India is going to change. As again I can say one

last example and come back. When I was working in banking department, people said key there is something called uh payment through the mobiles and when I was discussing with our CMDs of the

banks those days they are CMDs now it is MDS and they told sir now it is not going to work here and South Africa started there itself started it there and 2016 when demo has come we can see

the huge impact and now NPCI we can see the way it is happening around 50% of digital transactions are happening from India world's transactions there is huge change I

think another two years we can see there is huge change in AI adoptability and using it but one caution is that that AI has to be used as a tool it has to be used ethically and it has to be used for

the humanity that is what I can say thank you so much and we are getting prepared for that sir as IIITs are far better IM are far better whereas central universities are catching up with this

EI and we are trying to help with them sir. Thank you sir. &gt;&gt; Thank you sir. Whe it is a IIT, IM or other central central institution they will perform

you know at same scale and maybe other institution. We have uh also Aditi Nanda, director education and industry. uh uh India digital journey and I should say

lot of transformation last year language model launch Intel India educational journey associate as a you know part of the industry. How

do you see as a you know opportunity and challenge not for the only industry but for the education sector as well? &gt;&gt; Uh thank you Dr. Naman and thank you for having me here. Uh it's been very

interesting and it's been a pleasure for me to listen to all the other panelists here. Got to learn quite a lot and congratulations on the report. So very interesting and very pertinent uh point

that you raise that uh the industry also needs to work with different players not just with the government but also academia and create a change. So I have a very interesting job. I work with the

ecosystem and industry and in that I get to work with different startups get different ISVS and really see the innovation that's happening and some of these innovations are interesting to see

because they are cutting edge they are coming from India for India and then they go for the world like you just mentioned sir part was just talking about uh you know the digital payment

and I think you were mentioning empa from an airel perspective so how we have taken and you know the UPI and other things and we are taking this to the world. It's a very proud moment but it

starts with an idea and it starts with something that needs to be nurtured by everyone if we have and that's what the AI summit it's a great moment for all of us. Uh we've put ourselves on the world

map. We've shown the world that we can do great and here is where the technology innovations happening and from an Intel perspective uh we work not just very closely with higher ed but

also K12 and of late we've been working with some startups to come up with solutions which impact the students at large. So I was talking to somebody the other day and I think uh SA was talking

about you know BHJ Puri getting translated. So I was talking to somebody and said why are learning outcomes in the Indian tier 2, tier three and rural areas not as great. You know the

response came teaching mediumanguage and what we are doing today in terms of making sure that the content reaches everybody in the language that they

understand. I think that is going to be a game changer and that is coming from AI and AI is coming from a combination of people folks like all of us in the room coming together and saying okay

let's make something that will have an impact at population at large so those are things and you know I was talking to you just before this he said India people don't want to buy technology

people don't they're not afraid of technology but the The problem is and how many how many of us as parents will always say laptop. But why are we not seeing the value? Why

are we not seeing why are we not seeing that a creation device like a laptop or something that is more than a consumption device? Where is the value creation in that? Can we have AI courses

courses starting from class 3 onwards going up to higher ed? And we have in fact uh worked my colleague of mine has worked very closely with CBSC to create a curriculum which has gone into schools

right and we've worked Intel has worked together and uh helped put that together. We have a program called UNIT for higher ed and now we are bringing in these courses which are AI for future

workforce under that umbrella which has courses like AI and manufacturing and uh we have put this out in Gujarat Technical University and recently we had somebody come in from there. This girl

was the first time first generation to go to a college. She went through this program and in this program we also had internship. So she had interned with a startup or with a sorry with an industry

in Sured that was doing basically textile manufacturing and she created a project on defect detection using AI. So a kid from a rural area going to college for the first time as a first

generation going to college being so confident about what she had created because it was being used in an industry and she could see the impact. I mean those are the stories and those are

things that make you feel like you want to work in this. The rewards are huge. I think that is what is needed and Intel's doing obviously a great job of bringing these things together and uh all the

programs that we have whether it's unati whether it's future for workforce whether it's um you know the stuff that we do with the in the K12 space we've got an um ISB or startup that we work

with which is helping teachers become uh you know AI enabled so creating and there is and it's all running locally the the content doesn't even need to go into the cloud. We have solutions

running on AIPC which is what Intel is now bringing to the market. And I would invite you all to please come visit our booth at of course AI Summit because that's what has brought us all here and

we'll show you some of the really cool u use cases and demos where voicetooice gets translated on the device. So you don't even need to connect to the internet. You don't even need to connect

to the cloud. Everything is happening on the device. The content is there and I think I heard hallucination as one problem that is uh what you've also you know in the report uh identified. What

if the content sits locally on the device itself? So you're only looking at class 9 science. So when a child asks about a question, maybe they're just wanting to know how do I get into neat

and j the answer is coming from there and it's coming from a language uh coming in a language that the child understands. So what if that happens and that exists today? We've worked on it.

So think of it as a 247 tutor. You don't and one more thing you know I don't know how many of you will relate to this but at least I used to when the teacher is teaching

And if you are an introverted child, who do you go and ask? And how do you create that safe space of asking? You can have tuition teachers, you can have personalizer, but if there is a bot that

is not judging this child and is saying, "Hey, come here. I'll teach you in the language you understand." And you know as a parent that this is all happening on the PC. It is all

safeguarded. There are no or at least there is lesser chance of hallucination. That is what we are working towards. And um I'll finish with uh because there are all esteemed panelists. I think I should

finish with a quote. So you know Arthur C. Clark said um technology and I'm paraphrasing technology done right is like magic. And if we bring that magic of technology plus AI to all kids in

India, I think we've done our job. So that's what we are doing. Uh thank you Aditi. Uh I think we have few minutes more and we can have just you know quick round intervention.

Uh just on the issue when we are you know when we just try to reimagine institutions future of initution and

sir what thing you want to see in the future of higher education gi Field of higher education reimagining policy,

students of education. a crime by the word. We shall have to come back to this individualization of education. Uh just taking advantage of

my little longer journey in education. Uh say Mr. part said the schools penetration may I just like to remind him when first time the computers were sent to the

schools one headmaster complained to me sir government that was the stage from where we have come a long way and now we have reached a critical mass. The journey is not

going to stop. Journey is going to be accelerated. UN sorry European teacher students are good. He goes to the class the first day. He says uh how many ties

of size 10 cm by 10 cm I will need to fill a room of 1 m into 1 m. He felt it such a simple question everybody should answer it. Nobody raised the hand. He was

frustrated. Where have I come to teach? If this is the level and I was told it's a good class. Very frustrated. Finally a girl raised hand said okay at least somebody she said yes come on we'll work

it together says sir everything is fine but firstly tell us what is a tie see in that African area the tiles were never used they were used for round uh rooms with round floors and square tiles

or rectangular tiles were not in the dictionary and on that basis we declare all that class failed in mathematics that is what we are doing today with the help of a simple test. So we have to

find out what is the ground level situation and then go ahead on that to test the ingenuity of that. Uh lastly the we have not to teach the subjects we have to teach the students and therefore

for each student what can we do again I say AI is an opportunity great opportunity we are talking about reimaginating reimagining higher education in this summit and my request

with all the persuasion is uh let the youth assert themselves that we need these subjects to be taught for our degree and techn technology enables us to do that. We will have to do that.

That's my call on this. Thank you sir. A sur in the same manner when you reimagine institutions and you are heading a you know you're the part of a global body

what kind of future and what kind of you know you know I will say two or three things you want to see in the f you know futuristic educational institution right thank you very much u quickly three

points I would like to say first that if you look back 10 years back when social media was in India there was a talk that whether we want to be a download nation or we want to an upload nation. So there

was a lot of emphasis on creating contents and uploading on the internet and the media so that creativity flourish. Now the conversation has moved whether we want to be again a

consumption nation or we want to be producing nation. We want to be creative nations. Now this time the opportunity is phenomenal. So we need to have a system where people create not consume.

That's that's the fundamental shift we need. Now the second thing um I will say that university degrees, masters, PhDs, undergrad for the job we have the qualification for the job in some of the

countries only high school is good enough for getting the jobs in the government in the private sector high school diploma. Do we want only the students to be studying getting marks

getting distinction and do or do we want the students to be the problems solving young society? So I think we have to shift from a degree awarding institutions to a problem-solving

institution. India has millions and trillions of problems in each and every corner. You pick up one problem, solve it. You get your degree and go. you don't need to pass all the examination.

So that's the fundamental shift India needs if we want to go back what I said in the beginning that we want to be a nation where a skill capability drives the economy not the other way around. So

that's the second. The third one you see the uh 12th education system, the higher education system, the primary education systems works in a silos. We have to find and technology allow it to do it to

interconnect the entire systems and in the US the higher education and the high school systems are very well connected in a part of ecosystem. The moment we do that, we will have a thriving higher

education, thriving education system and pushing India into a a very high growth trajectory and also to realize the dream which I talk about a number one nations not by 2050 2070 but very soon. Thank

you. &gt;&gt; Thank you sir. uh Panka sir uh as a chairperson of NCT teacher education initution reimagine yes uh as a regulator for teacher

now Vikit Bhagat Adishan is coming uh where it has been proposed to uh go with AI oriented regulator that regulator is not supposed to have lot of human working for it but 70 to 80% assessment

will be done through AI so AI is going to play an important role not only as a regulator but also as a norms and standard developer for the nation for academic programs also and for teachers

also I think the responsibility ility to promote research ethics among young people is very very critical at the moment. Somebody is writing a letter to his wife and asking AI to give me a

letter. So this is ridiculous. Uh it cannot give you a emotion into that personalized flavor to that. So research ethics when you are doing any research for any class level then um we need to

uh think of uh assessment devices u evaluation and assessment which is lacking behind. We are developing content through AI but we are not doing assessment through AI. This year CBSC is

trying to assess class 12 answer script through technology but those would be only scanned documents will check by teachers from their own remote place but that is a beginning of bringing

technology into assessment and my last point would be um Indian knowledge Indian languages uh we must start working very very hard on this because if we actually want to pass on Indian

tradition to the next generation AI can become an important tool for that. Aspired India and artificial intelligence

combination optimum use. &gt;&gt; Thank you sir. Uh Patil sir from the ministry perspective how you visualize future university and what kind of change you want to bring higher

education in institution which you want to build for the future. Again same thing that as sir also has told that it is should be integrated school and higher educations I would

like to say that few universities has agreed now to uh reach out to 100 schools in Pune there is one university called COP so they're telling every day one school will come visit see their

libraries see their laboratories meet their teachers the teachers will go to the schools they'll interact because many of them are not knowing what is the present school and what I was in the

school and today's school there Huge change really huge changes there. So that has to be seen and it should be integrated. One more point that NEP says there is innate talent among the

students. So students should understand that and work on it horn your skills and meaningfully contribute to the economy which is very very important. So once 140 cr population of India started

contributing to the economy means above the income tax level. I'm telling that pre- income tax level. So minimum five lakhs or six lakhs it is going to be huge change uh here. Third point is

brick motor schools are going, universities are going that is already we are seeing there's huge change but same time teachers cannot be removed actually the teachers mentors

facilitators has to be there and even we requested even Intel we had last time meeting also with the the companies to be mentor actually you should also tell kids enough is enough one hour up you're

playing with the games or you're using uh these things so stop it there which is really required. So ethical use is very very important. Yes, we need to create a platform where all of the

people can come and that is what AI COE in education happening with the uh Madras uh IIT where schools and uh higher educations are coming together institutions are coming together private

players also coming together. I recently seen one uh uh startup in Iay Delhi where they don't like this yo I think this uh uh the hotel rooms and all that now so he not owned any hotel rooms at

all considered hotels like that this startup don't have any classrooms they don't have any infrastructure at all but they teach in medical education actually with the uh this permission from the

regulator paramedician basically are working Youngsters are here. A lot of youngsters there friends their annual turnover is 200 cr in just last two years and they

are telling another one year we will reach 400 cr. So I think there is huge opportunity for all of us. We should work on it. Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; Thank you sir. Ui your comment on future

of institution. &gt;&gt; Sure sir. I think uh everybody's done a great job of uh articulating that. I think that is what I'll say.

&gt;&gt; Thank you everyone for joining us and thank you for our you know eminent panel to you know put light on you know reimagining the institutions.

future. And thank you everyone. Hello.
