## 📝 Summary

This panel presents a practical, cross-sector blueprint for scaling artificial intelligence by aligning technical capabilities, capital allocation, legal frameworks and infrastructure. Panelists will examine how robust data engineering and production-grade model pipelines translate into investable business models, how investors filter technical promise from sustainable economics, and how legal and policy regimes for data and intellectual property shape commercialisation pathways. The discussion brings together operator, investor, legal and infrastructure perspectives to surface concrete steps that synchronise funding rounds, regulatory compliance and platform upgrades for durable AI scale-up.
