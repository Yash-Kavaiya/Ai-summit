## 📝 Transcript

exist by choice. Very small fraction would probably take it by choice. Still people want to do uh jobs in manufacturing or R&amp;D in the pharma companies. So that's a big factor

which we have to solve which ultimately falls into the remunerations which people get the the future potential of your profession and all that. The community pharmacy in reality has not

picked up in this country because of the u the social structure which we have otherwise the capacity building for anything to do with health care these pharmacists community pharmacists have

to play a very strong role with all I mean if you see doctors nurses um other health technicians you will find them concentrated in hospitals But in the society if you see the spread

the most uh basically the the biggest possibility is uh for any profession in healthcare it is for pharmacist through the whole retail chain distribution supply chain

management and they are the people who can actually contribute up to the last mile of the um value chain. So this this needs a strong change management. The the change is happening but I think it

would take some more time because it's a professional and mindset change and uh thinking change uh for pharmacists. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. I think very important point that it's more about

mindset change than just technology. Uh Dr. Servajit Kore, we are very fortunate to have you with us as the secretary of the Indian nursing council. You represent 2.2 2 million nurses and more

probably if we account for every registration is 3 million so which is like 10% of the world's nurses how are nurses coping up with the changes in technology with regards to

healthcare and what are you doing at INC &gt;&gt; thank you Dr. Dr. Gupta for this question and for this opportunity to be here in this esteemed panel. Um so uh to answer your question from the regulatory

point of view we have tried to integrate the AI and the digital health into the basic nursing curriculum. We had a change of the BSE nursing curriculum in 2021 and we have started by putting the

emphasis on building competencies through the digital health and AI. So five simulation labs have now become mandatory. We have given uh lab equipments, the list of manquins, VR

etc. that can be used to build up competencies because we are also seeing that the um clinical facilities that are out there for the nursing students to build up those competencies is becoming

limited. we are having almost 2.5 lakh nursing students getting passed out uh for GNM and BSC like both getting registered as registered nurses, registered midwife. So uh we have

started from scratch if I can say so. We have started with computer education. We have made uh given guidelines like for every five uh students there should be one computer. We have given computer

labs right out there and we have also worked towards faculty preparedness. So there is you know complete um uh adoption like you know the panelist brought out there has to be a change of

mindset. So even if you have these expensive equipments out there how do you use them and not just keep them in the cupboards you know safe as an inventory articles. So we have started

with uh two national reference simulation centers one in Gorga and the other one just recently opened last two months back in uh uh in the south balot and we started with faculty preparedness

for the Gorga NRSC we have trained around 2,000 faculty on how to use these um you know simulators uh for each and every nursing student. So what as a regulatory body we are

looking is uh for each and every nursing student to embrace the digital technology as she is working to be a nurse to build up her competencies and even for inservice we are linking it up

as you're aware with with a lot of uh you know push from your side we have had this professional digital nursing course so 6 months which lot of takers are there in nursing who are wanting to do

this but I think we need much more courses like that. We are linking it to CNE hours. We have also brought out uh our uh online uh registration system for the nurses which again we are trying to

link it with all these uh kinds of opportunities for them. So more nurses benefit out of it. And um in in the uh abroad if you see we are having you know these uh chief uh technical nurses also

now were you know trying to resolve issues like staffing uh prevention falls policies to improve nursing. So I think we here also in India need to do a lot in terms of uh policies to empower every

who is working in the rural or every community health officer who's working in the arrogant or every nurse who is wanting to do better for her patients in the super specialized hospitals. Uh

there's a lot more to be done. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. It's very exciting to see how you have moved to bring digital courses to nurses and the offtake for

that. And I also keep hearing very positive feedback on this opportunity for nurses. Thank you so much. Now I move to Dr. Suresh Shadav who I've known as someone who not just ideates the

future but creates the future. So working with the president of India whether he went to World Bank whether he's in Commonwealth even in Commonwealth few years back you put the

agenda of AI as a high priority. What is your work and role today at Commonwealth? So vision for the 56 member nations and more so for the small island states.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. Um thank you professor Gupta and thank you for your leadership in this very important um stage. Um he has been working in this digital health digital health parliament and global

leadership when the world was not thinking. So it's a great great contribution by you to uh the system because digital has taken a front seat only during the covid and the postcoid

before that it was just like a digital ego governance systems around the world. Now before I say anything I'll be very you know general in comment on the global level and then touching a little

bit on on the ground level. what it did cost the global ecosystem. Anise described when there was a um financial crisis what global south that point of time called a crisis triggered by the

global north. I mean naming that particular country. So they and he described how beautifully President Obama uh steered the United States out of that very complicated and complex

situation. Now if you look at the shortages of the health care professionals to the global economy what it cost shortage is one part it's it's number maybe somewhere 100,000 people

short somewhere more number what is the global implications so the economic cost of this shortages of the healthare workers which is around in all the categories around 10 to 12 million

almost cost 15% of the global GDP P and you can imagine that 15% of the global GDP of $120 trillion economy. So it's a huge huge cost just because we don't have people it has a multiplier effect

and it's leading to the cascading effect on the various other segments of the society. The other thing which is happening is that the the global temperature rise. If you look at the

climate and health, there is a latest Lancet report which brings very beautifully how the climate uh is driving health and leading to a different kind of a challenging

situation. But also on this other side I wanted to say that how health system is also contributing the climate because one of the largest emitter on the planet. Now given this situation we know

that so much is the shortages of the health care professionals and the nurses shortage is so much that Anisha will know better than I know that US has a special visa for the nurses. You may

have a computer science degree but may not get a visa. But if you have a nurse experience certificate you get a visa. So that is the level of you know the challenges which which the world is

facing. Now we know that this is a challenge. What do we do? How do we do how do we move forward? The other before I go to that the other challenge is the aging population. If you look at the

Japan, if you look at the Nordic countries, the aging population number is rising. There are not many people to take care of that. Even if I have to get a healthare worker in my village in

eastern Uttar Pradesh, it's so difficult. Even if you want to pay the money, there are no people to to to serve you. So what do you do? One is of course the obvious solution that you

train more number of people because there are a lot of people who are looking for the job. It's not that people are not there. So how do you ramp up that capacity? I know in India for

creating a nursing school you need to have an hospitals and there are so many um challenges in spite of um setting up lot of hospitals in the in the country. So one lowhanging fruit is the digital

solutions and on the top of that digital solution now is AI solution. Can I make one um doctor serve 10 people? Can I make one health care work serve more than five times 10 times more using the

the technologies management of the system using the health ERP like multinational enterprises are doing the whole system is fragmented in the healthare system. It should be entire

ecosystem. The one good thing about the US is that the doctor the pharmacy everybody is connected. So that at least fragmentation is not there in the in the US system but that fragmentation is

still exist in the UK system but in India that silo is is very much there. So even if using this health ERP on the lines of corporate ERP we are able to fix it I think that will be a entire uh

transformative approach of creating a very ecosystem approach where the health workers the doctors the nurses those who wants to volunteer and contribute they will be all connected. So that is one uh

quick fix solution I see. The other I see that in the global market and this was my pet project that and particularly came out from the postcoid that there are doctors and who wants to do more but

they have a challenges. So how do you connect a global or doctors without borders? How can an Indian doctor serve a patient in Kenya rather than Kenyan or Tjanian patient traveling to India? or

if they have to travel they should travel only small portion rather than a big big time of two month three months. So these technologies offers you that you can have your scans remotely you can

upload send to the doctor have all the diagnostic except the procedure which you are required to be there. So it's it's not only a country health ecosystem but also a global health ecosystem which

can which can be made available using the technologies and and then and I see that using that approach any best hospital or doctor the United States can be accessible to a patient in India or

or a vice versa because a lot of Indian wants to consult a doctor um in India. My wife who is in the US for 10 years is still believed in the Indian doctor and wants to have a medicine from India and

this one. So 2 million 20 million persons of Indian origin around the world. So India can connect 1.5 million people within the country and 20 million people who still believe that I should

have the Indian medicine I should have the Indian doctor. So this is a huge huge opportunities for India to take the leadership because you have the manpower, you have lot of young people

enter the job market looking for the job and you have the digital technology power. The only question is to putting these two together and make um the nursing institutes, the hospital

administration, the startups be all the part of the thriving ecosystem. I think if we can do it we will have we will really rather recreating or reimagining a health care system not only for India

but for the entire world and this 15% GDP this global temperature right the climate health nexus which I can talk about digital will be a great enabler professor Gupta in solving those

challenges and I'm a very very optimistic and futuristic person and I'm sure that if not in next 10 years by 2050 we will have a system somewhere that will be universal health access

cutting across the boundaries not that within your boundaries but you can have access to rest of the words of the medicine of the supplies of the doctors of the procedures so I'll stop here on

this positive note and over to you &gt;&gt; thank you thank you Sur this is very interesting and you know I I always like optimism over technology even if you're not optimism technology will move fast

uh coming to you all you are an entrepreneur in technology While Dr. Rajie approved DTX, you make DTX. You have made amazing AIdriven technologies. What's your take on capacity building?

Do we have enough capacity to have more entrepreneurs like you? We will have ideiers like you but not entrepreneurs because we don't have executors. How do you do define this?

&gt;&gt; Uh thank you Rajen G. Uh while of course I will be speaking on the uh uh on that part of technology as well, how we can create entrepreneurs. uh but I think uh more to the point that

uh my fellow uh panelists talked about uh I think technology when it comes to capacity building technology companies have a significant role because uh they influence how the current uh workforce

is practicing and also they influence how the next generation of workforce will get trained. So that way we have a dual responsibility and uh in that sense I think there's a design principle that

uh every technology company should keep in mind or any budding entrepreneur should keep in mind and that is that uh the way they design their AI or tech solutions it should be in a manner that

is scalable not in terms of volume but scalable in terms of complexity because uh if you're building something uh and if you're providing uh the healthcare industry with

something then you have to particularly in a uh country like India where you have a diverse spectrum of uh digital maturity across uh various institutes. Some hospitals might be digital native,

some of them uh might be completely analog. So in that sense you have to have a product that uh uh handholds uh the healthcare workers through the digital transformation journey. So it

the pro product is able to scale in complexity as the institutes scale in readiness that that's uh how we have been building products. as an example, our EISU solution. Its functionality

ranges from basic remote vital monitoring to more complex smart alerts and advanced clinical decision support systems based on the readiness of the clinicians. And that's something that uh

every uh techreneur should keep in mind. we shouldn't uh impose AI or technology rather the technology should adapt to the capacity or rather it should be able to handhold

the capacity and pull it up uh one more point that I wanted to add was that uh just like technologists have been uh creating or co-creating the next generation of workforce when it comes to

programmers and uh uh innovators. Similarly, I feel health tech companies have a responsibility in co-creating the next generation of uh healthcare workers. So with theademies like academy

of digital health sciences, I think technology companies or specifically health tech companies should come forward and co-design some hands-on uh courses as well like uh the one ma'am

mentioned uh the professional nurses course. So, so that we're able to expose the students early on to these uh developments and the flux that's going on. Uh otherwise uh if you're training

them in analog systems and they graduate into a technology first world, then there's going to be a structural mismatch always uh between what they have been trained for and the reality

that they're facing. So I'll have few two questions to the you know experts before we move to audience questions. Uh this is to uh first Dr. Sarjit to you because you're a

regulator. You made an important point that you want to change I mean you have already done that by incorporating digital health as a part of the education. You know when I was writing

the education policy my biggest worry was technology moves with the pace that you can't change your curriculum every now and then because by the time you go to the academic council governing board

new technology has come. So is there a way you're looking at to make I think you talked about CME but is that the way we should look at looking at training all professions you know adding CMEs

rather than changing curriculum every now and then because that's going to be really tough. um curriculum changes normally occurs uh say once in a decade and that also is a

long process when we brought out the BSE nursing um change we took almost 3 years to bring about a change with all the you know there's a whole process to it including the public commence and

bringing about changes um so yes at that point of time whatever is the best for the nursing students we have tried to do that but at the same time we also need to understand that there is this like 40

uh lakhs like you know 4 million nurses already out there in the country in different states whose competencies also need to be built because they are the ones who are working be it in the rural

or be it in the specialized hospitals and for this as a regulator we push upon having simulation centers that's what we are saying one should be in every district so that um you know there are

some states who have already started taking this like uh you know we had Namea in Uttar Pradesh and we had UNAN in Bihar where they building up these competency centers integrating the

digital technology with it certifying it so that and linking it to the CNE so the nurse carries it forward with her there are incentives there for the nurses to come up for these programs and uh to

better integrate this into the health systems a lot needs to be done in this and uh as you're also aware with the digital health academy we are now working towards having a one year or

maybe a two-year program we are still uh working that out so when this also comes comes there's a specialization more takers will be there I think it'll again disseminate uh down it's a mammoth task

no doubt &gt;&gt; Dr. Dr. Dr. I wanted to ask you on that uh point only that you have drug inspectors across the country who were in the conventional you know world what

are you doing for them to understand and of course for pharmacist too about your point &gt;&gt; so um yeah so before moving to that I just had one comment on this one uh the

curriculum change right so this actually points again and again in pharma education also and colleges and teachers say that we are not allowed to change It is governed by PCI but always I say one

point see PCI or any body which actually sets the courses they give you the minimum which which should happen they don't say that don't go beyond this so you have all open at the top whatever

you want to do you keep this minimum plus you go on adding if you want to. So if if pharma is not having a course on innovation or management or any modern technology computer programming PCI

doesn't say that you can't do it. PCI says that you keep pharma papers over and above this if I want to keep innovation paper I I'm I'm free to do that.

&gt;&gt; I'm sure message will go viral but the problem is how many people read it in that manner. you know uh when we started courses we put a line the contents of this course will change based on the

developments in the field and we had really tough time telling that it can be in the prospectus I said we have to do that the field is changing and that brings me to anish because always the

problem comes what do you do to governments you know when you're talking of technology we can have regulators change it we can have you know councils change it how do politicians get changed

do we have a crash course for them &gt;&gt; well so here is the there's That's an the spicy question, but let me let me let me handle it. Uh, well, this is in the US. It was funny when you saw the

senators asking Mark Zuckerberg questions that were not very smart. So, there was obviously a push to get education about what the technology means. But let me let me shift that

question in a different way. A lot of this assumes that the job to be done is the same, but you've introduced new tools so that you train people on how to do the same job, but with the new

tools. The politician or the policy maker is often focused on the outcome or the objective, the problem to be solved. And it may be that we've spent 10 years

doing it this way and we've funded it, organized it, and you should be educated on how technology will influence it. But at some point there'll be a flip. Hey, I've got an entirely new way of solving

that outcome and uh why don't we reorganize this whole thing that takes advantage of new capacity that wasn't possible but for the technology. Earlier in this

conference we heard from uh Sunil Wadwani from the Wadwani Foundation. He talked about tuberculosis deaths, half a million deaths and he said uh a portion of those deaths come from individuals

who uh obviously get later uh you know they've been detected later and then others uh they they dropped off their medications too early. So you've got these sort of error rates on both sides

and so you have a nurse or someone in the community asha worker someone helping engaging and so you could think about politicians saying okay do I have to fund a new program to do this

technology or it turns out they've come up with an entirely new AI based detection system and they found 25% more tuberculosis cases not because they've educated but they've introduced a whole

new concept that you can change the diagnosis model through voice. You cough into a phone and it tells you I'm I'm paraphrasing what I heard earlier today. So this is the moment where the more we

have flexibility in the political dilemma uh dialogue and some say this zerobased budgeting that's changed the way we fund our government. There are lots of policy

debates but if you start with the principle that there's a problem to be solved. We have too many people dying from tuberculosis too early. Now, let me say, look, we've got programming and

funding and staff and people that do things to do this. But now, a new technology shows up that allows me to think of this in an entirely new way and only possible to implement the

strategies that come from this because it exists. That is a whole level of training. That's not training. Oh, here's how the buttons work. that is connecting the dots on what the capacity

is to uh fundamentally reimagine the way to go about this and so not to go back to capacity building but I have coined this term innovation pipeline management in government uh DARPA very famously

it's our our research arm in the US government sets ambitious but achievable targets and then lets professors entrepreneurs innovators sort of come up with ideas and so you want to have a

stage gate to test ideas. You want to test more ideas. Then some of them graduate to the next stage and then you want to sort of validate those successes and then you want policy makers to scale

the ideas that work. And so I think your question was meant it was sort of funny that politicians need to be trained but there's also some seriousness which is it could also be the vehicle by which we

fundamentally re-imagine the way to go about it and then that brings a whole new cycle. So that's the positive side of where I think this could go. Thank you so much and let's get to the public

questions. So any audience questions? Yeah, you first. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Hi everyone, thank you for your inputs. Uh as someone who has been as an entrepreneur also coming from a casual

background researching brain and AI um and has spent a lot of time in US last years in US and India. &gt;&gt; Be specific to the question because we have less time. Yeah.

&gt;&gt; Context to what we're discing the need for the digital health courses. So if if somebody's come up with a solution for mental health for the professionals themselves like the nurses and the

doctors what will be the good platform because right now it's like you educate them for the need of it and then the skills and the outcome get measured what will be a better way to scale this

because the need is there we see it we work with kids also doing that and we see the same need for professionals as well right and it's contextualized to the Indian context as well what will be

the good platform to sort of take this to scale when such needs exist with all professional as well. I do have a separate question on the pricing with India. So as two ventures that I've been

part of that have scaled pretty well in the US, one of them has become 100 million revenue. The other has taken public route in the US but they failed miserably on the pricing here. So

spending two years up front here uh we couldn't get the same product to work at the pricing here. So what are your suggestions for how to make pricing work for India when you have the intent to

solve for India as well? So those pricing part I'll start now because if you go back and look to GDHS session on pricing of digital health you will get a detailed answer from those who build it

globally. So that will help you solve that problem. On the other one does someone want to take and answer it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So my gu guidance on how to take it

forward when you have a working solution that's already working with B2C format but you know take it up for a larger scale up. &gt;&gt; So um answering your question from the

regulatory point. So uh we have for the nurses we have linked 150 C hours and we have linked it to the uh renewal of their registration every 5 years. So now nurses have to mandatorily do these

courses then only their license will get uh renewed. So there's a lot of need to have these kinds of courses. There are some platforms where these courses are put free of cost. INC being one of them.

There's I got there. So I'm sure there are a lot of opportunities uh for you to you know take up anything that works for the nurses. The technical experts have to you know take a look at it to see if

it's okay and then we can take it forward. &gt;&gt; It's developed by doctors for doctors but it can certainly get up. I'd love to take inputs from you where to take it

&gt;&gt; We can after this Dr. Fari. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much. uh uh my very simple question is that I am born before technology and suddenly bombarded with the last four five years and the times

are like this the fate is this that I'm from best colleges being faculty and now joined era medical colleges dean faculty of medicine and suddenly this institution is in a whole into AI now

people like me who worked with MCI and uh the curriculum uh has already been changed but believe me that nothing has changed because I actually had evolution also. My question is that uh how are you

emphasizing in future that are people who are supposed to implement AI people who are who supposed to train these people in Gen Z now who themselves have not been trained so there's a dilemma

between them do you have any solution for that so that at least the people who have been trained now are being trained by people who are inverted commas not trained that's my my worry so I will ask

era only to answer it in one minute Sure. &gt;&gt; Yes. So, uh I I think uh there are still uh people far and few in between who can uh be those ambassadors for change. Uh

it's just a matter of uh giving them the tools being able to you know uh get them on the platform of uh era university or digital health sciences uh academy so that uh they're able to in

&gt;&gt; train or build capacity at scale. Uh that's the only way otherwise uh we don't have uh enough people to do it one-on-one or you know uh in a physical capacity. We have to use virtual tools

even for that. And uh at the same time I think it there shouldn't be a bar at uh of a you know a certain experience or a number of years of teaching for these kind of courses. So this has to be uh

age agnostic I feel. Rajiv 30 seconds for you and then we have to close this. &gt;&gt; No no we we have to close because we are running out of time. We have to launch also one thing. So

&gt;&gt; so I think answer lies in the system itself. If I just give one example remote surgeries the doctors who were trained 30 years ago they were not trained on remote

surgeries. Today they are doing remote surgeries. How did the shift? So I mean this is something I don't think that these trainings and capacity building should be restricted to the the from

within the profession. Whosoever is suitable for those trainings they should be engaged. It's a continuous process in regulatory system. Our inspectors and drug controllers they actually are

trained into the modern uh in basically approving and reviewing these u medical devices also. it was not there when they were appointed. So everybody is getting upgradition and there are systems to do

&gt;&gt; Yeah. And in our courses we have seen 80% of the people are you know above 20 years. Highest is 50 years after MBBS. So I think age is not a thing. It's a mindset thing.

&gt;&gt; Raj I'd also like to add about the consortium of innovative healthareities. &gt;&gt; We have to launch this and close this session. We have a very strict timing here and I see that clock ticking up. So

&gt;&gt; I I understand. So, we're launching the global global AI academy which you will see is about training people. You have platforms. It's not about that

&gt;&gt; together. Yes. &gt;&gt; Ready? Push the button. &gt;&gt; Here we go. Something's happening. There it is. The screen. &gt;&gt; Oh, that is coming.

&gt;&gt; It's coming and going. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it is. &gt;&gt; So, it's never about the platform. It's about the mindset. And start now if you have noted. Thank you. Thank you very

much. A big round of applause. Thank
