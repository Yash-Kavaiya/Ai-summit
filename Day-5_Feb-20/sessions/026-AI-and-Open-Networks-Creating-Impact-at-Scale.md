## 📝 Summary

AI can deliver population-scale impact across healthcare, education, agriculture, and energy only when coordination is built into the system through Open Networks and Digital Public Infrastructure. In India, AI agents leveraging open networks already help citizens access vital services via simple mobile interfaces—demonstrating how this model bridges structural gaps in service delivery. This session examines how this interoperable infrastructure translates AI intent into action, enabling safe, privacy-preserving impact that can scale across borders.
