## 📝 Transcript

because we believe that uh AI's true potential lies in its ability to deliver population scale impact transforming education, healthcare and agriculture for every citizen. However, that impact

uh can only be possible when there's coordination that's built into the system. And therefore today uh we are here joined by global leaders to explore how open networks and digital public

infrastructure can create a global interoperable coordination rail powered by AI to translate intent into action across borders. To set the stage uh it's my honor to introduce uh James Manika.

James is the senior vice president at Google leading research labs and technology in society. He also served as the co-chair of the UN's high level advisory board on AI. James uh welcome.

The floor is yours uh to set the stage. Thank you. Uh good morning everyone. It's uh it's a real pleasure and privilege to be back in India and to join all of you here at

the India AI impact summit. At Google, we believe that access to AI is essential for unlocking opportunities and expanding the innovation capacity for people everywhere. The rapid

technological progress that we're seeing in AI's development is really quite breathtaking and represents an extraordinary opportunity to solve problems and and empower people, power

economies, advance science, and tackle some of society's greatest challenges. Indeed, we're beginning to see the impact of this. So, it's not just in the future, but we're already starting to

see some of these benefits and impact materialize today. Take science for example. Five years ago, our alpha fold system, which is our Nobel Prize winning innovation, solved the 50-year grand

challenge of protein structure prediction. And since then, the freely available alpha fold protein database has been used by more than three million researchers in over 190 countries. And

in fact, India is actually the fourth largest adopter and user of the protein uh database where people are working on a variety of problems. Everything from neglected diseases uh all the way to

even breeding resistant uh soya beans and a whole range of things that are incredibly beneficial uh to to to people in India and beyond. But to take full advantage of this potential, we need to

collectively expand access right from the beginning. As you may have heard our CEO Sundapichai say yesterday, we need to ensure that the digital divide does not become an AI divide.

Digital public infrastructure and open networks are an important part of making this possible. They provide the coordination layer that allows AI to translate human intent into real world

action. And India has been leading the way with systems like UPI and Bashini uh network and infrastructure bringing the capabilities of AI into the daily lives of people across the country and at

population scale. At Google, we've been a very committed partner in this journey by helping to build the foundations that help to scale it. For instance, our collaboration with

the Indian Institute of Science and in particular on project Vani has now completed its second phase uh where we've been covering every Indian state making speech data for over 100 indic

languages available for free through the government of India's Bashini mission. In fact, this includes 20 languages that had never been recorded before digitally that we're now building onto these

systems in ways that truly try attempt to reflect India's true linguistic and cultural richness and diversity. And we continue to build on our commitment to drive scaled impact at the grassroots

level. This commitment to scaled impact is reflected in our recent partnership with the World Bank and I'm sure we'll talk about this later today. Together, we're taking a blueprint born right here

in India and scaling it by localizing it across the globe to countries from Brazil to Nigeria, Ethiopia, and Kenya. And the heart of this blueprint began with our partnership with the government

of Utar Pradesh. There we piloted a Gemini powered open network for agriculture that provides farmers with multilingual AI agents to facilitate everything from credit credit to crop

prediction. By taking the lessons we learned in Uttar Pradesh where digital to drove real measurable impact we're pro we're pro we're proving that a small hold of farmer can compete and com and

and execute on the value that they create rather than the platforms that they're on. This isn't just a regional success. It's now a global architecture and a model that can be taken everywhere

for global digital inclusion. The success of these networks depend on a single fundamental principle. It must remain decentralized and open. This is the driving force behind our

support for the networks for humanity foundation. Again, one of the things we'll talk about this morning. And through a $10 million Google.org uh grant that we announced last year, the

network for humanity foundation is building the universal tools for tomorrow uh from internet for asset tokenization to the Beckin open networks and by establishing innovation labs from

Singapore to Switzerland they're ensuring that the infrastructure of opportunity is a global standard and not just a local exception. Having this type of infrastructure in

place is what will allow all of us to collectively achieve population scale change. That's why we're supporting change makers like Wani AI through Google.org or grants that try to embed

intelligence directly into the digital rails uh for millions of Indians uh to be able to use in healthcare for example this means empowering something like 1.4 4 million frontline workers with

multilingual AI assistance providing early warnings for to combat child malnutrition across the country. In agriculture, it means integrating AI into the national pest surveillance

system to protect India's most important crops at a national scale. And in education, it means delivering high quality learning experiences through AIEL transformation of

governmentown-owned education and development platforms. And this is an initiative that's already reached 10 million students and educators with a goal of empowering as many as 75 million

students and nearly two million educators by the end of 2027. Ultimately, to fully capture AI's beneficial potential, we must be bold and responsible and be committed to

building all of this together. We must pursue AI's most ambitious possibilities while ensuring that we build the coordination layer necessary to bridge and close the AI divide.

With that, it is now my great uh and pleasure and honor to welcome an extraordinary group of incredible leaders and innovators to the stage who've been doing this for an

extraordinarily long time with incredible impact. First, I'd like to invite Nandan Nilikani. Nandon is THE Nandan is the co-founder and chairman of emphasis is a global leader in digital

public infrastructure and the co-founder of networks for humanity an initiative building open interoperable digital infrastructure for the intelligence age. I should say I've known Nandod for a

very long time. When he first told me what he was working on 15 years ago, I'm not quite sure I quite believed it. But here we are. Next uh joining us is Sbu Kim. Sangu is

a World Bank World Bank's vice president. Siz wall bank's vice president for digital and AI leading efforts to drive digital economy growth in developing

countries by strengthening infrastructure cyber security data privacy while modernizing government services and also touching many areas like health education and more. Our

third guest is is Kiran Mamuma Shaw as chairperson of Bioon Group. Kiran is a pioneering biotech Kiran is a pioneering biotech entrepreneur, healthc care visionary and

a passionate philanthropist committed to expanding access to health care through affordable innovation. And finally, please welcome Sunil Wadwani. Sil is a visionary entrepreneur and

philanthropist who co-founded the Wadvani Institute for Artificial Intelligence to drive systematic and systemic social transformation through AI solutions and innovation in the

public systems across healthcare, education and agriculture. So we're now going to have a conversation. I can't wait to Uh

Nand let me start uh with with with you. you've been championing digital uh decentralized ecosystems for a very long time uh building open networks uh taking things to extraordinary scale in India

and recently with Beckin and Finantech and obviously you bring a lot of credibility to both users of these systems and and to regulatory bodies. How do you how do you see AI as a

multiplier or a factor as you think about open networks and the kind of transformational change you've been pursuing? Uh no I think uh AI is uh very fundamental and I'll explain how open

networks and AI come together. I think you know what some of us have been thinking about is if AI is a general purpose technology what is the fastest way of diffusing the use of AI in a

productive way for people and you know ultimately all this is only makes sense if people's lives improve and uh I think uh we have a lot of experience with open networks uh I mean in some sense UPR was

a open network for payments and the open architecture led to the massive growth and became the world's largest payment system. So a lot of those principles are embedded in beckon and uh we have other

examples but I think open networks allows many actors many innovators to build applications on the edge using AI and I think we talk all we keep talking about

agents but I think the real power of agents is removing complexity for the user. So if a user is there who is uh a farmer or or somebody who's uh you know producing a little bit of electricity if

they can very easily transact with somebody else through an agent which is in their own language then suddenly this is inclusion at massive scale. So I see really uh AI agents on

an open network as the fundamental construct for massive uh diffusion of technology &gt;&gt; and also the importance as you mentioned of doing that in in languages and local.

&gt;&gt; Oh totally. I I think uh you talked about what you're doing at ISC. I think there are many many initiatives in India which essentially are driving to make language uh completely accessible

because language is not just uh a pure language. I mean the way Indians speak they mix the English, Hindi and Tamil in one sentence. So how do you how do you deal with that? How do you recognize

that? So I think all that is getting addressed. There are many initiatives voice AI, there's Bhashini of the government, there's AI for Bharat, there's your project, the Google

project. So I think there's lots of stuff but fundamentally I think language as a barrier will go away. So if you combine language so a person talk talks to the agent in their own language and

then if the agent does some transaction with comp hiding all the complexity behind it then you know that's the holy grail right we can get everybody on the system and that's how AI will get

diffused &gt;&gt; right and and speaking of you mentioned uh farmers and agriculture s let me come to you I mean you the world bank recently launched agri connect

initiative uh first of' like you describe that a little bit I think it's it's it's senator to make what small holder farmers do much much more efficient and scalable. But I'm curious

uh what has that work taught you so far about the type of global standards uh that are going to be needed to scale local solutions. &gt;&gt; So agree if you just go to look about

the agri connect in Uttar Pradesh for now. So it is very farmer oriented approach to provide very coherent and consistent services at the same time with open stack open network.

That means if you think about the the previous day the from the computer innovation, mobile innovation now we are seeing AI innovation. I would interpret this evolutions from the supplier

oriented service environment to the customer user oriented environment. In that sense some open standard and open network is really crucial part to make sure user centric service. So it is very

efficient and affordable solutions for in AI era to fully you know provide quality of service to the user. In that sense the farm this agricon uh project is really uh important but it is not

only for you know agric culture project with that we are really uh looking forward to expanding to another sector like health care and education part so it can be a very universal uh network in

the future &gt;&gt; that that that's pretty powerful in fact speaking of healthcare you mentioned you're taking this to healthcare Kieran you you've You've been a an incredible

advocate and innovator when it comes to thinking about medicine as a whole and uh you've you've talked about this idea that we need to move beyond the industry of medicine and tell tell me say more

about what you have in mind about what we need to move to and in particular how you can connect what's going on with maybe with AI and data sets uh with fundamentally transforming medicine.

&gt;&gt; So I think I have to answer this in two parts. The first part is how do we basically leverage what Nandan referred to as the digital stack to a health stack. That is the first big opportunity

we have and I think India is a country that can uniquely create a global reference model when it comes to uh the use of uh AI in the kind of health data that we're collecting. So for instance,

India is beginning to collect a lot of health data in its health stack, you know, with and it's phenotypic, it's genomic, it's demographic and uh and and and radiological data.

Now all and of course treatment and treatment outcome data. Now when you start collecting this data I think the whole objective again which is a holy grail which is universal healthcare

delivery at scale in a sustainable way and how do we reduce the disease burden I mean and increase lifespan all these are big challenges and a very complex set of solutions but I think this is a

starting point where you get this huge digital stack of health data And because India has this opensource and the consentbased kind of secure data sharing model already established in in UPI. I

think we should quickly you know apply this to healthare and when you do that you will start risk profiling your population at a demographic level which I think is very exciting

&gt;&gt; and at scale and if you can integrate insurance into that that would be even more powerful that can only be done by AI. So AI has the opportunity to risk profile very fast to try and find

interesting insurance models to see how we can marry the risk profile with the insurance instrument. Not easy but I think it's a good challenge because AI can be given a lot of exclusion

inclusion criteria which it can adopt. So I personally am very excited with what AI can do for health uh digital health and the the the whole universal healthcare delivery model.

Additionally of course India has this unique uh model of Asha workers. If Asha workers can be empowered with AI that is even more powerful. So I think you know deploying AI for the common people the

common man is very important to both Nandan and Samood's point of view. Now coming to my excitement about your second question about what is it that I'm looking beyond this beyond this I'm

looking at advancing medicine using AI. Now biology on its own was limited because it didn't have the kind of power of technology to get get deeper insights. AI like what you've just done

alpha fold alpha genome is going to give it immeasurable opportunities to understand biology. And to me biological intelligence is just amazing. And if you combine it with

artificial intelligence and conver bring that convergence I think we're in for huge transformation. And when I look at a uh you know biological intelligence when I just look at cell biology you

know how cells signal how cells create circuits how cells regulate how cells connect and disconnect. I mean the human body living systems have distributed data centers and these data centers are

connecting disconnecting with sips of energy not gawatt of energy &gt;&gt; and they are actually translating that into instant information and decision making if we can learn that and apply it

to AI I think it's going to be transformational I am really looking forward to reprogramming cells right that's the holy grail How do you convert a cancer cell into a

non-malignant cell? &gt;&gt; How do you basically look at regenerative science? How do you look at lifespan? I mean your biggest question today is how do we shift from hospital

centric care to primary and community care that can happen with AI with predictive and preventive medicine and that's I think I've said enough. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, it would actually take us in

in effect, Kiran. It would probably take us from kind of treating diseases to preventing diseases. And and I like you and I were talking earlier. You and I and Demis were talking about this idea

of someday we should be able to try to build virtual cells, models of virtual cells and be able to do, you know, in a kind of cell-based biology basically. &gt;&gt; Absolutely.

&gt;&gt; That's one of the exciting things. &gt;&gt; It's very exciting. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, we we'll come back to that. But I I want to come to you Sil which is you know I'm curious Sil as you think

about what you've been doing what is the what what what what role does DPI and open networks play in developing and scaling the kinds of solutions uh to some of society's most pressing

problems? I mean you've been thinking about this for a very long time from way back when you set up the AI institute way before most people were thinking about these things but I want to hear

what what your what your perspectives and experiences have been. Thanks, James. Good morning. Just so we're all clear, there's a lot of intellectual horsepower on the stage and

it's all on this side of me. I'm basically here for my good looks. So, just so we manage expectations. uh but when I uh set up uh Vadwani AI back in 2018 and prime minister was good

enough to come and inaugurate that basically we had a huge benefit which is the following to your point that over the last 20 years the government of India has developed a set of DPI digital

public infrastructure that is broad and that is deep and this DPI are basically digital building blocks that connect policy program implementation,

public service workers and citizens in the country. So, and I'll give you a couple of examples, but these again these digital public uh this DPI provides two key very practical

down-to-earth uh functions and benefits as I see it. Number one, they provide data and data pipelines. And for AI, you couldn't build AI for the social sector without

the kind of data and the data pipelines that they provide. Secondly, uh this DPI provides distribution channels so that once your inference models are ready, these AI platforms again developed and

managed by government provide a distribution channel to get our AI models out at scale. Without these, trust me, the usage of any model in the public sector, in the social sector,

would cost incredibly more and wouldn't scale anywhere near what we see. So, two quick examples, one in healthcare, one in education. So, one of the challenges, one of the national health priorities

for the government of India for the last several years has been the elimination of tuberculosis, TB. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It's the largest infectious disease

killer in the world. kills close to two million people a year. It's the largest infectious disease killer in India. Kills close to half a million people a year in India. And for each person that

unfortunately dies, 20 other survivors live miserable lives and it impacts their life, their ability to earn a living. So the government asked to us to come in and see what we could do and we

identified with the government what are the three or four key pain points in the patient's journey. First one is diagnosis and diagnosing TB in economically vulnerable communities

isn't easy. X-ray machines, pumm analysis, etc. These are all challenging. They're expensive. They're time consuming. They're tedious. Uh so that's challenge number one.

Secondly, if you do sputum analysis, these have to go to 64 government labs around the country. there's throughput time and by the time the patient gets the results back, you've lost some time

in initiating treatment for the people who have TB. And finally, there's a huge problem that there's a subset of TB patients who stop taking their medication because these are it's a very

toxic regimen of medications which has a very toxic effect on the body. The problem is once you stop taking them, you develop drugresistant TV. Then the mortality rate goes up dramatically to

50% and then you infect a lot more people and so on. So fortunately the government has a DPI called NIKsha. It's a very large data platform. It's a patient management system that has data

on all of the TB that detected TB cases in the country. Government gave us access to that database. We developed a range of models and to address these challenges that we saw in the patient

care journey for diagnosis, we've come up with a way of diagnosing TB from the sound of a cough into a smartphone. It's instant, it's quick, it shows you what the risk is of that patient having it

having TB and so government workers can focus on those patients. In the one year or so that this program has started getting rolled out, the diagnosis part using the sound of a cough, detection of

TB patients has gone up by 25% nationally. You may think that's bad news because now there's more TB cases, but they were there. But now we can make sure they get treated

on the labs and the turnaround time. We've come up with an AI way to automate a lot of this testing. So now literally you get the results the same day patient and the doctor finds out instantaneously

and then they can start treatment. On the issue of patients who develop drugresistant TB, we've come up with algorithms that predict which TB patients are likely to fall off their

medication regimen. And so the 2,000 or so TB case workers in the country, which is a small number for the four or five million TB patients that we have, but now they can target their time and

bandwidth on this subset of patients that really needs help. But all of that was enabled by this DPI called Nikshai, this database which enables all of this. One other quick example in the education

space in the global south including in India there's a very high dropout rate of students in early grades grades 1 to five. So we got a call from a large state government in India about a year

back saying can you help? We took a look at it and it turns out that the single key reason for this very high dropout rate in early grades, grades one through five, is the inability of these young

children to read proficiently in their mother tongue. If you can't read properly, it'll affect how you do in all your subjects, you know, geography, history, science,

everything. You start failing, you get frustrated, your parents say, "Take care. Come back home, work on the farm, work in the kitchen, etc." and that affects the rest of their life.

So, uh we've come up with a system to diagnose within 20 seconds for each child by just speaking into a phone into our model. In 20 seconds, we figure out exactly where they are struggling

what words, what phrases, what sentences and what will help them get on the right track. Uh and this is being done at the cost of five peray per student. I think cost is

another very big part of scaling that doesn't get discussed too much but cost is very important. So five pes per student. While this was in pilot the the suite of

solutions we came up with. So we've got a way like I said of assessing in 20 seconds where the patient where the student is struggling we come up with the diagnostic and then come up with the

remediation plan and exercises for each student to practice at home to improve their reading. The state was so impressed with the pilot they made it mandatory for all three million kids of

that age in school. Three or four other states including the state of Rajasthan just made it mandatory for all 8 million kids over there. And by the way all of this again enabled by DPI. So Rajasthan

has a state level DPI called Rakshuk. Our system, our models sit on top of that system. It reaches 400,000 schools, 8 million students and it's spreading. So now the government of India by the

end of next year wants to make the standard across the country. All 75 million children of that age group will get their reading improved and strengthened through the systems that we

have. Bottom line all enabled by DPI. No, I mean those are very th those are incredibly powerful examples. In fact, you know, the case of TB is is actually one that's super

important because something like 40% of people in the world go undiagnosed with TB and in fact most of them are in the global south. But it also just brings me back to maybe a question of scale. I

mean Su, you know, in what you're doing, you mentioned a few countries, but I think your goal is to get with some of these education and health solutions to like 25 countries or more. How are you

thinking about kind of taking that to kind of multi-country scale and how you know what are some of the ideas you have about how you do that &gt;&gt; beyond agriculture as you said we are

you know piloting and have a lot of good project in many countries for example in Kenya we have some pretty good number of progress of uh math education uh with

very simple AI math tutoring solutions can achieve the same you know academic goal within six week which usually takes more longer than a year long process. So

that's one question uh one example in Nigeria uh also not only uh TV some very small handheld ultrasound device can scan the the pregnant woman and then easily diagnoses some some problem for

baby and then it drastically reduce the uh birth the baby death rates. So it is one another example how can we scale this up. Another good example as you said we are expanding the current uh

India model to other three uh African countries and in Brazil we added one more in Philippine. Ah okay. &gt;&gt; And then the one of the way is that how can we really

find some very standardized and scalable model but this is not easy but from the one concrete example like in India case for agricult connect we are figuring out what would be the best way and lighter

model we can quickly replicate to other countries. This is our role. The World Bank is trying very hard to figure out what that means and then how they can really replicate this model to other

countries and what would be the the really critical component to be replicated. So this is our role. So we are just keep the working on the what would be the best simple model is. So in

that sense we we usually I'm not sure it is really right uh you know analogy I'm I'm using this analogy as a somalier we are not innovation creator uh there's bunch of really good you know the wine

producers but our customers is not really you know uh you know can aware of the which wine is really fit for their taste. So as a somalier uh the world bank is trying very hard to understand

the the wines and then find some better the recommend the better wines for our customers taste. &gt;&gt; Yeah but I I think on this question of scale I mean those are great.

&gt;&gt; You need any help on uh quality control with these wines? Yeah. But but but I I think on this question of scale, I mean, Nandon, I've heard you say that, you know, uh we

won't get to true population scale unless we actually scale things like inference in AI and how we do that at massive scale. And I'm I'm just curious for you to expand on that a bit more,

but also what lessons and implications might even have for people like us who are building frontier models. Say more about why the inference part of this really matters. No, I think broadly

speaking, I think especially in the global south, uh the cost of AI inference has to drop dramatically because if you're serving a customer with one query and that costs,

you know, 500 rupees or something, it's not going to work. So, we have to make it really inference has to be which I think you know you'll do that because uh I mean there's a lot of focus today on

the training side, you know, getting bigger and bigger models and launching them. But I think as that sort of stabilizes I think the focus will shift on the inference side to make inference

cheap. But I think uh the uh I'll give you an example of a very tangible example of open networks given agri connect. I yesterday I was talking to demis

&gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; and uh Deis was saying that Google is improving its weather models. Yeah, &gt;&gt; they're making it uh better, more efficient, more predictive, more

granular in where it you know area by area and so on. Now if you had an open network for agri like agri connect which suppose it has millions of farmers then all we need to do is just plug in the

latest weather model of Google into that open network and suddenly 10 million farmers have access to the latest weather data. That's a good example of why this open network thing is important

because it's you allows you to plug new models, new new sources of capability, new ideas and so on. And I think that's what we're doing. And to give you another example of how it reduces uh uh

the complexity uh if there's a very interesting you know demo here of energy trading. Now we never thought of energy as something that you traded because you bought it from the utility. But today

with millions of people producing energy, they're able to somebody has a rooftop solar, there's some extra energy, they can sell it to somebody else. But how does a farmer in UP learn

how to sell energy? It's a whole new concept. It's only by an agentic commerce interface that is simple. So I think uh lowcost inference combined with agents that hide complexity is the key

to massive diffusion. &gt;&gt; Yeah. In fact, I I like the example you brought up on weather because in some ways thanks to the quite frankly the forward thinking of part of the Indian

government and the ministry of agriculture. They've they they've set up that infrastructure and in fact last year they drew they used one of our models neural GCM uh which predicts uh

monsoons and were actually able to deliver I think to something like 38 million Indian farmers uh predictions about the monsoons. But that only worked because the Indian government actually

set up that kind of infrastructure where you could plug in uh the the these models. U Kan I want to come back to you because I mean in some ways you you you you raise some more foundational

questions here about the future biology and health overall. Uh can can I mean and I've heard you say for example that in fact AI doesn't replace biology that biology is much much more fundamental

and foundational. say more about that and what what can AI learn from biology and vice versa and what do you imagine what needs to happen to fully take advantage of?

&gt;&gt; Yeah. So I think uh first and foremost biology works through distributed data centers. Okay. And when it wants to build intelligence, retrieve memory and

inference data, it does so with sips of energy, not with gigawatts of power that our data center. &gt;&gt; So we could learn something from that. &gt;&gt; So I think we can learn something from

that. I think more fundamental to that is that biology also has generational learning. You know, if you think about uh how our DNA stores generational memory, I think that's fascinating. How

does the Arctic turn fly out of its nest for the first time, travel 70,000 kilometers to the Antarctic and back? It has navigational intelligence embedded in its DNA. How does that work? So I

think we have to learn a lot from biology and use AI to learn that biology because without AI you cannot have any insights into biology. So I just feel that the future is going to be about the

convergence of biological intelligence and AI and that is going to be a very powerful transformative process because biology has a lot to teach uh AI in terms of how to do it with less energy,

how to do it rapidly and how to multiplex multimodel data very rapidly. Now that is something which I think is very exciting and I think to go back to what

you've just been discussing with Nandan and others. I think what makes it very exciting right now is the volumes of data you can uh contribute on open networks. I think we have to talk about

I mean I know I work with a lot of uh you know organizations around the world in my field. there's a huge uh reluctance to share data you know there's a lot of uh

weariness about IP being you know fragmented and therefore I think except for India there's a lot of this resistance to share data now when you don't share data you're going to silo it

India has this unique opportunity because of its you know this open networks and the digit public digital infrastructure to share volumes of very important data like Nandan just

illustrated in terms of the u you know the the environmental data that he was talking about the climate data &gt;&gt; uh and farmers taking huge advantage of that is what we have to really really

focus on because India is uniquely positioned in terms of its open networks and if we can actually keep generating data and then make the cost of inference because of the economies of scale

then you have a winning formula. &gt;&gt; I I'm being told that we we're going to have to wrap this up. Uh or but but um before we do that though, I want to just see if we can do a quick lightning round

so to speak. I mean the this summit has been extraordinary. Uh the example that India is setting for the world quite frankly is extraordinary. uh if you could say each of you say one

thing you'd like to see happen in the next uh 12 months uh particularly with this idea of open networks and change at population scale uh what would that be uh I don't know who wants to go first

&gt;&gt; I think I'd like to see massive diffusion where uh all these applications that are just rolling out on open networks reach millions of farmers students uh patients and so

and actually show the world that AI is a force of good. I think we have an obligation to show that otherwise I think the push back will be huge. &gt;&gt; That's good.

&gt;&gt; Yeah, I definitely want to see uh a sustainable standard of care, highquality, universal health care coming out of this AI effort and the health stack

&gt;&gt; that's preventative presumably. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. as opposed to &gt;&gt; diagnostic, preventative, predictive and precision because you can't do away with treatment. But how do you basically

stage it &gt;&gt; up front? up front SEL or Sang. &gt;&gt; Uh yeah. So yesterday when the prime minister spoke uh at Bhat Mandupam you know how he has been saying for

years make an India for the world he said in the age of AI let's develop in India and let's deliver to the world. So in our case is just one little example at Vadwani AI. I've given

you two or three examples of what we've done. But we've developed over 25 AI platforms in India in education, healthcare, agriculture which are scaling up. What's interesting is over

the last year we've had an incredible amount of incoming interest from governments throughout the global south in Africa, Asia and so on who are hungry for these solutions and they're looking

to India to provide these. In fact, when PM Modi launched our institute back in 2018, you know, he was saying the US is so far ahead, China is so far ahead. I said,

Mr. Prime Minister, we can set the example in India for how AI can be used for societal transformation. No one else is doing that. We are showing how it can be done.

&gt;&gt; Sound good? So for the next 12 years I really uh want to work more to disseminate the really good use cases to our uh client uh country and people the one of the reason is that some big

challenge for the people in uh developing world they do not clearly know what they can do with AI even though it can provide really much affordable and easiest way

to expand their capability and productivity. intelligence. So in a in a very easy way comparely uh compared to the the the old uh old date. So once again they can get to know oh this is a

real important opportunity for them and then I can believe that they will really find some really good way to fully utilize this one in a very affordable way.

&gt;&gt; Yeah. No no thank you. And at least what what I'm taking away is that it's not just the example that India is setting for India and the world but also quite frankly the example that each of you is

setting because all of you in your work and your organizations your teams through your initiatives but also your philanthropy and quite frankly insight have done a lot to show what leaders can

do. So I appreciate the the examples that you're setting and and the example that India is setting. Please join me in thanking my panelists here. Thank you. And I think with that we'll

draw to uh close. Thank you. Uh just request you all to be seated. 30 seconds more. Uh uh first of all uh could we just please have another round of applause for our esteemed panelists.

Very insightful. Uh thank you very much for uh for coming here. uh the true benefits of AI the discussion shows uh uh can only be realized when we build for everyone using open networks. Very

insightful conversation. Thank you James for moderating it. Uh and to further help drive population scale impact uh we invite change makers and researchers to apply for the two Google.org impact

challenges. One is uh in AI for science, one is for government innovation. There's a QR code uh for you to learn more. And I encourage you all to visit us uh at booths three and four in hall 5

to see firsthand how Google AI is delivering a real world impact. And finally, I just request all the panelists to please join uh center stage for a photograph. Thank you everyone.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; That was great. Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; I know it's actually my fault I no For me personally, it's just &gt;&gt; take a picture.

&gt;&gt; Okay. All right. Okay.
