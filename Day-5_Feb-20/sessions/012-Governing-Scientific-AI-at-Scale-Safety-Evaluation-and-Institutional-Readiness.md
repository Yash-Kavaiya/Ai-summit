## 📝 Summary

As capabilities scale, existing assurance and risk management approaches are often stretched by real-world scientific and institutional contexts. This session examines how safety, evaluation, governance frameworks can be adapted and stress-tested through scientific AI use cases, and how emerging ecosystems can build evaluation capacity, manage high-impact risks, and contribute to globally robust scientific AI safety practices.
