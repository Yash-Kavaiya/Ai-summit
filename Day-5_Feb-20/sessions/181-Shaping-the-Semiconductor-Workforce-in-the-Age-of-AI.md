## 📝 Transcript

required workers to enable the growth of the semiconductor industry and support this era. We're here today to just talk about that. Thank you for the opportunity to engage in this important

conversation. We have experts here who can talk about how we build scalable holistic workforce strategies to develop India semiconductor ambitions. We extend a

warm welcome to our guests today. I'll start with Shri Krishna G secretary of Matei. Thank you sir for joining us today. We know uh you're very busy but if I may add uh excellent job by the

matey team and uh all of uh you know we're very proud at to be here at this event. U it was a mind-blowing exhibition. For those of you who have not enjoyed the exhibition, I urge you

it has apparently been extended by a day. Uh so I urge you to visit tomorrow if you get the chance to do so. &gt;&gt; And you can visit till 8:00 p.m. today. &gt;&gt; You can visit till 8:00 p.m. today sis.

Uh sir, thank you. Thank you sir. Well, we have also here with us David Freed, corporate vice president and leader of Lamb Research's advanced analytical and simulation software business that

supports the development of the semiconductor industry. We also have Mr. Paul Triolo. Paul Mr. Paul Triello is a partner and technology practice lead at the DJ group who graciously

agreed to be a moderator for our panel discussion which is to follow shortly. To set some context to both these sessions, 2025 was a great year. It was a great year for the India semiconductor

industry as well. With the right focus of the government and thanks to the India semiconductor mission, years of policy vision are finally translating ambition into reality. And we're

beginning to see the fruits of that now. And rightfully so. The government has expanded their focus beyond just wafer fabrication to the larger ecosystem because we realize that it takes the

whole village to make this happen. How do we ensure that we have the right talent, the research infrastructure, the technology expertise, the supply chain, all of the other things that it takes to

support this sector? With the industry accelerating past a trillion dollars, we at Lamb recognize the importance of supporting a globally distributed innovation-led ecosystem. We've been in

India for 25 years and we are committed to being a long-term partner and contributor to this. We have a state-of-the-art systems engineering lab for semiconductors in Bengaluru which

continues to grow and is significantly expanding India's contribution to the global industry. We are also making rapid progress in integrating India's supply chain into

our global supply chain. But most importantly, we have taken big strides in supporting the development of the workforce in India. And David will talk about that a little bit more shortly. So

I won't take any much more time but I'll invite Secretary Krishnan to share a few of his remarks. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Oh, you want a picture? &gt;&gt; He wants a picture now.

Part of the planning for many of these sessions included instructions that the picture of the panelist needs to be taken right in the beginning so that if somebody goes missing midway through

[laughter] they're not missed. So I guess he was getting to do his job. Um, lamb research in some ways is a bit of a uh a lucky charm as far as I'm concerned and I

think Rangkesh will understand what I'm trying to say. But uh more importantly I think uh um this is uh I'm really happy to be part of this session because this is one of those sessions which

represents what the what the convergence is in what India is attempting. We have two major missions. We have the India AI mission and we have the India semiconductor mission. And this session

kind of represents how those two missions are converging or getting together. It represents how semiconductors are so central to the AI story as AI is increasingly to the

semiconductor story. So um this morning we also signed um the PAX silica. Uh we were added to the PAX silica. So which again represents a very important step forward in building a trusted uh supply

chain in the semiconductor space. What the world needs is a resilient and reliable supply chain where I mean it is not just for geopolitical reasons but even for other reasons. we saw in the

covid pandemic uh issues relating to the supply chain propup and therefore over reliance on any one geography is always going to be a problem and India needs to be part of this game and for India to be

a reliable long-term partner in this game it's also very important that we are not just part of the design teams which we already are including for land research and including for many other

leading semiconductor companies in the world but we also need to be part of the manufacturing and manufacturing not just of the chips. And this year we are going to have 10 of

the um we already have committed to 10 major uh uh semiconductor plants across the country. Four of them at least will commence production during the current uh year during 2026

and the remaining in in in due course in about a year or so. But more importantly, I think uh the India semiconductor mission 2.0 has also been announced which will cover the entire

ecosystem including the manufacturer of semiconductor equipment in the country and I think that is a very very critical and important step and this is important from a context where I think the use of

semiconductors is only going to grow and not come down. [snorts] India's own market for semiconductors is going to be about hundred billion dollars by the end of this decade and um fairly substantial

part of what the global market is and we need to build capacity to actually cater to a significant part of this market and in some senses also for export because and the export part is important not

from the perspective of not just from the perspective of uh uh being competitive and being efficient because if you're not able to export then it obviously means you're not competitive

and efficient globally. But also because when you are part of a global supply chain you're never going to manufacture everything in the chain but you need to have a significantly important and you

need to be an indispensable part of it somewhere so that you don't sort of get knocked out of it at somebody else's will. So it is it's it's the way that this entire system works. It's the way

the global value chain works and that's where we are coming together uh in this entire space and what uh Lamb is doing in the space is extremely important and equally what's very important if we are

to do this kind of advanced manufacturing in the country is actually the capacity building to have the skills to do this. We keep talking about STEM skills in this country. We keep talking

about the number of people who are we we have 20% of the of the semiconductor design team in the country in the world. We also are recognized as having one of the largest talent pools for

manufacturing uh for AI in the world. Both of these are true but where we lack is people in advanced manufacturing in manufacturer of semiconductors. Where we lack is in

the precision manufacturing of the equipment needed for semiconductors and Lamb Research and companies of that nature in building the semiconductor ecosystem in this country are looking to

develop precisely that the precision manufacturer of semiconductor equipment. That means we will have to skill people in that space. We'll have to skill people in that line of work and that's

the real challenge that we will be facing in the next 5 years. As part of the India semiconductor mission, we've trained workers in fabs and in uh OSATs, not just in India but in like in uh the

semiconductor lab at Mujali but [clears throat] also in Malaysia, we've trained people in Singapore, we've trained people in Taiwan, we've trained people in Europe, we've trained people

in different parts of the world and we will continue to do that. But we will also need more capacity to do it here and uh training and research capacity being built by companies like Lamb will

have an important implication there and the government will support those initiatives um as part of the India semiconductor mission 2.0 and make sure that India becomes a key player in this

space as well and becomes a key partner in global supply chains. It's an investment that the world is making in India which I can assure you will be paid back in no uncertain terms in terms

of building a resilient trusted value chain for semiconductors for the world and that's precisely what we are attempting to do through the series of initiatives and today we can't any

longer speak of AI without speaking of semiconductors or vice versa and which is why what lamb is doing and what we are attempting to do in terms of skill building in critical space is so

important and which is why I'm extremely happy to be part of this event and all strength to you in lan may you continue to be our lucky charm. Thank you. [applause]

&gt;&gt; Thank you very much Krishna sir. Uh Oh, Deepa &gt;&gt; sir is in such a hurry that you're in such a hurry. Uh

&gt;&gt; we want to make sure you get your gift. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Five minutes. Okay. Uh we are eagerly awaiting the arrival

of honorable minister Vashnner Gj. He is uh 5 minutes away is what I'm just told. Um Minister Vashnav has been instrumental in getting this industry where it is in India over the past few

years. Uh we look forward to his presence here shortly. And in the interim, I'd just like to invite David Frerieded to give a few comments. David is a leader of our global semiconductor

modeling and workforce development organization called Semiverse Solutions. Uh David has played a key role in building India's workforce uh training on advanced semiconductor manufacturing.

He'll give a few words about that. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much. See if this works. Okay, clicker doesn't Oh, there it does. All right. So, thank you very much. I'm

really honored to be here at this event. Uh it is it's mind-boggling in its scale uh and in the amount of technology that's being displayed here. I want to bring this uh event sort of to a focus.

I'll talk a little bit about AI and semiconductors, how they're so intertwined, and I'll talk a little bit about how we're focusing um intensely here in India and workforce development

in this area. &gt;&gt; Sorry. &gt;&gt; So, uh at this summit, I hope I don't have to say this. I hope I don't have to use this slide, but AI is a

transformative technology. It's already transforming our lives. It's already changing our lives. and it will continue to do so more and more over time. Uh, everybody is using chat GPT large

language models in their day-to-day life. We're seeing uh, AI deployed in medicine for diagnosis capabilities and reading your X-rays now. So, AI is being deployed pervasively across our lives

and this is only accelerating over time. Uh this chart was shown a few moments ago while Rangesh was speaking but I think it's really critical to understand that AI and the data center demand of

GPUs and scaled systems is driving the entire semiconductor industry right now. We are at the cusp of the single largest ramp in our history and the single largest demand driver of semiconductors

in history. Uh this chart shows just how the data center demand of semiconductors will dwarf all other sources of demand for semiconductors in the next year or so. Um and this is uh this chart is

estimated through 2030. So this is not a uh a quick ramp and done. This is a long-term pervasive demand driver across the industry. As a result of this, I will take one step further from the

comments made earlier that AI and semiconductors are are linked. They're they're connected. I will say right now AI is semiconductors and semiconductors is AI. Okay, it is that it is that close

right now. Thank you. Um the the evidence of this is really the surge of new fab construction, new fabs across the world. This chart shows fabs uh with new in in blue first tool

moveins this year in 2026 and in yellow first tool moveins next year. What you will notice is there are many many dots on this chart. These are not existing fabs. These are new fabs with slated

scheduled first tool moveins. This chart is unlike anything that has been shown in our industry. The scale of the expansion is astronomical and it's across the world. So you see

many fabs in traditional locations of South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, fabs in Europe, fabs in the US, and excitingly new fabs with slated tool moveins here in India.

Okay, this is an incredibly exciting chart uh as an equipment manufacturer to see this type of chart but I hope this is exciting uh here in India to see sort of joining the the big leagues here. Uh

this is very exciting. Now as I said AI is driving our industry right now and it's driving the technology requirements across all of our major sectors. uh we like to hear a

lot about GPUs from Nvidia and other companies. So we hear about those GPUs that are primarily a logic technology chip. AI and the requirements of logic technology are driving us from finfets

to gate all around to sef advanced technology as we continue to progress down Moors law or more than Moore's law here on the top row of logic. We also hear a lot about high bandwidth memory

um from Micron and other memory manufacturers. That's a DRAM technology and AI requirements are driving our DRAM technology roadmap advancing to smaller dimensions but also smaller bit cells

from a six feature squared bit cell to four feature squared bit cells. So these are fundamental technology specifications of these technologies shrinking and becoming more complex.

We're also now finally starting to see AI drive technology requirements of NAND for storage class memory. Again, we've gone to 3D NAND several years ago and we're seeing multi-tiered stacked 3D

NAND to get higher density larger uh storage class memory to support AI. When we in the in the semiconductor industry talk about logic, DRAM and NAND, that's more than 75% of the silicon produced on

the planet every year. These are the three major market streams and AI and the requirements of AI are driving all three of them. Now, Lamb Research, uh hopefully you've

gotten to know us a little bit better. Lamb Research is a global leader in wafer fabrication. We are now the second largest behind ASML only the second largest um wafer fabrication equipment

company in the world. Uh we provide upwards of 20% of all of the equipment that go into wafer fabs globally across all of those major sectors and more. uh we specialize in deposition and etch

technologies and as these technologies as I showed previously go from uh finfet to gate all around to cfett or from uh drama 6fs squed to 4sq as those technologies get more complex and more

3D they are more heavily reliant on deposition and etch technologies from lamb research now the problems the technology development They're getting more and

more difficult every year. And so here's another connection back to AI. The road maps, those technology road maps are accelerating and the complexity of technology is getting staggering.

Everybody talks about Moore's law. Hopefully people are familiar with Moore's law that every 18 months the density of transistors on products double. We talk about Lamb's law. at

exactly the same rate. Every 18 months, the number of parameters on these process tools doubles, the number of possible recipe combinations on our equipment goes up. So, the complexity

that goes along with Moore's law is accelerating radically. Uh I I'd like to show this chart. The number of possible recipes you can run on one of our more advanced etch tools right now is on the

order of 10 to the 21st. Okay? and we're asking our process engineers to develop the right recipe to deliver to our customers on that tool. That level of complexity with that many

different options, it's way beyond technology that a human can handle alone in their own mind. Um, and the stakes are getting higher. The cost of R&amp;D, the cost of building the fabs are getting

higher and higher. So, we have to solve these problems faster. The way we address solving these problems is with AI. Okay. We are working heavily in the

semiverse solutions division, my division of LAM to develop digital twin technology across many different layers at the device scale, the transistor level, at the reactor scale, our our

chambers, at the full equipment scale, even the fab scale. So we work very hard to create simulation models, database predictions, optimization technologies to expedite and accelerate the

development of new equipment, new processes and those new technologies. So just to put some real specific examples here, when we talk about an equipment scale digital twin, obviously

we're designing the equipment digitally with digital digital design tools, computational design tools. We're able to create full virtual twins of the equipment and we use those twins to

figure out how to install or facilitize equipment before we get to the customer. Figure out how to do maintenance in the virtual domain so we don't have to learn it at the customer.

We have subsystem scale digital twins so that we can figure out exactly where are the gases flowing in our reactors. How is the plasma behaving in our reactors? We can do that before we ever build the

reactor so that we're not rebuilding and redesigning and recutting new parts. We also have feature scale virtual twins where we can understand the process and how our customers will implement that

process in their technology. This allows us to better develop recipes on our tools for optimal yield at the customer. Okay, so this is the type of digital twins, machine learning optimization and

physics-based virtual twins that we're developing inside Semiverse Solutions. The really exciting part of all this is we're in this accelerating virtuous cycle. Okay, we're taking computers,

we're using these algorithms and these digital twins to develop the next set of semiconductor equipment and processes to make more advanced chips that go into electronics that we then use to develop

the next generation of semiconductors. AI and semiconductors are inextricably linked. We're using AI to develop semiconductors. They're using semiconductors to drive the hardware

layer of AI. It's one and the same. Now we source talent for this across the world. You can see here sites lamb research sites around the world. We have talent and and head headquarters in

California but sites across the US through Europe and Asia and a very large site in Bengaluru uh run by our friend Rangesh here. So we source talent around the world and we've strategically placed

these locations both both close to our customers but also close to large talent pools that allow us to scale our enterprise as the market needs. In 2023

as part of the joint announcement uh between the United States and India, this was announced uh with the prime minister and our president at the time. Lamb made a commitment to help upskill

and develop the talent base in India uh to help fill the needs of this growth in the industry. So we made a very large commitment uh and we made a commitment a very specific commitment to train 60,000

engineers in India in the semiconductor discipline over the course of 10 years. It's quite difficult to do this when you don't have fabs in the country. you don't even have that many universities

with uh research scale semiconductor labs and so we took a very specific approach to solving this problem here in India is we using the virtual domain we're distributing our software the same

software we use internally to develop technology inside lamb research the same software we sell to large semiconductor customers of ours we're deploying that at universities across Ross India to

train on the most advanced semiconductor device technology in the virtual domain. The advantages of this are really significant. We can do this for students who don't have access to a fab or a

semiconductor grade lab. We can do this uh at very low cost. We can do this on laptops instead of on multi-million dollar pieces of equipment. We can do this in the safety of a classroom rather

than in a fab or a lab with dangerous chemicals and gases. So the advantages are are significant. Um oh I guess I clicked ahead too quickly. Sorry. Um this is not just India. We've deployed

this capability and this technology across leading universities worldwide. Um and I just show this chart just to reemphasize that we're treating India and the talent development in India

exactly the same as our primary historical markets around the world. South Korea, Taiwan, Japan, Singapore, the US and Europe. The number of universities involved, however, in India

dwarfs the rest of the world. I'm just trying to wrap up quickly here because I think everybody wants to get to the panel. This is just a quick view of what students are learning and

developing in this virtual domain where they're using virtual technology and digital twins of semiconductor technology to develop the most advanced devices, process sequences, and process

technology for the future. Um, and here's just a video showing a fully integrated semiconductor technology uh region. And you can see how students are very quickly able to do

depositions and etches and polishes and all sorts of semiconductor processes in sequences with a variety of different conditions in order to enable learning of semiconductor technology disciplines.

Um just to review very quickly the the program and the status of this program. We announced this in the middle of 2023 and we immediately kicked this program off with registrations. About 65

universities wanted to be a part of this. We launched this program at IISC in Bangalore and over the course of the last two years we have trained faculty at 80 universities nationwide and we

have already run I believe now we're in our sixth semester. Am I right? Sixth semester. We are in the sixth semester of this training. &gt;&gt; Hello.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; So, we're now in our sixth semester of this type of upskilling. We have uh we have been we're now present at 80 universities across India and we're well

on our way to our 60,000 student objective in the course of 10 years. We're actually well ahead of our plan towards upskilling 60,000 engineers across the country.

&gt;&gt; David, would you mind going back? &gt;&gt; Oh, sorry. Yeah, it's it's advancing on its own here. I'm not hitting the button. &gt;&gt; Go back to the first slide. I want

honorable minister to see the numbers. This is his brainchild that I want him to see the fruit of the place &gt;&gt; this chart. &gt;&gt; Yes.

&gt;&gt; Yeah. So again when we started try to speak here actually I'm going to take the microphone so I can speak here. See if this works. Okay. Um when we started this we kicked this off 65 universities

or institutes wanted to be involved. We kicked off at IASC. We brought in faculty from 14 different institutes to train at IISC. In the spring, we deployed 830 licenses

of this software. We we enrolled 570 students across 13 institutes and it keeps growing. A workshop last summer where we brought in 50 new institutes, the multiple different workshops. We're

now up to 80 universities and institutes. We're deployed in the last semester over 2,000 software licenses across the country, enrolling students across 31 new institutes and 14 new uh

faculty brought in over the last semester. So again, the scaling of this, the only way we're going to get to 60,000 over 10 years is by scaling out to more and more universities, growing

the program, and continuing the the enrollment at full capacity. Um this is just a review of how we continue to train the trainer, bring more faculty in, train them, bring them

back to the universities and continue to scale this. So the numbers are the numbers are super exciting. We're well ahead of our plan and I think that was these are some of the numbers and you

can see when we piloted it, you know, a pilot class of 43 students and as we continue to scale the number of universities, we're up to, you know, 2,000 in a single semester. We'll be at

4,000 um in next fall. And you can see our cumulative numbers are going up to 60K. We're we're close to two years ahead of plan. If you trace the trajectory all the way out

and I will say I'm I'm excited to be here in the north of the country. We obviously kicked this program off at IASC in the south of the country. And you can see the number of universities

where we're present is a little bit more heavily weighted to the south. And part of our main mission and our drive now is to start filling those numbers larger across the north and the rest of the

country to really drive the expansion of this upskilling, reach those target numbers, but really drive um talent for the entire ecosystem. not just driving new hires for Lamb, but new hires for

all of the companies, be they fabs or metrology, inspection, even design. Um, and so the objective here is really to drive across the country for full scaling of our talent development.

So with that, I'll wrap up. Uh, thank you very much for for your attention and I think we'll kick off our panel pretty soon. &gt;&gt; Oh, okay. I'm sorry.

&gt;&gt; Thank you very much, David. Welcome sir. Uh it's a pleasure to see you again. We know you're very busy and this is one of the marquee events of the for the country of the whole year. Uh the scale

and uh the impression of this event is mindboggling truly at the scale that we have been able to do it. So congratulations to you sir and the team for u inspiring us with the uh exhibits

that we saw today were amazing. And it speaks to the potential of AI. It also speaks to the importance of the semiconductor industry to enable this transition and the role that companies

like Lamb play in that. And we are uh very grateful to you sir for your support. You've always been very supportive of uh us in our journey here and you continue to be. So we'd like to

hear from you a few remarks. Uh we know you're a very busy person. So we'd appreciate it. Thank you. This is lamb team [clears throat] or people who have come to listen to lamb

mostly people mostly &gt;&gt; lamb supplier ecosystem. Okay very good solar technology &gt;&gt; solar very good. Um

semiconductor indry unprecedented just Focus semiconductor mission

target 60,000 talent develop for clean room operations and 80,000 overall design engineers. universities universities 315 universities we already

have students using world's latest design tools designing chips getting them manufactured incl moali and validating them and throughout the country Assam say

Jammu Kashmir say keral say Tamil Nadu say students age of intelligence semiconductors will be the one of the most important layers

five layer case architecture semiconductor is going to be a very important layer so or they say participate. I would like to thank Lamb for taking this initiative. I

would like to thank all the people who have got associated especially the universities unities. Mhm. Experience experience.

How easy was it to use uh this entire semiverse difficult? So that kind of that kind of approach we have taken. This will be very big. It

will open many new opportunities for students. Semiconductor industry people say that there is a talent gap of about 1 million people by 203132. That large talent gap has to be filled

by India only. That means all that work is going to come to India. That will be huge opportunity space for our young people or Uttar Pradesh semiconductor plantation

and keep doing this great work lamb. Thanks a lot Lamb team. Thank you so much. This is um

&gt;&gt; as you know sir we are in the business of deposition and etching. &gt;&gt; This is an old 14th century Indian technology called btheri wear &gt;&gt; from the district of bther

&gt;&gt; in north Karnataka &gt;&gt; where they also do this damisine process which is what is used for the most advanced semiconductors today. &gt;&gt; Wow. [laughter]

So this is a plate which is showing the skill of the artisans who have manually etched these features &gt;&gt; and in between &gt;&gt; and deposited met metal um to within

those etched features and then polished it which is exactly the process used today for semiconductor manufacturing. So we thought it would be very appropriate for you to uh have this

gift. So thank you very much sir. Thank &gt;&gt; Thank [applause] you. Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you so much, sir. Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Uh we're grateful for the uh brief but powerful presence. Honorable Minister Shri Vashn, thank you. Big round of

applause for him and the [applause] METI [cheering] organization. So now we can proceed with a panel discussion with the remaining time we

have. Um we have uh Paul Taylor here to conduct the panel discussion. We had Mr. Anand Ram Morti from Micron due to join us. Unfortunately, he had a personal emergency and he had to leave town. So,

uh we wish him well. Uh in the in the in the meanwhile, we'll have David and we'll have Professor Sarup Chandkar. Professor Chandurkar is a one of our key partners at Indian Institute of Science.

He has been instrumental in the launch and execution of the Semiverse program. He is also uh very busy advancing the state of the nation in the most uh advanced research areas for

semiconductors and its applications. So we'd love to hear from him as well. Thank you very much. Thank you Paul. &gt;&gt; We will. We will. Thank you. So okay um I'm going to pick up on some of the

themes that were discussed earlier. I was going to grill secretary Krishnan on ISM 2.0 but um unfortunately we can't do that. But I think it's really important looking forward um to as was mentioned

ISM uh 2.0 will focus on uh skilling and on supply chains and and manufacturing. So let me start with Dr. um Chandakar. Um we know that uh IIS is hosting a really rich center um in Bangalore and

and and with Lamb and other companies uh that is critical for the skilling issue uh in the semiconductor industry going forward. How do you see the future shaping up in 2026 and what does IIS

need for example from the government under ISM 2.0? &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Sure. Uh so let's let me just start uh by saying that uh it's actually quite

amazing for me to just have uh the dream of having fabs come up in India. Um it was something that actually happened from my father's time who was also professor in IIT Bombay and since his

time uh he was also a semiconductor manufacturer and technology and such. So anyway um fast forward we are in this amazing position where we are actually getting fabs here uh which obviously as

has been discussed uh leads us to realize that we actually need a lot of workforce uh and it's not that uh we didn't have people out here who would uh learning say semiconductor technology uh

it wasn't that we were not doing semiconductor design uh but what was actually missing was um the ability to actually see how fab actually works uh where you actually go and you know uh

interact with tools and that's where uh the semiverse uh comes in uh you know and uh basically we in ISC do in fact have a really good fab uh as an academic fab I would say we are uh probably you

know in top three or four in the world uh so we are pretty good there but uh that's not the case for most other uh universities in here and we alone cannot take uh you know the role of training 1

million people that's just impossible. So uh when uh this uh whole program came this was an ideal opportunity uh and so of course uh you know that's very exciting. Um at IC ourselves we we also

recognize that uh this needs a certain reook at the way we teach our coursework. So for example uh we started teaching uh courses uh such as uh advanced nodes uh for from the

perspective of fab and that's where in fact we do uh teach and make use of this software um and I for example teach uh uh SPC which uh is basically uh process control uh how does one do that and

that's those are kinds of things that are actually really required for uh fab and so the way I see it is uh I think the foundation has been uh laid down um and I am sure that if this continues uh

along with the support uh of the government I'm sure we'll do just fine u but uh the ask is not small by the way um if you just look at uh it's not just that uh once you get trained in uh on

tools like this that you become uh really actually immediately ready to uh go and start working in the fabs that's not the case. Uh and what needs to be therefore understood is that there is a

second layer of uh hands-on training uh that needs to happen. Uh we ourselves in fact have uh started we have a training fab that's currently getting established. Um and this needs to happen

across uh India far more. uh we already do these kinds of uh programs called INUP where uh people come from along uh all around India and u do some sort of fab in uh our fabs. Uh but this would be

more intended towards training and so we are gearing ourselves up for that and I think this needs to happen everywhere else uh where uh more fabs need to come up and show this up.

&gt;&gt; Great. Great. No, this is great. So um I I mean as as we heard we've heard I think this this integration of government support for both the academic piece of this and and the industry piece

is really important a really a really important three-way um uh relationship. So I'm going to go back to David who with a great presentation on uh on semiverse and say

I mean you you you know lamb is as you I think everybody understands is such a critical uh part of the supply chain. I mean, you know, no no lamb, no no semiconductors, right? Um, so David, how

do you how do you envision this this workforce? We've as as um Professor um Chandakar has noted, you know, this the foundation has been laid, but I think that as AI is taking off and as we look

look forward to the next three to four years, you know, this is we're going to see this huge uh demand and the million dollar the million person shortage really sort of blows my mind here.

That's a that's a huge number. So in terms of support from the government to help close that gap to to to continue the the momentum that uh that lamb has has has generated here what are the gaps

you see here um and are there areas you'd like to see expanded in terms of this collaboration between both the government and academia. Okay. So, I'll start the uh just thinking about the

gaps, right? This million person gap. I think it's important to recognize that that that gap is not a a single type of person, a single type of skill, right? There's gaps across the entire

ecosystem. Um and that ecosystem spans from even just from Lamb's perspective, uh field service engineers who maintain the tools in the lab and in the fab um all the way to process engineers,

process developers, equipment engineers. Um and then if you expand out to the rest of the ecosystem, our customers, they will have demands in metrology engineers, they will have demands in

device engineers, simulation and reliability. So the the span of disciplines that make up that million person gap is very very broad. Okay. And so one of the things that we tend to

focus more on developing talent and a talent pipeline uh rather than just educating on individual skills and I think that's super important for the future of semiconductors in India that

we focus on broad talent. And I want to I actually want to touch a word that you said. I think you said it five different times in your response, professor. Use the word understand.

Okay. The understanding of what we're producing, the understanding of what our products are is so much more important than a singular skill to go do one thing.

Okay? And and so the semiverse program at IISC and as we've expanded out across the the country is more about teaching students what are we making, what are the devices, what is what is process

integration mean, what are we creating so that those students can go off into various different areas of the ecosystem. Are they ready for all of those jobs with one class? No, of course

not. They need they need the additional hands-on training. They need additional education those areas. But I would my recommendation I think the recommendation broadly based is focus on

talent rather than skill. Okay. Combining a broad understanding of the industry and what we're what we're trying to accomplish and what we're building. It's taken the the the

countries that have historically led this industry have been working at this for 50 to 70 years. We've developed that understanding and that broad swath of of knowledge over 50 to 70 years. if we're

going to do it here in two years, it's going to take a very different focus on how we develop the understanding of the of the industry. So that that's my expectation. But by doing that, we can

address all of those gaps sort of at the same time. Great. Great. Yeah. I mean, I think that the the the that the skill skilling is the sort of popular word here, but it may not be the right way to

think about this industry given what what you've discussed about the complexity uh of manufacturing and and the the disciplines that are needed. It really is a a commitment to a to a you

know a huge set of uh talent development um that again uh this collaboration with with um with IAS and and the academic world is so important. So what let me let's turn back to um to to um professor

Chanakar and then we're going to have a little of time for questions I hope at the end. Um what is IIS so I've talked about what is IS looking for the from the government what is looking for the

industry um as we enter uh particularly in ter thinkms of ISM 2.0 I know which I think is really important. We may not know all the details. Um and then are there areas where things can be improved

or streamlined and what are the challenges because this is as we know that now this is a complex process. Where do you see as the biggest challenges over the next 5 years?

&gt;&gt; Right. So uh from the industry some of the things that uh we already are actually in uh process of talking with industry in this regard which is um though uh he just mentioned right now

that uh you don't necessarily have to focus on one particular skill uh but still making the coursework tailored towards what is actually essential for uh some of the skills that are needed uh

is something that needs to happen. And uh so as an example um we recently started uh a course uh for uh just giving hands-on training to students uh sort of uh people working in labs on how

uh do pressure gauges work, how do uh you build uh PNID systems. Um those are the kinds of things that uh those are for example he just talked about uh how u you need to be able to maintain tools

uh and um that's the kind of training that we are in fact giving in our own uh courses as well uh in fact uh one of the rather interesting ways in which uh ISC is currently uh sort of

providing service uh to the industry is by uh just training our own u 50 odd employees who work in our fabs. Uh those actually are surprisingly in demand like are immensely in demand and it's very

hard for us to keep them in. Um so uh what we would like more from industry is uh maybe more um of this kind of handholding that so for example we uh talked with lamb and did this together

with them. uh this needs to actually sort of grow across and uh to some extent we can do it. Uh but I think LAM since you guys already are uh you know giving out this software to so many

other places maybe uh it would be easier to do the same elsewhere as well right and um that I I'm I'm sure that's something that's going to be of great use. Hey, just one comment I'll make is

um this is one of the few situations where like industry doesn't need to be convinced to be involved here. The if we don't fill that talent gap, we will fail. Like all of our business

objectives and our growth objectives for the next 10 years require the talent pipeline to be developed. So this is not something where uh you're trying to crack into industry or trying to

convince us to do something we don't want to do. We fail if this doesn't happen. &gt;&gt; Okay. And so I think it's like one of these examples where we have mutually

perfectly aligned objectives. &gt;&gt; And so we're trying I I've had meetings for the last two days with different ministers and different agencies here in India where we're trying to find the

ways we can be more involved. One way, I hope I'm not ruining any any surprise or anything. An idea that came up over the last couple days is faculty fellowships at these companies,

right? If we could take take the faculty and give them a job, if we can figure out a way to get that funded, give a faculty a job for six to nine months inside our companies in the industry and

really drive more industry relevant knowledge to the faculty to the universities. I think this is a brilliant idea and we're going to try to pursue this and this idea only comes

when we sit down at the table and we start talking what do the universities need? What do we need? What can we provide? How do we make this work? But this is nobody needs to convince us. We

we need this to happen. &gt;&gt; Right. Right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. along the same lines maybe uh more uh projects that uh these students do for PhD if they are aligned with not

just lamp actually all the the entire &gt;&gt; no no just lamb ju just lamb [laughter] just lamp &gt;&gt; yeah so I think that would really work out um and I think that that's kind of

important and um I truly believe that unless you do projects um along the lines of something like um which is aligned with industry it's not necessarily he did say that you did say

that talent matters but uh I think the fact that we have small time window actually means that we don't have as much time as for example uh so as an example I myself uh did my PhD uh in uh

you know MEMS and uh in industry when I joined Intel I was I started out uh with no knowledge of all the SPCs stuff uh no knowledge of uh you know how they do stuff on the floor and whatnot but I had

to learn it and I had enough time I had no problems uh this is not the case here they're going to have uh so for example u sure enough now one starter starts their fab uh they're going to uh quickly

find out how how hard it really is how quickly and how often you fail and how it's important to pick yourselves up and to move forward and sort of that sort of uh I think that's something that PhDs

for example have a lot in them sort of built into them because they fail and mostly just fail and then eventually succeed at some point. Uh and so I think that's another thing that probably needs

to happen at a bigger scale within India where PhDs uh more PhDs now also start looking into uh these kinds of jobs and uh just sort of having at least some bent towards them. So that would be a

&gt;&gt; Okay. And I think it's important that having the manufacturing having the fact that there's going to be fabs I mean Japan is going through a similar thing right where they for a long time they

they the you know they weren't doing lo advanced logic and now that's that's one of the reasons they attracted TSMC to come to to build a fab and now within the the academic sector there's a lot of

interest in hardware engineering because it it's a hard discipline but um at the end of the day uh if the if the country is building fabs uh and there's a need for for um for engineers then that makes

it makes it more attractive because it has to be uh you know so that's part of the whole ecosystem building. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I was just going to say I think I I joke around that I only want Lamb, you

know, to benefit from this, right? But I I think we're seeing other companies in the industry follow us. I obviously Lamb is leading this effort. Obviously Lamb is um benefiting from this already,

right? We're already seeing the talent pipeline develop. We're scaling the team in Bangalore. We're already getting the benefits from this. And so because of that our competitors but also our

partner companies have started doing the same and so I think we are seeing um you know I can say ASML they're not a competitor they're a very good partner we work with them very closely that

we're see them we see them following suit they're jumping in and trying to do some of the same things that we're doing here in India because again their business objectives are reliant on

closing that talent gap so I do think we're seeing I'm very very proud of Lamb I'm very proud that we're leading this that we're out in front, but I'm also very proud to see the rest of the

industry jumping in, copying what we're doing. Um, because we all need it to &gt;&gt; Great. Do we want to take a couple questions from the audience? &gt;&gt; Okay. Wow, we got a lot of them. Okay,

let's let's go over here. &gt;&gt; Yeah, we need a mic here. Sorry. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much, chairman. I'm Arish Kumar from CSTV you know access to energy systems question

he have a very good startup in the semiconductor industries in India so the question is how to make a skilling skilling India energizing India is skilling India and the two question

how to make the lamp research make a skilling activity like in baffer development ment wafer in solar technology. The solar cells and solar module came from the wafers. So there is

no unit of any kind in India on wafer development. So there is any program on wafer development of the solar manufacturing, solar cell manufacturing and mam marketing in India not import

anything. &gt;&gt; I don't know if you want to take that. Do you want to take the question? You want to lead? Go ahead and lead off. So I I um I I can actually answer uh to

some extent uh when I'll let him uh take over from there. Uh actually there are efforts going on in India for uh in fact poly crystallin uh silicon growth uh for wafers uh and that's something that is

coming up. I won't reveal uh because I don't know exactly if they want to reveal yet but it's a big company uh they'll be bringing bringing it in. So it's happening uh it's it's going to

because of the skill development India have a huge 40% in India questioning skilling in India solar technology &gt;&gt; as he just said right

&gt;&gt; marketing &gt;&gt; sure &gt;&gt; yeah and I think I mean um one thing I would say is like leveraging the connection between industry academia the

government it's been incredibly fruitful it's been it's also just been frank pleasant. It it's been such a joy to work together between the government, the academia and our industry. And I

think um whether I think solar should follow a similar model, right? Where where there's business opportunity, where there's an educational opportunity, where there is an incentive

to be successful as a country. We put those pieces together and and wonderful things can happen. I and I I cannot express how wonderful how enjoyable this experience has been in India because the

faculty we've worked with at IASC and the other schools are such consumate professionals are are are so invested in this vision of the future and the government is

backing it. So I would I would urge sort you know copycat this model of putting the three pieces together and wonderful things can happen because the demand is here the supply is here and the and the

commitment to the vision is here. &gt;&gt; Okay. One one question right there. &gt;&gt; May I? This feels very palpably like a Y2K

moment where the demand is there and you know you have this great opportunity. If somebody was listening to this and they have a a a young person in the family and they're looking to pivot um what in

a flowchart what is the first thing that the young person needs to do to get into this market? I mean as a a young person I would constant problem solving critical thinking right um whether they

want to be building Legos or or doing coding exercises on some critical thinking problem solving right and then some specialization will occur naturally later but um what I would urge against

and it goes back to some of my messages before is focusing exclusively on a specific skill because this is the path to success and Just look at what's happening with our previous focus on

coding. Okay, everybody said coding is our way to the to the future. Coding is the way to success. And now AI is writing all the code. So I would I would stress like avoid the urge to focus on a

very single skill, a single solution. And I would focus on a broad-based understanding. um problem solving, critical thinking, physics, chemistry, material science, the broad hard

physical sciences lead to these disciplines across the ecosystem. Um now I say this as a father of two who has failed miserably to get his daughters into STEM. Um but I I but I tried I

tried really really hard and I think that's that's where the kids that's where the talent is going to come from by by thinking broadly by thinking about critical thinking critically and

thinking about problem solving rather than picking one skill to get very good at. &gt;&gt; I got my daughter into chemical engineering stuff.

&gt;&gt; Just [clears throat] a minute sir I I have one intervention directly to you David listening to you with wrapped attention. &gt;&gt; Excuse me. I would come to know that

about the talent. I was a student of English literature of Cal University 30 years ago. There is a very famous essay by TS Elliott where he mentioned about tradition and individual talent. It is a

talent pool which matters a lot. I have a specific question with respect to optimization which you mentioned about that semiconductor is AI AI semiconductor and its optimization

policy and it says that could just please just highlight as as as much as possible. &gt;&gt; All right. Well, that will be our last question. So,

&gt;&gt; oh, so the interesting thing I think again optimization and some of these technologies have to be really discipline focused. And so when we're doing R&amp;D, we're in a small data

environment. We don't have a lot of data. Optimization isn't isn't very helpful. When we're in manufacturing, we have lots of data. Optimization is extremely helpful. And so we're

developing machine learning and AI techniques, but you have to bring the right tool to the job. optimization in a small data R&amp;D mode isn't always super helpful very very helpful in a big data

manufacturing mode so I think we really have to focus on the discipline &gt;&gt; all right well with that we have to call it an end because uh we have exceeded the time allotted to us there are other

people waiting to use this room so thank you very much David thank you Paul for hosting thank you very much professor Tander [applause] appreciate it

&gt;&gt; excuse me please wait for a Let's come up. Come over here for a photo, please.
