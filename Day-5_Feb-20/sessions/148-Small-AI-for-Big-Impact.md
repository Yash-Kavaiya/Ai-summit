Handing it over to you. Yes. Thank you everyone for coming. Um requesting those at the back if you could close the door so that we can reduce the noise a little bit. We can't.

Okay. &gt;&gt; It's full. &gt;&gt; It's full. Okay. Okay. Great. Well, if you could just uh calm down a bit and settle down. Uh thank you. Uh

uh welcome to all our esteemed panelists and uh our panel the topic of our panel as you know is on small AI for big social impact. Um like to deeply thank our panelists for making it all the way

for the summit uh and uh making it to this panel. So uh what do we mean uh by small AI? I think different people have different definitions and we're sort of open to uh

how each panelist chooses to interpret uh small AI. When we at Wadwani AI brainstormed about this panel, uh we thought it would reflect u in some ways the ethos of our own work. Uh making

models that are data efficient, that are cheap to run, that sit on the edge and most importantly are meaningful to the communities that we serve, which are underserved communities mostly in rural

India. But it's increasingly clear that small AI means a lot more. And I see a lot of uh people talking about small AI in this summit. Um more generally, I think it encapsulates any AI that

meaningfully impacts individuals while taking into account and respecting their very local context [snorts] and uh rather than providing generic outputs. So any anything like that could rightly

be called small AI. And we're going to hear uh from our panelists about their experiences with AI models like that. So with that small introduction uh let's now avoid further ado and speak to our

panelists. &gt;&gt; So uh can you hear me at the back? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay. Um so we can start. Uh I have a common question for uh every panelist. Each of you represents a

different and important aspect of AI work that's happening outside of the mainstream excitement that focuses on large foundation models for a primarily global north audience. Can you tell us

briefly about your organization's work and perhaps your thoughts on nonfoundation AI models in general? Maybe we can start uh with Zamir. &gt;&gt; Sure. Thanks. Thanks, Alan. Um, thanks

Ben. Um, you I think we we really see the opportunity for AI to reduce inequality. And our starting point with AI tools is really does this work for whom where and

at what scale. So those are you know some of the departing points for us and so really looking beyond the model of a against a benchmark but how is this going to work

in a district hospital in Telangana or a small holder farmer in Zambia or a classroom in rural Sagal and you know part of what we've in some ways got caught up with is

the the performance of the model on its own and we've forgotten how does this fit into the lives and the context that it operates in. Um and in doing so you know part of what we need to think about

is who's designing the model and what's it designed for. Uh and I was thinking about the traffic that we've been experiencing the last few days in Delhi

and I thought to myself would anyone given the traffic here design something so big as an aeroplane to try and get across the city? No. Yeah.

I I think we would design something that's a lot smaller, faster, sharper, cost effective, and gets us from point A to point B without

uh a firstass Airbus uh on our roads. &gt;&gt; I think that's a great analogy. &gt;&gt; Aisha, can you tell us a bit about your work at Google Africa? &gt;&gt; Yes. Uh thank you. So, um I lead our

Google research Africa team. Uh we have two sites, one in Ghana and one in Kenya. So representing east and west. Um but the work that we do is essentially from Africa for Africa and the world.

Much of our work is uh is scaling from the uniqueness of the continent. Turns out that a lot of the challenges are similar definitely across the global south and and generally uh worldwide. Uh

our work So, kind of leaning into the the the next part of your question, uh, and thinking about how we approach this type of work, it's very much [snorts] in line. It's very much problem first. I

always say if there's a red button that you can press and it's a one or zero, just build the red button. We don't need to bring AI or technology. So, it's really important uh to be very

thoughtful about the type of problem. uh coming from Google research, we want to leverage uh our compute, our AI expertise and capabilities and then our mandate which is the societal impact at

scale to think about the types of problems that we work on. Uh I'll give two good examples of those problems. One is around weather now casting uh which we launched uh last year uh across the

continent of Africa. So to have much more accurate weather forecast is absolutely essential given that much of the continent and as well as in India uh rely on agriculture for labor right and

we are brainfed primarily 95% in in Africa so having much more accurate weather forecast is essential in that uh in that case and at the same time on the technical challenges side uh we know in

uh North America and in Europe Europe there's about uh about 300 or so uh weather radar stations and in Africa there's only 37 I believe you know you can fit both North America and Europe in

Africa so when you think about that you have to innovate um and so those constraints of the environment that you were alluding to in the intro are part of the motivation of having a research

team in the continent And so that was one way that we innovated and made solutions that were available to the continent. And then the other one is a complimementaryary site which is uh

working with the ecosystem working with partners in Africa including um Macerrera University digital um around African languages and we just released a data set of 21 now 27 voice uh languages

uh um given that Africa has 2,000 or so languages this is the start most Most importantly is it's partnershipled and driven and this is because it's voice it is about accessibility and about

reaching those rural villages as well. So and enabling the ecosystem to build the solutions from there whether they're smaller models or larger models. So making that type of data open and

available is another way that we are leveraging this notion of smaller AI. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Great insight. Amir, can you tell us about your work at Microsoft? &gt;&gt; Yeah, thank you.

&gt;&gt; Sorry, &gt;&gt; thank you for the invitation and it's a great pleasure to be here today. So, uh first uh what is AI for good? AI for good lab is the philanthropic research

arm of Microsoft. Uh we are employing um advanced AI technology to solve real world problem with u real societal impact. This is very important and how uh our team and researcher work. We

closely collaborate with NOS's, governments, non uh nonprofit organization and local communities uh around the world and together we are building IIA solutions on multiple

domains. We uh are interested about agriculture, food security, um healthcare, education, culture and uh so on. So this is about a for good lab at Microsoft. Now I am scientist. So I

would like to give you uh two concrete examples where we use uh small AI and also there are two global solution to tackle global challenges. So they are uh valid for both uh they are valid for

both global north and global south south. So the first project uh in biodiversity it's called sparrow. Sparrow for solar powered acostic and remote recording observation. It is an

AI powered uh open source solution designed to track and monitor biodiversity uh in the most remote and hard to reach region in the world. So uh Sparrow is u

camera tracks uh with h aa model that enable to detect uh animal species and this observation are then transmitted uh using a wireless connectivity and satellite uh where we don't have

infrastructures to transmit this information and this parro solution is already uh deployed around the world in many countries I can site Colombia Peru United states, Tanzania and it's easily

enable uh practitionist and researcher to understand species present and ecosystem changes to at scale supporting more timely and uh informed decision to protect biodiversity.

The second project uh focuses on uh wildfires. As you know uh wildfires becomes real fleet, global fleet with devastitating impacting lives, communities and ecosystems

and even uh economies and around the world. Fire wires are increasingly increasingly in both frequency and intensity making early detection and rapid responses uh uh responses uh more

critical than never. So through alert California we are addressing this uh this uh this challenge using AI. So what is alert California? Alerts California is the network of 1,300 cameras

operating 24/7 and we are developing AI tools that runs on the top of this infrastructure enabling to detect early fire and this

will enable uh emergency responder to act quickly and stop fires before it spread. So uh Sparrow and Alert California as I said they are two uh global solution for global problems that

can be deployed anywhere around the world and we are providing them open source uh that anyone can uh can embrace them and deploy them. &gt;&gt; Thank you Wes

Antoan. I think you're the only member of this group that doesn't work in the global south. So if you tell us a bit about the work at Parisante and how you're using maybe non-foundation

models. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Well, thank you Alpen for this invitation. I'm happy to be the outsider of the panel. Um I'm working actually in

healthcare and uh I'm leading a a new kind of innovation ecosystem for healthcare where we gather um researchers um doctors patients uh startups and industrial together as well

as institutions. Uh so the idea is to really create a whole community of innovation and engage into the use of uh data uh and uh artificial intelligence and healthcare is probably one of the

field where AI has a long-standing history and uh the world has discovered AI with the rise of Gen AI but there were number of small AI models uh um designed for a long time and this is why

we already have a number of validated tools that we can use in healthcare answering the question not only does it work but is it reliable which is very important for our patients u so before

we have uh the proof of efficiency of LLM in uh the medical field which is not uh fully clear yet uh we use machine learning tools which are actually small AI models uh in very specific areas uh

what actually works really nice uh today is the uh image analysis so pattern analysis. So you can think of radiology for example, chest X-ray or fractures in the emergency room are fully analyzed by

um small AI models and small AI tools that are easily deployable on small computers. Uh you can also think of picture analysis and dermatology of thermology etc. So these are very

concrete example of already validated small AI models in healthcare that are used on a daily basis at least in France and uh Europe. Um we'll get back in the discussions on how we need data efficacy

on this topic but it's really important to understand that these models are already deployable uh and some of them can can actually work offline uh which is really important in some

environments. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Elango from a World Bank perspective, what is your view on these types of models?

&gt;&gt; Thank you very much for the opportunity to be here. Coming right at the end, I don't know what new things I can say, but to basically reinforce the messages that have been said for us at the World

Bank, uh we see AI as a means to an end. And very much our AI agenda is shaped by the mission of the World Bank, which is to uh reduce poverty and grow prosperity in the world. And when you take that

lens and you apply it, we have to keep it simple. Not all countries uh have the ability to have the compute power, the electricity, the talent and the data. So therefore, taking on tested small AI

applications to scale and replicating them around the world is something that we see as a mission priority. So in that respect, what Wadwani AI is doing here is pioneering and what I've heard this

morning from Dr. Sunil Badwani himself about what you're doing in TV, what you're doing in out of school children. This is all tremendous and it has great potential for replication and often what

happens is we focus a lot on pilots and then what happens the pilots generally tend to kind of once the machine wears off people forget the pilot. I think what we need to do is and what we're

doing at the World Bank is to see those pilots whether it's in health, education or agriculture on the small AI setting. It works in rural communities where offline

uh where data is not that rich talent is not readily available and it can also not require a lot of electricity. It's plug uh plug and play. Then how do we get the right KPIs which then allows us

to go from a village of community of 50 villages to a larger population center and to see how best we can help them say in agriculture to improve uh productivity through better inputs as we

are now working in UP uh with partnership with Google and we're doing the same thing in Maharashtra uh household income uh the inputs get better and to see how they can the

markets and agriculture credit similar in health and education we've seen great practices that we seeing in Africa in Ghana in Kenya so how do we take these models and replicate it so like to

assure everybody and this is something people think small AI is inferior no it's not secondass no small AI can solve problems it means to an end and if it can actually fasttrack development

outcomes you know we've known the problems with Millennium Development Goals. We've known the problems with sustain uh sustainable development goals and many countries are lagging behind

and this is an opportunity where this development technology if it can be put to use in the right context in the right way I think we can achieve faster development outcomes.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. That's really interesting. Aisha, I'm going to come back to you and ask you more specifically, how does the work that Google research uh does in Africa impact rural communities

specifically? How how does one bring the benefits of technologies like uh these big foundation models to devices that may only have patchy internet and supply very little data?

&gt;&gt; Yeah, thanks. That was a loaded question, huh? two two parts there. Uhhuh. Um so so I think so first and foremost um in general uh just approaching these

challenges with with humility and and and relating. So I always start with you know I I'm I'm a scientist but I'm also a mother right and that's a thread that binds so many of us. When you think of

that, you also think a lot of the solutions that we're building, it's not for them, it's for us. I'm using the same health systems that you all are developing interesting tools and models

for um you know, and we have many of the challenges around weather as well. Um so so I think the first thing is uh is to kind of have that base human layer uh as we think about our work and to connect

with those communities whether they're rural or urban right um a lot of the work that we do uh we're looking at you know these large populations that you know if if you if you think about

agriculture for example where it has a large part of the labor force you know there's many ways that this is uh you know people are part of that value chain whether they're actually doing the

growing or providing the inputs and or making those decisions and the risks along the way. So that relationship of getting out in the community is a very important part of work uh that we do is

to connect with those um and then really think about you know kind of coming home as as Google research you know where is our unique value proposition we're not necessarily going to solve this full

problem alone usually it requires behavior change policy and many pieces of the puzzle how do we best fit our role and we do this in cocreation with partnerships

So that's kind of the the second layer of fabric on on how we reach these rural communities. And then on the other side of &gt;&gt; Sorry, do you have an example of that?

&gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Yeah. Abs. Absolutely. So if you think about uh okay, I'll do two ways. So um for example, the the languages work that I was talking about Wahal and Wahal is a word. It's a

synagogue word that it's wool of that means to speak. And the way we wanted to create this is it's not from from from us it's it's for the community. So if you have partners who are across the

continent, let them uh be a part of the process of collecting the data of of understanding their language and their local context to get these high quality data sets. Um and so I think being

partnership driven and knowing our role in our place was what was very successful for that. Um, and then the last point I'll just say on the second question that you threw in there is

really our open models, our openw weight models, Jimma, um, are made for a lot of these solutions that are, um, more closer to the edge. Um, so we have nano models that can run on your laptop and

tablets and so forth and we take advantage of of those new new technologies for our communities. &gt;&gt; Do you actually use them in in Africa? &gt;&gt; Oh, yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.

&gt;&gt; Great. Um, uh, Zamir, the next question is for you. Uh, much of your work at the foundation is about reducing inequities through promoting safe and responsible use of

AI. So, what role in your view do small and custom AI models have to play in this? And if you can provide examples, that would be great. &gt;&gt; Yeah, sure. Open. Um, you know, I think

I think I do want to just touch a little bit on the issue of reliability uh because my colleague over here, you know, spoke about it and I think it's I think it's a critical issue. Um, I'm

sorry if I'm going to repeat this example from one of my previous panels, but I asked the audience Alan because I'm going to be on a plane later, so it's a bad idea, but I asked

the audience anyway. If I said to you the plane has a high probability of leaving Delhi and landing safely wherever that's going to be

and that probability was 95%. Would you get on that plane? 99%. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; No. I did have one guy that he kind of

thought about it and he said no. And and the point there is that I do think we got to work towards models that have zero error, right? Um so much so that I I think that we are

trying to wrap our heads around is there a concept of verifiable AI where it's it it shifts the narrative from a black box to a glass box. It actually exposes the logic. So for a

particular set of inputs you can follow the logic chain and it gives you a set of outputs that you can really track you can audit you can see that it's repeatable um and you can prevent some

of the kind of fundamental errors uh that we start to see um I think you know in the and I want to go back to a very real example uh Alpine because when I think about

small models I'm coming back to the user the community healthcare worker that tried to help a mother. &gt;&gt; And we have one of our grantees who shared this very personal story of a

first time mother who presented she was 6 months pregnant and she said her hands and her feet started to get swollen and the community healthcare worker looked and said, "You're pregnant. This is

normal." weeks later she started having a headache and blur vision. I think colleagues will know where the

story goes. Unfortunately, that mother had severe gestational protein uric hypertension. It was missed and the mother and the baby didn't make it. But in that moment, what inspired

our grantee was if the community healthcare worker had a small model that worked on her device, which was a low kind of cost smartphone, still had patchy internet,

but was just built small enough to help it to make good decisions at that point of care, we actually would be sitting with a very different outcome today. And so I think small models present us those

kinds of opportunities. Very interesting. Very good points. Um was you spoke about you know in a general sense about the research done at the AI

for good lab at Microsoft. Again are there specific examples from your work where you see the benefits of building domain specific models to realize impact and are there research lessons that we

can take away from this? I think it would be good for the audience and us to understand what are the sort of research research directions of the future that can come out of this work.

&gt;&gt; Yes. I would like to start with a report that Microsoft has released recently about AI diffusions. And this report showed clearly that there is a gap in the AI diffusion between global north

and global south. But more importantly, they highlighted three pillars that can accelerate the AI diffusion in the global south. And these three pillars are access to electricity, access to

connectivity and access to AI tools in the local languages. And we have been working on this third pillar which is access to AI on uh local languages. And we have released recently uh research

works called be all bring your own language model into LLM. So this paper uh provide uh the best recipes and practices to uh select the best existing open weights LLM and we have been

focusing on small uh foundation models from 4 billion to 15 billion and once we select the best LLM for one target language we um do all these recipes to boost the performance for these low

resource languages. But I wanted to get back to all the challenges we are facing for these low resource languages. So when we train these foundation models uh we train them on internet data and

internet data represented by more than 60% is English uh and followed by some high resource languages like French, Mandarian, uh Portuguese etc. So this low resource languages even if they

represent more than 7,000 languages they represent only a tiny portion of internet data. This is the first challenge and the second one is the benchmarks. uh when we build LLM we

benchmarks them we evaluate the performance on benchmarks and we have seen like there are only uh at least one benchmarks for only 300 languages so we can see like more than 6,000 or 7,000

they don't have even one benchmarks and in even in these 300 benchmarks most of them are just translation from English to this low resource language so they have nothing to do with the culture and

the context of this uh languages And um the third challenge is uh the performance gap. Of course there is a performance gap between uh for this LLM even the frontier models between high

resource and low resource languages. And the fourth one is safety. So when we build LLM usually we do some safety alignments with the enforcement learning but this safety are mainly done in

English and some of higher resource languages. Now when we build LLM for LUS languages, it becomes very strong for this LUS languages. It rises some other issues with safety. So we have to

evaluate this LLMs for safety on this language and do all these alignments reinforcement learning in the target language also. So in this P we addressed some of these challenges and um

one we have been targeting three uh pilot uh languages which are initute spoken in north of Canada indigenous language. Chichia in Malawi in Africa and Maui in New Zealand. Why we have

selected these three languages? Just because we have access to local community to help us to get data. So we gathered data uh from this community. Then we we used some continual

pre-training and selection fine tuning to boost the performance of open weights LLM and we were able to gain 12% uh gain closing the gap with English. Uh so now what's uh next next steps

actually we are trying to expand this to more languages. We have some collaboration for example in North America with Paraguay to develop LLM for Gorani and we want to extend this to uh

other languages. Uh but most importantly we have uh launched um uh an initiative called Langu Europe to fund uh data collection in Europe for 10 lower languages in Europe. It was released in

last September. It was very successful. We have received many application and 10 have been selected and now we will start working with them and it was that successful that now we are extending

this initiative uh to Africa through lingua Africa. It has been announced just today in in the AI summit and we will be allocating five and a half million to support data collection uh

for African languages and this is in partnership with uh Gates Foundation and Microsoft air for good and uh FCDU and uh this uh initiative will be led by Masakani

uh African languages hub. So sorry just to follow up. So for people who are working on these small language models or domain specific language models even you know say for

healthcare domain or some other domain are there you know um strategies that they should pursue that you can recommend. &gt;&gt; Yeah this is very important and u this

is also related to the call for lingua Africa because many effort have been done in the past to colle to collect general proposed data. Now we have enough I think general purpose data but

when we evaluate this uh the performance of this AI tools for uh application specific for example healthcare, education, agriculture they don't work as we want as expected. So what we want

today is uh rather than instead of focusing on general data collection, we will be focusing on uh uh domain specific application specific use case specific data collections and building

AI tools for specific domains at least for this uh all relability issues. uh we will have a model that performs good in that target low resource language in that application that we can deploy uh

and we can be used by local communities. This is really a priority uh for the next steps. Let me come to you. You have vast experience in international development.

Can you give us a view of the future as it relates to using AI for developmental goals? Um do you think AI will have meaningful role to play in transition of emerging economies to advanced

economies. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So I do think the prospects are good and uh our northstar is job creation and so we need to support countries that AI doesn't automate jobs

away but AI actually supports the creation and enhancement of jobs and this is where small AI becomes imperative unlike the foundation models uh which

will have implications. So the second is how are we going to go about it and in some sense whether it's large language models or small AI solutions you need an ecosystem

and that ecosystem needs to be powered by the local private sector and often what we see even now whether the AI revolution is before us or not small enterprises uh whether in the

theme space or in the larger space struggle for a variety of reasons and if the countries don't reform uh business processes make it easier for permitting

which AI can do you're going to see that AI actually is not going to play effective role so there are some fundamental reforms and this is where some of the foundational investment in

DPI the digital public infrastructure needs to happen to create that ecosystem and the ability for the ecosystem to then work with the private sector, local communities to be able to create those

jobs and this is what we are seeing everywhere. If that happens and here too you see this whole vibrancy around the startup ecosystem is why because everyone the young people see

opportunities and this momentum can drive everywhere in the world whether it be in India whether it be rest of South Asia or Africa or Latin America or even in the Pacific region. So how do you go

about it? And what we did was we joined hands with number of multilateral development banks and last couple of days we launched this small AI uh use case report repository. It's about 100

cases. It explains in health, education and agriculture and job creation how AI can be leveraged to the maximum advantage of communities both in terms of service delivery, productivity gains,

household income gains. All this eventually leads to better jobs, better employment and better income prospects. So we are very much upbeat about small AI. But I do take the point about

community trust. If one it once it fails the community is not going to believe it. So it's very important that whatever we put in place work with the others partners including whether it be MDB or

Microsoft Google Gates and everyone we have to ensure that whatever we leave behind in small communities is something trustworthy reliable and it doesn't end of the day hallucinate and gives them

something that the farmer struggles and ends up with other challenges. &gt;&gt; Thank you. So this report you mentioned is it open access? on the world bank we are hosting it it's

called AI repository just type and you'll be able to access it it's got 100 and we'll continue to update this and uh once we able to sort out some legal issues then we'll also allow anyone to

submit their use case repository obviously into the repository obviously will go through a filtering process to ensure that the right ones are there &gt;&gt; great thank you

Antoan coming to you um you head an organization uses AI to advance health outcomes through research and commercialization. Um are data efficient and hardware

integrated AI models important for the work that's happening at Parisante and do you see these models as sort of potentially being deployed in low and middle inome countries like India?

&gt;&gt; Yes. Well, so clearly they are very important uh for us um for different reasons. Um, of course, we'll get back to the the scalability and the uh the use in low and middle income countries,

but at first uh what is the reality in healthcare uh is that data is scarce and siloed and so you need to work on what you have actually. Uh so sometimes it's large set of data uh sometimes it's very

small set of data but you need to have tools that allow you to build uh relevant algorithm and relevant analyszis on small data set and in the meantime of course we're building larger

data sets. uh so uh sometimes it's at a level of one department in one hospital sometimes it's one hospital sometimes it's a group of hospital at the end what we are reaching out uh uh in Europe is

the constitution of a large European health data space 450 million citizens joining their health data in digital public infrastructured organized in 27 country which will be a

world premiere um but in the meantime we need to work on that uh reality of scar uh data. Second thing is that not only data is uh uh limited but also when you want to enter the new revolution in

medicine which is what we call precision medicine, personalized medicine, you need to work on very efficient algorithm because they need to adapt to one person and not only uh to a whole population.

So you need also to get that into account in building the uh the algorithm. The last thing is um that you also have to work with what is is existing in the healthcare systems uh

which is sometimes uh not supercomputers or high calculation power that exists in servers uh remotely but uh when you're in room of a patient or working with uh in the hospitals it's very simple

computer and you need to have efficient uh algorithm and tools uh that you can uh uh have running on that kind of computers. Uh and so of course you go all the way to a smartphone at some

point if you go in into a remote areas. So this is why we actually work on this kind of uh approach making sure that of course we have research on LLM's and large computing power. Uh but we also

have this work on small data very efficient algorithm. &gt;&gt; Can you give examples? Well, yes. I mean I I already gave some examples about radiology. Uh we are able to have a

radology algorithm running on small computer uh machine. And getting back to your example which I think is really important. It it provides me the uh the opportunity to um put point out two very

important facts. One is that the u AI that we use is providing information. It's not making decision in healthcare. So of course we target high level of reliability but at the end it's a human

decision uh and that's this is very important I think. Second one is that we've been trying to compare the the performance of algorithm that we've been designing with the existing performance

uh and of course you're reaching to 99.999% etc. But what very few actual people actually know is that the actual performance of what we do at the moment

is not 99.99999%. So most of the time and I won't say the numbers uh but most of the times it's actually better than what we have and and this is really important in your

example uh is it good enough uh compared to what we can actually do at the moment and I think it's particularly important in low and middle income countries because very simple solution offline

etc can solve many many uh issues. Albin can I pick up quickly? I think it's I think it's really important and actually I'm going to name the number if it's okay.

&gt;&gt; So a really important World Bank study um from few years back showed that on a set of five very simple conditions the diagnostic accuracy was 50% across eight countries.

&gt;&gt; 50%. &gt;&gt; What illnesses are we talking about? acute diarrhea, uh, upper respiratory tract infection, uh, maternal hypertension.

And the point about that is I don't think any of us would be happy to with 50%, the equivalent of tossing a coin and saying that's okay, right? Um, and so I I completely understand that today

there's a big gap between what the models can offer. Uh, and I think I think I think the the question about are the models performing better than the

average clinician that's done. So I'm sorry I can't resist a follow-up question. [laughter] So often you find that average accuracy of models is far better. Um but models

seem to fail more unpredictably than humans. At least that's sort of an the understanding in healthcare. Do you agree with that or do you think that's not true? Anyone who wants to answer

this. &gt;&gt; Well, so I think we need another hour to discuss this because so what you say is absolutely true but then you need to look at every pathology or every

symptoms that you're looking because the performance of diagnostic can be a little bit higher in certain uh places in certain situations a little bit lower etc. uh but we get to the right to the

same point which is what we are building uh is actually better than what we are able to do at the moment and what we show in the scientific literature is that actually the combination between

algorithm and natural intelligence I would say the doctor is actually the best uh the best tool so far uh so the question getting back to your question how do we deploy this in low and middle

income uh countries I think it's uh it's really important um we need to have a model that are able to run on uh small devices uh that are able to run offline and sometimes it's a very limited set of

uh data very limited set of algorithm uh but if you we were actually discussing in Paris about examples of remote LLM u providing answer on the 10 most important questions for healthcare in

low and middle income countries that doesn't need uh uh LLM's uh online with super calculation power. So that's uh one first uh point edge native AI. Uh we also need to have

uh data efficient learning systems uh because most of the time in low and middle inome countries uh we have limited amount of data available. So this is what I discussed uh uh earlier.

&gt;&gt; We have a lot of data in India but it's very tends to be noisy. &gt;&gt; Yes. we need to get the time to actually get them together, clean them and get them prepared for a for a robust

analysis. So I'm I know you are leaprogging and going very fast but by the time you will scale this will create real power of analysis. Um and then uh we need also to understand how we can

couple uh hardware with uh software and algorithm to design reduce cost so that they can uh very uh uh easily scale. &gt;&gt; Great. There's fantastic insights. I'd actually like to give some time to the

audience to uh ask questions to our panelists. So yes, please. Yes. Thank you very much. I'm Arish Kumar from the CSC innovation center on solar energy particle invest

question to world bank president very thanks to the word bank in in Rajasthan 60% population rural areas and totally based on the agricultural domain

40% population in the youth how our banking increase the capacity of AI application to the youth as well as agricultural domain. So the economics changes more

productivity more economy more inclusion in climate change and renewable energy domain. &gt;&gt; Thank you for that uh question which I

think is a very foundational question to ask any policy maker in terms of what kind of an AI strategy or implementation you want to have at any geography in the world. So obviously the first thing is

you need digital literacy. Second you need to scale up so that everybody is upskilled and reskilled on AI related capabilities. Third is improving the STEM capability in uh schools and

universities. So you do create a few cater of people who can work on these topics. And then the the top uh the sectors you mentioned which are priorities agriculture, health and

education. Obviously this is where we see the greatest potential for uh small AI but on particularly on Rajasthan I have right now I don't have any information but I'm happy to share that

with you but certainly we are working across different states in India like we're doing elsewhere in the world and we do prioritize literacies

skilling STEM and applications in priority sectors like agriculture health and education but having said that I also want to say one point I mean just to respond to devices that can do

computing devices are expensive for the bottom 40%. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; How do weify the advantage? &gt;&gt; Hi. Um, my name is Selena. I'm the CEO

and co-founder of Zindi. Uh, we run competitions to develop models especially in Africa. And I actually had a question for Wasim um about kind of the technical

implications, the size implications, the practicality of using open-source openw weight models, you know, large language models to train very specific domain specific, you know, language, you know,

underresourced language models. How have you seen that play out? Yeah, I think um uh what we have seen like um the selection of the base model is very important because uh what is

true what is uh real that we cannot train from scratch in LLM even if small or large language model we cannot train it for uh from scratch for lower level languages because we don't have this 15

trillion tokens to train so it is very important to select uh the best multilingual model uh that has the right tokenizer that can be adapted to manyus languages. This is very important and

then get the the data that we need. Uh and what we have seen also uh monilingual data helps but also bilingual data can helps and also translating English into this lower

resource English into this lower resource language can also help to boost the performance. So in our paper we are providing all these recipes to follow to get the best boost in terms of

performance. What I would like to add also like with all these leus languages we have uh text cannot solve them all like many of these languages will be solved by speech is very important like

ISR model speech to text text to speech will uh build a uh a very large role into unlocking all these lower resource languages in addition to LLM that can operate into the lower resource language

or in English. I think we have time for one question. &gt;&gt; Hi, this is Dr. Ravi Singh. I'm from Miami. Um, and uh, it was a great panel. So, a lot of great insights. It's for

Google, Microsoft, and the World Bank. Here's the scenario. If there's compliance across all of these platforms, which platform will win the AI wars? [laughter]

[snorts] That's a loaded question. &gt;&gt; Anyone want to answer? &gt;&gt; I'm not. So, so first of all, I think first healthy competition is how we've

been able to uh develop incredible technologies just over time. So, the the competition is healthy and this is great. Um I don't see it as a zero- sum game. There's too many people on the

planet and there's too many challenging unique problems that need to be solved. So if we're making it useful and and bringing joy and happiness for all that's in the I just love it that's in

the uh the theme year then it's not necessarily going to be who wins whatever platform. It's what is relevant to the context of the enduser. So taking it back to a more like human personal

perspective. That's my my thing. &gt;&gt; I think three billion people are offline. So there is space for everybody to compete. Second uh in health sector alone three

and a half billion people don't have access to health care. So there is enough scope for all kinds of applications. Just I want to add uh many people have

been asked me to if this all efforts we are doing for languages if it is enough to make this model as good as English. I will say maybe not but uh without all this efforts we will not never reach

this objective. So we have all this collective efforts will get us to this objective. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Thank you so much everyone. Uh I'll now

like to invite Niha but associate director human resources to just hand out the momentos to all our speakers and we'll just take one group photo please

requesting the speakers to just take one group photo please. [applause] Thank you so much everyone. &gt;&gt; Thank you everyone for joining.
