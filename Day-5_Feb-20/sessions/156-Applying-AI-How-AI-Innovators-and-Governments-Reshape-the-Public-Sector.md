## 📝 Transcript

the AI safety connect series of events that we've been running for the past uh four days now. Yep. You want to sit? &gt;&gt; Excuse me. Hello.

&gt;&gt; Uh sir, who's everybody here? patience. And uh let's welcome Mr. Adit. So it's been &gt;&gt; you repeat that to me

by the ministry initiative on some priority for Mr. I cannot do that now. I cannot do that. Bring the minister here right now. Otherwise, you'll not

&gt;&gt; I know we cannot change. &gt;&gt; Let the session get started. Let the session get over. Does that work? Because they've started. One more.

&gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Good afternoon, your excellencies, distinguished panelists and guests. Thank you for being here with us at Batmanipam. I'm Sares and I'm here with

my co-founder of AI Safety Connect, Nicolola. &gt;&gt; Wait, wait. All right. Why is it that a safety connect is convening you today and why is it that we exist? Well, it's

clear to I think most of us now that the race towards artificial gener intelligence is no longer a theoretical pursuit as billions and maybe trillions now of

of dollars are getting deployed uh to push the frontier of artificial intelligence. the technology is now advancing rapidly and safety is not keeping pace with it.

There are wonderful opportunities on the other side of this quest. There are also big risks and so that's the purpose. That's the reason AI safety connect was founded.

AI safety connectet is there to help shape the frontier AI safety and secure agenda to towards what I would frame as common sensical AI risk management. AI safety connects has been founded to

encourage global majority engagement into frontier AI safety and AI safety connects has been connected to showcase concrete governance coordination

mechanisms, tools and solutions. &gt;&gt; So how we do this, we convene at each AI summit. Um so last year we started in Paris, this year in India, next year we're going to be in Switzerland. But we

also convene at the UN General Assembly, right? We need a faster tempo for this safety discussion. So every six months we have this global convening. We also do capacity building and we also do

trust building exercises at time behind closed doors. Well, this week in New Delhi has been a an intense one, uh an impactful one. Um on Tuesday we had a full day of uh uh

panels, conference, solution demonstrations and closed dooror workshop uh discussions on some specific um nuts to crack to advance AI safety. We for example had the privilege of

hosting Prime Minister Dick Shu from the Netherlands on stage to deliver um a special address on the role of top leadership in advancing AI safety. also engage with industry, engage with

academia of India and abroad. &gt;&gt; So we had a extremely busy week beside our main event. We had this closed door uh discussion that I was mentioning yesterday and today this closed door

scientific dialogues. We're going to publish the results soon that brought together senior industry leaders to discuss share responsibility for AI safety. Well, obviously none of this

would happen without partnership and we want to thank our co-hosts the international association for the safe and ethical AI and its director professor struck Russell to whom I will

hand over the floor in a in a few minutes and the digital empowerment foundation with anchoring us at the grassroots here with Osama. We'll close the session later on and we obviously

want to thank our sponsors and supporters starting with Sympatico ventures Ein Dono will moderate that panel uh and we're thankful for that. Um the future of life institute um Imana

and Yan who's been supporting this effort and the Mindu Foundation whose team is here as well with team and and it's it's great to have your support and we are thankful for that.

Yeah. So today we're about to hear from his excellency Matias common who's a secretary general of the OECD. Uh we're going to hear for our excellency Miss Josephine Teo who is the minister for

digital development and information at the government of Singapore. Thank you for your continuous support. Really appreciate that. Same for Yantalin who's the AI investor but also a funding

engineer at Skype and the co-founder of the future of life institute. And last but not least we also have Mr. U Minister Deo who's going to be with us from Malaysia, Minister for Digital

Development and Information. Thank you, Minister. Uh as well as Vice President Kim um for digital and AI at the World Bank. So an extremely important conversation to have.

&gt;&gt; And before you we welcome you to the stage, I would like to hand over the floor to Professor Strat Russell to say a few words and to speak about also what's happening next week in Paris.

Thank you so much. Uh thank you very much Cirrus and Nico. Uh so as Nico mentioned the uh International Association for Safe and Ethical AI or ICI the world's worst

acronym uh is a global democratic scientific and professional society. Uh we have several thousand members uh and approaching 200 affiliate organizations. Our mission is to ensure

that AI systems operate safely and ethically for the benefit of humanity. Uh and as Nico mentioned, our second annual conference will take place in Paris starting on Tuesday. Uh it's still

I think possible to to register uh but uh we're already up over 1300 people coming. Uh it's at UNESCO headquarters in Paris. Um so achieving this mission of uh ensuring that AI

systems operate safely and ethically is partly a technical challenge. How do we even build systems that have that property? Uh but also a governance challenge. How do we ensure that those

are the systems and only those systems get built? uh and this panel is mainly about this second challenge and I think it's one on which global coordination is essential

because the harms whether it's psychological damage to the next generation or loss of human control altogether those harms cross borders

and we must coordinate to make sure that they don't happen or they don't originate anywhere. uh and it's I think fitting that we are having this summit here in India which

has really among other things championed the idea that everyone on earth should have a say and so with that I will hand over to Eileen. Thank you very much. Thank you Stuart. So Dr. Alen Donaru is

the founder and managing P partner of Sympatical Ventures. She's also the former US special envoy and coordinator for digital freedom and the ambassador to the UNHCR. Eileen,

we welcome the the speaker on the on the floor. Please your excellency Mr. Maches Corman, Mr. Gobin Singo, Mr. Josephin, and Mr. Yan Talin as well as Mr. Sangbukim join us on stage. Thank you.

Okay, given this remarkable panel and the very short time we have, let me very briefly frame our discussion and get right to our speakers. So, we're here to share views on the opportunity for

policy makers to impact international AI governance. As the race towards AGI and super intelligence intensifies, AI safety advocates face a compounding challenge.

The technology is advancing rapidly and being deployed with minimal guard rails. While the riskmanagement processes that do exist are either illadapted to the magnitude of the risk, fragmented across

jurisdictions or insufficiently binding on developers, deployers, investors, and regulators. The result is an unharmonized governance landscape that fails to shape the behavioral incentives

of those building and funding frontier AI. Economies, governments, and societies do not respond well to such mixed signals. While much of the discourse on frontier

AI safety has focused on AI superpowers, there's an urgent need for deeper international diplomacy on the most extreme risks. At this juncture, middle powers and global majority states can't

be seen as peripheral actors in this landscape. Through pulled resources, market leverage, normative influence, and regulatory innovation, they can shape the direction of global AI

practices and safeties. Leading from the middle may turn out to be a more powerful approach than previously anticipated. Whether or not that collective power is

exercised now will determine whether international AI governance moves from the rhetorical level to the real world impact on safety. This panel will aim to identify present

present-day coordination gaps in international AI safety and highlight practical steps policy makers can take in the coming months to close them. So to our panel, I'll start with Secretary

General Corman. The OECD has done remarkable work over the past decade developing consensus on the OECD principles, providing a definition of AI systems that has

resonated internationally and playing an international role in operationalized the Hiroshima International Code of Conduct. Along with those foundations, we now

have the International AI Safety Report and the Singapore Consensus on Global AI Safety Research Priorities. With these principles, definitions, and frameworks in mind, two-part question

for you. First, what are the key lessons learned from the process of building consensus and then implementing these frameworks? And then second, looking ahead, what's the most critical piece of

coordinated frontier AI safety infrastructure we should be building? Now, some have called for an international incident response center, and we're all curious whether you think

that should be a priority and achievable. &gt;&gt; Just some small easy questions in in terms of um you know, what is the key to success? what is the sort of most

important lesson on on on like looking back on what we need um trust is built through inclusion uh and on the basis of objective evidence and you know what I I think what we've learned over the last

few years is that bringing together all the relevant actors governments companies civil society technical experts is is what we need to do I mean each has a different perspective and

different imperatives I mean markets reward the private sector for speed, scale and innovation while governments must manage risk and protect the public interest without stifling progress. But

a challenge and it's been mentioned in some of the opening remarks a challenge for policy makers in this context is that II
