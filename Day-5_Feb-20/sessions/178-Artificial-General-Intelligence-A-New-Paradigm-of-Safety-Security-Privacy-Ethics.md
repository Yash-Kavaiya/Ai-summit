## 📝 Summary

Artificial general intelligence will intensify existing challenges around safety, security, privacy, ethics, and governance. This session will examine how current trajectories in advanced AI raise near-term governance questions, particularly for developing economies. It will explore institutional readiness, policy gaps, and risk pathways across data, compute, markets, and deployment contexts, and will surface practical considerations for anticipatory governance that can inform responsible decision-making before irreversible dependencies take hold.
