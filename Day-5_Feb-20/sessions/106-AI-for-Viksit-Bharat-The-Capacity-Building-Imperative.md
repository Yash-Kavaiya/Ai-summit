## 📝 Transcript

UI and partnerships from the capacity minimum publishing to deliver welcome remarks. &gt;&gt; Good afternoon. Thank you Mustafa. Uh a very good afternoon to all of you

distinguished guests, panelists, fellow participants, colleagues from Kyogi Bharat and capacity building commission and a warm welcome to everyone. Technology they say is a great leveler

and AI they say is the next big thing after electricity. We as individual uh are part of society as individuals and a dual role of individuals and we deeply impacted by

these two to an extent that we cannot distinguish between these two anymore. As the popular Bollywood line says, mayor Mary Tanhai is actually me and my AI in that context.

This room carries the huge responsibility of making that distinction happen. responsibility is to carve out trustbased collaborative ethical frameworks so that the demands

of fast-paced dynamic AIDP age which constantly creates pushing demands for faster better safer public services is met by a well-informed design and delivery model.

Today we gather here as a first step alive with the India AI impact summit theme AI for economic development, social good, safe interested AI and human capital. The need for collective

discourse at the policy level is crucial more than ever to harness equitable benefits, mitigate risks and to ensure an inclusive governance transformation. to carry this foundation on forward. We

have our distinguished uh panelist, we have our chairperson and we look forward to listening to them. Welcome everyone. &gt;&gt; Thank you Dr. Washima. I now invite our chairperson capacity building commission

sraan to deliver the opening address. Thank you. Thank you Mustafa Namaskar. It's my privilege to extend a very warm welcome to all of you on behalf of team

mission karny yogi and I must disclose that this speech that I'm going to read out is handcrafted. No AI in the process has been used.

&gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. Absolutely. Being compliant. &gt;&gt; Our honorable PMS yesterday outlined manu vision a humanentric framework for ethical, accountable and inclusive AI

governance. Vishyogi has and shall continue to relentlessly craft and embed these very capabilities that will translate this vision into reality.

Public service today must evolve at a pace hither to unprecedented. It must learn continuously, develop deep competencies and dynamically adapt to eternally emerging work in work spaces.

Underpinning this competency and skill is the humanistic capacity that non-negotiable layer of intellect, diligence and values that has to flavor every decision made and every service

delivered by governments and its systems. From the community wealth worker delivering nutrition to an expectant mother to the policy worker strategizing access to specialized

healthcare. It is the quality of this human layer that will ultimately define the quality of service we deliver to our citizens. The future of AI more prec precisely the agentic AIS will not be in

massive monolithic models. It will be in small language models context specific sectoral and decentralized. This would entail creating the customized sector specific competency

framework that can suitably deploy AI agents to arrive at decision points that solve local needs and problems in its context. Capacity building must therefore focus on enabling artificials

to deconstruct complexities, impose appropriate guard rules on data and its use before evaluation benchmarks before using the agentic insights to take in decisions.

In the past years, the commission has developed holistic policy frameworks that have been tested and institutionalized, established operational guidelines,

especially those for identifying competency gaps leading to personalized learning pathways for each one of our learnings. Dynamic governance models have evolved

for stakeholders, especially at training institutions, ensuring they remain agile and [snorts] responsive to competency demands. Continuous learner feedback loops rigorously analyzed have become

integral to refining and strengthening the system. The aggra community portal stands today as a testament to this remarkable trajectory. It has delivered capacities effectively

at scale and across the humongous diversity of India's governance ecosystem. It is in the context of this evolving journey that we see today's event as an

opportunity to take that leap grounded in deep faith that mission continually as a public good must inform every other government that is on a similar and seinal mission to deliver inclusive

ethical and impactful public services. I sincerely hope that this deliberation here forges a cohesive and planning pathway for all of us to end the katon as global partners. Thank you so much.

Thank you so much ma'am for placing uh the panel disc uh through the address placing everything into the context for the panel discussion that is to follow and the remaining proceedings of the

evening. Now I take great pleasure in inviting the panelists for today's discussion and moderator Mr. Ramiser. May I thank yous and raiser to join us

on the Reverse panel discussion will be moderated by Mr. S. Ramaday, chairperson of and former MD and CEO of T consultancy services. Mr. The Ramadan is

a respected leader at the intersection of technology, governance and institutional delivery and he also had key initiations across academia, industry and public policy institutions

including as advisor to the honorable prime minister in the national council on scale development. Viva on we are joined by Gil Ala from Gazini

a7 servant at the management and innovation in public services government of Kazini working at the intersection of governance reform and digital transformation

Shivasa chief architect for Google's work in the public sector he currently leads the public policy strategic AI solution engagements of Google cloud in India

And our final panelist for today, Robin Scott. She is the co-founder and CEO of a political, a global online network of public servants. Thank you so much for joining us and taking time out of your

busy schedules. With this uh I hand it over to you also please. So the mic then I'll shut down. Now

good afternoon to all of you. Before I begin, I want to extend a very warm welcome to the panelists. Thank you so much for agreeing to be a part of this. It will

be a learning experience even for me for sure. After spending over five decades in the technology industry, I'm probably the oldest here.

It puts me with immense hope to sit alongside a group of young neighbors who are shaping the next chapter of this global technology revolution.

Thank you for being here and truly looking forward to the exchange. We look at look back at past techological revolutions. We rarely talk about the technologies

themselves. Instead, we talk about what they enable. Electricity is not celebrated because we built power. We celebrated because it brought a

revolutionary transformation to the quality of life. AI presents us with a suma moment. It gives us unprecedented power not to do things better but to do better things

to rethink how we explore, educate, govern, create, collaborate, heal and protect the people and the planet most importantly. Then the most important question for

this summit is not how fast we can scale AI but how we will recognize that we moving in a direction that elevates humanity. Sometime ago I read an article titled

building bridges as humanity's greatest legacy. It has spoke about India civilizational instinct and how it has how it has long lean

towards coexistence cooperation and balance including shared progress from Buddhist Mahatma Gandhi. India has consultantly attempted to build and promote peace and harmony

across the world. We're entering the earth at a time that is increasingly interwined in geopolitics and of course conflict. That reality demands deep reflection because the choices we make

today will determine whether here becomes a nuclear race of the 21st century or the space race that will take humanity to the moon. Globally AI is framed as a binary race

market led by experimentation in the United States. best to stateled technationalism in China. However, in my opinion, India offers a third way in partnership of

course. For over five decades, India's IT trust, reliability and deliverable capabilities across the world. We know 5.8 million professionals. This legacy gives India unique strength to deploy

technology safely and of course responsibly at responsibly at scale. They're seeing this approach to take shape on the ground. For example, the Tata AI Saki commercial program is

empowering rural women artisans to use AI as a tool for livelihood opportunity. India's AI journey is also grounded in the digital public infrastructure which includes radar, identity,

payments, API, documents, dity locker and consent framework. the data empowerment and protection architecture or dupa as it is called at a scale. These are not merely platform they are

trust architectures. The next billion users may not interact with parameter models. They interact with tiny embedded AI in phones tractors classrooms clinics and local government

systems. India's real opportunity lies in small language models that are absolutely domain specific and can run on edge devices operate in low resource

environments that solve real problems but I witnessed quite a bit of this during the walkthrough of the exhibition exhibits as artificial intelligence comes in across public

administration the challenge for governments is not limited to technology adoption It extends to ensuring the public officials understand how these systems

function with their limitations lie and how human judgment responsibly and ethical consideration must guide this use. Vishay has established a model

demonstrating that systemic technology enabled social services reform is achievable across diverse administrative context. Looking at this institution foundation,

the next horizon is to embed AI within workforce transformation frameworks while contributing the shaping of global norms on responsible AI in governance. In this context, the summit marks the

launch of a blueprint for digital capacity building alliance which sets out the share framework for developing a digital public good for public officials capacity Monday. Let us take this

conversation forward to see how the proposed alliance can be operationalized. How diverse partners can work together to translate the blueprint into

sustainable actions. I'll turn over to the questions for each of the panelists. I've got um couple of questions but I'll just start with one or two to each of

you and they're slightly different for each and none of them have been generated by AI again a disclosure. So let me start with Google cloud

Google is at the forefront of building global digital infrastructure and in adoption across enterprises and public services. The question is u governments often adopt new technologies

in fragmented ways. What technical and operational risks arise when a systems are layered into the legacy infrastructure without structural reform and how can

initiatives like mission help align infrastructure modernization with workforce capability development. Want to answer that before I ask you the next question please.

Uh so first of all thank you thank you so much uh uh I'm honored to be here at uh Bhat Manup uh as part of the uh panel of esteemed uh experts and we are talking about capacity

building uh imperative for vix par 2047. uh you know I think the question that sir Ashley said is a very important question when we are in the journey of using AI in our day-to-day lives and

specifically you know uh governments and especially government of India has a huge focus of using AI uh for making the lives of our citizens easier and also the government uh civil

servants you know lives to be much much easier than the work that they do today. Uh the kind of efforts that goes in to really sort of delivering citizen services is there a way that we could

actually leverage AI uh in really sort of solving for that. Now to S's question, I think the key it is a very important point uh that AI is not a you know layer that you could just put on

existing systems. you know the the the systems the IT systems that were developed uh with the objective of solving specific problems the

&gt;&gt; sure right so the you know the existing IT systems are uh very centric and they were built with the view to solve a specific problem or the kind of

technology that we had at that time with AI. We are sort of looking to change the way the humans interact with the AI systems. The existing systems they actually have silos of data, silos of

business logic whereas AI actually sort of look at this as more holistically. uh you need to really have a contextual data for you to train models to make it useful for you and so we need to really

sort of look at re-engineering some of our existing IT systems so that it can harness the potential of AI in solving some of the problems. So that is one one point of view. The other is to really

sort of prepare data so that we can train models whether it is the LLM or the SLMs. Uh whether it is at the edge that we would actually have AI in a small device like a mobile device uh

Asha worker could actually sort of go and can deliver services using AI in their own native language. So you know we need to ensure that we support the multilinguality the index languages uh

to deliver on those services. Now to build those systems we really need to not only change the technology the underlying technology but also the process that needs to be re-engineered.

So that is one aspect that we should think about also from a security perspective and data sovereignity perspective. We need to sort of reook at the the exposure that AI brings to our

existing systems. The kind of vectors that we are you know the systems have been built today. We will need to have to relook at it. Some of the you know vectors or some of the issues that we

have today needs to be resolved. So that would be my perspective sir. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Gee, he told me it's very easy to remember his name because G is a Hindi word also.

&gt;&gt; How can countries like Brazil and India collaborate more closely in shaping the global conversation around care, trust and alignment in AI? What do you think are the areas we can collaborate

together which will have the greatest global impact as AI becomes more autonomous and more deeply embedded in society? Well, that's an uh fantastic question. I will

try to bring some aspect to that, but I think we'll keep answering that until at least 2047. &gt;&gt; Uh h but the point is first I think Brazil and India are really close and

can collaborate a lot. I can testify that because it's my fifth trip to India. We've been exchanging a lot technology wise. when uh it relates to AI, I think we

should consider different aspects. We just mentioned here uh data uh and data for training models, but I think there's strong room for collaboration when you talk about R&amp;D, right? Because uh

there's not only similarities but also complimentarities. There are things that are complimentary to one another. So uh I guess that there's strong room for for for cooperation and collaboration but

also in capacity building. I understand that I'm a great fan of the mission kay yogi uh and capacity building commission. uh we have similar uh organizations in Brazil have been

training civil servants as well through an electronic an online platform and I believe that a digital infrastructure approach to capacity building is also a way to bring uh this to more people to

make this scalable in a way that we can actually uh change uh build knowledge uh build capacities and make uh things change within government. Of course, we need to be careful about the risks of

AI. In Brazil, we have developed a a uh framework for ethical assessment of AI implementation. We have also provided some guides uh explaining not only how AI works but

what uh caution should you have when you're using AI within the public service. Of course, we should consider uh boundaries and safeguards in AI implementation, but we should not uh

prevent from using it for the betterment of people's lives and to enhance our population. And I think that uh training and capacity building is crucial for that. Uh in Brazil, we have uh built at

least uh four different p profiles for capacity building. one for senior leaders, one for uh IT managers, one for data creators, and the other for general civil servants in which we organize the

knowledge you're supposed to develop and to to to build in order to use AI properly and to build AI solutions. And I guess uh going back to to the

Brazil India connection, I guess both nations are well positioned to I would say lead but to conduct this conversation in a global perspective. I think that uh and we have great

partnerships with a political as well. I've been working a lot uh with them and I think that uh coalition of willing organizations uh building knowledge for AI in public

service is something that could be built and if you can bring uh a south south uh flavor to that I think we're better positioned to provide the transition we want to the government and to the world.

Thank you Robin. You work with governments around the world. What are the biggest gaps you see in AI readiness within public institutions?

How can we shift the global conversation towards work reinvention? &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. That's a big question. It it is such an honor to be here and this seating arrangement is is

particularly meaningful to me because we're not only honored to partner with the capacity building uh commission and mission kamyogi but we are longstanding partners of an up the excellent

Brazilian school of government and google.org or has funded us to provide world-class training for free on AI to a million public servants and we 400,000 into that goal including in India. So

this particular configuration is is very meaningful and I also want to say something about Brazil and India which I think links the two nations. In our experience working with them, they both

understand that capacity building is not something that need that should be pushed to the side as an afterthought. It is an engine of innovation and has a a innovation unit within its school and

it is strategic and especially with AI it's more strategic because you don't get intelligent technology unless you have people intelligently supported to work

alongside and in partnership with that technology. So I really appreciate the ambition and vision that both countries bring to capacity building. I'll point to just a couple of gaps.

One is around ethical frameworks. You mentioned Brazil has one. Most countries have one. According to our data, this is an 8,000 person global survey. Of those people implementing AI in their

governments, these are people whose job it is to roll out the technology. only 26% say they understand their own government's ethical frameworks. So in

other words, 75% are freestyling and that builds a great deal of risk into the system. We also have a gap between talk and ambition and evaluation and follow-through. So when you talk to

leaders, 72% say they have a pilot or will have one this year, but only 45% of them say they have a plan to evaluate the performance of that pilot. And there is no point piloting something without

evaluation. There is a lot more to say, but I I just want to end on a note of optimism. Well over 90% of public servants are very optimistic about the role that AI can

play and there's a 1.75 trillion productivity prize for getting this right according to BCG. So we've got the optimism, we've got the energy and these gaps are big but they're not impossible

to close. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Just one final question everyone of you can answer. As we expandentric capacity, building scaling digital platforms, increasing

compute and embedding AI into public systems, all of us agree we must also confront the environmental footprint of these technologies.

How can governments and AI companies work together to ensure that the AIdriven public infrastructure is also aligned with climate responsibility, energy efficiency and sustainable

growth? anyone of you can all agree with each other or confront each other. &gt;&gt; Well, I can just offer we have developed a course on AI and climate and understanding the links with the

Stanford door school of sustainability. So, we literally have a program to answer your question. I'll leave it there. &gt;&gt; Uh uh

&gt;&gt; anybody has too much money? &gt;&gt; Well, uh well, I think there there are two separate ways in which it could be framed. there's uh AI for green and green AI. So aiming for sustainability

on uh on the on the power you provide for well for for for the GPUs and so on is crucial but also we could use AI to leverage the potential of climate policies. If you put together uh data,

materological data, data from forest and so on, you can bring uh intelligence and knowledge which could led to better informed decisions. In Brazil, we have a system in which we mapped all the

forests in private lands. It's the rural environmental registry and we're using AI to understand whether uh forest have been cut down or not. So we can use different AI tools to promote uh not

only fighting the forestation but also promoting reforestation. So there are several different potential tools and they are all could be used and if we can blend them together can make even more.

&gt;&gt; So I would actually say that u you know Google first of all uh has committed that by 2030 all our data centers will be carbon neutral and

And we want to make sure uh that we want to partner uh with the government of India to ensure that all the data centers that we are building in the country should have some sort of targets

to ensure that they are carbon neutral and there are you know design from a civil perspective but from a technology perspective we could always build models which are energy efficient. So I would

actually leave it at that but I think that's a very important point for India as a country. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Any one question from the audience please?

Go ahead. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Oh, it doesn't work. Somebody give you the mic. &gt;&gt; My name is

&gt;&gt; But you should add ladies first. I don't know why you Okay. &gt;&gt; Go ahead. Go ahead. Sorry. in three president for federation and just take a metric of doomsday clock

that was just reset on 27th January at 85 seconds to midnight. Now just simply translate that in a thousand mile downhill journey an overloaded earth with weapons of mass destruction that

aptly disguise our civilization today we are at 80 m to the edge of the precipice you know that dangerous we we are being so cannibalistic of the future of our children should vit my question is

should vitar by 2047 which is actually procrastination of our responsibilities is we just don't want to own up what's happening today and what happened

&gt;&gt; I think yeah &gt;&gt; so they have to come as a concert of civilizations by 2026 itself right here right now &gt;&gt; I think confrontation starts very early

and a lot of activities are happening in the country 2047 is a dream extendary year of our independence what we need to achieve it's a road map that's what is important rather than say nothing is

happening suddenly something will happen in 47. No more question here. Last &gt;&gt; Thank you. I'm Professor Charu from Indian Institute of Public Administration. We met some of you.

Thanks. And regards to the audience. My question is with regard to a consolidated international uh lack of availability of frameworks in terms of AI procurement guidelines, in

terms of AI ethical frameworks, in terms of competence frameworks. We do have UNESCO competence framework for AI but we need to hyperloize it to contexts which Robin and I were talking in terms

of various countries in another event. So maybe we need to have something a more generic collaborative international AI impact assessment tool which could look into capabilities not just at the

digital leadership level but across the whole organization or country. Thanks a lot. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Any comments? She obser

Okay. Thank you so much. Honorable [clears throat] minister say thank you to all the panelists and participants. We are also now joined by honorable minister Dr. Jendra Singh sir

minister of state for personnel uh minister of state for personal public grievances and pensions. a visionary leader who has been at the forefront of administrative reforms

and India's science and innovation agenda. Sir, it's a pleasure to have you with us. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]

&gt;&gt; That's important. You got Thank you so much uh minister sir for busy schedule. What was just witnessed in pawn of a

panel discussion is a small reflection of what the capacity building commission and karnogi bah are hoping to achieve through what we seek to announce today. May I now request honorable minister sir

to kindly launch the blue foring a digital capacity building alliance by pressing the button on the remote right before him. Being the world's largest democracy

comes with a sense of power. Imagine over 1.8 billion citizens, 36 states and women territories, 800 districts, 4,000 plus urban centers, 6 lakhs 50,000 plus villages, millions of decisions every

day. And to govern at this scale, this space, we need an ever evolving system. So India built one. In 2020, Honorable Prime Minister Shri Marini launched Mission Kabarogi to build a future ready

citizen central civil services. At the heart of it, the capacity building commission delivering capability with foundations of trust, empathy and inclusion. Part of this is IBOT Kogi

platform India's national digital learning platform accessible anytime anywhere and now the next AI enabled governments personalized learning paths smart decision support from reactive

systems to adaptive capacity building to all governments especially in the global south face the same challenge demand-driven and technology disruptive complex Governments need for agile

institutional capacity. India has a working model, scalable, proven, a global public good. Today, the capacity building commission unveils a proposal to forge digital capacity building

alliance. An alliance that fuses global AI principles, digital public goods standards, and the missionary model. A unique model for demand, design, delivery and continuing evolution with

one single vision to build a shape nonproprietary foundation for capacity building across nations. This alliance aims to bring together data for capacity building. A global to drive policy

design and standards. Industry to build digital commerce and specialized solutions. Academia for the network of knowledge, research and incubation. Civil society to champion systemic

equity and ethical accountability. DBG partners to orchestrate ecosystem for impact. startups to catalyze solutions and co-creation steered by the capacity building commission and bharat of

government of India a global public good for inclusive ethical capacity building in the spirit of surv welfare for all happiness for all. Thank you so much sir for launching the

blueprint. May I kindly request honorable minister sir and all the dignitaries on dis to stand for photographs. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you sir.

May I invite honorable minister sir to the podium to deliver the key address keynote address for the afternoon honorable minister and already welcomed delegates

Yes. So when you walked in we have we were in the midst of a panel discussion that of course you saw how it concluded and Dr. Mr. Ramadur was bringing the perspective

of how does AI and its use pan out for the public services? What are the challenges by way of capacity building? The learnings that we have had in the mission care

how valuable are they going to be to inform this whole journey that all the global partners, global governments, stakeholders are going to further take their steps

towards and the summit has seen the honorable prime minister unveed yesterday which is totally bringing in the layer of the need and importance of having an humanentric

approach the hands of the human in every decision that is being made that will impact citizens in every which way. So I think the whole capacity building is looking at that capacity and

capabilities that we need to put in the hands of every public servant from the secretary at the policy level to the community level frontline worker. How do they use navigate

and build the intellect that is needed to make the correct ethical moral value based decisions when it's going to impact the humankind in general? I think we have a very fruitful insights from

our partners the panelists and so this is almost a culmination of a long month months that we have spent in discussing these issues with our stakeholders whether it's from the industry the

partners our service providers academia startups we were able to bring all of them together today and the document that has re uh has been unveiled by the minister just Now is bringing all of

those learnings and insights together to call for action in all of us who are working on as experts in our fields to come together, collaborate, strengthen each other's hands and responsibilities

to fill that pathway with the human centricity that is required in handling the capacities that we have given to our baby which is the alien and augmented intelligence. I think so that is where

your keynote now would give us the further needed guidance that you think at the political leadership level. How do they view the whole capacity building space and like Robin said this is a very

important but oft sidelined sector of public governance but now we have the opportunity of bringing it center stage. I don't think we should lose this opportunity to take the leap with utter

faith sir. Thank you sir. &gt;&gt; Thank you madam brother. Thank you for reminding me that you needed my guidance. and more than me

reminding all in the room that they have to listen to my guidance. But I know you already done enough of that task. But thanks for your kind words and trying to encourage me to

stand before this podium. Now we are simultaneously talking about two three things this afternoon. We're talking about governance. So you have your capaciability and you're also

trying to bring in an artificial intelligence interface which of course is the only case there whether we like it or not we don't have to do it it's only there you know we sphere of life in

every domain that we work in now governness if you take one godness is a dynamic process like many other processes in every domain that we are engaged in

so also is capacity building it's dynamic it's continuous And the time that we live in is such a fast track moment that by the time you prepare yourself for tomorrow. When

tomorrow happens you realize that you were only prepared for yesterday and then upon that the artificial intelligence and the role of both in capacity

building as well as in governance. And you talk in the context of India today when you talk of a framework which indicates the best of all the three I

think the most encouraging feature is that we have a government in place a political dispensation in place which is supportive of all these yards and all these initiatives till about maybe 15

years back we won't be we wouldn't have ever part of a team like this gaining priority in an academic room of this nature. And therefore this is a dispensation of

the prime minister Modi which is uh not only ready for futuristic ideas and initiatives but also for future ready ideas

and that means while it looks very fancyful romantic artificial intelligence even if shop puts on a banner outside they hear my my items are sold through AI river I'm sure he at

least be able to attract some number of more number of customers so that's a new nature because but at the same time being unrealistic pragmatic and uh Mrs. rather well been secretary

DOP before she took over her present assignment we are also free to shed away some of the old baggage so while we turn while we are ready to learn what is new we should also have

the capacity and we should be nonpossessive enough to unlearn something which you held close to our chest for so many years and I'm proud to say that in the last one decade this

government has done away with almost almost 2,000 rules and that sin has not been committed alone by me. Madam Raha has been equally guilty of that

and that's because many of these rules were designed for the times that they were designed. They would have thought of artificial intell about 100 years back. We were having wounds which were

haunting us for more than a century getting our certificates documents attested by colony before. So we didn't go without that we had a means and we also have now means to trust each other.

So at the same time also we have opened up to learn the new practices and to also while learning new practices to capacity to learn new practice. So why capacity building commission sitting

with the governor's viewers? Because when you learn the governor practices you must also learn to build capacity to learn. So artificial intelligence the basing

mantra is to be able to be a good learner and if you are not one then to learn to be a good learner and capacity building is one instrument which helps to do that and this also was the idea

which first came from Prime Minister Modi. I think quite a novel idea for a government setup because usually governments are used to work in a status quoist mode. So we have a flavor of

private sector. Bandu is there earlier we had adul there because now we also got over the values of private and public sector. So unless we learn to

learn from each other and also give up our skeptical we will not be actually building up capacity to the optimal. We will be building our capacities which are limited by certain barriers and that

would not be an unbridled learning. So capacity building commission was there mission kogi was being talked about was also their creation. I god and all these are testament

to the godness reforms being accomplished through optimum technologies. Now this lies which is been launched. Now when we talk of digital public good

fortunately and unfortunately I'm one of the few who are from the school of sciences in this room. So if you take the first digital and just concentrate on public good

then synonymous with public good. So public essentially would be at the core of the good governance. It's just that now we started using

digital mean so it's fanciful and more because now we are into the age of unique application himself one of the earliest decorations Well, maximum governance minimum

government which in other word means a government which is citizencentric which is accountable as far as possible which is transparent and the ultimate lit test of to bring in ease of living.

So all that DG was happening earlier only the announcement is being made today. Yeah, that kind of scenario. I think building commission deserve

appreciation because they were very much instrumental in helping us building up these new frameworks. And I must also congratulate Madame Radha and his team for this launch of

digital capacity building alliance. uh but yes you can pract but the guiding principle ultimately all of us would be I would agree would be to build at a scale

which is optimally inclusive to bring as much inclusion as possible and for others to learn and also to adopt.

Otherwise the very purpose of the eyes would not have been achieved and therefore for that purpose artificial intelligence could be a powerful tool

but certainly not itself. Now in the same ministry when we already using it from the experience that you have the optimal mix is something I to the uh of this audience you record AI

plus HI intelligence plus human intelligence and we learned that in a hard way while we were devising CP gs we are feeling very proud that our

disposal weight of increased to more 95% almost 100% per week sometimes but everybody went back with a long face so I told me then secretary I said greedness was 100% happiness dis

I said no something called happiness index being discussed in the west so we actually had to introduce a human desk let's go over there because everything was happening online AI

The contain would immediately reach the concerned desk. The vessel would come before you expected and the person would end up saying so there.

So that kind of so I think that hybrid model is something which is ultimately going to be effective by all means. as far as I concerned the morning also I was listening to the IMF chief she said

India's progress in the AI initiative is phenomenal so I think we have already received recognition from the global judges and global benchmarks but that part what is suited to our conditions

a country sitting in Europe may not be used to talking for example 11 chapter We have I think I'm going to leave in the house of people who has mobile

clinic in my constituency and I have two doctors one is physically sitting there the other is an AI doctor she is a lady then they take the history they digitalize it do all the assessment

connected to one of the leading hospitals you have panled three four of them connect to the super specialist there the the time where The prescription is finished just about 40

50 minutes. It's a very innocative health start up now. But of course therapy. So when the patient comes the physical doctor talks to him but he feels more gratified right she talks

exactly in the same diur she would speak better. So the devil is over and I'm not talking without the because he has something called

and Indians are too used to if you get well if you don't get well you should so you sacrifice so as they say Indian data for Indian

solutions Indian treatment for So we need to have however much digitalized we go maybe other nations will not require that but we will always be requiring it and I think with this

alliance the repeated model that rather has suggested we will be able to engage more and more value addition and by by preparing this uh uh drops chapter with a content standard on the evaluation fra

work that is required but in the end I will just uh pick up on what she said the manov part of it uh which the prime minister spoke yesterday. Now how many in this room

actually have uh been able to justify what was meant by manu not a single hand has gone so I think you need this if you have a bag or a notebook please take it out M

stands for moral and ethical systems stands for accountable governance N stands for national sovereignity and the second A stands for accessible and inclusivity

and finally A stands for validity and legitimacy. Now this is what happens when we don't have the capacity to learn the term we have the capacity to learn

the acronyms and very soon the artificial intelligence will take up this much capacity also we immediately press it what is their

model the other day when I was watching this large bottle I couldn't understand that it was over so I said that but along with that I so

worried that we made of windows that we had in earlier generation we can't see people who know more than five languages could speak more than five language six language so many of them now we are at

the risk of even forgetting our own language there someone else to do it for us so that is why in the end I think the two reasons because what I I've been into this AI business quite deeply for

last almost half a decade I've been trying it in So the ultimate I think model which I draw for myself because these you can't be drawing for others

because everybody has the brain needed to learn for himself is that one has to be intelligent enough to use artificial intelligence otherwise don't get into this business

point which I think the timeline also for some media person if they are there Artificial intelligence can substitute everything on this planet but it cannot

substitute integrity. Now whatever you do the other law this robotic few days back somebody said now we will be able to get rid of uh these fetal infecting.

I said he said no because the doctor is sitting thousands of kilometer away doing an ultrasound on a lady who goes thousand kilometers away. So he would not be able to actually do any. I said

if I am a doctor and I'm smart enough I'll tell the person sitting on the other side when the lady peers whom I have to give the sex determination just go around I'll do that. So that is

integrity. So I think ultimately if we are not able to use this with integrity we might run the risk of ending up

also not putting too often into so much of other godless models that came to us but got wedded away not because of attributable to them but the reasons attributable to lord of us who had been

assigned to handle them. Thank you very much. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much sir for uh that insightful address and laying emphasis on the need for integrity which is only

possible through the idea of having human in the loop something which also finds mentioned in the blueprint that we have just launched. With this we come to the conclusion of

the event. Thank I extend my heartful gratitude and uh on behalf of capacity building commission and bharat thank you so much honorable minister sir uh dignitaries on the bias and all those

present here. Uh thank you so much. I now request the panelists also to just stay back for a quick minute for a photograph with honorable minister sir and the dignitaries of the nas

also all present I'd like to take this opportunity to invite you to booth in all five sir thank you so much

thank Welcome.
