## 📝 Transcript

founders founders who are building in AI. Uh AI as we all know is changing rapidly. There's a lot of new sort of uh technologies that are emerging, lot of new ways uh to think about product. So

how do how do founders learn about these changes? The way only way you can I think learn or maybe the best way to learn at a conference like this at a summit like this is by uh listening to

each other. So it's not a pitch. There's not going to be any talk about business. There's going to be no funding conversation. It's only about product. So I'm going to request um all the

founders who are presenting to come up and then we'll go um sequentially. Um and the other request on uh the presentations to all the founders who are presenting is please come I mean

feel free to come up is that um please use jargon because uh that's the intent is that the audience will understand it. However, um also be mindful that if you want more

people to learn who may not be AI natives, may not be technologists, but should it's still important for them to learn and understand. So if you can simplify it, it's fine. If you don't

want to simplify it, it's also okay. Um so the format we'll follow is that each one of you, you know, takes a little bit of time to talk about your product. But like I said again only product, no

business, no no pitching, no money, nothing. Yeah. So um I'm going to request to uh start with if I could request Raindra Kumar to um talk about what is it that you're building. So

quick introduction uh and then the product that you've built. Uh hi everyone this is Davindar uh from Technoate AI and we are aiming to automate automation itself. So everybody

says AI won't take away any jobs. We like let us do something about it. &gt;&gt; Do you want to stand there at the podium or you want you're okay? Whatever whatever no yeah you can start your

presentation. &gt;&gt; Shall we do that? &gt;&gt; Yeah yeah we should because I want people to really get into the product. &gt;&gt; Can I use the please? Yes.

&gt;&gt; Yeah. Can we have the presentation please? &gt;&gt; Okay. Yes. So this is us as I said what we are aiming to do is is to automate

automation itself. Uh I have been working in the robotics and automation industry for last about 15 years targeting everyone from auto manufacturers to automation

manufacturers and everyone in between. So what generally happens is that uh there are already very sophisticated automation equipment available out there in the market. I before starting

Technodi I've been working with this company uh which happens to be world's largest manufacturer of industrial robots way back in the year 201 or so they achieved 100% automation

which means no human on the shop floor still the manufacturing is happening at 100% capacity on the other side if you see globally including India manufacturing is not even sustainable

people are not able to use automation to the full fullest extent that is something which technoate is aiming to solve All we want to make automation as easy as DIY

uh using aentki. So what it does is basically help you in three ways. First to conceptualize and engineering robotics and automation engineering solution on your own. Then to deploy and

commission that including robot programming etc etc and then eventually it also helps you to troubleshoot when something doesn't work. uh for this we started as okay we have

to do something like this because the uh the idea of this discussion is how do we go from experimentation to real world deployment so when I came up with this idea uh the first thought was that you

need to build a foundational model but we are in India it's not that easy to raise money to build a foundational model but then how do you approach this the idea is okay let us go talk to

customer let us experiment with what all options are available out there and then figure out in the process is do we need a foundational model? So we started working started talking to customers

started doing some initial deployments. Today we stand again back where we started from that we need a foundational model for this. But in the process we have already started deploying

application including with people like Fortune 500 companies. This is how the team comes from. We are working with some people at I'm sorry but the being a founder some pitching comes in by

default. But then yeah this is how the team looks like. uh we are collaborating with people like Dr. Sumit Chopra PhD under the godfather of Aayan Leon. He worked at uh fair earlier. We are

exploring or we are rather going to deploy a use case very soon with Indian Air Force itself. Of course the team comes from IIT. I have a small demo to show to everyone.

There's some music to this if but it's just music. There's no audio in any case. So what it does is as I said three modules it helps you to conceptualize a robotics and automation

solution. It helps you to uh build that the agentic AI what it does is it acts mimics a automation expert. It really finds what it takes to deploy that solution in a real world scenario. It

gives you the complete architectures. It gives you the programs. It gives you uh the step-by-step procedures. How do you put these systems together? And then eventually in the final I mean of course

you can also ask it to make changes but what happens is in industrial scenario you change one equipment uh it has to talk to all other equipment. So everything changes. So it it does all

that on its own autonomously by using agents in the background. You can also see how that solution will look like on your factory uh which has been conceptualized by the agents. And then

when it comes to robot programming many people ask me that Chad Gibb can't do this. Why do you want to build a foundational model for this? Now when it comes to robotics necessarily we are in

we are interacting with the real world. You have to understand what is the object what needs to be done how the robot needs to move. All that data needs to be injected into the systems only

then robotic programming can be done. Anyways uh then there is something called CNC programming. CNC's are the mother machine. So every aerospace component every automotive engine be it

two wheeler four-wheer they're all machined on CNC machines. For that matter to build other machines you need CNC machines. So those all those programs can also be generated by using

uh agent or generative vi in this case. Uh in defense use case it's like for example this is a case of aero engine where you just say the error code the 3D model explodes and the uh generative vi

tells you where and what steps to take to solve that particular problem. For example, you will be able to see you set the error code. It shows you where in the whole machine that error belongs and

these are the steps you need to take to solve these problems. So yes, this is it from me. We are exhibiting at hall 14. See you all there who want to discuss more.

&gt;&gt; So anybody has questions on the product including founders sitting on this panel can ask questions on the product. Any questions? &gt;&gt; Yes, please.

&gt;&gt; So GPs model intelligence. How are you going to cope with that?

&gt;&gt; We'll use their model. See, I have no I am not fond of building foundational model. My aim is to solve the problem of my customer. &gt;&gt; Initially we used to build

So how you going to beat that? &gt;&gt; Absolutely. So one thing that this is this will never be in a human history these kind of tasks will never be simple chat response kind of scenario. you need

complex uh work these are complex workflows right so even if let us say open AI wants to do it he will have to build a custom application for this right so this is an application layer

model can become ASI the super intelligence level you still will have to build the application so that is what our first approach second is for industrial domain even if openi wants to

do today he will have to build a foundational model for this separately because it is related to industrial world the 3D actual world the data is proprietary. Customer doesn't share it

with you. So your application has to run on his premises or on the virtual uh uh clouds. &gt;&gt; Okay. Thank you. You're next. Thank you so much. Thank

you. Hi everyone. First of all, I would like to thank Karan and Arja from Dukam Capital for giving me this opportunity. Uh India doesn't need more rappers. We

need infrastructure and that's what we are building at Quesis AI. My name is Webhawad Shukla. I'm the founder and CEO of Quansis AI. We are building the voice uh infrastructure for India. And uh

so the India is the customer support capital of the world. It is $55 billion industry for us. It's roughly 2% of the glo uh India's GDP and uh we are the problem is that this entire model is

outdated in the agent era. So that's what we are solving. We asked this questions to oursel uh if we can automate the call centers uh itself and the call centers can automate and

completely run by it by by by themselves. So for that we started solving this problem and we started building uh bu building from from scratch for what exactly is required to

automate the entire call center pieces and that's what we have we we initi in initiated with quantis. So quis is the default layer where u you don't need humans in the loop which can automate

the entire call center and BPU infrastructure and we can completely run end to end for the processes. So these systems can listen, understand, act, respond and solve the entire purpose for

any particular uh any particular use case. So it's not a concept anymore. We have been working with some of the top enterprises like PTM um credotics.

Uh we also partner with OpenA for the infrastructure. We are working with them on on you know voice and uh indic languages infrastructure which we have developed by our own uh digital uh data

engine and we can generate data at scale. So we are different in a way because we have solved the entire layer for for uh be your application layer for uh

orchestration layer then on the model layer and the data layer itself. So for examp we basically making the entire suit of uh the the uh automation lay the layer

for call centers. So it's completely you can say call centers are u completely running on itself. uh we have built uh we have built companies before we have a really good

research team which has helping us in you know developing the entire foundational layer of it and uh we have deployed some on some of the use cases where we have already worked with some

of the large enterprises already um yeah and I'm happy to answer any questions if anyone has &gt;&gt; any questions on the product &gt;&gt; yes you

right &gt;&gt; uh from dist lands on the somebody's phone like again kind of thing so can these be used on those kind of uh scen scenarios

&gt;&gt; yes it can be can you be more specific on the use case &gt;&gt; yeah for example uh I got generated a lead on Google ads or say a training uh on digital marketing right training.

Okay. &gt;&gt; So that customer is calling &gt;&gt; to a particular number correct &gt;&gt; this lands on say in this phone. &gt;&gt; Yeah.

&gt;&gt; So can I put this agent into this phone which can attend that call and answer according to my requirements. &gt;&gt; Yeah it can definitely do. So what will it will do in the back end and you can

you know have a handshake handshake of websockets when your number and the other number that we have uh they can basically merge together and the conversation can flow from there

&gt;&gt; and it can answer the questions because it's a dynamic question it's not a fixed kind of questions &gt;&gt; right right it can so all the knowledge bas that you can you're going to give it

so for example I'll give you use case of real estate right so uh if somebody's making an inquiry about the real estate project uh you basically fill the form you get the number there the AI I agent

will make the call. It is already trained on the entire uh data set of your real estate project. Where is it? What is the per square feet size? Uh the cost of it, what are the amenities and

all those things, the locality, all those things which is already trained on that. It will talk to you on the basis of the all that information. It will record the uh interest level from you

whether you want to visit the site or not. And then it will all automatically book the site visit as well. And you can trigger SMS, WhatsApp, email whatever you require. So everything that was

previously done by a call center uh agent is completely automated using AI agents and it's end to end process. So basically the purpose that you've given it it can completely solve for that

&gt;&gt; and can like uh institutes can take this or companies can take this on on a standalone basis or you have put in a subscription mode kind of thing. &gt;&gt; So it's more like we're charging per

minute kind of subscription at this point. So you set it up one time then whatever the number of minutes that you consume with us you pay for that. &gt;&gt; Okay. Okay. Any other question? Yeah.

&gt;&gt; So if you could tell me how you scaling on the same because foundational models are very good for demos but when we scale we have even seen serum breaking &gt;&gt; right.

&gt;&gt; So how are you? [laughter] &gt;&gt; That is right. We basically gave a demo with server and &gt;&gt; guys. [laughter] Well, that was too

loud. But then yeah, how are you &gt;&gt; thinking of combating that scenarios? &gt;&gt; The main thing is basically the data engine, right? So I mean data that you have basically train it on. There's the

most important piece. Initially when we tried it with Bhashini and Google data sets and all the public libraries that are that are available, we basically tried to fine-tune and uh generate

basically train the model on that data set. But unfortunately like you mentioned there are so many problems with that. So that's why we uh build our own data engine as you can see we won an

award from prime minister Modi as well was right here in Bhartum last year. So we basically generated data generate data from our own data uh data engine and that is what we are basically

putting it in in the model. So for use case by use case for example PTM that is working with us at s scale we are making tens of thousands of call with ptm. Uh for those kind of use cases we basically

take it uh what exactly is the use case on right. So for example merchant is a very complex use case scaling. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. So we are working I mean

concurrency currently is around 50. Now we are going to increase that as I mean the as the model grows we we'll increase that concurrency. &gt;&gt; You had a question.

&gt;&gt; Oh yeah like Right. &gt;&gt; Correct. So there are two kinds of um uh problems, right? So there are smaller companies which are employing five guys,

10 guys. So if you talk about that, that's not something where we are currently focusing on and that's not the industry can't focus on that. I mean the pricing will come down drastically in

the next couple of years but there are companies like SBI insurance they are employing uh tens of thousands of people in particular building right so from real estate from managing the security

the parking spaces uh the HR management team managements all those things subscription headsets machinery all that those things if you take it down to the last minute so that costs roughly 25 to

30 minute rupees per minute for this this particular maybe cost 3 rupees per minute. So that's more like 90% of the cost saving for those kind of companies. So that's where the current market is

and that's what uh we are basically focusing on. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you very much. I request guys a round of applause for all the

founders. Uh I'd request Praim Gupta to now come and present. Be generous with the applause at the questions both please.

Yeah, I mean founders are taking time out to talk about their product. &gt;&gt; Okay. Hello. Thank you ma'am for providing me this opportunity. Can I just

Okay. Hi everyone. Uh my name is Praum. I am representing Papy Labs here. So, so just giving a simple example what Papy labs actually do is that uh for example you're today all coming to Bat Mandapam.

Now you must be using maybe if you are here from Delhi you might not be using a map but I am from outside Delhi. So I was using a map from it Delhi to Barat Mandapam. Now what happened was that it

all it said to me that these gates are open but these gates were all of them were closed. I was just looking around all over the parking areas and normally this is a common problem in the map

system today. What map system have done is that they have brought a great navigation system. So they you want to go at a particular place that could be anywhere all over

the all over the city you can go down there but that navigation would never be so much aware that the kind of awareness that you require. So for example that there could be a place that gates are

closed there could be something which is happening maybe a very heavy fog is there now that is not updated. What our company does is that we update the map any kind of existing mapping system in a

very instant way. How we do it? We we work on on a visual system. So for example our any kind of a vehicles which are having on the ground they have our cameras placed in. So these are simple

dash cams, CCTVs, anything which is visual we basically place all over the cities and we work only in the metro cities as on date or only on the major highways. We take out all the data and

we plot it over the map and then we not only place the videos or the images we categorize them. So like for example right now in Delhi we have we work with a there's a local transport here DTC

it's a Delhi transport company. So we plotted about 8,000 units and then we were getting like a like 100 pabytes of data from all these them and then we were categorized them so fast that you

basically see the entire daily life and the best part was that you can search from them what's going on there. So now what are the use cases that we that we brought probably three use cases in the

market. So for example there's a company called JC Deox. They own about 4,000 billboards all over New Delhi. The problem in all these billboards is these billboards come at a standard price. So

for example, you own like 10,000 billboards but you don't you usually sell it only on a like a basis of if it's a poss area then I will charge maybe more. If it's a less Porsche, I

will charge them less. What we brought is a new kind of pricing mechanism that you charge on the basis of impression count what digital ads brought for them and that's how we were able to increase

their revenue for about 40 45% because now they were charging more on the revenue basis. We worked with a company called autonomous car. So this MG motors they had a Hector Hector vehicle which

when they were renting in India back then they were bringing that thing in the autonomous set that they want they were bringing internet edge inside. One of the problems that they had was that

they had luxury passengers but they wanted to know that okay what is happening on the road like instantly even if it has a fog they need to know that okay divider is broken or not my am

I safe in there or not. So we started to update um there's a company called MAPMA India. We started to update their systems very fast. Third, we worked with a company like BCG. BCG is a consulting

firm which basically consults government to take decisions on the ground. What we told them that this is where the demand is there or this is where the capacity is high. That's how we brought a root

rationalization algorithm that's helped DTC on the ground to basically manage all their 8,000 buses to where they need to actually deploy more buses to so that they can increase the revenue. But the

second perspective was that they can uh more passengers can actually board the bus. So we update the map on the cases that they want. Now we have been penetrating in news. So normal daily

newspaper that you usually read on a regular basis there's a imagery that is attached to it in that images there's about 8 to 10,000 people usually just on the ground do a basic job is to collect

those images what we do is because we have a huge volume of videos that we have we just updating them and they we're creating a news out of it so like you want to search anything any news you

want to create you can create from it how we do it so one because this is are more of a product business. So um one of the problems that we faced in India when we were trying to scale this product is

that even everyone is talking about AI but today if I'm just going to be asking any single passenger just to put a phone in their car and provide us data none of you will do it and this was a very basic

problem. So we realized that people want it in India there's this perception is that they want to absorb they absorb the technology really fast but to give the give that information is very hard. So

we created a mechanism in which this customer started to supply the data by itself. So for example when we started to deal with passenger [clears throat] bus service passenger like local DTC we

started to give them passenger counting because the problem was that they didn't knew how many people come inside the bus on a particular bus stand where we need to run more buses. When we started to

deal with packages count so like logistic companies logistic companies use digital locks. So today any truck which goes all over the country the problem is that they put a digital lock

and then they expect that the uh the truck is safe but that digital lock even gets opened the any kind of a thing is not evidence in a port. What we added is a small camera in the in the particular

container that thing counted how many goods were getting inside and how many goods were not um like what was the exact tally value. uh that's how we we deployed in a highway sector. So here if

there are three sides of the data part one is the passenger that means we are getting city data if we are deploying in the uh logistic sector we getting highways data and if you're deploying in

the normal commercial cars we getting the lane information and the perspective was to just to get the front imagery the back imagery they use it for themsel and we are certainly not interested in that

part that's how we formed this entire information um one of the problem that we faced to one of our customers was So we reached to one of uh so Delhi police and we started to sell this in this this

entire platform. They started to Google that uh like basically they want to search everything that where people are not wearing helmets because they want to cut the chalance very instantly. Now

these things was that we created layers but we didn't had a system that we can create very dynamic layers for the p for that particular uh person. So what we did was we added that's where the LLM

thing came in that we started to describe every image and then internally we were searching everything for them. So like you have anything any idea in your mind you want to for example a

person comes to me he says to me that find me all the CCTVs in New Delhi find me street lights which are not working just prompt it out internally we are a video analytics company like we are so

we keep we running on a bare metal like 100 pabytes and then we're just processing them really fast and you can then the best part that we brought was let's start to compare like what changed

now and what was previously before like six days back, year back, what was the development going on and this is how the basically the end customer gets. So for example, if it's a

local bus passenger company, they wants to know that how many passengers actually board. So we we provide a system to them but internally we use a front camera system. So they use a fleet

management system then we brought Papi over the top. So this is an example that we brought with DTC. This this was funded by Jika. JK is an investment corporation which funds the government

of New Delhi and that's how we scaled in entire New Delhi. Um second thing was that if you want to know any count like where the pe where the how many cars have been gone through

or how many buses pass through that particular portion or where the two wheelers are or where the ambulances actually cross we started to take out every information all over New Delhi and

this is all real time. So if you want to do it today, you want to compare it for like last 6 months and then you want to track and target them, you can do all of it. So we we brought this base systems

because uh JCD Cox was the organization. So we a team of six engineers right now we're based out of IT Delhi if you want to. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Any questions?

[clears throat] &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So thank you so much for presenting. I am uh curious about

knowing that you mentioned a certain pabyte of datas that you're using and data you know is a very uh debatable topic right now after DPDP. So how are you handling that? How are you DPDP

compliant? Because you are going to give this to certain other businesses also. So because you are getting a lot of personal data too like getting images of people, getting images of the car

numbers and all of these things. So how are you DPDP compliant and ensure that? &gt;&gt; So um there are two things. One is that inside videos we never take out for the public information even though the

clients are ready to pay even 10 times over that value. Second thing is like this is the rule of popular labs internally. Second thing is only front data is used. Front camera data faces

are blurred. Number plates are also blurred. Uh second third thing is that right now uh we don't uh run on any AWS. So we don't use hyperscalers right now. We only use bare metal servers. So bare

metal means stacks in which we keep everything in Europe right now. So Europe hner we we have a like we have taken a a portion of their data centers. And the second thing uh so in India

there's a big problem. U one of the things that people say that okay GPUs are lot but the reality is that GPUs are uh the the companies which are actually selling these GPUs never purchase from

them rather purchase from CAD so CAD is a organization called Arawat Arawat is providing a supercomput and like a bare dirt cheap price so if you're going to be searching on AAT just purchase their

GPUs and then keep data on bare metal on your security premises then it's very safe and it's very Okay, one more question and in the end we'll take more questions because once everyone's done

the presentation, please go for it. &gt;&gt; I want to ask I want to ask like what are the incentives you are giving to the dash cam holders like I heard you are giving

incentives to the local DTDC buses or like uh &gt;&gt; so we don't pay incentive they pay us. So like what is the leverage you are holding for them to

&gt;&gt; so for example uh so this company low DTC uh D transport corporation they burn about 80 crores every year on on not providing the timely bus service and uh they had a very low revenue like they

they burn about like they had a revenue loss about 800 like 18 800 crores as I had a talk with is Sachin Chandai back then he was there now is Jitendra G came in now what when we came into the system

we actually reduced on the revenue loss for them. So for example u if if you see this number 27 is the demand which is there and 25 is the capacity. So in India what happened was that when Amadi

party came in they provided female passengers as a free bus service. Now every party started to criticize all these parties that you are providing free for the bus service to the females.

We were the first company which actually gave them a mandate that 1% is actual female passengers are operating. So that's how they were able to save their lives. So that's when you know when we

came in we solved their lot of operational issues. &gt;&gt; We can access it through our apps or &gt;&gt; nothing nothing is possible sir. We are a pure B2B company. We never enter B2C.

&gt;&gt; Okay. Uh we'll do questions at the end. Let's finish the presentations and uh okay quickly but short answer on your part. Yeah but short answer please.

&gt;&gt; So sir we sell on tile basis. So for example u this particular area this comes at 25 by 25 square kilometer. This starts at 1.5 lakh rupees per tile. This is for only valid for one day and this

usually multiplies at a volume at the company. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. So now I'll request Mal to come and present please.

Hello everyone. I'm Min Gupta from Easopy Solutions and so nice to see you over here. Uh who all are founders over here? Oh wow, so many. So uh we founders

founders who all are founders over here. So I love to be with founders. I know they they share the journey uh and the struggle they know it very well. So we

all three women um mostly known as three dvya because this name was given to us by Mr. Narendra Modi. So Minel Gupta I'm the founder N Fatma and Sheal Taras we all started uh

this journey our platform we have named it as Imagics AI. It's a AIdriven precision uh or imaging to treatment planning for cancer. So um we are HIPPA compliant. We have four patents in hand.

Uh we are ISO 13485 uh certified company. We also have Sedesco uh license. Talking about cited you people who are from medical field they might be knowing that uh there is a license uh

which is required when we want to go to uh when we want to take our solution to hospitals. So there is a ICMR agency that certifies uh your product that is software as a medical device. Once it is

certified then you can take it to any hospital. You can actually uh commercialize post that. So we are uh Sedesco certified. So uh talking about the problem we know uh there are around

20 million new cancer cases every year and there is no not like that doctors don't have the intent of solving the problem or uh taking cancer uh treating cancer

but the main problem is the shortage of clinical experts. We can increase the devices like uh diagnosis devices can be increased uh im imaging can be increased but the problem that is facing is the uh

shortage of expertise for oncology. So u and finally the treatment planning. hospital talking about that problem. Once a cancer has been detected, the patient is sent for city scan. Once the

P City scan MRI, once it has been done, then tumor board decides whether the patient has to go for uh radiation therapy or they have to go for uh surgery or the combination of both. I

can understand everyone can relate it because almost every family in India or world are having someone very near and dear who are facing through cancer and they have gone through the such

challenges. So what happens is because of this shortage it costs lives it cost lives or the stage of the cancer changes the either it changes from first level to second stage it changes because of uh

this unavailability. So this is where our solutions sol solution comes in. So this was our own personal experience where all three founders have personally experienced cancer through to some uh to

our near ones and we have gone through this radiation therapy where we had to wait in queue uh because of unavailability of specialist because of unavailability of treatment planning. So

this was a very big bottleneck. You can see over here uh once uh once a patient is uh recommended to go for radiation therapy there is a planning for to do for that radiation therapy. For this

planning there has to uh there is a manual process where wherever there is a tumor all the surrounding organs of tumor they are to be segmented and this is a manual process. I can proudly say

there I can proudly say that in India there is no one who is solving this problem and we we are the only one who have this solution. Uh here we uh we contour all the contouring is the

masking we mask all the organs which are on risk and are surrounding tumor. So here the main purpose is that all the organs that are surrounding tumor they should be saved because they are healthy

organs and radiation therapy should be as less as possible on the target uh on those healthy organs. So uh talking about the manual process it used to take somewhere around n 60 to 90 minutes we

have reduced it to at the max of 15 minutes. The reason is uh for complex uh radiation therapy when it is head and neck cancer it takes lots of time. So maximum 15 minutes and minimum 5

minutes. So we have reduced it here. Uh what we do is once the patient is diagnosed with cancer he goes for city scan. Tumor board uh city scan is been done. It is uploaded on our cloud. Uh

tumor board would uh have the access of this uh CT scan through our own uh diccom viewer. Uh diccom is the format uh through which this images can be seen. they decide whether they have to

go for city scan uh radiation therapy planning or surgery and we have various suits. We do AI analysis where do we do first level of analysis where we mention the load of the tumor and second level

of analysis is we have various suits we have X-ray suit neurosuit and alco which works on this uh scans and finally we give the final report. So this is our product

we have uh trained our um uh AI on about 5 million of data set in which around 30% is Indian data set and this 30% we gathered it from northeast region. So northeast region is very tough teranian

and we got support from NITIO who where we went and collected data. It is very tough taking off AI over there is very challenging because 4GB so we had to implement it onromise

solution so that we can get the data and we can uh help them solve that. So 30% of data we have almost deployed it in 14 states in India. We got our data 30% from that accuracy is around 92

to 99% depending upon the complexity. You can see this data. We are working in Gujarat in seven district where we are helping uh to scan uh to do uh uh CXR chest anal lung analysis where we have

helped uh we have helped we have sc made some where around 1 million of scans we have detected around 4,000 TB positive cases till yet uh in which there were around six uh lung cancer cases where

early intervention is still possible. uh we have done around thousand of radio radiotherapy plans till yet and talking about in last 3 months we had done around 50,000 of chest x-ray x-rays

where 2700 of TV were flagged so we could save uh TV these are live photos where handle x-rays and all are being done so I uh this was our solution was recognized first by Mr. Narendra Modi

and day before yesterday we were invited in Microsoft by Bill Gates to show our solution to him. Uh so we personally showed our solution to him and yeah we are taking it forward with him.

&gt;&gt; Thank you very much. Any questions? &gt;&gt; Um like in health tech I've observed that uh trust is a very big factor in terms of AI adoption and uh you seem to be implementing it across India. So how

do you make sure that the technology and the science behind is trusted by the people that the who are being benefited by? Yeah, I understand. So here our solution uh it's not we are not

replacing doctors, we are just assisting doctors. We have made their manual process easy process but final approval has to be done by radiologist. So it is human in the loop. We are not claiming

that directly our will solve the problem. &gt;&gt; Thank you. I'll request Vive now to come. Hi everyone. So first of all uh thank

you so much uh team Brookham Capital for organizing such a vibrant event and the energy is full of high in this room. I can see &gt;&gt; it can be higher though. I think

&gt;&gt; yes. So my name is Vive Gupta. I'm the founder and CEO of company called Industs AI. So we are building the voice architecture of uh India. So we are

basically building the whole layer of operating system of voice where all the layers like speech to text, text to speech, the LLM, speech to speech, all of this infrastructure we are building

right. So it's it is a common platform where anyone I said anyone can come on this platform and build their own voice agent as sir was asking the question about whether you are running a campaign

on Google you are put a number you can build your own agent by yourself right so it's a DIY platform where we are training we are primarily focusing on Indian languages because uh the problem

in linguistic problem in our country is if you'll see after each 20 kilometer dialect changes right so we are working with couple of banks banks, NBFCs right and whenever they run a campaign they

run a basically called cold calling in let's say Mojafaga region in UB right and whenever they call in Gorakur region the Hindi is totally different but global players like 11 laps or maybe you

know some different global players players like Azure and Google they are providing a generic Hindi but we need a company in India who can build the infrastructure of voice in our country

based on our directs and again so while we are building the infrastructure uh on our own GPUs and servers the hyperscalers we have uh inbuilt in our system so that's how we

are able to reduce the latency so we have uh some sub 400 500 millisecond around latency into the system which is like more human conversation you can feel it and you know the complete

analysis of the call is there right as soon as the call gets disconnected you will find the sentiment analysis of the call the outcome of the call and it will log into the system so what is the

expected outcome of the call it will uh go into your CRM. So the journey starts from your CRM and adds ends with CRM. You trigger the calls from CRM and it end with the CRM.

So again as I said like native uh direct mastery we have and we are ultra low latency and again you know cost uh we al somebody was al also asking question regarding how effective it is in terms

of cost. So if I talk about existing system cost we are reducing the cost up to 70%. Right? So up to 70% cost can be reduced and operationally you are enabled like 24/7 availability of the

system is there. System is multilingual right you don't need to have multiple people for different languages. single system can handle 24/7 and that's how you are able to you know reduce cost and

operationally efficient and you know the important part is emotional handling right so like one year back I started this company 2.5 years back right I used to be a director

of an engineering company in uh software company in Bangalore and 2.5 years back I quit and started industry is from IIT Delhi right so the the core problem was emotions right when I

started this company I always thought like if somebody's laughing over the call how would AI system would recognize the person is happy or angry. That's how the agent would say sorry or or

congratulate because you need to understand the emotions right. So we were working on this speech to text model since last 1.5 years and on the 16th of this month in the bhart mandam

only we launched this uh model called it's basically you know emotion aware st. So we launched this model here in bhandpam only and we are basically you know distributing it to our customers

existing customers now so that they can start using it. It's p phase right now. And the good part is since we are an Indian company the all the data is going to reside here on our uh sovereign uh

field is there right so we are pure Indian origin company so as I said like if I if I compare with know global players like Google and 11 laps so we are cost so like let's say I

I I hope many people knows what 11 laps is right their cost is somewhere around 8 rupees per minute right but we are 70% lower we we we sell at 2 rupees per Right. And we are superior in terms of

Indian dialect accuracy and uh the streaming latency is uh somewhere around 300 to 400 millcond and emotional expressiveness is already there in our system as we recently launched it and

Indian data residency clause is obviously there because we are an Indian. So uh I mean so we are a use case agnostic platform. We are we don't say

like we are having mastery in this use case you can come on our platform so like as as of today we are working with multiple use cases right we are working with banks we are working with

enterprises in FMCG we are working with you know customer support people they are building their own voice agents but they use our ST and TTS through API right so not anyone can build ST and TTS

so instead of using 11 laps they use us because we are cost effective and obviously good in terms of Indian dialect uh mastery so uh it's DIY platform anyone can come

and build their own agent we have different flows workflow is already there you can create nodes each node can be connected with web hooks or API and that can be connected your CRM so it's

completely guided journey and you can create and you can also integrate your voice agent with telephon so we have already partnership with uh Airel and uh Jio so that's how you can give the SIP

channels through there and connect with your voice agent so it's complete end to end journey And again uh so the core uh market is B2B enterprises right and we are also

platform for developers. So developers can use our APIs into their existing systems wherever they want to use right. So usage based API and it is again per second based costing is there. So as how

many seconds you will use you will be uh the credits would be detected. So it's a recharge based system you recharge and you can use it and also we are into we are building

channel partners as well. So like we have couple of partners one is in Dubai, one is in Germany. So we are wideleing our platform for them right. So they can onboard their clients on their platform.

Internally they would become our client shared client and we can share the revenue. So we have uh right now we have developed four to five partners globally. So we are building from bhat

for the globe. So we have foreign languages as well. We have Arabic, we have German, we have French and Mandarin. Mandarin is in building stage right now. So we have core uh and

English all the accents. We have Australian accent, uh British accent, American accents, all the male female voices. And again you can clone your your voice as well on our platform.

Yeah, this is it. Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Any questions? Quick questions. Any questions? Yeah. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. It's a no code platform.

It's a journey based platform. you need to uh trigger what you want to do what you want to basically build out of it. So let's say you are you want to build an agent for inbound agent for your

leads right so anybody who is calling from Google ads would land on the voices end so you will define the journey and how you want to integrate let's say you want to some meeting has been fixed for

your product right so it is connected with Google calendar your Google calendar so as soon as AI agent books a meeting your you will get an email on your Google calendar this meeting has

been fixed and your Google calendar will be pro &gt;&gt; so my question is like I have to make this like uh there are some nodes I have to connect this and make a pro or you

have all thing are made up. You just have to click and the agent will start working. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. It's like DIY platform and we have tutorials as well, right? If you

are stuck, you can see the tutorials. So, and still you are feeling know you you are not able to build it, you can support the customer center. &gt;&gt; So, our team will help you in that case.

&gt;&gt; Okay. Quick question. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Sign of the data set you trained your model at number one and number two connected. Can you just share your uh you know story a little bit your story

your business story but how did you start when you start left your job &gt;&gt; we don't have so much time you can talk to him off offline but the data set question I think

&gt;&gt; I'll make it short right so so so journey started 2.5 years back right so I initially started with building voice agent and started using TTS of somebody else right then we figured out like this

TTS is having this issue how can I solve this because you know my customer will ask the issues complaint to me right so we were not able to solve this problem of you know pronunciation of some words

right because these issues were there already in the third party system right so we thought of initially building our own infrastructure and we pivoted in a model that people will use our APIs

that's what we want to build it right so then firstly we used public data publicly available data then we started creating our own data right so we create the data and we have multiple

hyperscalers available and scalability wise our system is so much scalable that you can you know put thousand requests at a time it will handle so it will scale 0 to th00and within 10

So that's &gt;&gt; thank you very much and thank you so much for all the engaging uh questions that everybody did make the effort to ask. Uh we are time constrained over

here. So we'll just I want to thank all the founders for sharing uh your product and any questions you have for the founders please do connect with them and do continue the conversation. It's just

that we need to leave the room. So and I'll request uh all of us to do a quick picture together. &gt;&gt; [applause]
