## 📝 Summary

The Adda is a forum for AI founders to move past polished narratives and into candid, practical exchange. It is designed to surface what is actually working, where real friction exists, and how the ground is shifting as teams build products, hire talent, navigate regulation, and scale. The focus is on lived operating experience shared honestly, peer to peer so founders leave with insight, not soundbites.
