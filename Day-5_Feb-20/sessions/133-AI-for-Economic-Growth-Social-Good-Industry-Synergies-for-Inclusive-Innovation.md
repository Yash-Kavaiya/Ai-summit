## 📝 Transcript

case you would think it'll create access, it'll democratize access to healthcare. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Both in terms of price, in terms of

availability. That's great. Uh Kitika, over to you. Um &gt;&gt; tell us about yourself, the organization and your take on AI for good. &gt;&gt; Sure. Thanks. Thanks, Kavi. Uh really

happy to be here and privileged to share the stage with each of you. Um I'm Kitika Sanani and I work as chief of staff at Intersection. Uh I've been in the development sector for about 10

years. uh started in the corporate sector uh serving investment banks in another lifetime. I'm also a teach for India fellow. Uh so I joined teach for India and decided to not look back and

continue with this sector uh and in fact have spent have been associated with intersection for almost 10 years now. Uh intersection as Kavi also alluded to uh we work with governments on making

social protection accessible to vulnerable citizens. Uh the end goal is that we ensure that welfare is delivered to them during critical life moments for the household such that they can they

are able to actually tide over moments of crisis and make the most of moments of opportunities like education uh or health care um to ensure that they've they're trying to codify pathways out of

poverty for themselves and their families. Uh the government is the protagonist in our work. Uh because of course you know they are the biggest implementers of social protection. We

are the enablers. We come in with tech solutions uh policy redesign solutions, capacity building solutions as a team. Our model is to embed these solutions within existing systems instead of

creating parallel systems. And that is what we are about. We've worked with about 18 state governments uh working with currently uh actively working with national ministries like labor uh and um

ministry of social justice and empowerment um and yeah very excited to be here. I think when I listened I heard about the prompt kavi as what uh AI for good what does it mean to us really it

actually is uh about enabling equitable access uh for vulnerable citizens to social protection. Uh right now they take about 10 steps 10 burdensome steps to access a

single entitlement. How do we bring that down to a single touch process? That is what AI for good stands for us. &gt;&gt; Great. I heard access you're talking about simplicity and speed. Uh I'm

really curious to find out more themes as we keep talking. Thank you Kitika Himman. Should you over to you? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Uh thanks. Thanks Kav and uh and and thanks to I think the government of

India for sort of managing such a humongous uh event. Uh I know as a matter of fact because we've been part of the planning team almost a year's preparation has gone into it. Uh right.

So kudos to everybody who's sort of pitching in in their own respective uh roles. So I'm Manu I I come from an organization called utnovation mission which is uh the federal body that

manages innovation for the country. Uh we are hosted under NITO which is the public policy think tank of the government of India. Uh innovation mission was the brainchild of the

current prime minister honorable Modi G. uh 2016 uh when uh we felt as a country that you need a body for innovation that cuts across all ministries all life cycles right so you essentially it works

from school to startups when I say startups even the high-tech startups like space so we're going to celebrate 10 years uh next week uh right the new title that we have sort of decided for

ourselves is school to space right so covering almost everything u I'll not drain by talking too much about the programs uh that we do maybe we'll we'll talk it in in a bit. Right? I think for

for me and and for the organization as a whole, right? Uh because you're also house within uh a government institution, right? So social good means that whatever AI is trying to enable,

right? Is it having some impact at the grassroot level uh right whether we work with incubators like T-Hub or startups directly uh or the state government. So I I also lead a program called setting

up of state innovation missions for example where the idea itself is that how do we move beyond uh the current level of innovations that is happening right how do we bring every part of the

ecosystem together and put a layer of AI not only AI I would say all frontier technologies right for example when we when you talk to matured states in the southern and the western part right

there's there's huge conversation around quantum &gt;&gt; right there's huge conversation around uh uh even AI for health for example uh Right? There are conversation where uh

can we enable AI to improve the public service delivery for example uh right where what we say we are not building unicorns but we are building uh or we saying not unicorns in terms of

valuation but in terms of social capital right uh where we say that can it start impacting a billion lives &gt;&gt; right yeah &gt;&gt; so I'll I'll I'll pause here

&gt;&gt; no this is great him thank you we heard access we heard simplicity and speed uh you talked about scale and infrastructure uh because that's the mandate with which you know

organizations like a IM come from um I'll talk about one bit on you know what we see at T-Hub we have understood this very clearly that you know um as Dub as organizations you know even like AI IM

uh the the goal is not for startups to be verticals or horizontals uh startups MSMES uh nonprofits uh you know I think we're all here as vehicles uh you know to to to implement all this uh of

economic growth uh if you talk to startups they don't talk about policy &gt;&gt; uh they talk they don't talk about you know infrastructure they're talking about building uh when they're talking

about building they just want to solve problems uh they want to create value and I think AI has become a supercharged tool right for startups to do that um so the point I was trying to bring out at

least from our experience with startups is that um at least in the last 15 years this is uh it's we see it all as a wave but it is probably the strongest tool uh you know that startups have ever had

access to right and a lot of social impact startups uh you know if you look at even if you look at the Swiggies of the world and Zomatoes uh and if you take a step back and if you look at uh

what they're talking about on social media in the last let's say a few months both positively and negatively you will see the major uproar is about gig economy and I was reading an article on

the economist which said that we are one of the only countries or economies in the world where the gig economy has become a true form of employment Right? So people are talking about

minimum wages, they're talking about, you know, labor treatment, they're talking about human rights, they're talking about all of that. Now, who would have thought that a food delivery

company, right? Uh food delivery, multiple food delivery and grocery delivery companies will actually create an organized labor market &gt;&gt; in our country. So that's the lens that

we take for startups. Um um I I will hand it back to you. I I have a question for some of you based on what you said, but I will also drop in one theme here. Now uh when I said AI for good I think

uh it obviously means AI for good impact uh you know for economic growth but it also means AI for good which is the other way to you know interpret the English of saying that it's here to stay

&gt;&gt; it's here forever uh and it is our job to now figuring out what to do with it right and I'll quote I think Nandan Nilken yesterday said something about you know uh either it is a race to the

top or race to the bottom with AI uh and I think the only way to go to the top is to focus on impact Right. So, Kitik, I want to pick this up with you. Um um we know that Indis action when you talked

about equitable rights, you talked about social protection. You talked about welfare and access to welfare and reducing 10 steps. Tell us a little bit of the work that you've done in RTE. I

don't think the audience is aware. Uh talk about admissions. Uh and then tell us where do you see the biggest opportunity for reducing those steps in that example with AI.

&gt;&gt; Absolutely. Thanks. Thanks Kav for setting that up. Um so intersection uh started with the right to education act. There is a specific clause under it. Uh it's called section 121c. Uh all of most

of you would have watched this movie called Hindi medium or English medium both versions. Uh so it essentially mandates that 25% seats in private unedited schools be reserved for

children uh from economically weaker sections and disadvantaged groups. Now um we picked this sliver of a large constitutional mandate which is section 121c and with a fundamental belief in

the power of choice for parents from vulnerable sections of the society to put their children in a school of their choice and not whether it's public or private and that with that spirit with

that spirit which is also uh part of the letter and spirit of section 121 we started working uh on this particular right. So we started our work in Delhi. uh I think we very we started with

running uh on ground awareness campaigns and very early we realized that for about we were able to mobilize about 19,000 applications in 2013 2014 in Delhi of which only

196 students got a call for admissions &gt;&gt; and this is a constitutional right &gt;&gt; this is a constitution &gt;&gt; this is their huck to get into the school

&gt;&gt; that was a huge eye openener for us and we realized that only by working with citizens and parents we are not going to be able to solve this problem because I think the government system also needs

streamlining and support and they were really trying to also there was willingness to execute but the government is also really constrained for resources uh tech capacity and so on

so we went there and you know fortunately the government showed willingness to actually experiment with a full online approach Rajasthan government had already done it. So some

of the peer effect also worked in our favor and that's when we introduced uh what we call the RTEM MIS that was our first solution. We've now actually uh it's now evolved into an education

digital public good. It's an open-source modular product that we've launched for any government to adopt. But what that did was uh what parents were going through was they had to it was this

particular act. It actually works on a lottery mechanism for selection. So the draw of lots the school has to do and the parent has to go to 10 schools that they have applied to to actually see

which child has if the child has been selected in A, B, C or D. We cut that entire physical transaction and we got a digital lottery integrated which is actually our secret source. Yeah. Um and

that particular module has now was now adopted in some shape or form across 18 states uh that we've sort of worked with. How many applications in total and children in schools now?

&gt;&gt; Children in schools now are about 900,000. Nine lakh children. &gt;&gt; Nine lakh children from 196. &gt;&gt; From 196 &gt;&gt; 10 years ago

&gt;&gt; 10 years ago and states we actually when we started um we we made an exit from our first state which is Delhi and then Uttakhan. Uttan adopted our endto-end system. Uh

we took about 7 to 10 years. Now we've shortened that entire cycle to 3 to four years. And tell me kitika to pivette uh what is AI giving you as a tool to simplify and scale what you just

described. &gt;&gt; I think what uh we've actually now moved it to the next level by saying we are now focusing on who are these children who are applying to this right are they

the most vulnerable so it's the challenge of discovery that we are using AI to for improved targeting for the state &gt;&gt; and how using targeting AI and

targeting. So AI in targeting what we are currently experimenting with is we have a WhatsApp chatbot. It's a multilingual chatbot which is uh which serves as a first interface uh for the

students or the parents to apply to and also using frontline building frontline worker capacity. What that does it it actually reduces the role load of the overburdened frontline worker with

respect to reaching out to these students as well &gt;&gt; and also uh being able to target the most vulnerable with respect to uh just having that multilingual advantage

having a physical touch point if I'm confused to you know actually reach out to somebody to navigate this system and then apply uh to the different &gt;&gt; so so the path from 196 to 9 lakhs was

about 10 years but I'm getting I'm understanding understanding that from 900,000 to 9 million will be much shorter. It wouldn't be 10 years. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. So there are 20 lakh seats

available under this particular right and the idea is every year &gt;&gt; annually 20 lakh children &gt;&gt; annually annually uh there are 20 lakh children currently there is about 60%

coverage when we started it was at the 30% mark so we've definitely made &gt;&gt; so AI will scale that and I think you didn't talk about this but I know from our other conversations that while AI

will help you drive this deeper and scale what you're also doing is horizontally the DPG the digital public good they have built in education This stack that they've built

&gt;&gt; is now being universally applied to other entitlements or constitutional rights. So we heard the example of education. &gt;&gt; Absolutely.

&gt;&gt; The dream I know it's called project name is UI. They want to build a UPI like so instead of United payments interface intersection wants to build a United entitlements interface. Think of

a dig locker meets a digiatra meets meets the constitution. You log in, you check your own uh you know eligibility and you can tap into a constitutional right and apply for it and actually get

access to something that is already rightfully yours. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Absolutely. &gt;&gt; This is phenomenal. Thank you so much for that. Uh Kitika Himmanuji we'll take

a step back. I love depth especially when people who are in action talk about it. Tell me where are you seeing pick a specific example and where are you seeing AI truly you know unfold you know

uh the real impact of what the work that you guys do. I have the same question for Raj Babuji after this. &gt;&gt; Okay. uh I'll probably step maybe two steps even further back right uh when uh

when the cabinet approved our extension in 2024 one of the programs that uh was really high on priority was setting up of state innovation missions right we did a couple of workshops and we

realized that uh there's a huge disparity between the western and the southern parts as at at one end of the spectrum and the northeast eastern and northern part of the country uh right So

Telangana, Andra, Karnataka, Maharashtra are already talking in a level which is more towards the evolved countries as a whole. Right? Let's not say that these are parts of India in terms of

technology enablement and even understanding of how this can be leveraged by a startup. Uh and when you take a diametrically opposite view to even the startups in northeast and even

eastern part of the country, right, they are really really not even at the basic level, right? even normal incubators right the concept of an accillator is slightly new to all of these uh states

uh so one of the first few state innovation missions that we we plan to set up are is in the northeast right uh and the eastern part of the country uh the first launch will be next week I

don't want to take the thunder away uh &gt;&gt; I know what's coming up we're talking to them about it you're launching a state innovation mission next week I won't name the state

&gt;&gt; yes correct uh and some of the conversation that we having with the state right uh and it's a very progressive evolved states uh not too much in terms of manpower or resources

uh because of the simple reason that all the good people migrate to Hyderabad and Bangalore of the of the country and don't remain uh in that state right uh but those who have remained back right

they're actually building something really incredible for the state itself right they're trying to solve some grassroot problems uh I'll talk something that is more relevant uh and

this is a conversation that happened about 2 months back when almost everything was set and uh and and the the idea was how do we sort of launch a hackathon which is a ministry backed

hackathon. Now the state of uh the state let me not name the state uh the water uh uh in this state has high content of uh iron right the idea was can we convert this into a hackathon and say

that leverage AI uh right to first identify the content of what in different parts of even the district so it's not talking at the state level going one level below district and even

one level below district to a subdist level identify what is the different uh uh level of iron or different types of iron and then build a hackathon where a startup can leverage this data that has

got collected uh right and build solutions two ways one a low cost diagnostic right can we build a a 100 rupee kit that can sort of diagnose this water uh right and second maybe build a

lowc cost solution to solve this particular uh problem uh other conversation that that started happening uh now the state has a lot of bamboo right in fact any of you would been to

the newer terminal at Bangalore airport. If you see all those beautiful bamboo things happening, it's come from all from the state, right? Uh the quality of bamboo

is better than China and Vietnam, but they only get about 110th or 120th the price, right? One, because they don't have access to market. Two, they are not able to uh even identify what bamboo

will sell where at what price, right? Can we link it to the global market? identify who needs what. So they're trying to create a dashboard for it, right? And that thought came because

when they realized that people have appreciated the bamboo that's gone into the terminal two of Bangalore airport, uh there could be a lot of use cases, right? Uh third element and this was

fascinating, right? Uh and and and this is something which is sort of uh not something to be proud of in government. We have a lot of data, right? Uh everybody knows we have a lot of data in

the government. Uh right, you're just trying to build a small funnel. uh right that what's the total number of innovations uh who convert to a startup and create the jobs right now from

startup to job is a sly slightly easier sort of maybe multiplied by 10 15 or even you you have the data for these 100 200 startup that are there in this district registered DPI IT startup the

first thought that uh that that came to my mind while I was talking to the secretary there he said let's look at innovation that are happening in the state now imagine the state has 120 130

startups but has 1100 documented innovations which are grassroot innovations right and these are validated innovations because the the overall

innovation is 3,000 which is better than a lot of states when we took it in terms of per capita than even Karnataka and Maharashtra I I come from a consulting background that's the first thing I did

was just divide it by the population right look at at a per capita thing was twice the the number from Maharashtra right uh and they are trying to solve problem which are very basic for example

They're saying that hey if we mix this plant and this plant that can lower your blood sugar &gt;&gt; I don't know some of them may be patentable some of them may not be

patentable &gt;&gt; but the idea is that even if 10% is is a good enough right so 10% of that thousand is about 100 it'll just double the number of startups

&gt;&gt; where the innovation is already existing right somebody has just to commercialize that innovation right &gt;&gt; uh right and and this number sits on the national innovation foundation dashboard

&gt;&gt; right which is which were and the state government had no clue about it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That oh these many innovation and then we said can we divide it maybe district-

wise. &gt;&gt; Right. And allow the district collector to monitor what innovations are happening uh and then collect and connect to maybe startups or people who

can commercialize it better. &gt;&gt; And a lot of this you can now supercharge with AI. &gt;&gt; Which was slower before. And now we have multiple let me just say infrastructure

layers. Right. You have everything from 5G smartphone usage to the largest user base for chat GPT to you know I don't know if you know this number but 22GBs is the average usage uh of uh five

internet mobile data in India 22GB per month &gt;&gt; correct &gt;&gt; right and use super with UPI and now AI correct

&gt;&gt; and obviously this changes &gt;&gt; and the the other thing that we talking to uh uh this uh how can we enable AI to improve the public service delivery when I was talking about that right and

there's some broad use cases right simple cameras on on the traffic lights which uh monitors what is the flow of traffic at each hour or each minute, right? And link it. Can we sort of

automate that to reduce the consumption of petrol, diesel, whatever it is, right? And then show some savings and parally earn carbon credits. One very simple use case. Can we utilize for

example satellite imagery to identify how lakes are drying up, right? Or what is the water? Just basic image. Everything is available. It's not that we have to create newer uh things and

this is available with the government &gt;&gt; right one of the startups that we have funded at at art innovation mission uh is a startup that has created small sensors that are embedded in the

pipeline that tell you where and measuring the flow of water at each level maybe at every 10 20 30 ft that where exactly is the leakage right so that people don't have to go to that

pipe and then see oh where is it ringing let me just fix it up you directly go to that The next level that this startup is building is can we also look at where the leakage is happening for the

multiple times and look at what is the material right is there some more stress at that particular point of the pipeline to ensure that next time that you're building or repairing it the leakage

doesn't come from this particular part of the pipeline no this is great what I'm hearing from you is that first of all I can feel your sense of energy and excitement for the region upcoming state

innovation mission launch as well as the beautiful vest you're wearing today &gt;&gt; this is not the say that for the launch. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. We're not giving any hints. Um no, I was just going to say that what

you're saying is in like the pipe example that you talked about is that there are existing innovations. There are existing latent energy that startups have. There are real problems that can

be solved and AI is helping you know as an example tie all of this together. It's not just supercharging or fueling this but it's the glue that's bringing all this together. And and the best part

is that in truest sense this is democratization because AI will enable that Assam and Manipur or Megalia or Sikkim are at the same level at maybe Karnataka because if you have that AI

level on a data right and you want to take any data back decision for public good right it doesn't stop Sikkim to take that decision which Karnataka can take today and and the other very

important thing that we're trying to build within the state innovation mission is to create a peer-to-peer learning network right there could be something fascinating that Shikim can

offer in terms of organic vegetation or agriculture which can be picked up from the other agradian states. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. This is great. I'll um we'll go over to Raj Puj and then we'll break

for questions. Um you know we've heard the um building in public perspective from a nonprofit as well as a federal organization. I want to see the private/corporate you know and the work

you guys do in the foundation perspective Rajabuji on you already spoke about you know access you spoke spoke about availability in healthcare um pick an example that you're already

building towards uh and tell us what are you most excited about about how the products and services that you are building will truly unlock value &gt;&gt; see

&gt;&gt; for social good and economic growth always &gt;&gt; yes so I'll first touch upon one point see there is lot of concern and fear about AI I coming and uh taking away the

jobs right uh I think that's partially true but in a big picture it is not true see what's going to happen every time uh technology comes for example when humanity started as a civilization we

started there was only one industry which was agriculture &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; pre-industrialization &gt;&gt; exactly and then after that right when

When when the industrialization happened more opened up, right? It could have been seen then with the power it came it saw very disruptive right from horsepower to steam power that could

have been seen very disruptive to many people who were livelihood was depending on horsepower or bull power or whatever power it was. Same way from steam when it moved to electricity it could have

been very disruptive people whose business was all in steam uh coal and all that stuff they would have thought oh this is not a necessarily a good thing it's going to put all all of us

and even yesterday somebody was referring in early late 1800 they said we'll close the patent office because everything needs to be innovated has been already innovated there is not much

to do &gt;&gt; but then here we are almost 30 40 years later uh new things are unfolding. So I think you know like in the you know the many in the

forum leaders spoke a is a like another energy right like electrification it's going to do a big transformative change and there is not a thing it won't touch it will touch everything and it's going

to make everything intelligent and when some everything becomes intelligent largely very good things will happen very good things very positive positive things it's going to enhance the

livelihood or quality of life for many people and it's going to create lot more opportunities with that being said in the industry we are focused in right uh for example I will tell one example

which um we tried agileium one of the things we wanted to do is that so we work with pharma company biotech company one of the problems we were trying to solve I'll just give few problems which

we were trying to solve was not unsolve was not solvable at that time because of the technology as recent as four five years. H &gt;&gt; tell us more about this example.

&gt;&gt; For example, in 2018 we invested in a project um our our customers were pharma companies. It was reps. So the reps basically are going and meeting the doctors. They are supposed to know which

doctor they are meeting. um what was the last time the conversation they had with the de uh rep doctor and doctor said hey I wanted to know about this medicine uh what kind of adverse impact it could

have for the patients uh side effects it may have if I give it to the patient some technical details the doctor would have requested so they have to go back right and maybe talk about it give those

details and all that stuff but between two appointments sometimes it's 3 months to 6 months &gt;&gt; sure so they don't remember what happened So what we wanted is last time

conversation record it of course they have it in paper on Salesforce and all that stuff they may put it but then you're going today from the previous meeting you don't remember that you are

not accessible you are in the car driving and all that stuff so what we wanted to do is we wanted to do a AI where in the phone app it's implemented and you uh previous day like based on it

will look at your calendar it will look at who are all the doctors you are visiting And then it will go to the CRM. What was the conversation? Last two, three conversations happened with the

doctor. You take that and what you have to what homework you did on that. It will take all that. Then it will take as a voice memo. Morning 7:00 a.m. when you are going to meet the doctors. You play

that voice memo. It says, "Hey, today you are meeting so and so doctors. This is what was the conversation last three. This is what you are supposed to do." &gt;&gt; It's it's almost like a morning

presidential briefing. &gt;&gt; Exactly. Morning presidential briefing. And I got this idea based from that only right &gt;&gt; amazing

&gt;&gt; right but then at that time the technology available for me was um Lex it's called Lex is a pro offering tool AWS had released from Alexa so Alexa whatever they used to do build

Alexa they they gave that tool as a lick and then there was another technology called poly which also from AWS technology so we took these two technologies Y for our customers from

the AWS platform. They were there. We were trying to build it. &gt;&gt; It sucked at that time. The experience was really bad. Um because they could not understand the keyword, the the

medical keyword, it would not understand people's accent. It would not understand and reading structured and unstructured data because you have to read the unstructured data, structured data and

all that stuff. And you have to do it. It was not so great, clunky. Now, so we have to shelf that project. We I in we we invested almost a million and a half,2 million dollar at that

time. Multiple customers of ours and the experience when we took it to the rep, it was not so great. They did not &gt;&gt; Yeah. If it's not easy and usable, nobody ad

can you tell? Repeat it again. Repeat it again. Three times they will throw the phone. Right. It was like that. And when it got it also he did not understand it was bad because of the accent various

thing medicine technical. Now that has been implemented a year back with the AI super seamless &gt;&gt; and where do you see the impact of adoption of this technology

&gt;&gt; across the board everywhere because the everywhere if you think about it now right it can take you every individual every one of our individual let's say our calendar we can take we can create a

personal agent for us and it will look at the task it will look at our email it will look at our calendar and it will tell &gt;&gt; yeah this This is what you are supposed

to. &gt;&gt; I think a lot of people have begun to use that. &gt;&gt; Yes. And and and then now not only self an organization can create an agent for

each and everybody instead of manager going and telling each and every person hey you're supposed to complete this we can have their personal agent who is their agent buddy can tell them which is

a little bit private and more comfortable to hear. No, and and I think I think in healthcare in the service that you are in a continuous flow of information, highquality information

makes a huge difference in you know availability of the work that you're doing. &gt;&gt; Exactly. Access to medicine this is simple as accessibility information like

you said &gt;&gt; and scale. &gt;&gt; But then I'll take now another complex situation where we are working with another research institute in San Diego.

&gt;&gt; Yeah. where basically this is in the liver transplant where the patient basically is waiting there who is in the waiting list a longer time the donor comes in they would be matched now what

we are doing is a that is not the way because you know in the liver any organ transplant absorption of that organ is very difficult because it's seen as a foreign body

&gt;&gt; receive it &gt;&gt; yes the foreign body and the body will all the it will reject it try to reject it making it accept is very very big problem. So then you need to look at the

biologics of both the patients. You see who is most conducive from a biological point of view to receive this organ. &gt;&gt; So there are parameters biological parameters and physiological parameters

that now you can do a match &gt;&gt; and there are too many parameters to do in a simple old old algorithm it's very difficult. Now what we do and then there is a

multiple research papers. &gt;&gt; How far along are you on this matching for organs? Now we we are helping a institute one of the top institute in San Diego scripts with lot of noble

laureates from medical are there one of the researchers actually from India um it's published so I can quote his name is Sunil Kuran he has published and he has implemented this with this and with

the AI now he has told based on the patients donor and the patient the AI can tell who is the best receive strongest match and their livelihood the organ after that they will have a better

living condition it it can predict based on various parameters which is not very easy to do so from a simple use case as information to very deep science &gt;&gt; you went from morning presidential

briefings to almost tinder for organs in in one shot no this is great I want to ensure uh Raj G we have enough time for questions we have a small audience here I wish we could take live questions

online But we don't have that facility yet. But uh any questions here a small audience any questions that we have very happy to take them. You can point it to a certain panelist if you like. Yes

please. We'll pass the microphones right behind you. Please uh tell us your name and you can point a question to any of us. &gt;&gt; My name is Yuvraj. Uh thank you very

much. Uh I have two questions. One is for Rajes G and one is for Kitik G. So Rajes G uh what medical breakthroughs do you believe will come up in the market in next 3 four years after this

integration of medical science and AI is is my question &gt;&gt; crystal ball question on healthcare and AI &gt;&gt; what was the question

&gt;&gt; what is the breakthrough on the healthcare medical side that you see it's a crystal ball question that might happen in AI that you're excited about your second question for kit

&gt;&gt; to critika g uh your initiative is very impressive what I want to know is is the average poor person somewhere in the rural area is he aware of your initiatives or if not then in what time

frame do you believe that you'll be able to reach that person &gt;&gt; awareness question I'll add a flavor to you Raj's question of saying can that awareness be unlocked further with AI

&gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; we'll first start with Raj Babuji please go ahead &gt;&gt; yeah um thank you very good question appreciate it see I think definitely we

lots lots right it's going to be very transformative it is going to be both in the healthcare side. First the healthcare right I think the primary health care lot of it will move to AI

right I think through uh our AI basically doctors will start creating the doctor agent and first your questions your personal doctor agent will address it basic and then based on

that your personal doctor agent your doctor's agent will now next contact the doctor if there is a need I I have a feeling that the doctor's agent will talk to your patient's agent before

&gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. &gt;&gt; before it comes to the two humans. Exactly. &gt;&gt; Let us assume. &gt;&gt; Exactly.

&gt;&gt; So what is the breakthrough for you in that? &gt;&gt; You see I that basically the access no waiting especially you know in the western countries the waiting some of

these specialist is unbelievable we would not have heard in India they wait for 6 months to one year &gt;&gt; right that's the waiting time for surgeries too.

&gt;&gt; Yes. So I think that would definitely transform and then also is like talked about one of the things sir talked about the bamboo situation why not a global healthcare like why

can't be there be a marketplace immediately they can reach and there is a doctor of course already that is happening but that can happen in a much much greater level because these agents

of AI could be sitting at hospital level doctor level patient level &gt;&gt; as a patient I may not be AI saving to reach a various things but my AI agent avatar which I have created if we can

create in some easy way that would reach it and definitely you know address it &gt;&gt; no I think you you brought up a very important point and we'll go to critikica right after is that what

you've said is that in in highly skilled professions where human capacity is uh at a very significant uh you know scarcity um that capacity can be unlocked to a

further level simply because you you know, agentic will come in. No, that's great. I hope you ra the first questions answered. If you want to add on, I just add on to what you were saying, right?

Uh I think we we were doing a joint program with uh Swiss Next, which is uh the Swiss arm of uh the embassy of Switzerland here. &gt;&gt; Uh and and this was like a exchange kind

of a program, right? And and one of the Indian startups that actually spent a week in Switzerland, what they're trying to create is look at all the profile of cancer patients, right?

and start mapping uh that to the DNA and and start predicting what is the probability right so they have created a test uh uh it seems uh still at a validation state what is the probability

of you getting cancer looking at all the data patterns that they have in the database right uh and and they feel that this will sort of enable a much faster &gt;&gt; cure for cancer because you'll be able

to predict it much better. &gt;&gt; Yeah, Kitika over to you. I'll expand's question again. I'll recap. I think he's asked something very interesting and important is can in a country of a

billion plus people despite the availability of technology awareness of important interesting impactful things continues to be a challenge. Given your experience at Indis action, do you feel

u there is an awareness problem based on the work you've done with now nine lakh students and uh can that awareness challenge be leaprogged using AI? Over to you.

&gt;&gt; Absolutely. Absolutely. No, this is a really relevant question and something that we are very actively working on. So what we're saying is we want to flip this question.

Whoever the citizen is, citizen could discover that the citizen has to discover the scheme. &gt;&gt; Can we use AI and tech to flip this and

say can the state discover the citizen? &gt;&gt; Fantastic. and building in those layers of AI ML into existing data which is exhaustive and it is with the state to say that what if I layer your VBG Ramg

or URSTW MGA data with PDS repository with say uh aspirational district data and say in this district almost 95% citizens are eligible for this particular entitlement

&gt;&gt; and this currently happens for demographic longitudinal research &gt;&gt; absolutely &gt;&gt; it is not used for actual access &gt;&gt; absolutely and actually there is an

organization so educate girls has a model wherein they've been able to use ML to be able to identify and pinpoint to say these are the districts which need an intervention these are the

districts where we have the most number of out of school girls &gt;&gt; so so awareness will flip &gt;&gt; to actual targeted outreach &gt;&gt; that is exactly what we are now trying

to attempt with the state the problems of validation verification of citizens are they eligible not can we use AI IML tech to be able to flip this and say let tech enable the state to discover.

&gt;&gt; Fascinating. And that will also reduce the 10 steps. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. In one in one single shot. Exactly. What an answer. Love this. I think we can take one more question. We

have a few minutes left. We have two we'll take two. Keep your question short and point it to you know uh whoever you want to ask. Please go ahead. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Thank you for a valuable session.

Uh I just wanted to ask that u there are a lot of startups in India but in which sector you think there should be more startups but but aren't currently &gt;&gt; great question great question do you

want to answer it you and I can pick this up you go first and I'll follow which sector lo largely defined loosely defined do you think there's a huge volume opportunity for founders

&gt;&gt; okay uh I think there it is at two level one is if I define sector by what we traditionally call a sector let's say edtech or a health tech or the second would be is it like a frontier AI

nonAI kind of a thing right uh so if you look at uh the current sectors right what most startups are doing uh that's my personal belief not the organizational belief right what most

startups are doing is they're trying to or they were trying to chase venture capital money so if I felt that edtech is hot today let me go edtech today that Same thing is for deep tech right just

enable some element of AI or some element of deep tech and say I'm a deep tech startup right the point is not that so I think one founders should look at some problem to solve I'm not saying a

social problem some problem some gap that they feel with the current ecosystem or the current startups are not fulfilling or create your own niche that's one second what some of our

programs also do and I did talk briefly about it is the social kind of a thing right uh do we create solutions solutions that can sort of enable or solve for problems in India because a

lot of problems that we solve for in India or in Indian context are replicable to the global south because similar per capita GDP, similar environment, similar diversity, similar

price point. You want to &gt;&gt; No, that is great. Uh very very interesting perspective. It's a fantastic question. Um I'll just answer it with one simple perspective. Uh

foundership is a long journey. uh even if you look at the current IPOs they were all been building for 10 15 years um AI will not shorten that journey but will make impact faster I believe so I

think given the world that we are in right now and this massive phenomenal super tool that we're getting I think founders should build things that take time because that can be accelerated now

uh these are essential problems if I have to pick sectors I would say healthcare and education and not because we have them here but uh I think even if 10% % of the talent that's currently in

fintech or is currently in consumer tech I think if they move to healthcare it could be engineers founders investors it will fundamentally change this you know what this country can do and needs and

it's the same for education I don't want to say unemployment but we have a massive massive young talent pool the largest in the world uh if we can change you know as founders and as startups we

can build more tools for education I think we will unlock a superpower you know for our country so So I think that's where founders should go. Thank you. One last question you had on one to

ask us. &gt;&gt; Hello, I'm Yashi. I wanted to ask one question anybody from the panelist can answer. My question is how can we ensure that AI systems deployed for public

welfare do not deepen digital divides especially for rural and marginalized communities. &gt;&gt; What an amazing question. AI can deepen divides. I will use the I'll take the

generosity to not just say digital. It could be economic, social, uh you know, cultural uh there are many divides that exist in the country. How can it ensure uh Kitika do you want to take a shot at

it? Given that you're in the welfare space, I'll ask maybe all of us can give a quick oneline 10-second rapidfire answer on what can we do ahead proactively for reducing a potential

digital divide thanks to AI. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I think u two perspectives. uh one is in our solutioning when we and I'm going to take a live example when we actually embed say a lottery algorithm

uh within a state uh what we tend to do is we also have this equity algorithm to say that the gender ratios are going to be balanced. It's going to be the girl and the boy are going to have a 50/50

application rate there. Right? or to say that this is going to be the percentage of you know children with special needs uh or uh children from say soioeconomically weaker backgrounds or

like SCST OBC. Um so one is like how do we proactively embed these algorithms to be able to address what you've just suggested which is also a a problem that we actively work on and the other is I I

definitely feel that we cannot discard the human in the loop. I feel like AI has to make their jobs easier. Give them my my Anganadi worker or my Asha worker. They need to have access just the way um

you know uh Raj Babuji was referring right. They have information which is so simple and so easy to disseminate that they don't have to spend hours and hours parsing through these complex uh say

eligibility criteria for welfare schemes and so on. So I think those are the two perspectives that I &gt;&gt; Fantastic. Fantastic. You you're basically saying build a pro social

equity bias into AI. &gt;&gt; Rajuji, do you have a quick rapidfire answer to this? &gt;&gt; Yep. Um thank you. I want to also answer the previous question because that was a

very good question. I'll quickly touch on that and come to this. See, I think u like uh uh Kavi told the don't chase the VC money. I mean it should be always see the monetization should follow the

value. What you should be focusing is are you creating a value &gt;&gt; and what is happening is many are chasing the monetization and missing the value. Are you making a difference? If

you are making a difference and wherever it is whatever small it is like he said health tech especially a lot of potential is there we need to be making different disruption there. So focus on

that but there are others also and then to this &gt;&gt; on digital divide and social equity &gt;&gt; on on the digital divide I think AI with the phones already everybody has a phone

now almost everybody is going to have a smartphone if not already they have it once they have a smartphone they have AI so AI is not going to divide if anything it's flattening everybody out for

example the people with the computer engineering they were in the pedestal programmers now it has brought innovation Not only for a programming person, it has brought down to

everything. If anything, a AI is the biggest equalizer. It is not a divider. Fantastic. Himmanuji, any view on that? What can we do proactively? &gt;&gt; Yeah, I think I think sort of agree to

to what everybody has talked about. I think with with AI and the smartphone and we are one of the largest consumers of internet, right? It has sort of democratized the the divide between

rural urban. I think there's one more divide which we which we generally don't talk about is a language divide right there 22 languages no other country in the world has 22 shidu languages right

and this is just shu languages in a state like up it looks like Hindi but you travel from the western part to the eastern part the dialect changes right uh so that's another divide that

probably is being sort of democratized by AI for example and and and everybody's building solutions around it right all the LLM models that are being developed both by the government and

even some of these larger uh companies that want to look at our data. Uh right. So it in the future I think one thing that we need to be very very cognizant about is which we I started with right

the divide between the western and the southern states at one end of the spectrum the eastern and the northern states at the other end of the spectrum right the the challenge is that a lot of

mentorship VC money all that has not reached them right so they're still trying to build those native solutions which is not bad right but for them to really equalize with some of the other

states That's where AI is going to enable and and some of these state governments are are building and all of us are sort of playing our own little roles in that.

&gt;&gt; This is great. You've brought it all together. Himmanu G. We'll wrap this panel now. I think AI is here for good and it's our duty to build AI for good and uh what an interesting conversation.

Uh the divide is a matter of what we do. Uh and it's great to have all your perspective. Thank you everyone for joining us um and for this conversation. Let me just

&gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you. &gt;&gt; This is It comes with the photo of the That's why they take it at the start. You can check it out,

&gt;&gt; please. Thank you. Thank you.
