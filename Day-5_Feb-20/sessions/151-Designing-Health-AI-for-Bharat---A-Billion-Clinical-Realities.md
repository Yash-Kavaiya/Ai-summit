## 📝 Transcript

Thank you very much for having me here at this very very prestigious event. I just came in from Mumbai in the morning and uh what I see over here is uh I mean I think uh it seems to be the microism

of the globe in fact. So thank you very much. Um yes I think u you know I take all these compliments on behalf of Max uh and it I think it starts uh and ends uh with the trust which is uh sort of uh

reposed by patients at our hospital system. Today our occupancy is at least 10 to 15% better than the next best player uh in the hospital system. uh and you know uh one of the things that I

want to point out is um you know AI seems to be sort of uh the buzzword of course today but five or six years ago uh when we started our journey uh we started bringing digital technology at

that point of time to the core and what you see today what you experience and you know you mentioned better outcomes and perhaps uh uh patient services but uh that is what you experience what you

don't see is the technology behind it and I think that is the true test of technology and that will be the true test of uh of u of AI as well when you don't uh uh interface with technology

but uh the experiences are improved uh having said that I think uh you know uh like I said you know we started this journey uh a few years ago we started by uh creating a commonsized data lake uh

for all the patients have which have been through our doors over the last 15 years uh and which are doing so on a on a real-time basis today. Uh having said that uh you know these were our

attempts. We tried to sort of create a closed loop uh uh system like Google uh so to say for our doctors and our patients. uh but you know we we like many people faced uh uh very early very

big setbacks because when we used to do search results we used to get zero uh results in the search engine you know because it wasn't sort of native to the language and that's stuff that we've

been playing with but having said that I think uh uh the early days of AI uh are going to impact tasks rather than uh although uh you know one is moving towards uh institutional adopting it

from EOS ecosystem standpoint from uh you know inculcating it within the institution so it becomes a intrinsic part of the institution but I think today what uh uh it's affecting our

tasks it's affecting tasks of efficiency um you know we've already started doing predictive analysis of beds which are vacant and available and so on uh it's working with um on safety measures I

think though the early sort of wins that we have especially uh with respect to uh patient satisfication of the risks and so on I think uh uh clinical support um you know it's uh data collection a lot

of time by clinicians was being spent in the past to collect data uh now a lot of that data is being collected through uh through uh you know uh through forms which are in our apps today uh and you

know you can speak to them it kind of collates it in a particular manner. So uh the clinician actually spends less time in perhaps gathering history uh than in providing a little more you know

value up the value chain. Uh great and I think um um Max I mean as you mentioned there is this data lake that you have created is uh quite ahead in terms of digital adoption and I'm

sure uh when you would be starting and and this is a term that we use and see quite a lot that adoption of digital in a hospital. So is that what is also happening on top of this large data lake

and the EMR solutions that you have created on uh for max is there like a AI adoption wave uh that is happening and do you think like when the digital adoption happened uh things such as NAB

ABDM many of these things started coming up uh talking about policy talking about regulation uh in AI adoption Are there any challenges, any things that you see uh

that can help in uh this adoption to be much more faster or you see that uh people are just going uh all crazy on getting AI adopted in the hospital settings? No, I think u you know there

is a desire all across um you know but having said that desire does meet reality I would say more than occasionally and that comes in the form of failures which

are which are welcome sort of I mean we quite welcome it actually because the more you try the more you will fail and the more you would sort of have better outcomes coming into the future as well.

uh so we've had a lot of failures I can tell you uh you know whether it is the longitudinal data of a patient or looking at uh you know ICD11 norms you know tagging our data with respect to

the WHO sort of I mean we've been failing left right and center we've been reasonably successful as far as ICD10 is concerned but I think 11 um you know most sort of layers that available in

the market don't work the ones which work are very very expensive uh you know so we've started um you know we've been inousing a lot of this so we're toying around with it. I have no doubt uh that

uh uh the speed at which we are failing and the amount of failures that we have uh shortly we will run out of all excuses and failures and what will it'll be like Edison right you would have

found out every way to fail and I think perhaps the only way to succeed will be in front of us. Uh so yes there is a lot of enthusiasm uh you know towards adopting it. uh we see this as a future.

I think everybody does. Um there is u we of course have to be very very careful uh because unlike you know let's say something like education where if you're imparting perhaps uh incorrect

information you know it can be resolved but this is healthcare I think patient safety data privacy these things are right up there. uh we have to we have very very little uh u you know standard

deviation possible uh in what we do and so it requires uh a large extent of supervision I would say and perhaps it will continue to for years to come although it makes life easy for most but

uh you know from at least from a clinical clinical prescription outcome it will require uh a lot more supervision to come as well. &gt;&gt; Sorry. So can can is it now the priority

for hospital for example uh when the digitization adoption happened it was it used to be a priority for CEOs that okay you have to make sure that all the billings are online uh every uh you have

to have all the JCI u discussions and uh ID created and so forth. Is this a priority today? Uh adopting AI at hospitals and as a KAS for your CEOs or operators is is that what uh it has AI

reached that level today at at hospitals? &gt;&gt; No, I think clearly clearly it has uh and it's really out of uh I think two sort of uh uh drivers that I find at

least uh and you know this is at a very very at the outset level. I think one is the way the world the consumer behavior itself is changing. I mean a lot of the searches used to happen on Google a lot

of the searches now happening uh through different platforms altogether and the way they sort of seek whether it's they thought about your website or you know when they're looking if you simply ask

which is the best cardiologist in Delhi uh you know there was a different way of uh uh people reading into that earlier and there's a different way of people reading into it today. uh so you have to

whether it's your collaterals whether it's your digital assets and so on and so forth you have to make those changes uh information I mean if I look at ESG if I look at investor ESG uh how do I

improve my ESG score I mean it's like encyclopedia out there right you just ask it any question it tells you to do so how should I present my annual report how should I present myself uh I think

you know pretty much you know it is intrinsic to now everything that we do from that standpoint second is how do how can I use it as a tool uh to improve efficiency and these are lowhanging

fruits. I'm talking about the lowhanging fruits before we even in I mean kind of you know absorb the entire ecosystem or create that ecosystem or participate in that ecosystem make it a part of

institutional uh habits right I think even prior to that we'll be looking at it as a task stage uh you know how is it that I can improve now you know if I have a

particular waiting for my patients okay how can I do predictive analysis of room availability when I'm looking at discharge how can I sort of this thing when it comes to patient summary

How do I get how do I unlock the time that my doctors spend on patient sort of history and so on and so forth that all improves efficiency all improves outcomes all see eventually the lens we

are looking at it from is efficiency is accessibility is safety is clinical support and finally to the experience &gt;&gt; that's uh I mean it's it's quite a bit of bread that uh you're looking at uh uh

AI but and a little bit more on generic terms uh everybody says that technology is moving very fast or things are changing so fast AI is also changing so fast uh and we also keep doing that like

we want our businesses our operations our sales also run very fast is more your internal feeling uh how how are you feeling feeling are uh health institutions

moving as fast as the technology is moving. Uh even people uh in the organization be it uh doctors be it uh nurse staff all of them are looking at it and a lot of this is about India

summit as well because government is looking for educating people on how uh fast things are changing and we should all be ready for it. So what are your views on your institutional readiness

people in your institute and and in general on this whole uh AI moving fast? &gt;&gt; So I think first and foremost also depends on uh you know the institutional culture. Uh we are very clear about one

thing that we have to be more sort of circumspect about it than anything else. Uh we must go up the learning curve as far as AI is concerned. things are changing very very fast. We have close

to 43,000 healthare workers which provide healthcare. Um you know that means there are thousands if not hundreds and thousands of work processes

for us to adopt AI in any task means you know you have to change huge amount of attended work processes even if this layer sits on top. Uh and having said that okay is there something else which

is better out there is there something which will disrupt this further and so on should we wait for something to be adopted by and large to see sorry uh so to see what the efficacy of that is and

see what the uh you know see once it's sort of established before adopting it to me look having the first move advantage in this is not going to do anything but getting it right is I think

because we can't afford to get it wrong we these are human lives these people. So, um I think there's a huge amount of learning within the organization which is happening. Um and I I I meet you know

phenomenal people across the board. Okay. for various aspects. I think since the morning I today if I look at my sort of schedule 30% of my meetings would be people come you know from a technology

background uh pitching various sort of applications where our lives can be improved and outcomes can be improved and efficiency can be improved and so on and so forth but you know at the very

least you have to be very very circumspect about what you're going to adopt and what you're going to roll out. No and and I think you touched a very important point that we learned uh at AA

we were earlier uh did a travel startup me and Deepak what we realize that in health there is obviously innovation that people are looking for but trust is the

most important thing. I can bring a cool idea or there could be a cool way of doing a diagnosis at a clinic but I as a person would trust only the doctor that uh I have spoken to or have been uh

talked about. So there is this uh and that's the reality that we learned uh when we started doing health that yes innovation is definitely important but trust is key and I think max has uh uh

being trusted over the years uh and and to be very honest we also don't know how to balance that out uh the trust that has been created for institutions for doctors and Now these technologies that

are coming in where it asks questions to the patients and gives uh relevant next suggestions uh this trust factor is uh kind of getting a little sort of changed. um any views that you

have especially when it comes to uh people trusting doctors to AI to uh institutes uh any change that you see uh and even doctors looking for AI solution and whether they feel that this is uh

right now not as good. So uh you know I I I'll give you one example at most hospitals at least u once every couple of months you will have a patient who will come in okay

with uh a pain in the chest you do the ECG and uh the ECG to the doctor seems sort of normal he speaks to the cardiologist okay and the cardiologist says okay I don't see anything wrong

with it and the patient is sent home and he has a heart attack right because ECGs although they're extremely extremely common okay uh it can be very very nuanced so a expert cardiologist okay

may be able to catch a particular movement there okay while somebody else may not but and even the expert cardio on a good day may be able to catch it on a bad day not right now uh I'm not

saying AI in its sort of this thing is complete but when patient comes to ER. Okay, I think it's absolutely necessary to use that tool. Okay, because that tool says requires admission. Okay,

whether the patient doctor sees it or not, admit him. Okay, look, by the end of the day, you may admit 150 instead of 100 actual patients, but don't let that one go. I think that's the important

thing. You're able to if you're able to use this as assistive tool uh to augment your capabilities. Okay. And I think that is what is emerging today. you know I think it's a little too far out to say

whether it will replace the clinician or not okay but I think right now clearly that is a very very essential tool that you can use and let's start with safety before we go to efficiency or anything

else um you know so I I think a very very simple example like this okay and it depends it starts with leadership moves to institutional sort of habits uh okay to be able to adopt something like

that change your work processes because the teen amount of work processes which have to change Okay, doctor when a patient comes where do you move when this sort of ECG report you move him to

the Kath lab okay and which is a 13 minute sort of this thing but that's also preparatory time right you're doing it within the golden hours you sort of move him into uh you know the ICU how do

you sort of interact with the doctor you have to call the doctor let's say it happens at 3:00 at night okay the doctor the cardiologist has to come from his home and so on and so forth so the

entire dance starts right &gt;&gt; okay but you have to make sure that you know you you can use this tool to on the side of caution but I I think at the very least that's what you need to do

today &gt;&gt; and I think you touched upon um like these this complex healthcare process and uh uh when we look at it from a technology perspective this is what AI

can solve for these extremely complex process that today uh there's a multiple human touch point very simple uh such as uh doing an emergency call to a specific doctor with giving all the respective

summary which today can be optimized which can save lives. Uh so that's the sort of things that we uh keep discussing about uh during our uh board meetings and discussions. Uh but but a

lot of these uh and maybe health and non-health as well. What's your view how the next five years, next six years? Um yesterday there was this conversation with Sam where AGI will be there in by

2028. uh what is your view on how next 3 years to 5 years now we can't even say a decade right it it seems like we don't know what all will happen in a decade

but how do you see next 3 to 5 years uh changing in your hospitals uh or in uh in general healthcare &gt;&gt; I think dramatically I adoption of and it's it's not because you know uh

hospitals or healthcare providers desire it I think it's becoming absolute necessity for the country. Uh one of the things and perhaps one of the major things which propels our country forward

is the demographic dividend. Uh you know the average age is 29, 28, 29 whatever. But make no mistake 10 15 years down the line okay it will be very very close to the European age and that's the time

people will require medical intervention. There just isn't enough infrastructure and doctors available in the country. Okay, it's barely barely sort of it's actually not even enough

for the population today. I can I can certainly tell you 15 years down the line there isn't enough infrastructure which can possibly be built. there isn't enough money over here or I mean this

we're just behind the curve a little too much right and if we have to solve this equation as far as healthcare is concerned uh you know you have no choice but you have to it has to be about

predictive uh health it has to be about uh you know sort of before even patient comes to the hospital falls sick to be able to predict that he's going to fall sick and and and make amends there uh

reaching out to people unclog the this the hospital infrastructure home care and so on and so forth. Okay. Be able to replicate uh capabilities, skill sets of doctors to be able to take

them to patients and so on. I think all of that is a necessity. Without that, we will fail the future generations. So there's no question of us. I think you know this is here. I mean the future is

here today. &gt;&gt; And especially the whole vision of uh making India developed country. we have to leaprog and many of these technologies can help us in leaprogging

uh the way you were explaining but uh uh thank you so very much a for your deep insights. I think uh we all uh love Max and uh the kind of work that uh you are doing and uh we see more and more AI

coming together at max to solve for doctors, patients and all of us. Thank you very much. &gt;&gt; Pleasure is entirely man. Thank you. Thank you so much.

Thank you a and I just request you to present a token of her. We now move to Uh we now move to a panel discussion which will be moderated by the

of impact. He has shaped landmark policies including India's national health policy 2017 and advised institutions such as the UN, WHO, World Bank, UN's IGF, dynamic coalition on

digital health among others. We welcome you sir onto the stage. We have with us Tanvi Lal. Miss Tanvi Lal, director of strategy at people plus AI, an initiative of the AA step found

astep foundation. Her work focuses on scaling data and AI enabled products for public good with an emphasis on adoption, usability and impact. Tanvi holds an MS in biotechnology and

management from Carnegi Melon University and an MBA from UC Berkeley Har School of Business. We next have Mr. Nikil Dongri. He's a 2012 batch Indian railway personal

service officer and currently serves as director IT at the National Health Authority where he leads the technical architecture and implementation of flagship national initiatives including

the Ashman Barat Digital Mission and Ashishan Barat PMG. We welcome you sir. We have with us Miss Padmini Vishwanad, researcher at the WHO SEO, Southeast

Asian regional office, bringing a regional lens to health equity, digital health policy and evidence-based transformation in low and middle inome countries. We welcome him.

And last but not the least, we have Mr. Jigat Halani, director enterprise social uh director enterprise solutions architecture and engineering at Nvidia South Asia, a 20-year technology veteran

driving innovation in supercomputing, big data and AI infrastructure and a trusted adviser to government and industry on AI strategy. I now hand over to Deepak to lead the panel discussion.

&gt;&gt; I think we are short of space so I'll manage standing high. Thank you very much. Uh it was a great session. Uh Vik and A just left. Um we have short of time. So I will try to leave maybe five

10 minutes at the end for for everyone to have uh questions. Um I will like to start this session with Dr. Gupta. Dr. Gupta, we were talking last night. You know, you were instrumental in defining

the whole first white paper around ABDM. How did it all started? uh there is obviously a lot of progress uh from when you conceptualized uh way back uh in 19 2019 2020 to today. What do you really

think has really worked towards seeing the reality and what are the challenges? How do we see how do you see going forward? How do this whole documentation moving from between patient and

interoperability will start impacting the clin uh clinical decision- making for the physicians going forward. Thank you Deepak and thank you Vikl for this wonderful session and giving me the

opportunity. So it started actually in 2014. It was in BJP's manifesto I wrote and then in national health policy in 16 and eventually when I was adviser to health minister. So you know firstly we

should complement the uh ABDM team. There is no precedent. There is no precedent to create records for a billion population. How do you go about doing it? But I think people like Vik

and you every time you know you take a bold step there are naysayers who will say today we have 860 million aids. So I think if I look at the reality today and

I know I'm sitting on the right of the director IT we have created the digital infrastructure now we have to leverage that to empower the people who are going

to use it. I see a future where we will not have people using multiple schemes. That was our biggest problem internally. I can tell you why this got you know created and there are more reasons too.

But eventually technology will allow us to optimally use resources to clinically be precise in treating people remove redundancies

and also my boss who is still the union health minister we agreed fundamentally it'll be tough to send doctors to rural areas they study for 12 years to make their lives better not to go of course

we want them it'll take time to have that infrastructure where they can stay in rural areas but we believe that digital health digital solutions will be able to leverage this backbone that we

have created to serve people in the areas where they need them the most. I think that golden hour to platinum minutes to I think finally what I believe will be the digital health uh

standards where in a minute you could get to what you need at least for primary care. So I'm very optimistic and was right that decade is not we used to talk decade at 2013 14 now we talk three

years max few months is better to talk. Yeah. So I think it's a time where we should be really optimistic of the vision that we were able to build thanks to people like who had implemented you

know we had co at our hand you know when we looked at 2.2 two billion people you know getting vaccinated not calling up people just going to the app and getting it done so I think the creators are in

the room the implementers are in the room so ideators don't need to worry much thank you &gt;&gt; thank you very much that's great so moving uh to your left Nikl uh Nikl you

guys have done a phenomenal job in you know deploying u adoption of ABDM in public sector today but uh we see a lack um in the in the private sector uh definitely uh what have you been

learning? How do you think this whole learning pro of ABDM deploying at a large PSU where obviously there is obviously massive to massive uh load of patients walking in and very limited

physician and staff to support digitizing appointments in a great way. How do you see it going forward uh moving into private sector? How do you see it going forward getting into the

workflows even deeper which will really uh help better outcomes? Uh first of all thank you and team and for my uh

what I can say the a models whatever we see so the model is dependent on the data we fed so the models for health specific you need context rich data generally it comes from the

big corporate hospital as hospital generally so what ABDM did they made right that whatever the foreign models which which cannot be successful in India. So where the domestic SL SLA

models and nanom models like which can be developed by IKA or other health startups where ABDM created the federated architecture where the model can go

there and they can be tried because the simple mo making algorithm doesn't make a solution in the health sector right just now uh as the max safety is very much important. So what

is missing in the foreign models is the which is not tried in the Indian data especially we can't neglect the population the rural population small hospitals where most of the people go

there where ABDM created a HMI solutions where we have access to the longitude records of the patients where our Indian models can be tried and where we can get the success actually the ground is

fertile enough right now to pitch in for the Indian startups to come in and train your models especially because of federal you don't need LLMs you just need SLMs and some random models to come

and do it so that the models cannot be biased because the biasness I can't see only from the technical angle here you have to keep both clinicians and technologies so that the the context

data is available from across the India and across the population where the uh subject with the billion clinical realities and where and the a model should be not only transactional they

should be conversational where the literacy rate is very low. So now is a fatile ground for the Indian startups to come in and show the brand value of the Indian startups. So where I can see it.

Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much NL insightful. uh you touched upon uh cloud infrastructure and we have uh here so cloud infrastructure has made AI

scalable right we all are using everyone's using chat GP today uh infrastructure sovereignity and trust are you know hot uh we've been hearing about these words for last five days

like I don't know n number of times it becomes super super relevant for uh health as we heard in the last session the trust how do you think the models of the companies is building in India

brings that trust factor so that physicians and the operator like Abbe would trust those solutions and then start implementing which will really help you know people like Nickel in

building those model for the country. So I think it's a it's a deep question right trust has many aspects if you ask me honestly right trust in my language could be the most accurate results and

I'm happy because I'm a fastmoving guy uh IT professional right so we are known for it the event gets over today and Monday we are back to work and we know we are going to hog again for next five

days to make something better and bigger right uh trust for my mom could be a very different uh story line right because for her everything on priority line is health nothing else essentially

right for me plus or minus 1% 3% 5% 10% is also okay for her nothing is okay right uh and trust for a mother who has just a newborn in her hand it's going completely different right so uh it I I

personally feel it has many layers but a fundamental layer if you ask me honestly model builders what they're trying to do uh is trying to still accumulate the knowledge which is still available on

the web right uh what we haven't gone back and that's where I would borrow if India is achieving these numbers which I was not aware I I knew Aba pretty well uh I have registered myself as well uh

although I have not used it yet But but I'm a registered user uh I want to myself get enrolled into every scheme that government is coming up with just to make sure that to understand where

all connectivity is possible essentially right but &gt;&gt; I'm not even a willing one uh yeah but uh but but I'm saying that once we have this data how do we make

use of this data better so that I bring not just the context of India which is so important and body kakar is trying to do just on the language side story which we all understand that language is so

important to us. Imagine the uh you know the the the the the environmental changes that I have from you know place to place and bases which the changes that I have in my body

structure and basis which what medicine helps me better and so on and so forth right uh it it has its own subsequent uh you know chain of things that that is there how do I bring that data more into

the ecosystem thereby I make those model more and more efficient better and in the lingo of what India understand not just in language But also in the lingo of health which is

impacting that particular like for example I come from Gujarat but I stay in Bangalore I know for sure that environment is not suitable to me right and I keep sneezing for the Poland

reason of course many I the moment I go back to Gujarat I'm absolutely normal right whether it is extreme cold whether it is extreme hot uh it's raining doesn't matter at all I never sneeze

&gt;&gt; I think things works in Gujarat &gt;&gt; I go I come Delhi I don't get sneezing at all right I'm just another example right So how do I bring that data more into the ecosystem number one and then

number two how do I how do I train those model more efficiently and serve them back to the users. So that's one aspect of it right. The second aspect of it is I think

unlike language in the healthcare we need a very large momentum of citizens to participate and help us to have lot of feedback ecosystem uh in what they are perceiving from these models which

are they inferring it right like for example in your solution which I've seen the demo because now it's been a number of time in the demo booth I've seen this if a patient is talking right and and uh

you know uh going through your recordings let's say which he or she has just done for him or her it's the most important thing for the doctor it's it's like the next patient right how do I go

to the next but the patient will definitely go back and check the recording patient will definitely go back as we all do and for the rightful reasons we check the second opinion with

the doctor right but that information is only with me what did the second doctor told me right I check with you as a doctor and then I say all right it's a big operation I should take a second

opinion and I go to her I take another opinion and then both they say the same thing and I then still go Google right and I take the opinion there and I say you know what looks to be that I need to

get operated and then five days free consulting questions right so I think the user also need to put the feedback back in the ecosystem by using these models and then

getting democratized right I think that's how the trust layer is going this is at a very high level right policy level things are going to be very very different and I'm sure it's a topic by

itself some other day we'll work on it and I'm sure we will we will try this one &gt;&gt; thank you very much right this Google doctor has been very very popular in

clinics so when we meet our doctor they hate it I have seen a board many many times outside the physicians Kevin no Google doctor please &gt;&gt; yes

&gt;&gt; okay so we discussed so next question to We've been talking about private hospital infrastructure. There's a mass high quality infrastructure available in the country with really great

physicians. On the other side, we have PCs, massive pressure, less number of physicians. How do you think you know builders when they think of building solutions for both of these perspective

like these very very different should they think of a single solution they think of two different solutions? What do you think how going forward? &gt;&gt; Yeah. So uh uh at people plus which is

an initiative of astep we do a lot of analysis on what are the adoption trends and for high need population. So for basically for people who are building in healthcare, education, agriculture,

right? What's the uptake, who's building what, who's not uh taking third party solutions and trying to build internally? And there are a couple of uh points that have emerged in that thesis.

I think the first is because AI is meant to be personalized and context specific, it can deal with multilinguality and voice, there's firstly a lot of opportunity to bridge some of these

inequity gaps that exist. So the first thing is that today you can imagine as a builder solutions that are in some very very regional low resource languages for the different beneficiaries and you can

design them to be voice first which in a way is inducing trust because now they are speaking to someone uh and they're just not reading off an answer and they don't know who's behind uh that

solution. So the first aspect is that AI is meant to be personalized. So when you're building solutions or you know I'm going to go a step further. I'm going to say it's beyond a solution.

It's a transformation. You can create very customized transformations. That's number one. Uh I think the second thing uh over here is that when uh uh you know because it's a very fragmented value

chain right in the case of healthcare like someone is paying someone is using the technology someone's ultimately benefiting from it. What we've realized is when you're designing these

transformations, a big part of a builder's journey is not just making the text app, but spending time with people who will be adopting it, educating them at different levels to explain how this

tech could get consumed or improve their life. Right? So many times and uh I mean there are 700 plus healthcare startups in India who are doing all kinds of pilots and demos right now and what

we've realized is that the demo phase goes really well like 3 months 6 months you can get because there is you know adopters who could be hospitals or other institutions sometimes play from a place

of either fear or hype like I want to be aware of what's going on and I'll do the demo but after three months this is just going to be a side window on my browser which I never go back to because it was

never thought of as a as a solution that I would embed into my workflow. So you have to think from the start of this as a journey and not just a one-time switch that I get that one time contract or

that one time demo and imagine that that will convert into some kind of impact. Now to build that trust it's very different in the private hospital which is maybe much more urban much more aware

of what's going on versus a PHC right and the people in the PHC. So I think a tech stack and the solution is one piece of it. But when we're designing the transformation which comes with

education, awareness, trust building activities, creating safety and maybe feedback and evaluation stack it has to be very different and transformation is about much more than

the tech. And I think that's where people should be spending a lot more time as builders not It's just not about cracking that first pilot or that first deployment. We're saying what will it

take to go from pilot to population right like what what will that take because that is a very different journey that's a systems journey that's not a tech journey uh always

&gt;&gt; no that's super helpful uh continuing the same discussion Dr. Gupta when you look at policym do you look at these two segments very differently or you think uh the when you look at policy like

private sector or PSC you think health is one single sector or do you start defining saying okay how will it work in public how will it work in private sector

&gt;&gt; so if you look at the national health policy this is the first time where I actually wrote the line both for private and public sector till 2002 it was mostly written and even implied it was

only meant for public sector I think if you really want to deliver care, you have to break that barrier between private and public. That's how you will deliver care. When patients has

a problem, he doesn't see whether is a private or public should I get into it the first hospital they get it. So I think that was the thinking behind it and that's how the policy is like.

&gt;&gt; Oh wow, that's great. Learned something. Um I move on to Padmini. From your regional vantage point, how should AI system be designed differently to reflect the diversity of context

capabilities and care relative across countries? &gt;&gt; Yeah, thank you. First of all, thank you so much for having us today. um who was very glad to be representing um the work

that we do. Um and you know listening to my co-panelists uh it's interesting to hear about you know the the importance of tailoring because uh interesting and a little um

how do I say uh anxietyinducing for me because the you know the work that we do is on the other end of the spectrum which is how do we create norms right how do we uh create norms and normative

guidance uh to ensure that AI is equitable and moving in the right direction Um and so when I I'll I'll talk from the regional perspective and you know of course we work with eight

countries across CRO and all of these countries and systems are at very very varying levels of digital maturity right um but what we often find is the AI tools are developed for the most

advanced most connected tertiary institutions and then adapted later for the most uh more remote settings right um but we We are finding that some of the count's uh you know pilots are

looking at reversing this logic which means that we start uh developing readiness frameworks for the most remote settings u understanding the frontline capabilities device availabilities all

the factors that matter with in AI readiness um you know uh developing a framework for that level of remoteness and then scaling it and when we we do see that in um you know in contexts

where we do that there is higher provider trust um there is u more equity so I think that is uh you know from our experience we feel that uh maybe we need to slow down a little bit and look at

how we can modernize existing legacy systems rather than kind of building on um and adding new systems um yeah I'll I'll stop there for now &gt;&gt; that's really insightful uh we've spent

all of us like last one week spending here so I would like to ask single question to each one of you here what has been your great one thing you've learned in this

which you think is started getting some impact in health one thing you've seen in last five days which you are not aware of and saying started starting some early signs of success health

ecosystem if there is any so &gt;&gt; I'll go first I think uh it's a common factor I think it's horizontal not vertical but it's very

very important for the country right if I understand what Tamil doctor is speaking with the patient and converted into Hindi and have that deployed in Delhi and Gujarat I think I'm I'm home

essentially I'm solving many problems for years together that has been prolonging in the country essentially I think it's it's by itself is a uh you know reward to the country we should be

fully liber. It's not a technology problem. It's a mindset problem and that's what I have seen every single person you know talking to they started more believing

in the fact that you know the time has arrived. &gt;&gt; I will tell uh two things. One thing is broader So I'm very happy that lot of discussion is going on about a so for

any technology anything to uh including to public the thought process very much important that impact some it created that impact to discuss things on AI basically now everyone will discuss on

AI like you very ruler to the CEO the discussion is happening that is very much important to build systems that thought process second thing develop I visited few of

the specialist startups. So very happy to see some starts are doing the really great like ek that eascribe so where the tdm can use basically small clinics the to reduce the burden of the clinicians

from the nonclinical worker work so and uh there is one company and they are doing very great work on data anonymization because for models to train the after the advent of the DPDP

act so the data privacy and patient and are very much important. So they are working very really good in India. So I'm very happy to such companies are there and they are doing really

wonderful. So I'm very proud. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Uh I think for me it would be the emphasis on uh AI ready data systems because this is across sectors. Everyone is realizing that AI is only as good as

the data both at the model and the application layer that it has access to. And I really want to give you guys credit for that because uh you are pioneers in terms of putting out data

and making it available through that MCP server that came out. In fact, we cite that as an example. We are working very closely with Mosby right now and they want to make their statistical data sets

available to the world. They have put out their first MCP about a week ago. But just the fact that you are you know uh institutions are just not extractive when it comes to data but they want to

give it back so that others can build on top of it is very important. So in health it's crucial that that happens because otherwise uh uh there is no personalization happening.

&gt;&gt; Pardon me. &gt;&gt; Um so I would say I I think so far u you know we have looked at a lot of quantitative measures of adopting AI um in health you know diagnosis accuracy

number of patient visits etc. But I think uh this time round we are seeing more discussions around the qualitative dimensions right empathy dignity care um and you know it's interesting because in

one of the pilots we are conducting on a paliotative care we you know we didn't even think about it but a caregiver and a patient uh paliative care patient visiting a nurse you know that's their

only source of human connection during that week um and so how does AI kind of change that dynamic of caregiving right in that those little moments they spend together in the clinic. So I think uh

the increased conversation around this and um just acknowledgement of not just the quantitative but also the qualitative dimensions is something that um I'm personally really looking forward

to. &gt;&gt; Thank you. The objective of this question was not to get the promotion for AA just a disclaimer. I will no but thank you. It was super uh

insightful. Audience any question? &gt;&gt; On the edge only or on the cloud or hybrid? &gt;&gt; No, of course.

&gt;&gt; I think uh where do you use do you use chat GPD? &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; the servers are hosted out of India. &gt;&gt; No, I'm saying this cost cost factor is

also there and &gt;&gt; I think data privacy is also there so and you know so &gt;&gt; the moment you add cost as long as it is in India I think we are home I don't

think so we could be ever cheaper &gt;&gt; so I was just asking a suggestion from you so like what model should like someone was creating such a solution for voice and translation multi let's just

target 22 languages so where should the mcb inflate on the edge on the edge on a gadget like a mobile phone or something recorder or you know hybrid

&gt;&gt; I would say I would say depends on the use case &gt;&gt; okay &gt;&gt; if you have a very particular use case very tiny one in a remote place edge

would be the solution you don't have a choice you will lack behind the connectivity and few other aspects as well &gt;&gt; it will synchronize once a month or once

a week or once a day &gt;&gt; no voice is something you need to have connectivity in play &gt;&gt; you can't be having offline things that's my view at least

people are trying I think sub had something on on &gt;&gt; I think 90% we should go for connecting with the cloud or server &gt;&gt; even if it's local India hosted server

&gt;&gt; that's correct one at the end there's one at the end hello everyone uh we have seen a lot of uh stalls in the expo uh showing AI powered documentation and diagnosis. Uh

I'm a dentist and I am currently pursuing MBA analytics. So I'm curious uh how far this AI uh Indian based AI tools are relying on Indian data rather than global data sets.

Depends on what they're claiming. That's first. So and the other side I also represent uh the Mayo Clinic strategy in India. So as Mayo Clinic platform we are opening in partnership with some of our

data sets for to look at but also collaborating with hospitals inside to leverage each other's anonymized data sets. So I think important point to note is the culture of data is missing. I

mean we still have to get the culture of data to get to have those AI systems that are based on Indian population. I think this is still far away. I think with AVDM sitting next we have 860

million But if the number of records on ABDM if you check they are not what we want to be. So I think we're still not there in terms of if someone makes a claim be

careful. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; That's great. We talked about you know what we really like you know what we've seen the change fundamentally but do you

guys also think there are still few items where we're lacking behind as country as a health where we should have been you know already seen or or you think we are on the right path and if we

are on the right path then what do you think would be the great outcomes in next three to six months to a year I don't go beyond a year in in terms of how health is being leveraging AI in the

country whether it's PFC or private hospital &gt;&gt; answer is very frankly you know even at the cost of obsity see the issue is not about the usefulness of technology or

the use case it's about ethics and doing the right things most of the people are not using not because the UX UI technology outcomes

everyone knows that how many doctors would actually want to what they charge for a prescription, how many prescriptions they make and why they write three antibiotics for one case. So

I think it is about regulating that unethical part. The way they were able to crack it, you'll be seeing the mass adoption. The challenge lies in the medical practices and medical ethics,

not on the solutions per se otherwise we would the most adopted nation in terms of digital technologies. the great last night we were having this conversation where in China I was

surprised to hear this that on the real time when a physician is writing a prescription there's a data going back and if there are errors it's coming back and the doctors are getting flagged if

they continuously do this thing and then that's a way one way of controlling what you've really said and you know think of us we are still in metro lit trade but think of people in tier two tier three

having three antibiotics at the same time issue practice medical practices good pharmacy practices good precision practices to follow

&gt;&gt; just want to add she asked one question how many models are training on Indian data So you said now that where we are lagging behind. So I want to say like

the behavioral change is very much important. So we have solutions even we give very uh with CDK we give one issue light which is almost free to small

hospitals and all the government hospital including as having the HMA solution where they can create the langitude records but some of the ducks are not ready to do

because they said that we are very much accustoed to writing on the paper so still they are doing and we are accepting so where we are losing the context is data from the ma major public

hospitals. So where we need some tough stance some tough because I'm now working nationality but before I was in railways now railways totally stop physical

prescription because they took a decision that no more physical prescription they are doing only now online prescription everything even lab record everything integrated. So they

took one decision there ends actually. So we need some tough decisions and also we need some behavioral change where we have to go for creating longitudals then only we can give some context data to

the Indian startups where our models can be deployed and trained then we can get benefit of it. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much. You've been a great panel. Thank you very much for all your

insight and I'm &gt;&gt; sorry in the interest of time we'll have to wrap up. Uh but before we close this session a sincere gratitude and thank you to all our panelists. I request

Deepak to just present a moment to from our behalf.
