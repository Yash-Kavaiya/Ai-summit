## 📝 Transcript

very exciting sessions. I I'll just wait guys. Um so we are meeting for a tremendously important subject and this has been a great summit. I know you're all

energized, inspired, excited and exhausted at the same time. And we will get a moment when this subject becomes a room of 5,000. So that's what we're going to work towards. But you're here

today. We're delighted to have an absolutely tremendous panel with us today. Uh I'm deeply honored flown across from the US, from from Europe, from Singapore and so forth and we have

a lot of material to cover. I should say that uh the triple challenge that we are dealing with in this panel is perhaps the most important challenge any of us will face in our lives which is to

promote development on the one side while dealing with the creation of a sustainable planet and in terms of climate change your self- selecting group you're all here with us and

there's a reason for that you already know about climate change you already know about AI is that as you know we are not necessarily winning the battle on climate as yet. And so we need to deal

with both mitigation and adaptation. And this panel will address both of those two things. We have very little time in the panel. So I am going to speed along, but that's a good metaphor for the very

little time we have to do something about climate change. So we're in action mode. It's a call for collaboration. We're not going to be I apologize to our speakers and panelists for a number of

things. One, this is not a real panel. We're not going to be having discussions. This is just boom boom boom talking to you about what everyone's doing. Secondly, there's going to be a

kind of switcheroo moment when some other speakers come up and some of us are are replaced up here. Uh, apologies for that. It's just the intensity of the panel. Uh, and for all those things, I

apologize in advance, but I don't apologize for the incredible quality of our panelists today. These are amazing people. And I would just end by saying that this is not a normal session. This

is an invitation for radical actionoriented collaboration with all of you. On that basis, let me begin by talking a little bit about uh a summit we held last year in London and the

background to it and an organization that some of us are very deeply involved with and almost everyone here is a friend of called the green artificial intelligence learning network. You will

immediately note it has the cutesy acronym of Grail, like the holy grail. And what we're trying to do is really see what the synergy is between the development agenda and the climate

agenda through the application of AI. I'm going to speed through this. We're going to then move to Professor David Sandalow who actually anchored our summit last year which is the first

major global summit on the application of AI to climate change and has very kindly flown in from Colombia. I'm going to ask our speakers one more favor which is instead of my coming up and

introducing all of you don't mind introducing yourselves that will speed us along the way. So let's go through this and I so as you all know and perhaps professor Sandler will talk

about it. Uh the IPCC gave us a target 43% decarbonization from 2019 levels to 2030 levels. Uh we were meant to reduce GHG emissions by that amount. uh in 2021, some of us at

COP 26 in Glasgow uh had a meeting to look at the likelihood of that happening and we came to the conclusion that the likelihood was very low and therefore traditional approaches to climate

mitigation and adaptation needed to be enhanced with new solutions and we thought what was Jcurving as fast as climate change was J-Curving and the only thing we could think of was the

application of AI this great new suite of technologies including of course quantum and all the other things that go with it and we started to talk to people and we talked to a whole bunch of people

in the AI community a whole bunch of people in the industrial and power automotive all the different sectors that produce emissions and we said are you talking to each other and shockingly

people were not talking to each other there's very little going on with some honorable exceptions at Google but very few people were really in the AI community focusing on downstream

you know uh issues uh around climate change and similarly the big industrial domains were not really focused on the use of AI for decarbonization and economic value creation. So with that

lens think about this session as throwing one J curve against another J curve. Can we throw the crazy increase in AI technology represented by this great summit against the world's

greatest challenge? That's the purpose of the Grail organization which is a not for-p profofit based in London. It's a vast terrain. We don't have time to cover it all. It's obviously mitigation.

It's obviously adaptation. We have to hit both. And within that, there are endless taxonomies of all the wonderful things that AI can do. And of course, you'll be worried about the increased

GGs from data centers, but that's not the primary focus of our session today. That has been quantified. The Grantham Institute uh did a quantification last year of.5 to 1.4 gigatons of extra GHGs

from data centers, but that's from every kind of utilization against the potential benefit of 3.5 to 5.4 gigatons being sucked out of extra GT emissions. So there's clearly a very strong balance

towards what AI can do to helping the planet in its shift towards a clean and green economy. Grail, what's Grail? Grail is a an attempt to create a collaborative network of great academic

institutions, commercial institutions, AI companies, uh, industrial companies, philanthropic institutions, private sector, sustainability networks like WBCSD,

bringing them all together with governments uh, to try and create massive collaboration. The next slide at the bottom you see that same group of institutions. Bottom right the ideas and

deal flow going back into Grail. Bottom left the fact that this becomes a collaborative community to get all these solutions scaling at speed and and at the top then getting that deal flow

funded through grants through government programs uh through venture capital corporate funds but to move the agenda to real solutions at massive scale as quickly as we possibly can. All of this

led to a summit that occurred that I mentioned earlier last year. Sean, will you keep me real on the time? Thank you. &gt;&gt; Okay. And that led to uh 200 people uh 115 organizations including all the

organizations represented here today, 60 speakers, and we looked at AI for power, AI for building materials, AI for everything you could think of vertically and horizontally. looking at the issues

of materials innovation, looking at the issues of value chains, looking at carbon markets and so forth. What has happened after the summit? Three things. One line, we've created an online

collaborative platform uh and we invite all of you to join it to co-create those solutions that can make a difference. Second, we've started to engage with governments around the world. Imagine a

summit like this that was focused, yes, on development, but with a central climate focus as well. How amazing would that be? And most importantly, we're focusing on uh taxonomies that lead to

uh massive calls for action from the innovation community. So, we started to work on taxonomies for a variety of sectors, the energy sector, the built environment, materials innovation, and

we worked with groups of AI experts and power experts and figured out what the big wins were. what are the big opportunities for companies to create economic value while at the same time

massively decarbonizing. And this was an intellectual process including many experts many some of whom are here today that led to uh this uh astonishing work and identified the big win-win

opportunities for economic value creation and decarbonization. on the bottom right the teams from academia industry industry associations variety of other people and countries uh eight

country teams as well were involved in various ways so where's this all going well uh thank you to McKenzie for your very kind collaboration to after we had done all that work saying hey we want to

help and and and kicking in and working with us to further refine those offerings and look at cost benefits and cost curves and all sorts of things delighted about it And then there are

apart from working on the power sector to look at generally what we can do apart from working on the built environment generally what we can do apart from looking at materials

innovation generally what we can do to accelerate solutions for decarbonization through AI we have two big partnerships that are emerging one and I want to slow down here okay uh 250 companies are part

of the world business council uh their network that represents in scope one two and three 26% of world GHGs. They've realized that that's mainly in supply chains who are going into a

partnership. So is Mckenzie. So are other partners to look at what are the AI opportunities to take startup and scaleups into these decarbonization opportunities

at massive scale with the 250 largest companies in the world representing 24% of world revenues and 26% of world GHS. Finally, working with uh coalitions of energy companies and Nalin you'll hear

from later on and we have deeply partnered with Nalin on this and others on this. How can we take this into accelerating? For example, UNESA has 71 energy companies, 750 gawatt of clean

power. They want to go to 1,500 gawatt of clean power by the end of the decade. How can we help them with AI? It's a very practical lens. We invite you to join us and be part of this. On that

note, I would like to briefly to invite uh to introduce um Professor David Sandallow. David, I'm not going to go through your very distinguished background. It would take the whole

panel to do that except to say that you have worked in every different field. most importantly in the past in very senior positions in government, but now of course you've been the luminary on AI

solutions on climate. That is the worst introduction you've ever got. I'm sorry about that. Just in the interest of time, but I'm really very honored that you've flown all the way to come here

and I'm handing the mic to you. Thank you so MUCH [applause] U thank you your energy your enthusiasm your passion is in they're all

infectious and your intellect is remarkable what you're driving forward in this area is worldchanging uh you are not just an inspiration you're a gravitational force that are pulling

people together to work on this so thank you so much you're your what you did in London was remarkable. What you're doing here is incredible and I'm looking forward to being part of what you're

doing in the future. So, I've it's been my privilege to lead some teams that have been working on these issues over the course of the past couple of years and I'm going to talk about one of the

projects that we've done. Looks like the slides are not there. There's a circle turning on the screen. &gt;&gt; There it goes. I will say that while we while we wait

I'll say that I really like the metaphor that that you had u about two hockey sticks and this is just a remark remarkable convergence of two of the most important trends in that are

happening in human history right now. One of them is alas the increase in greenhouse gas emissions which is happening at such an astonishing pace but the second is the exponential growth

of the capacities of artificial intelligence. What's driving me is we need to find a way to make sure that that second trend artificial intelligence helps to solve the first

problem and that's the study that we did which um we brought together a team of 25 experts uh just wonderful people one of them was Hosang Lee the head of the IP inter last head of the

intergovernmental panel on climate change and some top experts and the question we asked was it was very simple how do you use artificial intelligence to reduce greenhouse gas emission

question. There it is. It came up on the screen. Um, thank you so much. I appreciate it. Um, and so it was a it's a very simple question. How do you use AI to reduce emissions of greenhouse

gases? We came up with 17 chapters. We wanted to do more than just provide analysis. We wanted to provide actionable ideas for what to do. So, every chapter has recommendations.

You can find a print version available on Amazon. Um and free downloads of the entire volume including chapterby chapter versions are available at these websites. I want to thank the government

of Japan including Neato and Medi for supporting this work. They've been very important supporters of work on AI and clean energy more broadly. Oh, I'm going to promote my podcast

later, but I I have a podcast just talking about this topic as well. But so here's our uh here's the table of contents for our work. We talked we have introductions to both AI and climate

change in this volume. One of the things we're trying to do is target this book both to experts and to people who are beginners in this topic. And you know Uday talked about bringing together

different communities. One of our basic conclusions was we need to bring together experts in climate change and experts in AI. And there are a lot of people who know a lot about climate

change but don't know a lot about AI. A lot of people who know a lot about AI, they don't know about climate change. So we decided to have primmers on each of those topics. And then we talk about

eight different sectors and a number of crosscutting topics. Um uh so we have five key takeaways. Um this was an interesting exercise with all of our authors taking 300 pages and

trying to distill it into five key takeaways. But here's what we came up with. The first one I mean it this is a kind of bottom line but it's important. AI does have significant potential to

contribute to reductions of greenhouse gas emissions. And we categorized it with with two categories. Incremental gains such as just improving efficiency. It's up at solar farms, building energy

efficiency. There are lots of incremental gains that can be made, but also transformational gains. Um, in particular, new to new new materials and other things. Uh, we looked at whether

greenhouse gas emissions are causing increases in or greenhouse gas emissions are increasing as a result of computing operations. We decided based on the available evidence that the best

estimate is less than 1% and maybe much less than 1% of greenhouse gas emissions are currently coming from AI. That tracks with the Granthm study that UDE talked about that tracks with what the

IEA has said as well. The main barriers to AI's uh impact in reducing greenhouse gas emissions are a lack of data and a lack of trained personnel. There's other barriers as

well, but but obviously you need data. Uh a lot of places we don't have the data for this purpose and and you need people Um, trust is essential. People aren't going to use AI unless they trust

it. Um, and then every organization with the role in climate change mitigation should consider opportunities for AI to contribute to its work. I think as AI grows and the public consciousness at

summits like this, that's becoming less and less of a kind of radical recommendation, but it's just so important. I think if you're working in climate mitigation, you you need to have

a team dedicated to AI and how AI can help. So, I'll just run through quickly because we only have a little bit of time uh some of our chapters. We we have

a chapter on the introduction to AI. And if you're if you're a climate person that doesn't know a lot about AI, this might be helpful to you. And one of the things we did is we broke down AI

capabilities into four basic categories at a very high level. The first thing AI can do is detect patterns. And how can that be helpful in climate change mitigation? Well, one example is

detecting methane emissions from satellite data. You know, some of you probably know this, but I mean, we know much much more today than we did 10 years ago about methane emissions. And

that has helped us dramatically to begin to reduce methane emissions. That's entirely dependent upon the optical sensing technologies and machine learning tools, uh, our knowledge in

this area. So, um, that's just one example of AI's impact so far. AI can also predict such as weather patterns at solar and wind farms. It can optimize such as power flows on transmission

lines. and it can simulate such as battery chemistry reactions. So I think for me in fact I'm teaching a course at Columbia right now where we're emphasizing this framework of detecting

predicting optimizing and simulating and those are broadly speaking the capabilities that AI brings to the table. Um a lot to say about climate change but just for the for those who

aren't paying attention atmospheric concentrations trapping gases are now higher than any time in human history. in fact higher than any time in the past three million years. And July 22nd, 2024

was the warmest day ever recorded. 2024 was the warmest year ever recorded by far. And the warmest 11 years uh ever recorded were in the last 11 years. So we are living in an era of climate

change. Uh we do deep dives into a number of different sectors. We don't I'm just going to talk about a few of them. power sector is maybe the most important just because part of our it's

already 28% of greenhouse gas emissions and our strategy for reaching de decarbonization requires us to electrify lots of things. So we need to grow the power sector and decarbonize a sector at

the same time. I don't think we're going to be able to do that without AI tools. Uh AI is already helping decarbonize the power sector optiming optimizing location of generation transmission

increasing output of solar farms but it can do much more. uh dynamic line rating is optimal power flow analyses but to do this we need standardized data we need trained personnel the utility business

model is a challenge so um this is a really important area that requires a lot of attention at work oh and the final point the last bullet on this slide using AI in real-time operations

can cause real security and safety risks so you know we uh need to be very careful about generative AI in context like this so even as we look to deploy AI to help reduce greenhouse gas

emissions we need to be very attentive to these risks I I kind of find it amazing how few people pay attention sometimes to food systems and climate change that um 30%

or more of greenhouse gases are in some way related to the food system and the food system has incre uh is threatened by a by climate change. AI can do a lot to improve both mitigation and

resilience in the food system. We just I mean there's a few examples here. integrating uh data from soil sensors to create fertilizer management plans, creating virtual farms. Um there's lots

of things that can be done here. But coming back to this issue of lack of data, it's a huge problem especially in the global south. So the efforts to build up a digital public infrastructure

that are happening here in India are so important in this regard. I'm going to go quickly here. We look at buildings where there's tremendous potential.

I think materials innovation is one of the most important areas and you know 150 years ago when Thomas Edison invented the modern light bulb he literally spent a year running

electricity through dozens I think hundreds of different filaments to figure out how much light and heat would be produced. So today we can simulate a million of those interactions in a

second and there's already tremendous advances in the pace of innovation in battery chemistry and some other areas using AI tools and I for me this is one of the most promising areas in terms of

transformational gains in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. um extreme weather response is extremely important from a resilient standpoint and we don't have a lot of time to get

into it but but I think that the AIM ML enabled forecasting is transformational because it's so much cheaper for example I mean we at really a thousand x the cost uh a thousandx less the cost we can

run a IML weather prediction tools and make a big difference on extreme weather response. Um we have findings and recommendations um throughout this report. Um uh it you can see it here

again. Um we just did a new report uh in the same series on sustainable data centers. Uh and our main messages there are that with this data center construction boom happening now. This is

the time to be paying attention to data center sustainability. We are investing right now in multi-deade assets. We need to be paying attention to this. Smart sighting is a key. And finally, here's a

plug for my podcast. Started this about a year ago. I've had some great guests. Jensen Hang Dami Lola Owen Be the head of sustainable energy for all. Jennifer Granholm the US energy secretary under

under Biden. Listen. Um it's as they say available on all major podcast platforms. Um UD once again thank you for your leadership. Thank you for convening this amazing group. Uh really

appreciate the opportunity to be here. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; I feel horrified. We've got speakers of this caliber and so are we. So, thank you so much for your leadership. May I

invite both of you to speak? You can speak from here if you prefer. We've got two great leaders from Google. Obviously, you know, in the in the sphere of corporate AI leadership on

climate, there is no one that parallels all of you. And we look forward to hearing from you your thoughts. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you very much for hosting this. I don't know if that's a

I'm super that's a privilege or that's pressure when you when you start with that sentence about you know the leadership position Google has. I just want a quick question. Raise of hands.

How many of you have used Google today for either maps or searching something? Thank you. Uh so you know who we are. This is my [laughter] I'm um you know I'm Rishali and I'll

introduce myself and then Spencer you can after that. Um I lead Google's in a nutshell um decarbonization water and circularity strategy for the company. Essentially what that means is I'm

responsible for quite a few things that you had in your slide that we should be doing. Um and a good way to introduce myself is also I like getting things done. And so I I my uh I feel like my

you know inner calling around this is we've had a lot of conversations. We've had a lot of uh playbooks and and research and things but it's almost like how do you act on it? how do you execute

on it? How do you start delivering the outcomes that I think we all are looking for? So that's the kind of space that I I come from and um a privilege to be at Google who's allow who allows us to kind

of expand that space. So the reason I asked you all to show your hands most of you know Google as a search or um maps and similar pieces information source. One of the other things Google is now I

think as a company is a full stack company and when I say full stack that means is the the search and the information is a top layer of it but underneath that sits the entire physical

infrastructure that drives that and so that's data centers that's the way you operate that that's the networks uh that feed into all of the applications and so when we look at climate uh and my title

actually is global director climate operations so I I I say that out of humility because when we look at climate, we're trying to put it across our our operations the best we can. So

we um and good examples of that I'll start with data centers the big topic right now. How do we operationalize them? Where do we site them? The location, what impact it has on the

community, what impact it has on the infrastructure there. Sighting is a big part of it. Access to clean energy is something we're looking at. Uh and pretty much we have a carbon-f free

energy goal. So I think for us if you look at climate a big portion of climate is emissions how do we impact emissions it's from electricity what do we do with electricity shift to clean energy or

renewables and so that's the spectrum that we that we look at and so a lot of our investments are in carbon-f free energy and how we think about it and um I it also is more not just take from the

grid or expect the government or you know sort of the infrastructure to get you there but how do we invest and bring more clean energy to the grid I think that's a big piece of I think what

companies can at the speed at which we all moving is um how do we take these sort of bigger picture systems it problems and and embrace them and solve them. So one is big one is generation of

clean electricity and the other is grid and how do you solve the grid problems. So that's the infrastructure of AI. Then using AI I think just going to some of the other things professor you were

saying is we we look at how we could use AI more to drive our operations more efficiently. It's very boring pieces. It's not really shiny superstar things, but a lot of the impact comes just in

general. All of I I look at water taps and I remember the amount of leakages we have on water taps. The amount of electricity wires that are not connected, just the inefficient use of

resources is a big one. And how can we use AI to sort of optimize whether it's optimizing within the us use of our chips, optimizing the grid, optimizing which applications run from where that's

a big part of our strategy. Um and then the third piece is where do you use AI and how do you use it for climate? Now clearly you know um our business is information and search but which means

we also have access to a lot of data and so one of the ways we consider um is what you can do in AI is how do you use these large data sets uh a find a way to open source them encourage different use

of them but also incubate certain initiatives that can help to show the light to others. So Earth AI is a big one in which we you've got satellite images, you've got weather data, you've

got all of these big chunks of information that we can put out there and then there's an application layer uh which I think is of interest to you in terms of resiliency or or mitigation. So

one of the things um you know which you all probably haven't heard of as much is flood hub. So we have a lot of information put out there as to flood risks of different region which then

other companies can use for whatever products they're launching whether it's insurance whether it's real estate um fire sat wildfire risks how do you do predict prediction around it something

all utilities companies especially from in California where I'm based is you're very passionate about using that for prediction um and I can go on about the list of sort of what data can be used

and how it can be leveraged the the the thing I think I'm going to go back to to the you crux of the of what you had in this is we're in the time frame of two hockey sticks. One is the impact on

emissions and I I completely appreciate that the tech companies, hyperscalers, data centers are at a scale contributing to it which we want to obviously help mitigate or or replace um with clean

electricity as much as we can. And then the other is how do you use the innovation curve on this? And I think we've just scratched the surface. Um and there's there's of course like you know

there'll be trials and errors but the surface around how do we democratize data? How do we encourage innovation and how do we scale it very quickly? Because I think those are the three the trifecta

of how do you how do you drive this change? Um and so I I'll one of the ways I'll end with saying I'm super proud of what we've done this this week trying to bridge those two gaps is uh we're

working with the principal scientific advisory of the government of India to launch a Google center of climate tech. uh we call it climate tech because it does those are the two hockey sticks

that you're trying to get in right the tech scale and the climate impact and we are our goal is to encourage academic research but research that is actionable so five pilots first of a kind and how

you can scale um and there's a lot of uh you know focus already on electricity so we're trying to do the non-ele electricity pieces in that which is around lowcarbon steel lowcarbon

materials built environments um lowcarbon sustainable aviation fuel and then the biggest one we don't talk we talk about what I think is a big lever across everything is green skills you

need to embed this sort of a thinking which is green climate first across every domain and how can we encourage that in in um in India and especially the tier 2 cities so super excited about

those two hockey sticks and how we as a company can u bridge bridge those gaps &gt;&gt; thank you Rashali and thank you U for the invitation to be here uh I'm also with Google and I'm the head of regional

sustainability for Asia Pacific. So I'm going to put on a bit more of a regional lens which one that covers a large part of the global south and uh UD I love the way that you framed you know this is

about development accelerating development in a sustainable for sustainable planet and so as we look at Asia Pacific there are three main areas where Google is is particularly

interested in one is of course climate science climate adaptation uh my colleague Versali has talked about the you know flood flood hubs and weather prediction uh it's important to note

that this part of the world is the most exposed to extreme climate events six times more than other regions. So I think there's a lot that science and AI can can bring to uh addressing that

issue. A second major area is the energy transition. This is an uh a part of the world that's still developing and actually needs more power and how can AI actually contribute to that energy trans

transition uh and in fact through some uh material improvements in terms of new technologies. And and what's also important to note is that the Asia Pacific is often the supply chain for

the rest of the world. So the carbon intensity of what is produced in this part of the world actually is really important uh to to globally. But what's really distinctive about Apex actually

the third major topic which is livelihoods as I mentioned this is a part of the world which has a lot of developmental ambitions and and livelihoods are key. So we're my

colleague touched on Vali touched on chapter three uh power systems. Actually I would like to touch on agriculture and food systems which is your chapter four. Uh so it's agriculture and uh and other

land use is actually the largest employment sector in the Asia Pacific. I mean I believe in India it's about 46% of of jobs and for the region it's the largest sector about the same as the

next two sectors added together which are actually manufacturing and uh wholesale and retail trade. Add those together you get the same number of jobs as in agriculture.

Now 80 over 80% of farms around the world and especially in India and the rest of the global south are small holder farmers and that creates an issue because a lot of the technology for

agriculture is developed for large commercial farms satellite imagery etc. So this is one example I just like to delve into in terms of what Google is doing to contribute to the the the the

data the digital public goods that Versali uh spoke of. So if you uh want to use satellite imagery and actually understand agriculture so you can do things with it, you need to find the

boundaries of your individual farms. That's the that's your individual unit and often less than two hectares if not smaller. And so you can do that with people pouring over maps or or satellite

imagery, but that's not scalable. So but this is a really interesting problem for AI. And so for those of you like to know more about this is actually an exhibit at the expo in the at the Google

pavilion. But this is what we call agricultural landscape understanding and agricultural monitoring event detection. So we've trained AI to actually digitally enhance the field boundaries.

Uh and you can say well that's interesting and because you can zoom into India and look at the uh the indogitic plane and see all the field boundaries. We've also trained uh the

model to distinguish what crops are being grown through uh multisspectral imagery and with that we can detect events like tillage uh sewing harvest etc. And all this data is now available.

It is part of the the the Kishi DSS. So it's being contribute it's contributing to the digital public infrastructure of the Indian government through the industry uh ministry of agriculture

through state governments for example like that of Telangana and the ADEX uh um uh uh system. And what this does is allows NOS's, government bodies, etc. to actually give advice to farmers because

they you now understand what's going on on the ground, which is a critical uh driver uh for for for mitigation benefits, but also adaptation as as actually the planting uh uh best

practices for planting and what to plant is actually changing over time with with climate change. So uh do find out more at the the the pavilion. But one thing that I'd like to uh to double click on

as we say is actually the innovation part of it. This digital public infrastructure is only helpful if it can be really used and it's not just governments and NGOs, it's also startups

that they're innovating and finding new ways of using this information. So uh companies like Carbon Farm, they're they're in France, they're using uh they're using this data. Veraha uh which

social startup entrepreneurship but also um uh uh Wadwani AI is another startup that we are supporting as well in terms of driving innovation in in the agricultural space. So this is uh really

all going to be accelerated through the use of AI and we're very excited to contribute to that. Thanks. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. You can see [applause]

&gt;&gt; so hello. Yeah, you can see that Google represents the convergence of the two themes we were talking about and I think you have a wonderful uh web at least I've seen access to materials about your

sustainability strategy online. So if people want to know more I'm sure they can go there. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I'll make a plug website sustainability google.com. It has all of

our information and the expo booth has all of our &gt;&gt; So thank you very very much. Now we are inevitably vastly behind schedule as we are with climate change. However, we're

going to keep going with great focus and we're going to turn to the energy and power sector. Now, this is a bit embarrassing because we have to do a little bit of a switch over of people

and we don't have time to put up the new names here. So, we're just going to announce them and listen with great attention. So, we have two fantastic speakers from the energy sector which as

you know is uh one if not the most important sector. Do you want to come closer Nalin? Sure. &gt;&gt; And we can just be together here. And uh uh I would ask obviously the

decarbonization of the energy sector is absolutely critical. Without that nothing happens so I'm going to hand over straight away first to you if I may Nalin to set the stage a little bit and

what you're trying to do uh with climate collective and UNESA and then Dan more specifically to what you're up to. So over to both of you and uh and obviously introduce yourselves. Sorry I haven't

done it for you. &gt;&gt; No thank you. Um I understand we are we are short on time so I'll keep very very very brief. I'm Nalin Nagaral one of the founding partners at the climate

collective. I think we'll have the slides up soon. Great. So um today I'm just going to talk about very quickly uh a program that we've been running for six years and where we partnered with

GRA on um uh to really drive decarbonization and grid modernization um u starting with India but across the global south. Right. So if I can move on.

&gt;&gt; Who's operating there? &gt;&gt; Let me go there actually. No, no, no, no. Let me go. I'll do it. I'll do it. &gt;&gt; Okay. Just quick snapshot. So we we are

uh an ESO enterprise support organization. Uh largest uh in in the global south uh about 1500 startups supported. Uh key partnerships. UA is a key one. Um I don't want to spend too

much time here, but that's what we're going to spend some time on as well. Um we do a lot of work in AI um in power but beyond. So um next week we're doing the Delhi climate innovation week. In

fact Google is is is a is a sponsor and partner there. Um and of course Grail is as well. Um but happy to chat about this later. Um here's what we're trying to do. Um I think what's happening is that

a lot of the challenges around renewables are being solved. They will be solved. I think one of the increasing recognitions is that the grid is a key bottleneck now and we need to really

work on grid transformation that includes both decarbonization and modernization. Right? So that's what we're working towards. Um so we work with utilities. There's about 22 of

those that we've worked with so far. Uh work on a problem statement approach, get startups to apply, select startups, get them to create business cases and pilot plans and eventually lead to

pilots. Right? So there's 22 utilities that have participated and have u led to about 20 pilots that uh a subset of which have become large deployments. Right? So it's it's a very unique

program in the global south actually it's the only one right um high conversion ratio so about 30% of the of the pilots that um that have been proposed have have come in uh key

partners I mean 22 utilities um and all the all the people that are working in power sector reform are part of this program um I mean again I won't spend too much time but there's a lot of this

information available online this all the startups that have vetted ready to deploy are available for utilities to engage with. Uh we have a bunch of case studies also. But the key point is this.

We are now developing this along with Grail into a global AI for power innovation platform which has three components. The open innovation program which is electron vibe. On the top there

is the knowledge hub which is basically a peer sharing uh uh platform where we we do convenings colllocated at cops at climate weeks etc. And then there's an online solutions database of of

prevetted solutions. I'll stop there uh and hand it over to Dan. Thanks. &gt;&gt; Thanks, Nolan. Um I'm going to stand up too because I like to stand up and talk. Um so um my name is Dan Travers. I'm

from Open Climate Fix. We are a startup doing AI for grid. I'm going to dive a little bit into that the grid area which has been talked about a bit. Um, in order to get to net zero, we we need to

electrify, we need to green the grid and we need to electrify everything. Um, the grid of the past had usually in each country there was tens of generators and the grid operator would know those

people on a first-name basis and they would ring them up and tell them when to turn up and down. We now got millions of generators with solar panels, wind turbines everywhere. Um, the grid of the

past had variability from just demand. We've now got variability from demand and the wind speed and the clouds, right? So, three sources of variability. The grid of the past had a normal demand

that we understood well. We've now got data centers, we've got EVs, we've got batteries, we've got AC. So, that the demand is changing shape incredibly. How are you possibly going to address

this balancing of this grid with a bunch of people in a room, right? You need AI solutions. You need a highly digital grid. You need something which can schedule and marshall all of these

assets in a in a digital at sort of AI speed. So that's um really important. And why is it important? It's important because if we don't do it, we'll have blackouts

and if we don't do it, we'll have costs increasing because the way that grid operators are currently dealing with this challenge is they're actually scheduling a lot of backup generation.

It's usually gas fire generation. It's very expensive. So bills are going up and if you look around what's happening now, there's a there's a push back against the green revolution. If we

don't address these problems, we're going to have a democratic push back and we will have a reversal. So AI solutions can really help us in fighting the battle for hearts and minds as well as

the actual physical battle. So u myself, I came from a sort of banking tech space. Jack, my co-founder came from Google DeepMind who the name keeps coming up. Um we both saw there was a

big gap between the amazing tech that was available in some of these industries and grid operators and the electricity industry which is by nature very risk averse. It has to be worried

about things failing all the time. So we saw the the gap between those two and we formed open climate fix to really try and address that gap to bridge that to take sort of moonshot ideas and actually

build a rocket ship that is going to fly to the moon and actually implement something and give data to researchers. The company's nonprofit. We're open source. Um, and that's about the

scaling, which I think is a key part of the title of this talk. So, we've built the best solar forecast in the UK, we think by about 20 or 30%, like quite a long way. We now want to take that, we

are started to take that to India. We're working with Adani. We're working with Rajasthan Grid operator and a combination of open-source plus commercial sort of expansion. We see the

AI tools as super transferable across grids. So I'm really excited that we can take tools from one grid and apply them to all the grids in the world and use AI to solve climate change. Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Thank you so much. [applause] &gt;&gt; You can imagine if we had more time we would have had a panel on the built environment, a panel on industrial decarb, a panel on transport. We don't

have the time. But thank you for that fantastic uh couple of interventions. Now we turn to the last segment. uh we have three very distinguished institutions with us all involved at the

strategic level uh with Grail and with this process and I'll start Anker with you at McKenzie who've been close partners thanks a lot &gt;&gt; another race against time yeah uh so uh

what would I like to maybe if I can just &gt;&gt; I should say that Sean went out of the room and negotiated five minutes more for us in the room so [laughter] we Okay. So, uh it's okay. While the slides

come up, it's firstly a privilege to be here. Uh and thank you for the opportunity for McKenzie to be part of the journey that you are leading and thank you all for being here and shaping

this in in your own special way at your own scale. Um I'm Ankur. I'm a partner based out of our India office. I lead quantum black in India which is our AI team and I work across sectors because

that's really a lot of fun and part of my work has been in energy part of my work has been in the built environment uh but I'm representing the team which is quite global that has had the

privilege to work with um the Grail effort. So I'd like to just talk about how this little effort with us is shaping the larger movement uh that Grail

represents. So everybody's talking about the impact of AI. So I'm not going to talk more about that or the promise of AI. Let's just be clear. Uh I think the way large global efforts have sort of

found shape is to focus around a few challenges. So one of the big pieces that the Grail work has been about is shaping these four challenges and articulating them about operational

improvement in our current way of working. Uh big consulting words strategic intelligence and foresight basically better planning. Okay, build things

better. Uh transformational innovation. So, can we do new things that don't exist that will help the future? And the last one is autonomous operations, which is essentially do you do current

operations in a very different way? Use drones instead of people to go see how the wiring is in a large electric plant and uh create more impact. Okay. Several of the examples you heard about will fit

into this across energy built environment materials and this can keep expanding food systems perhaps. Now there's a huge amount of work going on in just collecting the knowledge on

each of those challenges. Then you think about those fields of play the energy built environment within that there are stakeholders. So for each stakeholder what's relevant and then for each

stakeholders let's say if you talk about system operators here as an example there's network planning is a domain to think about asset management is a domain to think about delivery is a domain to

think about field force execution. Think of this as you now bringing in the language of the industry into this knowledge base so that if someone manages a power plant they'll be like

okay what's my library of things I need to look at tomorrow that can then connect connect it to people who are innovating or providing these solutions one important gap in the middle is uh

okay how valuable is each of these ideas when it comes to cost when it comes to emissions and the work's not yet ready to be unveiled We are quite privileged to work with the Grail team to and of

course global experts to start to now quantify both in terms of economic impact but also in terms of direct emissions impact what each of these uh applications could be worth because then

our um scarce resources and limited time can be focused to the most important problems and I think that's what's coming up ahead and uh I look forward to all of you pushing the boundary further.

and uh it's a privilege to be part of this. Thank you. [applause] &gt;&gt; Okay, I will kick off. So uh as a metaphor for the climate, we're drastically running out of time and I

can see a clock ticking down in front of me. So I'm Rob. I'm from University College London. 200 years ago, University College London was founded with a purpose to drive change, to be

impactful, and to create useful knowledge. That's really important for the climate because We no longer have the ability to let knowledge sit on the shelf when it comes to climate. So in

2026 at UCL, the way that we bring our community together is through what we call the grand challenges. These are a self-funded crossun university way of tackling problems that are too complex

for any one discipline. Climate crisis at UCL sits alongside challenges like mental health and well-being and data empowered societies. and they're found in all 11 of UCL's faculties from

engineering to health and arts and humanities. So where does AI come into this? Well, AI at UCL is not seen as a single discipline but as an enabling layer

embedded across the entire institution. It builds on our heritage in AI. We've got three Nobel prizes. We're the birthplace of Google Deep Mind. We've got several companies all at unicorn

valuations. Four quick examples at UCL at the moment. So starting at home, we use our own campus as a living lab. We've got sensor data from across our estate that

forecasts energy demand and detects unusual patterns across UCL's buildings and we turn that into insights for practical innovation intervention. Second example, we've got our spin out

carbon re, which uses deep reinforcement learning and digital twin optimization to cut fuel use and emissions in energy intensive processes like cement production.

Third example is a partnership. UCL's center for sustainability and real tech innovation is created in partnership with Py Real Estate. It links computer science to the built environment and

accelerates AI enabled sustainability in the real estate. It drives impact on the environment but also value for the real estate investors. And fourth, UCL grand challenges has

supported an inclusive AI tool that transforms satellite and drone imagery into accessible web-based sea ice classification that's being used to support safer travel for Inuit

communities. Aviation is another frontier for us. It's a grand challenge in its own right. And in there we are looking at short-term and long-term interventions.

AI is used to create short-term interventions that drive down its impact on the climate while engineering is do undertaking long-term technology transform in electrification and um

hydrogen propulsion. And finally for UCL convening really matters. In April 2025, as UDE mentioned, UCL along with Grail hosted our international summit on AI solutions for climate change, exploring

sectors like energy and the built environment and moving from discussions and pilots to deployment and impact. I'll finish with a quick call to action which is that the grand challenges

crisis can use AI as a tool of meaningful change and impact now and not tomorrow. And if you need rigorous study, you need research for built for deployment, then working with Grail,

working with UCL is going to allow us to change knowledge into powerful impact in climate progress. Adam, &gt;&gt; cheers. And we're properly into Alex Ferguson overtime now. Um, so hopefully

not with the climate change, so I'll try and leave a little bit of time for Uday. So I'm Adam Si. I'm from the Alan Churing Institute. This is the UK's National AI Institute.

We focus on five missions across environment which is focused on uh environmental forecasting and climate change uh on sustainability on defense and security on health uh and on

foundational research. And as the director for sustainability obviously I think that's the most important mission uh and that's why I'm here. Uh but we believe that the time for action is now.

We've seen that the world is literally on fire. We we saw in the US uh which have been linked heavily to climate change. We are seeing droughts in India which is affecting uh the the food uh

and people's lives. We're seeing pollution in Southeast Asia which is affecting health. Uh we cannot wait for new fuels for the energy transition to occur. We we need to do something

immediately uh starting today. And we believe that AI can play that role. We know this because we've have as a part of our institute have applied AI and data science to shipping and reduced

emissions by 18%. Um we have done this in buildings where we've improved HVAC optimization to reduce emissions by 42%. And we've created an underground urban farm that works entirely off renewable

energies in the UK allowing us to grow crops without using any uh CO2. However, I think we done some relatively impressive things for a relatively small institute. We can't do this alone. We

realize that this is a global problem and the the sustainability missions uh chief funer is Lloyd's register foundation which is a global charity heavily focused on the global south. Uh

and so we think that it's really important that we work together um both within the UK and outside of the UK to solve these problems. and that's why we're really pleased to be part of

Braille um to look for global solutions to global problems. So, thank you very much. &gt;&gt; It's a tribute to all our speakers that they managed to put extraordinary

quality into this ridiculously short time frame. I'll just end on three words. One word is uh that we have come through our work together to find hundreds of examples of opportunities

where businesses for example can save money or increase revenues, improve their economic value while at the same time massively improving their emissions profiles on the mitigation side. On the

adaptation side, to your point, there are many examples from Google to all of your institutions where these technologies are already being deployed to save lives at a big scale. And the

last point I'd make apart from I'd ask you to thank our speakers with a big round of applause is first to say that again and again you've heard one theme coming out of this group which is

radical collaboration. work with us to make the difference that we all believe and know can be made through the application of AI solutions to climate change. So maybe we could give our

speakers a round of applause. Thank you very very much. [applause] Thank you sir. Uh from the India I will present the momentos to you.
