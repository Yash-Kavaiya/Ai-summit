## 📝 Transcript

You share the screen. &gt;&gt; Yeah, share the screen. But it's a desktop. While we uh wait for the minister to join us, I would like to welcome

everyone to this special session titled AI for skilling, AI for impact, skilling, inspiring and empowering the next generation by Meta in collaboration with 1 M1B 1 million for 1 billion

foundation. India stands at a defining moment in its AI journey. Not just building technology but building skills, innovation, capacity and future ready talent at

scale. As AI transforms industries and societies, the real question is how do we equip young people with the skills, platforms, and opportunities to innovate with AI and create meaningful impact.

To introduce to you all of you, I'm Saffin Matthew. I'm a vice president at 1M1B and your host for the session. Today's session brings together leaders from the government, industry, academia,

innovation ecosystems and global institutions to explore how AI skilling and youthled innovation can drive inclusive growth in India and across the global south.

The session also builds on the UI AI initiative for skilling and capacity building led by Meta in partnership with India AI, AICT and 1M1B. an initiative that's focused on nurturing and scaling

youth innovation using AI across the country with a commitment to empower 100,000 youth on generative AI and large language models and I'm pleased to share that in the last two months once the

initiative kicked off about 15,000 youth have already been skilled through the program and we are looking at you know scaling it up in the coming few months we have a few innovators uh present here

today in fact three of the inspiring young innovators who are here to show us how they're using AI for good and especally especially innovating using large language models. The innovators

you'll hear from today have been identified through the UI AI initiative for skilling and they have been identified through a hackathon and a hunt for startups who are using LLMs in

a very uh creative manner. So these young innovators are not just learning AI, they are applying it to address pressing societal needs across India. And each innovator will do a short pitch

of 2 minutes. I would like to begin by inviting one of the innovators to go ahead and present his pitch. Uh, AI for cardio. Let's have a round of applause as we

welcome the young innovator. &gt;&gt; Everyone uh my name is Nandakor. In India there are around 30,000 primary health centers are there. So imagine a farmer having chest pain going to this

primary health center. What they going to do? They will take an ECG and a blood report. But the problem is there's no uh in-house cardiologist over there. So they have to send in to a central hub

then return the results back to the primary health center. So the problem is it's around 30 to 40 minutes delay is happening. Delay means the mortality rate is going high. So we built AI for

cardio a desktop application that works completely offline where the uh medical practitioner can upload ECG image along with blood reports to get the final diagnosis. So it's powered by llama

3.21b vision model we fine-tune on 8 100 GPUs and it has been published in one of the most reputed medical journal in the world called British medical journal. So this one is actually have an

interpretation system called cross model attribution system where the model is actually giving the idea where the model is actually focusing on. You can see on the image there's a red mark that's the

model is actually more more focusing on that part. So uh we actually implemented on around 100 plus uh PHC's and uh helping thousand plus patients. So the motto is simple wherever you are even

you are you are in a rural area the life should have been saved. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. I think that deserves a round of applause. Excellent. Excellent use of AI for the masses.

Thank you so much. Now we have the honorable minister here. With that, we can begin with an insightful fireside chat that aims to explore India's vision for AI skilling and how collaboration

between the government academy and industry can unlock large scale potential and opportunity. Now it's my privilege to invite onto the stage Sri Jan Chri. Sir

the honorable minister of state independent charge for skill development and entrepreneurship and minister of state for ministry of education and joining him for a fireside conversation

is Mr. Aman Jane the senior director and head of public policy India Meta. &gt;&gt; Firstly uh it is incredible to see so many people in the room still. It's been it's been 5 days and uh I feel like my

first reaction when I came today was that uh uh you know it seems like more people every single day. So uh so it's incredible. Well, thank you everyone for uh for being here. Uh I I hope the

traffic will get better uh where you're exiting but uh um thank you for being here. Firstly, thank you uh to um honorable minister and guest uh who's uh graced us with his presence. Um you know

one of the things that's become very very clear at uh at this event and in especially in the last five days uh honorable prime minister in his remarks also spoke about um uh you know a lot of

the importance of AI and what we want to be do able to do with AI is essentially going to become a function of skilling uh and we are we are lucky to have a dynamic uh minister in charge uh for

that very very important portfolio um so um so I had a couple of questions and you know we could uh just uh hear your thoughts uh on them. Uh just to start off um you know I'll ask the sort of I

don't want to be provocative but but just uh uh make it interesting. &gt;&gt; Why not? &gt;&gt; So make it interesting. So um you know and and because I referenced the prime

minister's remarks um you know at at the beginning of the uh summit uh you know he did say that look uh uh AI taking away jobs the very notion is kind of misplaced um you know stating that

technology actually creates new opportunities um rather than uh eliminating them. So I want to know what are your thoughts on this because that's obviously top of mind for folks that you

know with with more proliferation of AI are we are we going to end up losing jobs? uh and then uh uh you know depending on how you think about it also from your vantage point then what would

be your advice to youth? &gt;&gt; I think it comes down when any new tech comes in if as a society we adapt to it early and if you're a first mover second mover maybe even the third mover then

there you advantageous position and the size of the pie will go up. So as currently we are not seeing that because AI is not adopted at scale yet. It's the promise of it, the idea of it, the

multi-dimensional nature of it that is exciting everyone and everyone in the room knows whether I'm a farmer, I'm a student, I'm you know a professional, I'm an entrepreneur, I'm an accountant,

I'm a strategy consultant, I'm a student, it's going to affect all of you in very personalized and intimate ways. you're going to be using it and you're going to be affected by it. So I think

India is in a position where after this event we've created a huge uh mass of people that are going forward on this that are engaging with this without fear. There is no fear there. Yes,

there's confidence and with time we'll be able to with our architecture build trust because trust come becomes very important when you are giving away a lot of space to technology but it is

inevitable. If you look at the offline online retail for instance as an example people still like going to the small shop the canara shop and having that conversation but at the same time you

can see a dramatic shift towards the online model. uh the impact that internet had it probably took away a lot of jobs but if the share of the pie went up the possibilities today using social

media monetization that I see I've gone to villages and I see people uh I would ask them earlier okay what are you doing they would say we've done BA pass I'm saying what are you doing or even an MBA

and they say what what are you doing now they say I'm doing agriculture I came back basically I lost out or I gave up and I said okay now I have no choice I have my two acre I have to till that

land till I die. Now when I go to the villages, you see young boys and girls with walking with a stick. So they've been able to monetize and create a new space for themselves. I do

believe AI will come up with a whole set of new jobs. Context mapping for instance, we're just assuming that large enterprises will take you know 500 agents. Who's going to train those

agents so that the process flow actually gets automated? Who's going to contextualize? Even now in India, the voice that speaks in the lift doesn't seem like a voice

that is familiar. They still have not been able to get the the kind of the language, the nuances and India is so so diverse. So for any AI model to represent all of us as Indians, it'll

take time. So that contextualization is a story where I think you're going to see a lot of people at the grassroots getting opportunities. Our startup system is very robust and the best part

is that with a huge population that is savvy, that is adept, uh adaptive, that is trained and skilled. The probability is higher that the best new ideas of the future going to come from India. This is

what that event is about. exceeding that ambition in every young person and when those enterprises get created there will be job creation but will every job be the same as it was 10 years ago it isn't

even now the the catch is that we are told every time technology comes in it's supposed to make your life easier so but everyone ends up working harder so this is the question in the room it's

AI will make us all more productive will we be able to be more humane in and will we value our experiences as human beings more as a society uh or will it life become harder for us?

This is where the tagline of the event Can we take out more time for more productive aspects of our life? The blurring between technical and non-technical qualified people. I

believe that would be great cuz it offends me when we say white collar blue collar that itself is offensive because what are we trying to say? So I think those things will get blurred because

the opportunities are immense. You don't need to be have knowledge of programming to become a coder or to create apps. to create products. Uh that is the beauty of this

AI. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Um you know you said something uh on the pi increases and uh you know as an example and just to corroborate that point further um you

know we've seen that in retail for instance where overall the pi has increased in size and so you know e-commerce actually is just 7% of the total retail uh in India and uh and as

we go towards a 5 trillion 7 trillion 8 trillion economy that retail continues to grow sort of you know um fair bit &gt;&gt; to that you're while they uh receive a lot of criticism and they must evolve to

better practices uh and social security benefits for the gig economy. But if you look at the aggregating platforms, were those small dhabas and restaurants actually getting any business and could

they have survived? And if not these aggregating platforms, what other tool would have come that would have changed? So we just sit here thinking that life will be the same, it will not be the

same. There will be something something all the time. There is going to be flux and that's a dynamic nature of a globalized world. Absolutely. You know, you mentioned the theme of the summit.

Uh the theme is AI for all. So, your thoughts on how we can use AI to to ensure that it, you know, skilling and the benefits of AI reaches um you know, what would be called traditionally

underrepresented groups. So, you know, whether it could be people with disabilities, it could be um people in far-flung areas or you know, in the northeast or anywhere else across the

country. How do we make sure that AI and the benefits of AI and skilling uh along with it reaches every part of the country? AI impact and the kind of products we're already seeing out there

some of them are displayed here have a tremendous uh possibility for special people with special background handicap I mean disabled people and one of the challenges in the education system is

that we need to screen and identify those students earlier so that a customized more sensitive environment can be created for them in the classroom. So one aspect is teacher

sensitization that does a teacher have the capacity are there tools out there which is why we tried a press app in our schools and a second iteration is now being rolled out I'm sure there can be a

layer of or some kind of augmented augmentation using AI but if you're screening early because in in the Indian case our if you look ask me how many schoolgoing students in India are

categorized as uh with special needs less than 1% And what is the actual figure? Probably six, seven, eight%. And why are children then dropping out? This is one of the reasons, one of the

biggest reasons why if children are not completing school because that school is not able to capture their unique capability. So no child should be left behind. The best teachers were the ones

who didn't teach the best kids, who paid the most attention to the weakest kids, people children who are not following, right? Every child is important in that classroom. And now with AI there are so

many teacher tools out there that uh individual journeys can be mapped can be analyzed and corrective action can be taken real time. So that is a power of how AI at scale can transform our

capabilities and competence. U northeast tough geographies again AI has solutions there on the skill India digital hub we've tried meta has been partnering us and we created skill India assistant

which again is making the journey easier for anyone who comes to the portal. Skill India digital hub is now a DPI. We are not going to add more and more data layers on it and try and create more

value for researchers create a open stack if you can. IIT Madras is working in similar fashion on the education center of excellence and education that also includes elements of skilling but

the idea there that is being proposed is also to create a full education stack. So all of the ed tech solutions, all these new startups, all the vibrancy that we are seeing in this summit and in

this room, those players can now come on board and partner government in our journey to uh to change lives. I probably should have started with this that thank you for visiting our booth.

uh you were uh you were just there and uh um you know and we had the uh honor of also hosting the honorable prime minister uh on day one and uh and I was there and he was very uh sort of engaged

and uh and what we'd shown to him was uh this feature on the rayband glasses meta rayband glasses called be my eyes uh and that exactly is that point that how it helps um you know that is a specific

feature for um people with uh you know impaired vision uh or or andor blind in this but but there are so many different sort of use cases uh where where AI can truly help. Language is so important

&gt;&gt; that language people will slowly move away from this parochial mindset of it's pronunciation it's going to go away our way of thinking will then migrate to what is he

saying what is she what is she trying to communicate the idea that she's talking about that is most important the the medium which is just a language should not matter those barriers will go away

very easily with AI that capability is already there. You are working on that. Surv has come out with a very small edge computing model that is not expensive and can run on your you know any device

that you own practically. uh and and and because you mentioned server as well uh we are you know working with them on essentially what we call the AI kosh and and again u the

focus there is on u you know multilingual omnilingual you know how many more sort of languages we can um uh we can add uh and and and that's I think also a fairly sort of good framing I

think the Indian government did at this event and essentially saying that look it's about uh it's not necessarily a race for frontier models but it's more about models that

uh for you here and and and and that should be a focus. Uh you briefly touched upon it so I wanted sort of uh you you know we've got many organizations represented here. Um you

know what would be sort of your advice or clarion call for uh industry to partner with you uh as you're thinking of advancing many of these skilling initiatives? How can industry partner

more with you um uh as in your work? &gt;&gt; Yeah. So the I my one ask really is that enterprises are created and value is created when you are able to widen your engagement with your clients with your

new markets with a new base of employees. But if you do a real analysis of corporates in India as they have come to this point they are still hiring on closed networks. It's the elephant in

the room. They will hire based on trust and faith which must be high. So we need our industry partner. using our academic infrastructure. One new scheme that has come in that I'd

make a pitch for is PMCU. For the first time, 60,000 crores. It's a lot of money. 60,000 crores is being put in our ITI. So our ITI are the grassroot organizations, government ITI. There's

maybe more than 3,000 in the country. They are going to get benefit from this. We're going to create clusters. It's not going to one ITI. The idea is not just you create a swanky building or a lab

and let it be. It is also incorporating ideas of governance. Can these becomes institutions and create a network. So it's going to be five ITIS in a cluster working

together aligned to the local economy to the needs of the MSME there and with a partnership where a industry partner will be onboarded as part of the governance of that institution. We want

industry to say we will run these five it will design new courses in those it will look at our trainers globally if you look at the skill ecosystem

the people who are working in industry are the people who are going to their in the Taff for instance in Australia which is our equivalent of ITI people who are currently working in industry are going

there and working and training similar in European guilds people who know cutting edge practice they know know what the employers want. They are the ones who are actually going and teaching

in institutions in our system. Who is teaching? The state is the one hired by the state 30 years ago who perhaps his trade is carpentry. Now he has to teach AI, welding, electronics, circuitry. So

if you yourself don't have that domain knowledge as a trainer, as an instructor, your capacities are limited. So we need to create a repository of trainers that again industry will come

in. We need to create new courses. Do you know we still teach Hindi stenography. It's a one-year program. You should wonder why we are teaching it

and why are children going and learning it? Because they need the certificate. No one will tell you this for recruitment which is why they are doing that program. All of this needs to

change. So while we're talking new technology, we're talking AI, we're seeing the visible impact at the grassroots, we need a lot of rejuvenation in our educational

institutions. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Um I know you're you're short on time and so again I've uh I'd like to thank you for for taking the time. I I think uh um you know in in in

in a few minutes you've really uh you know shown a very exciting vision and and also a clear way for how industry should partner. uh at Meta we obviously believe in this a lot and we are already

working with your u ministry with the skill India assistant we hope to do more and uh and and you know uh um and you'll see that uh uh in the coming sort of weeks and months uh and to everyone else

in the room as well I'll again mention this that you know it is uh it is really a privilege to have such a dynamic um uh minister uh in charge of what will become probably the biggest sort of area

for disruption uh over the next few years which is going to be skilling education and so on. So, thank you again for for your time.

&gt;&gt; Thank you so much sir and Ammon. That was a fantastic conversation. And if I may, please request yourself for one photograph with all the panelists. If I can request all the panelists to come on

stage for a group picture. &gt;&gt; I'm not sure from morning it's going on. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Thank you so much. While we get ready for the next panel, I

would like to request our other two innovators to come forward and pitch their innovations as well. So, I'd like to first um invite Proima AI if you can come forward and present your pitch.

So, good evening. My name is Ashish Praab Singh. I'm the CEO of Proxima AI. My father MSME business in Lucknau. So wherein all the data is actually scattered across email, spreadsheets and

WhatsApp leading to 35% productive time loss and 10 to 15% in revenue leakages. But this is actually a all India problem leading to 8 lakh cr plus of annual cost overruns across Indian MSMES. There are

7 cr plus msmemes across India. So how we have solved the problem is by building an autonomous AI agent that can think, act and execute on your behalf. Users can get work done uh by uh by the

agent by giving it simple commands to do work like tender extraction, tender tracking, CRM querying and calendar management. Under the hood, we have used meta foundational models uh particularly

scout and maverick because we in our internal evals we have found them to be particularly good at reasoning, planning, orchestration and tool usage. Results, we have achieved 15,000 minutes

plus saved monthly with 99.9% compliance accuracy. What sets us apart is reduced we have reduced the productive time loss from 35% to nearly zero with a 6 to9 month payback period for our clients.

Currently our revenue standards stands at 41 lakhs in the last 6 months. At the end I would like to thank 1M1B and Meta AI for this opportunity to collaborate with them.

&gt;&gt; Thank you so much and all the MSM is here. He's someone you could reach out to for an interesting solution. Next, I would like to invite uh Ayur the GPT who's got a very interesting

solution. If you visited um I think hall number 14, you would have seen a part of the solution presented there as well. They have a stall there. Yeah. Nure

sorry. &gt;&gt; Hello. So, good evening honorable uh dignitaries and respected guest and all my dear friends. So my name is Himmanshu

and I'm representing Ayurveda GPD. So Ayurveda is India's gift to the world and people have been embracing Ayurveda. Uh so yeah pretty much like there are a lot of manuscript text right available

but they are pretty much difficult to interpret and further the people cannot access it directly. So we've been like working on this initiative uh for Ayurveda GPD where not

only you can just access this knowledge but also you can have a real-time conversation with the rishi in terms of video kind of chat. So let's say uh pretty much this model is being trained

on more than 300 million plus ayuric tokens. It's of i4 architecture based and further it is reality rooted from the manuscript itself. So whenever you are having a doubt about let's say uh

fever itself. So during that you can just simply query to that particular model and it will give you answer right from the manuscript along with the dedicated source. So further there are a

lot of government initiatives being there but there hasn't been a specific model which directly rooted from the manuscript. So this was the initiative that we kind of launched and further our

current model uh you can directly see it on the screen itself that's a demo where I'm having a real-time conversation with Arishi related to the manuscript. So yeah thank you. So are you guys ready to

take it to the global level? &gt;&gt; Fantastic educative um taking Ayurveda to the global stage using AI. Thank you so much. Now we move on to the leadership

dialogue titled empowering youth and driving innovation through AI skilling. May I please request our respected panelists join us on the stage for the discussion. Uh Mr. Mr. Pankhash Kumar

Pande IAS Principal Secretary Government of Karnataka Department of Personal and Administrative Reforms. Let's welcome with a round of applause department of eGvernance. Mr. Rishkesh Patanker, Vice

President NSDC. Mr. Buddha Chandra Shakar, CEO Anwadni and CCO of AICT. Mr. Darren Faren, director, United Nations Information Center India and Bhutan. I think Mr. Deepak Bagla who's a mission

director for Innovation Mission. He'll just join us in a few minutes. He's in the other room. And the discussion will be moderated by manav the founder and CEO of 1m1b.

Hello everyone in the room. My name is Manav uh you know and and trust me I didn't change my name yesterday. I was always man you know and until the prime minister just uh you know casted the man

of vision for us and it's you know it's uh yeah what a vision for all of us um to uh to take AI but you know you know thanks to my parents uh I did uh they named me man of quite some time back so

welcome everyone uh we have a very high energy panel today and very limited time and uh we'll try to make it interesting and uh I'll try to utilize the maximum we and out of the short time that we

have amongst these distinguished people with me. So um you know I'll start off with you know AI is the they say it's the new internet AI is the new electricity. Uh the question is who has

the switch and today that's what we will be discussing. You know if the past technology patterns we have seen that there have been a few country who have made it and the rest of us consumed it.

uh that needs to change and uh India is uh is going to change and uh when the the youngest population collides with the most powerful technology which is artificial intelligence we're going to

have creators and consumers and this is the opportunity for India to have AI creators like what we just saw Ayurveda GPT right like these are local innovations that we need to see so I'll

start with the question uh first to uh to Mr. Pankage Pande and Mr. Mr. BLA would be joining us but Pankage has been you know leading he's the principal secretary of ego governance at

government of Karnataka and there's a lot of action the government is taking in Karnataka especially on the skilling front. So the question um pankage to you is what what role are is the government

of Karnataka playing to skill the government workforce and make sure that we are aligning the government official also with what's the trajectory that the comp that the country is taking. Yeah.

So, uh thanks a lot and uh congratulations to the young innovators uh for having presented these three concepts and uh it's very well done. Uh my compliments to them. uh if I look at

the government uh see uh the government the verticalization or in terms of protecting your own territory and the information is is is very that feeling that okay this entire data and this

entire data set belongs to me is extremely high amongst the department and the government is one of the one of the institutions where we create a huge amount of data you take energy uh you

take agriculture various departments Now uh for a good and targeted delivery of the services of the government uh we need to uh ensure that these data sets talk to each other

and therefore one thing which has to change is the change in the mentality of the people working in the government that we have to talk to each other. We have to collaborate with each other. We

need not just create data but we have to collaborate and ensure that this data set is used for the purpose uh for which it is meant. And uh for example, I'll give you a simple example like uh uh the

farmers will require data on on on the weather. Obviously, this weather data also has to be used apart from the cropping pattern to ensure that the power supply is given in the various

irrigation pumps at feeders which go and supply the power to uh to your irrigation pump sets. Now these two are related to each other apart from the cropping pattern. So your GPS data uh to

the granular level your uh data regarding the energy and the data regarding the cropping pattern and the weather conditions are interrelated. Now these department needs to talk to each

other like energy, agriculture, horiculture, your disaster management cell all of them need to talk to each other and therefore the mental frame of the government officials have to change.

In fact in this direction we had a workshop. We called uh the second in command of all the government departments first who maintain their data. Every department has got some kind

of an IT cell. They have a IT cell which manages their data, manages their software. We wanted to target them that you need to talk to each other. You should see that what kind of potential

exists if you start collaborating. So this is one thing and obviously uh this will also require the academia and the industry to come together with us and and that is where we want their help to

be taken. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you very much uh pankage. My next question is to uh Buddhaji. uh there's a lot of work happening on Anuadini AI and uh you know

what the minister was talking about that we need local languages and uh and you are leading a big initiative in the country especially in higher education so would like to have your views on how

this is coming along and how the grassroot participation uh can be critical and will be critical uh looking at some of the work that you're doing. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Good afternoon all uh on

behalf of ministry of education government of India I welcome all of you for this thoughtprovoking sharing is caring you know that's in the first standard book I think you know

what a wonderful event is happening from last four to five days knowledge is flowing from one place to another place not only within our country from the across the globe you know so because we

all believe the entire world is our family that's the reason you know this it says you know wellness for all you know for everyone you know happiness for everyone, welfare for all, you know,

very very apt. So I just come back to this because I see this in a little different way because have you ever seen skill books anytime for a plumber or a painter most of the books has a images

without a description? Have you observed? So the biggest problem if you give this books to notebook LLM to Google I'm just taking a notebook LLM. You can take any any such kind of a a

tool. It can't even describe what it is. So that's where the Anoadi Ministry of Education component comes into picture. We have created a advanced visual large learning model. It can understand what

is there inside the image and it will describe what is there inside that image in Indian languages because as you all know that 85% people in in our country they speak their mother language. So the

way they communicate they trade in mother languages. So that is a biggest issue. So, so what we did we have translated all skill related books into 22 Indian languages so that the the

plumber painter you know who is not well educated can easily understand but you know we did that and we have one very big event in Bangalore so my wife is also from Bangalore I thought I will go

and you know little show off and send a photos to my wife saying that you know I'm there and you know I helped your people then I got a shock in my life one painter I just asked him sir you are

also there in that event. So basically I asked one simple question key are you happy we have given you book he said sir you don't understand our problem I said please explain what is your problem you

know the shocking answer he gave sir he said I'm a painter in one hand I hold paint da other hand I will hold the paintbrush how I will hold the book do you see the difference between human

intelligence and artificial intelligence so we are creating all technological solutions. Assuming that one human with a with less educated person can use it then

not able to sleep then we have come up with a wonderful audio-based books for them because see I think this is where I see uh AI comes into picture but I put this in a three simple perspectives

learning earning leading this is a simple three dots which we need to connect you know when with respect to the skilling and connecting that with the artificial intelligence

but when I artificial intelligence you know the artificial intelligence with the data intelligence with the business intelligence because these three are dots are interconnected but because

people love artificial intelligent word so you know they are just simply using it but the matter of the fact here is the content what you have is not self-explanatory one the second thing if

someone wants to learn it right the best way of learning is in their own mother language but here the challenge is if you take exam again I'm taking Canada but you know you Take any language.

Example, if you take Hindi, Punjabi Hindi is different than a than a you know Bangladeshi sorry you know Bangladesh West Bengal say if someone is coming and speaking in Hindi their Hindi

is different then a Bihari Hindi is different than a Bpuri Hindi is different than a Hani Hindi is different than a Rajasthan Hindi is different. Do you see the issue right? So the

neutralization of these softwares, neutralization of these languages into a common neutral Hindi you see see that is where Anuadini comes into picture because he was asked me to

talk about Anadi. So, so basically we are a small learning model you know nothing rocket science but you know we are trying to solve the major problem of making everyone understand what it is in

a pictorial way in a audio based as well as in a video based and recently as you know the there are lot of cling and all I hope you all are using it see this advanced technology is given us a wings

to fly because if you are just you know talking maybe 40% people can understand but if I am showing you something right so the because human being has a best of the best ability of capturing the

impressions of images that is what we will run it so fast and we we called it as a videos right that's the reason people like YouTube videos so now the matter the fact is we are translating

all the skill related content in a AR VR and a video and pictorial basis so that people can understand easily and at the same time it is in multiple languages not only in Indian language you know if

you are interested to learn multiple languages is let us assume I'm the one who is getting trained but you know I'm planning to place in Japan. So now the matter of the fact is skill ministry

come with a very wonderful initiatives where I can learn everything in Japanese as well as in my own mother language and including English. So what a beautiful combination we are creating. I see that

this artificial intelligence is no more an artificial intelligence. It's an advanced India. God sent an AI to make India's advanced country advanced India. So this is where I clearly see it. Do I

have one more minute or &gt;&gt; Yeah, we can. Yeah, please. No, no, I have more questions for you. But but but I'll let the but thank thank you Budhaji. Thank you so much. In fact um

&gt;&gt; I mean if you allow I just connect these three dots. &gt;&gt; See the learning is important as well as earning is also very much important because we are competing with something

called artificial intelligence. You know the much more better intelligence. But I would like to take you back to one level to prove that you know human intelligence is greater than artificial

intelligence. The reason being is you know there is a soap company. I'm sure you all use soap right? So one of the European customer complaint saying that I received a soap box without a soap. So

the company CEO is a technology they spent 300 million and created a best of the best ICR engine in the world which can peep inside the soap box without putting a hole to see whether the you

know the soap is there or not and he implemented everywhere but you know the company they have in India also it is called senarosop you have seen the ad also in the newspapers and TVs so they

never the guy who sitting there he never implemented it the CEO got pissed off he came visited India and he said you know what is the reason you're not using you give me an expl ation I spent 300

million do you see the Indian best of the best brain the guy who's sitting there is a sixth standard failed farmer and a small labber you know and he said sir I don't need to use this so he said

prove it in front of me that you know you don't need to use it you know what he did he just took a table fan and put in front of the of the you know of the conveyor belt of the soap so what

happened if the soap is not there you know it's empty box right it fried he said I don't even need to pick brothers I'm telling you dear Friends, this is the best of the best brains Indian is

carrying. You know, Indians has a best capability of connecting right and left brain. We are the best of the best human beings living in this world. The only problem we are not confident, we are not

working as a team. That is the only problem. I think the second dot you know we are not converting our skills into a earning which is much more important because you know if you earn then only

you will live right because you need money at the same time how you can survive take it to the next level. Maybe I will just you know try to pass on to the other panelists. I don't want to

occupy their time but we will discuss further. &gt;&gt; Sure. Sure. Thank you. &gt;&gt; In in fact you know there's an innovator in the room Bumneshwaran. I don't know

if he's here. Okay he's here. He's a farmer's son and he himself has created a technology which is voice based AI for farmer guidance. Right. And uh and when I was talking to

him, he was saying nobody none of the farmers like the complicated apps. Uh you know, there's too much too much too much of content out there. I'm just making a simple phone uh and a

voice-based service and uh that's what he's a he's he's getting that that grassroot knowledge to to AI which is so important uh and one of the stories that you were sharing. So uh so thanks

Bhneshwaran for being here and so any any of you anyone of you who are interested to know his technology he's a local innovator uh he's sitting back in the room but I'll uh I'll I'll turn the

next question to uh to Balaji uh who's the mission director at Adel innovation mission um and one of the big things is we need policy policy for AI acceleration and there are innovation

labs uh that utel innovation mission is putting up in the hinterlands of India so Um um so Mr. Bagla, how how can a local innovator participate from the hintterlands of India and still make

something which is globally relevant or does he need to make something globally relevant? &gt;&gt; You know first I'm sorry I got a bit late. I was on the hall number 17 19 you

know what was happening there they had identified so we have tinkering labs currently in 10,000 schools 5,000 share p actually sar and government schools and private

schools all included so in the next 96 hours quick background uh utal innovation mission which is the government's innovation mission so it is from school to space and I'll give you a

quick introduction on that will turn a 10 years and its 10th birthday which is after 96 hours it is the world's largest grassroot innovation mission 1.1 cr young entrepreneurs have moved to

it and I'll give you an answer there were three kids 11, one 12 and the other one 14. You know what are the solutions they came up

with? One has given a solution of radiology. How he's brought in AI that reads your when your MRI happens and gets it out of you.

The other one is treating mental health among students with AI. These are kids which are 11th. I can't even call them kids. You know I'll give you a small example.

I was just posted into utter innovation mission July and May and I said I want to test the power of this platform. I'm just telling you at a school level to begin with GMA my colleague is sitting

here and it was in September mid and I said let's do a hackathon and everybody told me I said no let's do it. None of you know about it because there was no big ad.

Five weeks later, we had over 25 lakh prototypes. It is now in the Guinness Book of World Records as the world's largest hackathon. And I'll tell you what

happens. What I'm saying here, these are not just entries. These are solutions to challenges from that small village. I remember Saturday I was doing my puja

phone third time I picked it up. The guy said, "Sir, nth class student." I said, he said,

India is a different India. Ga say he finds my mobile number calls me up. This India cannot be stopped now that we are number three in startups in

the world and number two in the number of unicorns and all. This is just a drop in the ocean. This story is just 3,600 years old, 3600 days old. This utter innovation mission

story. Just imagine all these people coming into your workforce and they are solving the smallest of problems which are there which are contextual.

And the other interesting thing Mangalore government school so every year there's a global olympiad of robotics they select from the best all across the

world who are go who go and present and it's a very difficult process to do it. This time it was in Panama. My five kids flew to Panama all within 96 hours of getting a visa

and being there. And of over 90 countries, they came 13. This is it's really unbelievable what is happening in India. And that's what I was just saying in

that room when I came from there. I said the future of India and the biggest benefactor of AI in the world which we call is the delta multiplier is India. We are 1.4 billion. We will be 1.6 6

billion and by60 you will be the largest on the planet. Just imagine each one of them with the power to make the change and

the power to work together to make it happen which is what AI is doing now. It is empowering that youngster and it is giving them the ability to

join hands with each other. The dots which you are joining this power we have not even thought of how it can be unleashed but you know it cannot be stopped.

You are now at that inflection point and we are all underestimating how fast it will happen. in India. It'll happen now. So ladies and gentlemen, the future is

now. &gt;&gt; Yeah. The future is now. Thank you so much. And uh &gt;&gt; if you permit, I just want to add one and see the kind of a transparent system

government of India have. The school children from a small remote village they got recognition you know and they got help also. This is the you know governance what honorable prime minister

G is you know created a transparent and very valuable system for our next genz as well as millennium. Great. And I'm being told we have five minutes. Uh, so I'll be making it very

quick. And my next question is to Darren Far who's uh, you know, who's an Australian. And we were having a nice banter about the the World Cup that is going on.

&gt;&gt; We took your time. &gt;&gt; Sorry. Sorry. What is the World Cup? I'm not familiar with &gt;&gt; And you know, &gt;&gt; I could draw your attention to the

Winter Olympic medal team. when and Darren and uh we work together and he Darren is from the United Nations Information Center. He's based in Delhi. He's seeing it all happen. And Darren,

not the World Cup question which I'll talk to you later, but the question to you is uh very very quickly because we have limited time. What what role do you think India can play in the

global south and the and and across the globe um in in taking AI and creating uh made made in India for the world? &gt;&gt; Well, I think this week is your answer to that. You know this is the first such

summit we've had on AI in the global south and there's a very good reason why it's in India because India is a global leader in south south cooperation in sharing ideas in getting forward and of

course just by sheer numbers one sixth of humanity it's a microcosm of the world what's being done here all the issues you might face with AI are already happening happening on a small

scale not a small scale but are already happening here in India So the question of languages well that's already an issue in India and you're solving and dealing with it. So the experiences that

you have you can translate to any other country or any other context because you're so diverse already. So I think that's why India is always going to be at the front of the pack in terms of uh

getting out there and sharing ideas among the global south and for us at the UN that's so important because we're really worried about the AI divide the people who might get left behind. So we

want to see India also as a champion of that of making sure that people not just in uh in India but around the rest of the world get their opportunities to benefit from AI especially in the area

of skilling like it's great to hear of all the innovations and all the skilling that will take place but we do have to remember some people will lose their jobs you know on a large scale. So what

are the solutions we have to get them new skills to to be ready for the future? &gt;&gt; Thanks. Thank thank you Don. And the question Rishies to you is um you know h

how do you think we can scale it? You you're leading it at NSDC. You're seeing it happen. What are one thing or two things we need to do to really scale this and make sure that the talent that

we are developing is actually employable? &gt;&gt; Yeah, thank you Manav G. I think uh government's focus is on employability and it is always said that education is

creating the opportunities but uh scaling creates uh employability and that is also focused in the current budget announcement which has been made that employability has to be given more

focus and uh um employment will come through and uh if we are talking about scale I think some of the speakers have already talked about the scale whatever we do in India is the world's largest be

digital literacy, financial literacy or the transactions which are happening online. I think uh with the right kind of mindset scaling has not been that

aspirational but now with AI and multiple sectors growing in I believe a lot of emphasis is now on improving the skill sets and it is lifelong learning and uh I think with the current uh

government's focus on multiple domains like logistics maybe marine u aeronautics aviation I think uh there are a lot of opport opportunities which are created uh in the ecosystem and uh

with the right kind of uh ITIs who are now the 21st century Indian institute of technologies which our honorable prime minister thinks about and the engineering institutions tier 2 tier

three the schools uh tell innovation missions I think with all these I think the stage is all set we just need to uh create and come together the canvas is vast and uh whatever we do uh will be

scaled up that &gt;&gt; thank you so much thank you and I I'll just conclude with one last question to all the panelists and uh you know public private partnership is so important so

uh one last question huh just wrapping up we just five one last question and I'll start with u uh Mr. Dr. Pankage Pande what what what can industry do to to collaborate with your department to

make this scalable and replicable and that's the question to all of us and we can wrap it up with that &gt;&gt; probably we need the support of the industry the max right now and uh uh and

we want to collaborate obviously with all the major companies which are there in the AI field apart from the startups which we have in in Bangalore and uh I think that will provide us the the edge

which we have in terms of being nimble footed and adopt and adapt to the technology faster. So I think that is what we need right now. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you so much Mr. Vande

Deepak G. &gt;&gt; Today we don't have a choice. It is now an imperative. Everyone has to work together which is academia, industry, government and each

one of us as a stakeholder. The biggest challenge which I see in my job currently. So at innovation mission is the core entity which is responsible for the innovation ecosystem of the country

to see what can be done. My entire focus now is how do I make one higher learning institution speak to another, one young school speak to another and how industry and government

work together. &gt;&gt; You know what is my dream? If I could take a &gt;&gt; No, please please. If I have one dashboard,

all my school innovation labs are there, all my incubators are there, the policy makers are there, the mentors are there, all together on that dashboard speaking to each other, working together. My god,

&gt;&gt; if it happens, unbelievable. &gt;&gt; This Yeah, sorry. &gt;&gt; The power of collaboration. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, so uh one s one thing which I

really love about the western concept is that movement of the people across sectors. So government moving into academia, academia coming to the industry the guy who has worked in the

industry also teaches there in the in the college and again works in the government this kind of a moment if it is allowed that that will really help the government will get to know what is

happening in the industry what is happening in the academy. &gt;&gt; Got it. &gt;&gt; See that that's what NP 2020 is all about sir. Now we are so fortunate that

you know we got NEP 2020. I strongly believe after the constitution of India. This is the best document have come up. It is connecting five simple dots. One is the education with the skill with the

you know with our industry and with our talent and with our innovation you know and research. I think these five dots are getting connected using this. But you know I have a little different

thought was altogether what we need to do instead of doing a cast senses for God's sake no one know don't want to know others cast we need to know other skill we need to do a skill census in

this country so that we know oh time is up just you need to let me finish so the skill census is much more important so that we know each and everyone's skills

let us do a SWAT analysis of it so that we know what is their strengths and weaknesses we need to strengthen their weaknesses and you know make our country better and interconnect all these dots

together. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you so and more power to India, more power to AI. Thank you so much for for the panel. Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you so much. It a small moment for all the speakers. Um it's it's from the impact summit team. And as we conclude, one message stands

clear. AI leadership is not just about models or compute. It's about people, skills, and opportunity. If we invest in youth, we invest in impact. Thank you to all the panelists. Thank you to all the

audience. You have been wonderful. And have a good rest of the evening and rest of the summit. Thank you so much. And a big thank you to our institutional partners Lloyd Business School and Jims

whose students have been here and engaging with us. Thank you so much.
