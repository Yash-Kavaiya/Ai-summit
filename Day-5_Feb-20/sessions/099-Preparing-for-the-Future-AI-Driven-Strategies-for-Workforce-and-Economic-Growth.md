## 📝 Transcript

Hi, good hi, good morning everybody. I've got an incredible panel here this morning. Uh the topic that we have is I think the most important topic uh at the summit. I think everywhere I've spoken

or everywhere I've been it all revolves around this critical topic around AIdriven strategies for workforce and economic growth. And I think the reason this topic is super important is the

fact that if you are a government official anywhere in the world, I think this is their biggest concern is that how is AI going to impact society? How is AI going to impact workforce? How's

AI going to impact industries? Uh so that's going to be the most you know it's the most important topic. So appreciate everybody who's out here. My name is Tish P Chopra and I'm the

founder and CEO of industry.ai. So we are an AI we are an AI company that focus on driving productivity safety uh across manufacturing plants. Uh this is a topic that's deeply uh uh

passionate for me uh because I live and breathe this every day because we are trying to really do this is that how do you create the digital workforce or how do you empower the workforce across

industries u a quick introduction of my colleagues on the call we have Mr. Satinda Singh from the ASEAN uh Mr. Mr. Narendra Sin from NEC cloud should be joining us any minute. Mr. Vinod Jawer

who's really the key in Nextra which is part of ETH. Dr. Nihar Sha who's one of the best uh in in the healthcare space and sorry and Dr. Mahindra Karpen who's a presidential adviser uh to Guyana. So

welcome everybody. Um just one other key point I just sort of say just to put it in context. Uh in India we have uh 70 million MSMES. uh these MSmemes employ 230 million people. The MSME market in

India produces 30% of India's GDP and 50% of exports. And the other big critical thing is how do we bring AI for all? How do we bring AI for all these companies that can't afford what

normally large companies do? And that's the big challenge in front of us. And that's what we're going to talk about today. So in order to really kick this off, what I'd like to do is first really

talk about three critical elements in today's discussion is that how do we redesign our workforce strategies given this new technology that's coming up. How do we build the digital and compute

infrastructure and I'll request uh Vote to talk about that and how do we really ensure that economic growth uh driven by AI remains inclusive responsible uh and sustainable. So with that I'm going to

request Satinder if you don't mind uh kicking it off. Uh and would be good to understand from your perspective how's the digital economy framework agreement going to help governments around the

world navigate the opportunities that exist. Over to you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you Mr. Chopra. Um very good afternoon to all of you. Great to be here with all of I think all of us

are enjoying this uh momentous impact event and it's a great place to be here sharing ideas and I'm here specifically uh Mr. Chopra if I don't mind I'm I'm giving the perspective of the ASEAN if

all of you some of you may not know ASEAN is next door to India we are the today we are the um fifth largest economic block 700 million people most of it middle and upper middle income

economies who are part of ASEAN and with India of course we are deeply connected we have a free trade agreement uh and uh we also have a very strong trade economic IC ties with India and we have

a lot of cooperation going on with India including in the area of digital connectivity. Mr. Chopra talked about the digital economic framework agreement. Let me just update you. What

is that? In short, we call it DEFA. DEFA is a digital agreement. We are now negotiating in the midst of completing negotiations by March of this year. Uh last two years we've been negotiating

it. It's the largest regional digital agreement in the world. The only difference is is also legally binding. So we are actually negotiating with the 11 countries of ASEAN to come on board

700 million people to be digitally interconnected interoperable so that we can do business better and so that we can grow our economies better. Now the essence of DEA came about postco. I

think in CO like in India in ASEAN 2 it really changed us. I think while CO was not good for anyone but COVID also had positive unintended consequence. We saw the greatest transformation taking place

in the way we live, work and play and that interpreted clearly into growth that took place postco. I think the leaders in my region saw the prospects and they also saw the numbers where huge

chunk of economic growth is driven by digital and therefore there's a no regret move now to move the entire region into digital connectivity and and that's where the defa comes through I

think the interesting thing in ASEAN I mean while India is one country in ASEAN like I say there are 11 countries we have LDC's there least developed countries like Laos Cambodia Myanmar and

now Timoles just join us. And then we have advanced economies like Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, uh Indonesia, which is like a middle- inome economies. So it's a mixed bag of economies but the

momentum of getting all of them together to do this we we were able to move the agenda because we were able to show very quickly through data that the biggest beneficiaries actually of the DEFA is

not even advanced economies like Singapore because they already there digitally connected but actually are the LDCs. We were able to show that the impact of DEFA will be greatest in terms

of jobs, prospects, economic growth uh because they are they are really economies which are least developed but they are going to be move moving in um into the latest of all kind of

connectivity at the lowest cost and they'll be the ones who will be able to benefit on a per capita basis in the maximum way. So that is how we were able to get 700 million people from 11

countries sitting on a common agenda of being integrated because you were able to show them the money. If you don't show them the money, nobody's going to jump in and do any such agreement. Money

here means jobs, economic growth, right? Uh deeper uh depth in terms of growth of the people and communities. So DEFA for example if we already ASEAN is a very vibrant digital economy

roughly is about 300 billion today and we are going to be moving to a trillion dollars in size by 2030 in the next couple of years but with DEFA the numbers are showing that the region is

going to double the size of digital economy. So I think this is where we are in terms of um our ability to come together to be able to do business and our idea is of course not to stop in

ASEAN. The idea is that once DEFA is going to be in place, we want to be connecting to India, right? Economy to economy. I think this will really be fantastic. I think we can stop looking

over the shoulder. I mean, basically global south, India, Southeast Asia, there's plenty of markets. Demography is on our side. In fact, even the affinity, the affinity of our people in wanting to

embrace technology is on our side. In fact, some of the uh studies that are showing that actually it is economies like Southeast Asia and ASEAN as well as India is where people are seeing the

translation of the use of AI in the most profitable way. The data is showing that it's not in the west is actually in our region where businesses are beginning to deploy small AI into their day-to-day

business and making a big impact on productivity on growth and also in relevance. I'll stop there and chop and maybe I'll come back later. Yeah. No sat you're absolutely right because I think

in our part of the world I tell everybody that India is trying to lead and be the bridge between the advanced economies and the emerging economies. But I think the dynamics of technologies

needed for our kind of part of the world is very very different from the west. So I think if we can get a good price point to provide these technologies that'll be great. Uh Dr. Carpon, you're an

interventional cardiologist and uh you know you're advising a lot of governments around the world. Would be great to get your perspective uh in terms of how you see AI and its impact

in terms of transforming public healthare. Now Dr. carpenter. I was at a at a discussion was it two days ago with Vinod Kosla and he always says some really provocative things and one of the

things he said was that in a few years from now uh AI we won't we won't need doctors in the world and I know M said we won't even need doctor surgeons in the world

&gt;&gt; you don't need &gt;&gt; so you don't need so you know would be you're you're the actual real person who does all this stuff so would be good to get your perspective

&gt;&gt; thank you very much for having me here and uh I bring you greetings from our president Dr. Muhammad Eran Ali and vice president Dr. Bar Jagio. Um we are from a small country located in South America

just a population of 850,000 people. I believe on the way here I might have encountered 850,000 people on the road. So you can imagine the scale that we are dealing with. What is transformative

about Guyana at this time in our history is that sometime 2015 we discovered oil offshore and you know that everything that comes with that transformative discovery. The oil and gas industry is

now booming and we're trying to learn all of the lessons from states that have walked this path before. those that have relied heavily only on oil and gas, they have encountered

tremendous difficulties that we are hoping to avoid. So, one of the things or a couple of the things that we are using these resources to do is to help us with our health care, our agriculture

and our digital transformation in the public service. One of the other important things about Guyana is that we have majority of our population living on the coastal area

and most of the rest of the country is forest. So we actually are pioneers in selling carbon credits to the world. The sad and vulnerable part of this, however, is that the coastal area is

under sea level. So using AI, predictive models, all of those things, it's a survival tool for us, not just now, but for future generations. In recent times, we have been fortunate

to have visionary leadership to take us in the direction we'd like to go. And we have in our country several remote villages of indigenous populations. And I'll

share an example, personal example. When I was more in hospital practice, there was a 18-year-old boy had to be flown out from an interior village by the military helicopter after a snake

bite. And when he came to the city, it was the first time that he saw headlights on a car. That's where we still are in some places. So we have been able in recent times to use our

resources to establish tele medicine in particular areas. We have now over 200 functional sites that can actually serve these remote communities. There can do simple things like EKGs,

X-rays, blood pressure, blood sugar, all of the common things and respond to trauma etc. So a health care worker, not necessarily a doctor, a community health worker, somebody indigenous to that area

can assess these patients. They go on video conferencing and all uh 200 of these locations actually have Starlink or we're trying to implement that now so that they have connectivity.

So the specialists on the coast and in larger centers actually can give real-time diagnosis, real-time advice. I myself in the cardiac unit my on call team always will be able to review an

EKG like in India I suppose our number one cause of mortality is still cardiovascular disease heart attack is a huge problem in our population historically some of you may be familiar

with uh the the fact that most of our population at one time were indentured immigrants that left India and the majority never returned and they built homes and created generations of

uh descendants from then in Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago, Sarinam in that entire region. So whatever is plaguing you in India from a health care perspective, it's the

same thing that was transferred because we maintain the same lifestyle. We have the same foods, the same likes, the same dislikes, the same genetic predispositions.

So in our context, what we have been doing is to start at the basic primary level because that's where we are. We're not yet at the Singapore level and the others, but we're hoping to get there in

a very rapid leaprog type of strategy. So, we're using AI at this time to do primary health care, for inventory management, for surveillance, and we're moving into areas like agriculture, for

soil uh management, food production, etc. And to help us in all aspects. So for those of you who are looking for opportunities where there are challenges, there's

always opportunity. So Guyana presents to you tremendous opportunity for investment, for development, and for long-term multigenerational sustainable involvement in our country.

And I am sure, and I bring you this message on behalf of the president, we welcome investors to Guyana. &gt;&gt; Dr. Carpin, thanks so much for that. I completely agree because I think the

world is going to face exactly the same challenges whether it's in healthcare, whether it's in agriculture and I think there's a lot of cross sharing that we can actually learn from. Um N I'm going

to pull you in. Right. So just for everybody's benefit, NR is with the Lawrence Berkeley National Labs which is really one of the leading public research institutes in the world. But N

I just want to share with you about four or five weeks ago uh there was an Majus in ADNO at in Abu Dhabi and they had a 100 CEOs in a room on a Sunday and everybody in the world showed up and

there were four groups of people every major CEO of every major oil and gas company in the world. every the CEOs of every major energy utility in the world, the CEOs of every AI company in the

world, and the CEOs of every large capital provider in the world. And I was trying to figure out myself what's the connect. And at the end of the day, what came out was that the world will need

four times more energy in the next 10, 12 years to support the growth of data centers and all the other things that are going to happen. And that's going to require $4 trillion dollar every year

for the next 10 years. So near with those numbers would love to get your perspective on from a technology perspective and how should the world react to that kind of growth that's

needed. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Um yeah so uh as uh mentioned my name is Nihar Sha and I work at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. Uh it's one of the 17 Department of Energy

National Labs. If you all saw uh Oenheimer you might know you know where the national labs came from. uh and of course we have a very distinguished history with a lot of Nobel prizes

history. I won't bore you with all of that. Um but you know I'm very grateful first of all to CI for this opportunity to speak and uh you know with respect to the question um obviously energy is one

of the things that I think in you know I go to bed every night I wake up every morning thinking about energy being one of the energy uh you know labs of the United States. Um now one of the other

things that is also probably not uh as known well known I direct the global cooling program at Berkeley lab and uh another blind spot respect to kind of you know you mentioned energy you

mentioned the huge growth uh you mentioned uh you know the huge investment needed another thing that's needed is going to be uh cooling and uh that's another blind spot that I think

we we don't really pay attention to so those that gathering of CEOs I hope that there's also a gathering of HVAC and data center CEOs uh and then in addition I think uh you

know one more thing that we will probably need to think through in countries like India is the water consumption. So you think about these kinds of things uh you also so we need

to really think about this in the holistic sense um and then you know in the in the bigger picture thing I think uh some of these things of course AI we're at the uh intersection of so many

different things uh but if somebody tells you that they know exactly what's going to happen in 3 years or 5 years or seven years uh they're selling you something. So you might want to to to

take a a second look at that. Uh I'll say a couple of other things right related to you mentioned Ven Kosla just a month ago I was in Silicon Valley uh Berkeley lab is based in Silicon

Valley and Mr. Kosla was giving a keynote there and he said this as usual he said some very pro provocative things. Uh one of the things he said was by 2030 everything that needs human

expertise will be free or nearly free. Second thing he said was uh everything uh that needs you know labor is going to be and this is coming to our topic here uh is going to be also very nearly free.

The thing that I disagree with Mr. Kosla about is that again I mentioned the energies blind spot and the cooling blind spot. Uh so really I think some of these things are going to be

infrastructure bottlenecks which I think some of our co-panelists are going to be able to address. Uh and then also I think along with that uh there's probably also going to be a talent

bottleneck and when I say talent bottleneck I don't mean talent across the board. I think it's going to be particular kinds of talent that we're going to need. Uh and just today you

might have heard the US and India signed or India formally joined this pack silica initiative by the United States. Uh pack silica is an initiative about the whole AI supply chain. So now you're

talking about not just uh you know kind of compute and not just uh you know the infrastructure but we're also talking about the whole supply chain that would allow that to happen and that's an

initiative that the US government has started. So you know there's a range of different things we could talk about uh the workforce dimension of course super important and of course I can come back

to any of those things. U I'll mention one last thing. Berkeley Lab uh the u uh energy act of 2020 uh Berkeley Lab requires Berkeley Lab to essentially report to the US Congress uh you know on

like data center uh growth and they found that over the last uh I would say last decade uh data center growth has tripled. So again you know some of these numbers are bear out even if you look at

history and the forecast is that it will by 2028 triple again. So uh you know these things are again uh not very well known uh but I I do think that you know that these blind spots need to be

addressed by all of us uh and all of y'all and we're at very interesting point with the you know uh I would say industrial revolution uh so let's see what we can do together. Thanks. No

thanks for that n I think you're absolutely right. I think the people are underestimating the challenges of developing all this infrastructure whether it's in terms of cooling whether

it's in terms of power whether it's in terms of communication fiber optics. So I think that's going to be a huge challenge and with that I'm going to turn it over to Venode. Vinod's with

Nextra. They're building some of the largest data center networks in India. But just before this uh panel I was actually talking to Venode because I think uh they're going to be two parts

of the world. They're going to be large cloud data centers which Venode's building. But I also think there's going to be another parallel world that's going to be on the edge. Uh we at

industry.ai AI this week launched the world's first uh AI supercomputer for manufacturing which can go on every factory floor in the world especially at a price point for 70 million MSMES to

transform productivity. So two things uh you know one would be good to get your perspective on how the world's going to pan out of cloud versus edge number one and number two all the challenges or

bottlenecks that Ner was talking about whether it's in terms of Kool-Aid you know capital uh technology skill labor would be good to get your perspective. Sure. Thank you. Thank you very much. I

represent NXTra. Uh it's a subsidy of AEL. Uh we are in this business of building infrastructure for data centers. So that's our bread and butter from next point. So we've been doing

this from last 20 years. We seeing the evolution from a normal server room racks to small enterprise customers to now hyperscalers. Now we got the expert also Narendra here. uh we got now the

new u what do you say elephant in the room called the AI requirement of data center. So much is the demand now which is coming through to build large

infrastructure for data center that next has decided to carve out a separate vertical called AIC on that. So that's the vertical which I represent. We are here to develop large scale gigawatt

kind of campuses to that to cater to the uh fast requirements of the some of our customers to grow primarily in the Indian subcontinent areas here on that. Yeah, they rightly said that um

uh the challenges are there uh power is the challenge um uh land is a challenge and getting the right kind of skill set still remains the challenge. But we come from an uh 20 uh years of experience. So

we understood the ways to overcome this on that. So being one of the pioneers in the home ground industry in the data center here. So we have been doing that. Uh few of the challenges have been uh

pushing us to go beyond certain areas to look at new areas to build data centers. some of them very close to the coastal area so that it can also accommodate cable landing stations for us. So that

takes care of a lot of data requirements. Plus we are also putting sites which are close to national grids. Now there were places where we used to source voltage at 33 KV and now we are

looking at 700 KV volts and all. So this is the thing thoughts which has now evolved and all and it requires a separate uh uh thought process and the uh obviously the large amount of capital

is required to get into that. So we are in this and we are well prepared. Uh the demand obviously is quite high. Uh uh the expansions of next is quite aggressive also and we got something

going on in the south. We'll start something the best going forward on that. to the your second question of how do you do the power and sustainably portion

of it obviously most the power we're going to source from renewable energy that's the key strength in the Indian regions here luckily for uh some of the good policies which have been put across

few decades back by the government we have got plenty of renewable energy generators here uh we the the government is pushing for upgrading the infrastructure to evacuate this energy

also. So once we are at this high voltage, we're also connected to the central grid. So makes it very very reliable for us. So from uh we are aiming to be what we said uh net zero by

30 20 30 32 something is what and u there's a big pool of renewable energy for us to tap into that. We are at present we have contracted close to 400 odd megawatt of renewable energy. So no

longer we are looking at just 50% to be source of energy. That percentage is going almost close to almost 100% now. This is how the whole sustainably portion of data center and India and

extra are well positioned to tap into this. I think that's the interest level in trying to do a green data center evolves for us on that. Um the other challenge which has been

told about how do you do the uh skill set. Yeah skill set is a challenge probably it requires a lot of debate on that. Uh it's something which uh needs to be uh handled both at the fundamental

level at the schooling level and uh uh at the university level and right at the immediate level of training the existing engineers to adopt. So by the time the next generation come in we probably

would have missed the bus. So uh there are three four approaches we are looking at how we can build an immediate kind of skill upgraded to make them suitable to develop the data center on that. So this

is some of the things which we are doing and I think we are as an extra very very well positioned to meet the demands of whatever the customer looking at it. Thank you.

&gt;&gt; No thanks for that uh Vun. I think um one of the things that came out of that session in Abu Dhabi was the fact that the world that's going to win the AI arms war is the country that has the

cheapest energy and I really do believe that in India we have an incredible opportunity. I come from a renewable space. My first solar farm 8 years ago my revenue was 18 rupees a kilowatt

hour. Today we get 2 rupees 202 rupees 30. My first wind farm was 8 rupees 50. Today we rupees again. So I think we have an incredible opportunity in India to really you know win this AI arms war

because the cost of uh producing energy is quite cheap. So Narendra first of all welcome Narendra is the MD of rack bank and Ne cloud. Uh Narendra you've heard all the challenges on terms of the cloud

would be good to get your perspective in terms of one cost of compute in India. How do you really you know make it affordable for everybody and two is how do you ensure adoption across the

country? &gt;&gt; Thank you. Uh so I'm a first uh founder Necloud and drag bank first generation entrepreneur uh technology guy uh trying to solve the

infrastructure challenge which we are facing and uh uh it is start uh that AI adoption is growing super fast but the infrastructure is not taking off that speed. So how to solve that? That's the

biggest problem. The bottleneck is supply chain. What what I believe uh and that's what US and every market is facing. Uh energy is another biggest challenge uh which we have. Uh new cloud

decided uh first trackbang I'll talk about that long back 2013 I started from Indor which is tier 2 city in the country uh center of the country low latency lowmic zone unilateral latency

across India. If you place Indor in center, you'll get that advantage and uh low sysmic zone and the power is cheap and that's uh that's what motivate me to build another data center in Raipur

which is which is scalable up to gawatt. Uh but we afraid uh to talk big numbers uh it it required demand as well. Now demand is flowing the market is very easy. Fast forward 12 13 years in the

industry we realized that uh data centers is no more real estate business it's more than that that you need managed service you need customers demanding the GPUs and running operating

GPU is very difficult it's not that easy and the customer want you to buy the GPUs and put it and operate it for them they want to transfer so it's no more real estate it's combination of four

five industry which is one and one is energy Second is the data center supply chain. Third is the chips. Fourth is the technology and fifth is legal which is

DPDP which is coming up. If you have this five capability then only think about building a cloud in the country. Fast forward seeing those challenges that how we can make and serve billion

users and more than billion users from India. Look at the perspective what what India has. The good thing is we have a lot of sun we can take the advantage less than 30 millisecond from

Andra you can connect entire Southeast Asia from Mumbai Maharasite you can connect within 30 millisecond half of the Mina so what it means that more than half of the world's population you can

connect less than 30 millisecond from India and you have billion users so and and the government EOS government has come up with a good fantastic policy which is attracting every day so every

day is one email we want to invest in data the another email that we want to do than that. So this is a good time for the country cloud part we started last last to last week we launched India's

first orbital based data center in space the objective of this you have free cooling free power and you are solving the biggest challenge which is unconnected

like connecting people places and things from the orbit and the latency will be you are placing in like we are placing on 300 350 50 km away from earth which is we partner with Agniul which is a

space tech company and the space ecosystem is evolved in the country from last 7 years and the government has uh given a lot of open open up the space for everyone for the private player. The

first mission we are sending before end of this year and we believe that this is for critical workload which can protect the borders unmanned vehicles and all those things. So we started exploring

beyond earth and that's what it is needed and we can lead as India because the ecosystem today look at the cost of building data center in India is four five $6 million per megawatt versus $12

million in US in Singapore and Dubai any market you go you get a cost of $12 million why because the 80 to 90% product which required in supply chain is manufactured in India and we have to

strengthen that as government announced that 200 billion I believe this is only for data center infra infrastructure not for chips. So chips cost is on top of it. It's like 5x or 10x. It depend on

what chips you are using. So opportunity is huge. It's about trillion dollar opportunity for the country. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thanks Narendra. I met Narendra about 2021 at the JW Marriott Hotel in Mumbai

and that time you were still start putting together this whole strategy and I was thinking to myself in 2021 uh you know what's going to happen about data centers and now he's talking about

data centers in space. So it's good to see the kind of progress that's happening. Uh before I go I have lots of questions to ask but any questions from the audience that they want to ask

otherwise I can go ahead. Go ahead sir I am basically from industry but before that I was working at research in CSI or so my question to Mr. Sai is uh we have seen hydrogen fuses being used at

experimental level in railways and buses uh but it has not implemented at a large scale neither in India nor abroad. So what are the bottlenecks that are coming in its implementation? Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Thanks. Yeah, I have uh there many colleagues at Berkeley lab actually they have been collaborating with the you know India's national hydrogen mission. So you know I think and thanks for the

question. Uh you know when you come to fuel cells I think uh there are a few bottlenecks you know some of them are have to do with also just even having the hydrogen infrastructure in the

country right. So I'm not necessarily the the right person to address like all of these issues in terms of why hydrogen fuel cells have not taken off. Uh but I do think that some of these things are

still you know kind of an R&amp;D challenge and I think many of these governments are looking at hydrogen to see whether or not you can actually uh you know eventually do the R&amp;D to deploy it and

there is collaboration going on. So you know stay tuned I think it'll obviously India is also doing a lot on that and other countries are also doing that. I can add to this that uh the bottleneck

as a operator is the cost should not be higher than what we are getting today from the grid. Innovation should like lower down the cost than the grid then adoption will happen rapidly. So that's

what we think and that's why I believe the adoption is not happening because people are don't want to pay premium for that &gt;&gt; and I think India can take the lead in

that you know in terms of cost adoption and price points you know the supercomputer for manufacturing we're seeing six and a half lakhs. So I think that's the kind of speed at which we're

going to change the way things are going. So Tindra, I want to pull you in and the ultimate question that everybody's asking impact on jobs right at the ASEAN, how are you thinking about

it because huge concern for governments is AI going to replace jobs? Is it going to enhance jobs? So it' be good to get your perspective and what you're going to say out here is going to drive policy

all over the world. &gt;&gt; No. So um I'm also going to say it perspectively from also how data is being collected already on impact on jobs and actually I've taken this from

um the studies that actually um were done by entropic it's a massive study on AI jobs and uh security and one thing is clear I think right now while there's a quite a major hype on AI but when you

actually study the impact that it has globally and even in Southeast Asia in ASEAN um it's really impacting certain segment of the economy. I think the biggest

impact is actually more on white collar jobs rather than blue collar jobs. Okay. And it's true because a lot of it I think even in the white collar jobs a lot of it is got to do with uh

collaborative augmentation rather than full automation and handing over to the AI to do everything. So I think that's at this stage where we are in terms of the technologies on AI that we have and

how we're deploying them. Of course when you are watching Elon Musk and you watch all these technologies and um of what's to come in two three years time they're saying now this is going to move from

collaboration to totally replacing uh the the human factor. In fact, the takeover part is I think that's what scares most societies and I must tell you this is now becoming front and

center of conversations in government in policy makers. I'm actually quite certain that the governments are not going to hand over this ability of replacements of uh all important jobs at

the high echelons of society to the machine. You know that I can assure you is not going to happen. there will be a lot of effort and conversations going on and it's happening in closed doors where

policy will have to come in to determine what cannot cannot happen you know and those barometers are going to be there and I think that's where that's where you see this impact event I mean you saw

the largest conglomerate of uh decision makers from the private sector sitting with governments in this one location you can see that momentum is there there will have to be there will have to be an

ability for us to differentiate and also collaborate with what the change is going to come and if otherwise otherwise I think you're going to see societies breaking up the contract of governments

with people is going to break up people won't have jobs right and if we are we are saying that the impact is not so much on the blue collar right I think then a lot of the farming community is

bit probably signing with relief but I think we all know that um in the cities where there are millions of people I think this is where it's going going to be quite critical for us to get this

contract properly sorted out. I think in the coming years you're going to see a lot of ethical rules regulations set up in order to ensure that actually whatever change that we embrace coming

from the latest of AI it has to improve not take away the quality of life. Um I think collaboration is going to be the name of the game not displacement of the human uh the use of uh people and

population and I think that is something in conversation. It's not some one thing that in this room we can decide but clearly you can see that the momentum is here for that kind of difficult

conversations to take place. No, you're right. And I like what you just said first and first time I'm hearing that one collaboration not displacement because the word I've been using is

enhancement not displacement but I think it's going to be all of the above. So I think you're absolutely right. U Dr. Carpin would be good to get your perspective especially for of

healthcare. You talked about tele medicine right technically I guess a doctor in the United States or India could be providing advice to somebody sitting in Guyana. So how are you seeing

this whole world panning out in terms of the impact on healthcare jobs? &gt;&gt; Thank you. So I'm glad that you mentioned the collaboration of these uh services. Yes indeed we have in the

teley medicine space we have doctors from India. We have doctors from New York. Um the Apollo hospitals here the Northwell Monk Sinai group in New York they collaborate. they are able to help

us with with patience in terms of displacement of human uh capital or human skill set though I think for most of the countries like ours we're starting out at a at a severe deficit so

there's not a surplus of radiologists there's not a surplus of cancer diagnostic technicians all of these skill sets are extremely limited so AI actually comes in to help us with

diagnosis, accuracy, speed of diagnosis as well as the economic aspect of achieving all of those outcomes. But I tell you one thing as a physician that we are not too concerned for some things

in the emergency room when there's a child who could not who can't breathe from asthma and they're scared parents and AI could make an accurate diagnosis. They could tell you exactly what to

give, what mixtures to nebulize patients. But to comfort and reassure those parents, that's a human function. At difficult stages of life when you're facing

terminal situations, end stage of cancer, you want somebody with warmth to hold your hand that cannot and could never be replaced by AI. So all of this we have to bear in mind the

complimentary aspect of this new era that we are entering into. We rely on the AI to give us the accurate accuracy of the diagnosis. In fact, in Guyana, we just purchased software to help us with

CT scan interpretations and the world is going towards more imaging earlier diagnosis and that will be used effectively to reduce cost to have

better access to specialists. Um, there was a time when we could not even contemplate getting the top guys from Apollo to give us an opinion or the top guys from Mount Si. Now they're willing

and they're able to despite the time difference. Actually, it's like4 to 5 in my morning time. So, if I'm a little sleepy, please forgive me. But this is how we're using it. But that human

touch, I don't believe it it will be replaced at all. &gt;&gt; Glad to hear that. Um and also I sometimes think that um you know when you go and search something on the

internet you get hallucination you get false answers. So the last thing I want is a doctor to be searching and getting the wrong answer and suggesting the wrong medicine. U any other questions

otherwise go ahead. &gt;&gt; Hello I'm the CTO at mind.ai and I'm also the founder of AI societ my I have two questions actually. My first question is that if I am starting a AI

pilot company and to have a full economic impact, what is the biggest technical barrier that I can have while moving towards that? &gt;&gt; Ran, do you want to take that or do

&gt;&gt; you want to go ahead? uh so scale and AI today to you spend $2 and you generate $1 because half of the 50% goes to the AI chip company and uh this problem can be only solved through

enabling indigenous AI chips which has a better performance and the lower cost and maybe in the big guys who enabling the entire ecosystem they have to reduce the cost that's a that's the best way

because once you build the the agents uh we have billion users it's the largest market in in the world scaling when you do the scale people will not pay for the value $20 is not enough or $10 is not

enough for the subscription but your cost is higher so I think uh uh this will take some time the new chips is coming and uh and that's where the job questions related to that if I answer

this the job uh uh the AI voice is fairly usage happen in the country and we are losing even government is adopting AI. They are signing all the MA with the foundation companies. What I

believe that they should not remove the call center. They should come up with a policy because AI is costing seven rupees per call versus call center is only one rupees per call. So adopting AI

in this and you know you're you're firing millions of jobs and what happened after that. So I think in some area government has to restrict or adop the AI and that's those are the

challenge because we have to wait for some time to figure out what these people are going to do next. Upskill their thing. Yeah. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Can I go more?

&gt;&gt; Can I give somebody else a chance? Yeah. Thanks so much. Yeah. Yeah. Somebody at the back you get a hand up. Sorry. Just give me one minute. Go ahead. &gt;&gt; Question to Mr. Sinder. As you as you

have taken the topic of job insecurities say skilling or reskinning. how how can these strategies can help preserve the jobs and still the human in the loop and AI the relationship between this more

better more human friendly more human &gt;&gt; so clearly the um the efforts in most countries in the world is to really start upskilling their populations already beginning is starting from

schools but it is going out to the workforce because the workforce that's actually today actively under siege you know with all this AI implementation and obviously there are

countries who can afford the upskilling the more developed countries are quite generous in terms of capacity building and coming out with programs even empowering uh work employers uh and

workers to help themselves in order to do the upskilling but I'm also worried sometime what are they upskilling with uh what they sometimes upskill with may not be enough in two years time you know

so I think this upskilling is going to really upskill task if I may just say for all of us. Uh so ultimately I think you you you have to continue learning upsklling

is the word but continuous learning to adapt is going to be the name of the game. Um but you know it's going to be harder for my generation and some of us in the panel not all of you uh and for

some of us in the audience but not for some of the younger ones and some of of you who are just starting work right now. And when I talk to some of them, the younger people, they are less

worried about this. They are less worried because they have already grown up in the universe where things are moving in that speed and they are not talking about lifelong careers. They're

talking about lifelong skills that they will keep adapting you onto the new change. So I think that is the name of game to survive. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Go ahead.

&gt;&gt; Yeah. Sir basically you told that the solar revolution came in India when it was a 85 per kilowatt per hour and now it's 2 there were little little catalyst which were involved to boost the solar

revolution in India so one of the revolution was subsidy and the information to people basically I am in favor that AI should come and boost up because it won't affect the jobs it will

fit the people at the particular level where they should And it will increase the literacy and are we also planning to give subsidy on various AI projects which are into development on subsidy

level because it will play a catalyst to boost up the AI model as solar revolution came in India. &gt;&gt; No I think that's the anyone I think the government is doing a lot already the

government's already given 10,300 crores for the India AI mission for sovereign AI. They're giving GPUs available at 65 rupees uh uh per month, &gt;&gt; right? Per month, per year, per hour,

per per hour. So, we're already the cheapest in the world. So, the government has a whole slew of incentives and subsidies that they have announced and they keep on adding more.

I don't know if anybody else wants to add. &gt;&gt; No, I can. &gt;&gt; So, there are quite a few. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it has not been made public.

&gt;&gt; No, no, it's public. It's all public. It's all about &gt;&gt; this event is all about India like if you forget about global missions. So the India is bring us together and uh build

this entire ecosystem. Two years back same alman was in India and talking about you can't do this this is not part of cough of your tea. Now look at 12 foundation models country has launched.

So this is only possible when you democratize the AI access or GPU access to the innovators like you. So that's what government has already done. You just request you'll get the allocation

of the GPU with one of the providers like us and uh you can get a half of the price is paid by Gor by the by the way it's not subsidy they are paying full price and subsidizing the end user like

you the innovators thanks &gt;&gt; I'm Dr. I'm representing academia. My question anybody can answer. I'm very thankful that all of you are contributing a lot

to the industry as well as as your domain whatsoever you're doing. you know that India is the uh youngest country right now and more than 65% of uh our population is lesser than 30 or 35 years

of age and challenge is around 26 to 28% of total population is enrolling for higher education mean the G ratio is not increasing much when the G ratio is not increasing so how you think mean anybody

can how you think that the AI impact will be there on these uh this that particular part of population and how uh their lives can be more uh you can say useful using AI that's the first part

the second part is uh by the advent of anthropic kind of things do you think that there will be the impact on the reduction of cost as well as the reduction of energy uses

So um I I think um um when it comes to the higher education um the challenge is worldwide. So I can tell you in dinner conversations of some of the most uh uh established people I've sat with their

children who are all in high education um you can see that the value system is changing. Um the focus today of some of the most influential people who can make a difference is to actually encourage

their kids to become more enterprising. So I think the the culture of being enterprising has to be given prioritization in order for the ability for us to adapt to

what's coming. And I think if we change that and we create that and inculcate that in the universities even more and bring it up front I think that will be the way we can overcome some of the

challenges you face at least I'm trying to address this first part. Yeah, I think I can add up on top of it that set of AI layers like you can get the GPUs from the but now you don't need to learn

code today you can code through AI right so you can build a we have billion user billion problems so you can solve those problem you can make them entrepreneur like solve one problem at a home or or a

college related or school related and that's what uh we also encourage people should come our students should come and go the industry visit because If they see that they will do that and the

physical world has lot of opportunity than the digital world because digital world is now concentrated with imagine how many apps you guys are using in your phone. Now this will go to one app which

is open AI or cloud. So the money is going to one one company and that's dangerous than anything else. &gt;&gt; I'll just add on the energy part right. Uh so you heard also your Narendra talk

about putting uh you know data centers in space right. So and free cooling uh free energy. So that's one part of it. uh but the other part I think that's interesting about this whole energy

question is uh you know that you really I think with AI are able to imagine potentially I mean we don't know what we don't know and we don't know what we know even right so one of the

examples I'll give you on that is you know with respect to like designing better chips right is like uh when they gave the you know Google deep point when they gave the problem to uh AI to

actually design better chips they found a 50% improvement in the performance of the chips because AI was able to design better chips and so you can think about AI designing better data centers AI

designing you know many different parts of the whole chain and we don't know all of the different things that AI you know even mathematical computational efficiency these kinds of things so

there are many different domains that we haven't even touched that potentially can also have a transformative impact and so this is a very like I said a very exciting time in our lives where we get

to really see what the impact is going to be thanks &gt;&gt; you want to you wanted to add No. Okay. Uh just to add to that uh what we expect AI tools probably to do is to

give an opportunity to gras grassroot. So uh when these tools are being employed and they learn through that and now lot of language barriers are also being breaken up

&gt;&gt; common. So English is no longer a barrier with all the AI tools. So you'll have some set of people who will be using that and qualification is not a driver for that. So so this is what AI

will do and we will see a trend where you'll have lot of blue collar upskilling by themselves. No need to link it to degrees. It is the self-learn module assisted by AI tools which will

make them competent for the market. They could be either a specialist advising or they could be entrepreneurs or they could be a coach on that need not be a sitting in a desk and doing something

which is written there. I think this is how we feel the education system also will change with the tools being available there. &gt;&gt; Thank you. So obviously we are the

newest particularly in consideration of of this room. We're new to the AI game, but one of the things that we've been able to do in Guyana is to create a digital school

at the primary level. And it started working. In fact, it's now being requested by other countries in the region. That's the Caribbean region. And part of our objective is to use this to

get kids kind of hooked on the technology AI type of education. Hopefully, it can be tailored to each individual child to to identify strengths, weaknesses, to strengthen the

areas that are weak, whether it's literacy, numeracy, anything, and tailored to that particular child. And so that their interests can be peaked, their interests can be exploited and

expanded and ultimately they may be able to condense eight hours of school time, maybe three hours and then they can go outside and play like normal kids the way we used to play kids like as kids.

So the digital schooling, the digital era is not necessarily to take all their time to behind a computer and a desk, but to give them more time and more freedom and to create a habit so that

that will follow them not just at the primary level, but when they get university and all the way up to adulthood. Thanks very much. I know we only have

we're out of time right now and I'll quickly wrap this up in about 45 seconds just so that every I think it's been an incredible discussion. Boy, it's going two times now. So, I really have to wrap

it up. But I think I just want to quickly wrap up six or seven key takeaways from today's discussion that we all had. Um the first one is the fact that I think um uh jobs are going to be

key. Uh it's going to be collaboration not replacement. I think the way we do our job that's critical. Um I think Dr. Carpin talked about agriculture and health and medicine. I think there's

going to be huge transformation but the good thing is humans want touch. So that's good but you know there'll be a lot of revolution in terms of teley medicine etc. Uh nihar you talked about

cooling and bottlenecks I think those are things that we all have to think about in our countries. How do we provide the infrastructure for cooling etc and something that you all can work

on and let us know how to make it more efficient. Um I think that's great. You talked about in terms of next in terms of the talent challenges we're going to have and how are we going to have have

to manage all these data centers. Somebody mentioned recently that some of the big data centers in India uh for 30% of the time it's down because of the lack of talent to maintain these data

centers. Reindra you talked about supply chain. It's fantastic that India is also thinking about putting data centers in space. Uh which is fascinating. uh there's going to be a big debate about

you know more data centers versus the edge like I mentioned to you you know there's a one school of thought that we can actually bring the big AI to uh every factory in India uh by bringing it

on the edge and the computing power that's developing is going to make that happen uh uh and the last point I want to say is the point that you mentioned that and I think this is going to be the

key takeaway for all of us is that the speed at which technology is changing is so rapid that We all going to require continuous learning going ahead and it doesn't matter how old you are but

that's going to be the biggest takeaway for me that that continuous learning and upskilling is going to be the key for all of us. So with that really thank you very much to all my panelists and to

everybody and hopefully we can all make an impact around the world. Thank you very much. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much Mr. Chopra and all our dignitaries for such an insightful and

engaging discussion. Before we conclude the discussion, I would request all our dignitaries for a photo group photo because Mr. Sain joined us a bit later on.

Thank you once again for joining us today. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Sure. You're from which country? So this is the first

separate No, it's fine. It's fine. WhatsApp. We just put Just extend.

What do you think about Another question. Welcome. testing, testing,

testing, testing. I'll be here. What's coming? Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Sir.

&gt;&gt; Okay. May I invite all the speakers um to the front to have a seat in the in the front? Um I believe there's going to be a group photo first of the speakers before we start. Um

Minister Mr. Kana Dali uh we'll sit at the front. Uh please take a seat at the front. Ambassador Garcia,

&gt;&gt; your excellency. &gt;&gt; Oh, Dr. here. Yep. &gt;&gt; And if anybody wants &gt;&gt; Okay. Sorry. Should we get us I think I that chair is

much more comfortable for you. &gt;&gt; Okay. Thank you very much everyone. Oh, do you want Sorry, I'm getting I'm getting my cues from the photographer. Um it's not my show yet until I start.

It's a photographer show. Can we please you'd like us to stand up for a group photo? &gt;&gt; Please come in. &gt;&gt; Come in front.

Okay. Thank you very much. It's very Asia. Um we it's not it's not an event unless there's a photo. So um thank you very much.

All right. Um thank you very much. Good afternoon everyone and welcome. Um it's a real privilege for me to um to host and moderate this session. Trusted AI at Scale, a global south leadership

dialogue here at the India AI impact summit. Now, this session hits squarely within the summit's trusted AI pillar and deliberately so because trust is no longer a downstream concern. It is now

the condition for scale across governments, enterprises, and societies. We are moving past the question of whether AI will be adopted. The real question is whether it will be trusted

by citizens, by institutions and across borders. So why this session and why did ISA um uh host this session? The framing for today's conversation is very

intentional. Much of the global II governance debate is still shaped by frameworks emerging from the global north, the US, Europe, and China. Those frameworks are important but they are

not sufficient for the lived realities of the global south where AI is often deployed at population scale under real constraints and in context where the cost of failure is not abstract. It is

social, economic and political. This is precisely the gap that AI safety Asia was created to address. I am one of the adviserss of ISA and our mandate is straightforward but ambitious to bridge

the global north and the global south on AI governance not by importing templates wholesale but by co-designing governance approaches that are interoperable pragmatic and grounded in local

institutional strengths and we do this through the three pillars collaboration capacity building and policy relevant research and what makes this session different.

That brings me to expectations. The session is not about abstract principles or ideal end states. We are here to surface operational blueprints. How trust is built in practice and we have a

an amazing panel that will hopefully be able to really bring that to um to the discussions and how safety is governed under real constraints. how AI systems actually

reach the people states that the people and states often struggle to serve. The speakers you will hear from today are not theorizing from a distance. They are governing, financing, regulating and

deploying AI in the real world. From small island states to small large democracies, from welfare delivery to financial systems, from regional cooperation to enterprise risk

management. So one final framing point before we begin. The goal of today's dialogue is not to position the global south as a passive recipient of AI governance

norms. And we'll hear definitely from from um uh from Cambodia, from the Maldives and Indonesia and Brazil. It is to position the global south as a co-author of those norms contributing

models of governance that are population scale institution aware and grounded in lived social realities. That is the thor that is the through line of this session from why trusted AI matters to who it

must reach to how it is enabled, governed and ultimately operationalized. With that, I'm delighted to open this dialogue and we'll begin with opening remarks that set the stakes why trusted

AI is existential and not abstract and then we'll move through discussion. I realize that time is very short so I think one of the reasons Ed put me here is because I'm known to crack a whip a

bit. Um, so with all due respect, I know you're all very important people. Um, but I will let you know when the time is up. Um, so with that, I would like to invite

his excellency, Professor Muhammad Kinana, Minister of State for Homeland Security and Technology from the Malds. Uh your excellencies uh distinguished head heads of delegations, honorable

ministers, esteemed leaders, it is both a privilege and profound responsibilities to stand here before not merely a representative from Republic of Mis but a voice for many

SIDS small island development. states. I extend my warmest gratitude to the organiz organizations of this forum for creating a platform where the aspiration of nations

regardless of their geographical size can be heard alongside the strategies of those leading the frontier of innovation. Uh ladies and gentlemen, with the global

disclosure turns to AI, it is often centered on the ambition of large economies on a competing scale or on a trillion dollar

geopolitical competition. And while these dimensions significant, this represents only part of the narrative. For seeds like the Maldives, nations defined by geographical dispersion of

small islands, 1,200 islands, narrow economy base and acute exposure to climate change. AI is not a matter of competitive advantage alone. It is a matter of institutional resilience.

It is a matter of sovereign capacity and increasingly it's a matter of survival. The Maldives comprises nearly,200 remote islands which is spread across 850 kilome square kilometers. Our

economy has been ba mainly based on tourism. Our exposure to sea level rise remains among the highest of any nation on earth.

These realities do not diminish our ambitions and they demand we adopt technologies that that can deliver public services efficiency across vast distances

strengthening governance and diversify the economic foundation. The government of the modis under the leadership of our current president launched a digital transformation

agenda. A comprehensive national vision to transform the mold into a digital first nation within the coming 3 years. The technology vision is called moldives

2.0 is not a technology in initiative in isolation. It's a fundamental re-imagination of how these state serves its people and how the economy grows and how opportunity reaches every citizen of

the of the Moldives. We have already begun the implementation. Moldis uh Maldis have good technology infrastructure. If you

look at the region, we have the highest uh the we have one of the highest internet penetration rate in the region. We have the highest number of mobile subscribers in the region. Our

population is half a million. We have mobile subscribers 1 million. Uh 4G coverage is 100%. 5G is 80% one of the highest in the in the region. six subcables

and also fiber to each household is 100%. So maybe some of the European countries even have not even achieved these statistics.

So considering the delivery of uh the AI enable uh and also considering the uh the geography of the motives uh AI is very important for us when it comes to the health sector, education sector

since our our islands are very remote right. So AI intelligence also offers the mold is a pathway to economic diversification enabling us to develop a knowledge

economy to to cultivate local technology enterprises and to position our youth digitally. Uh the mold is not approaching AI without preparation. We are building

governance structures to ensure that this technology serves our people ethically. In July 2025, MADIS launched the A AI readiness assessment methodology report which was

developed with assistance from UNESCO and this landmark assessment the first of its kind in South Asia. So building on this assessment, the government is now advancing to develop a

national AI master plan for a for uh master plan and also an AI act which is also underway. So the the UNESCO readiness assessment has further recommended the

establishment of an independent AI governance body and multistakeholder advisory council. So these are some of the recommendations of of the report. So I uh as I told you Moldis is getting

ready for the AI and also since we have this uh Moldis 2.0 transformation vision we are working very hard in the next uh 3 years to get digitalization complete in the moldis. So excellencies, the mold

is may be small in land but we are vast in determination. We are a nation that has built its identity upon resilience, resilience against the tides that shape our shows.

So modis 2.0 I have said that the vision is our commitment to that future. AI deployed responsibilities governed ethically is central to this vision. We do not seek to replicate the digital

trajectories of large nation. We seek to achart that a course that is authentically ours on that reflect our values, address our vulnerabilities.

As the world convenes to deliberate on the governance of AI, let us build on AI future which is inclusive, intelligent, equitable and as human as the technology is

powerful. So thank you so much. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much your excellency uh Minister Kananat. Um I now like to invite um Deepali Khana uh as uh senior VP and head of Asia for the Rockefeller

Foundation &gt;&gt; for her remarks. &gt;&gt; Just before I start I mean we're talking about global north global south. What struck me in this panel is the women at

the periphery, right? So, anything and everything that we're going to do in this space, we'll have to get women back in the center. But I was also excited that, you know, we have strong women who

can manage these men. So, anyway, good afternoon ministers, excellencies, colleagues, and partners. Let me begin by thanking AI Safety Asia for convening this dialogue and JP Morgan Chase for

co-hosting. The fact that this conversation is happening here in this region with this leadership really matters. PM Modi in his keynote yesterday laid out the vision for Manav.

Building AI that is safe, ethical and centered on people, ensuring technology serves humanity responsibly and benefits everyone including women. Right? We've just heard powerful perspectives that

bring the point to life from the Maldives that AI is not abstract policy. It is a survival tool. uh I know our colleague from Togo couldn't join but I'm sure she would have mentioned that

trusted AI can make the invisible visible. So the question before us is not why AI matters or who should benefit. It is how we build it responsibly at scale and with

legitimacy. For over a hundred years, the Rockefeller Foundation has leveraged advanced technologies for betterment of society and we believe that there are learnings from that work also to apply

trusted AI partnership, patient capital and institutional strength. What distinguishes success stories like Togo's Novisy and India's Coven is not

just technological sophistication. It is alignment. Governments willing to move decisively. private sector actors willing to collaborate, technologists willing to

design for public systems and catalytic capital willing to absorb early risk. Novice reached nearly a million informal workers not in months just in days. Co delivered a population uh delivered at

population scale with transparency and interoperability built in. This was not mere luck. These were examples of ecosystems working together. That's partnership for adoption. Users must

trust both that AI will deliver the benefits without harm much like early vaccine development. We need to invest in both supporting users to adopt the technology as well as building robust

evidence and systems that ensure safety and scaling this trusted AI in the global south requires more than venture timelines. It requires risk tolerance. It requires capital that understands

that building sovereign AI capacity involves experimentation, regulatory iteration, and institutional learning. Philanthropy can truly play a cataclyic role here. Not by replacing markets, not

by dictating governance, but by derisking what some leaders have described as the smart adopter model. The smart adopter does not wait for perfect consensus. It adapts

responsibly. It pilots with guard rails. It builds local institutional muscle alongside technical capability. Catalytic capital can support regulatory sandboxes, independent safety

assessments, talent pipelines, and interoperable standards so that adoption is both fast, nimble, and trusted. That's the power of patient capital. And finally, institutional strength. Digital

public infrastructure has shown us something profound. Trust must be designed from day one, not retrofitted after deployment. Transparency, auditability, re gance redress, open

architecture are not compliance burdens. They're adoption accelerators. If our AI systems are to scale in health, climate resilience, food systems, and financial inclusion, they must be built on

institutional foundations that citizens recognize and most importantly trust. Businesses have a critical role here. Responsible innovation is not simply about internal governance frameworks. It

is about long-term partnership with governments and societies. It is about seeing trust as a strategic infrastructure not friction because trusted systems scale on uh untrusted

systems tall. The global south is demonstrating that it does not need to choose between speed and safety. It can design both. The opportunity now is to align partnerships and patient capital

behind that leadership. So that trusted AI at scale is not a slogan. It is operational. The Rockefeller Foundation stands ready to continue playing a catalytic role in

that journey because trusted AI is not simply a governance aspiration. It is a development imperative. Thank you so Thank you so much um to both um your excellency minister Kandanath and um

Diwali for the I thought again um it's a great way to start out start us off for the discussion today um you're welcome to stay on the on on u in front sitting in

front but uh we'll start the discussion um actually I think um it's it's it's set the tone for what we wanted we really want to um discuss today operationalizing trust

Um so everyone um that you see in front brings a very specific experience um skills and um and and coming from their coming either from private sector or their u or their government. So I would

love to in particular exactly as as as Deepi mentioned building trust starts from the first it's it starts from the beginning it's not an afterthought. So, um, I'd like to start with Under

Secretary of State, um, uh, Your Excellency, Sang. Um, I think there's a microphone right there. Um, I guess a question I'm going to have for everyone is what is the single biggest obstacle

to operationalizing trust in your context based on your experience? And what is it that this room that's filled with quite of people from different sectors, what could we do about it as

well? And what you've heard as well in in in these past couple of days as you've been here in the summit. First, thank you for for the very good set of tones of these discussions and

I'd like to thanks Asia um AI Safety Asia for having me on these panel discussions. Um from Cambodia perspective um I would say a short answer to that is uh how to get the

people familiar with that AI and that would start off with the people user the leader and the regulator and aside from that um I can talk a little bit about the Cambodia experience on that. Um

similar to what excellency minister from Adiv mentioned, Cambodia is be has began to back the journey of uh conducting the AI readiness assessment supported by UNISCO. We completed um last year in

July 2025. And from that perspective, we can rely on the recommendations and starting to think about what is the strategy for Cambodia to move forward in terms of AI uh AI adoption in Cambodia.

So based on the recommendation, the national AI strategy has been drafted and currently we are in the process of finalizing the national AI strategy. At the same time we are also drafting the

national uh AI governance framework keeping the the national strategy in mind and one of the key strategic priority that we have in the national strategy is people which is the first

priority of our national strategy ranking from the user like I mentioned earlier user the leader regulator and also uh government official. uh the second uh priorities

priority is the infrastructure and data. The third and the fourth one is uh AI adoption in government and the private sectors. The fifth strategic priority is the governance and the last one is

cooperations and the research. So based on this priority we can see that human is still the first and the key priority action for Cambodia. Building on that our draft uh AI governance framework

also very much human centric. So we um believe that the governance should be aligned with the risk of AI. So context of our governance framework would be based on the the risk

assessments and to understand uh the risk people have to know the impact of the AI. So government has very clear intention is that we need to educate people let people understand what is the

AI tool and the implication of that. So since 2024 government introduced we call Cambodia digital skill road map which we outline what is the plan for the next 10 year for Cambodia in terms of human

development and that our goal is that with the next 10 year we will have 100,000 talent who are AI ready and uh in addition to that we also uh introduce

various program to educate government official As of now we we have trained more than 10,000 of government official u basic digital skill and also part of it is the

AI um skill as well and so uh based on what we have right now if one thing that you ask me u what we can do in this room is that I would like to say is to increase the capacity of human to

understand uh the risk of AI. &gt;&gt; Okay. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. Um I have so many questions. Um but I'm going to hold them for now. Uh I'm going

to move to Ambassador Garcia um as a tech ambassador for Brazil. Um as a G20 country, a leading bricks and all of these um along with Indonesia as well for in G20 um you know as I mentioned

the global south must be architects and not observers and I believe Brazil is at the forefront of this. Um can you say a little bit more about that and what obstacles do you find?

Thank you so much for the invitation. Glad to be here. Yes, we as you know in Brazil we have the presidency of G20 back in 2024 and we include AI governance as one of

the priorities of the Brazilian presence within the G20 especially AI for development, AI for reducing inequalities because sometimes when we discuss these issues for example you

mentioned global north some we need to see the reality of countries in the global go south and their priorities, their concerns of the risk of lagging behind uh for lack of resources, the our

countries, developing countries, they are not lacking talents but the conditions to develop them and also uh benefit from the technological revolution. So this was uh successful.

It was discussed in the digital economy working group and we reached a consensus on this. Then next we have the presidency of the bricks in 2025 and uh and for the first time we had u

first we had a uh create an AI task force to negotiate a document that was later adopted during the Rio summit last year which is the leader statement on AI governance.

It was the first time that the bricks had a common vision on what to do in terms of AI governance globally. So this is something new that we contribute and negotiate with the other bricks members

and uh we highlight for example the centrality of United Nations because what we see today is a patchwork of initiatives. Sometimes they are disconnected from each other some some

overlapping as well but uh when we think of the global south we need to be represented otherwise it's going nowhere for us we need to be there be at the table so I think the UN can provide this

legitimate universal representative platform so this was stressed in the bricks uh declaration specifically and also digital sovereignty because we don't want our countries to

be forever dependent on on foreign structures and the foreign um capabilities to uh to harness the power of the technology. So somehow we need to enhance our own national capabilities

but in cooperation with other partners overseas. And finally we only have copy 30 &gt;&gt; as remember last November and we included digital technologies and

climate change &gt;&gt; as sustainability problem because now we have been discussed in terms of data data centers energy efficient and so sustainability is key um in in in a way

that we are always we are trying to send this message &gt;&gt; in terms of AI I as a development oriented strategy and I think for the global south it's important that we

engage in tech diplomacy. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Because this otherwise we will not get hurt uh heard and we need to speak up &gt;&gt; absolutely

&gt;&gt; with and our voice uh be heard where it matters. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. Um so moving from one great um nation in the south to another one. Um Ibu Aayou um Ibuayou is the

director of AI and emerging technology ecosystems um of the uh Ministry of Communications in Indonesia. Ibu I uh Ibuayou can you tell us a little bit more about Indonesia's national

strategies just basically where do you find the obstacles as well and um as Ambassador Garcia has mentioned in the ecosystem of of um of of bricks um where does Indonesia or where is ASEAN sitting

on this as well? &gt;&gt; Okay, thank you Ima. Uh it's honor for me to sit here uh from Ministry of Communication Digital Affair. Uh I cannot say it is a obstacle. Yeah. Uh I

say it's challenging uh ones. Yeah. You know uh uh mentioning about the challenging one. Indonesia has uh many uh things to be uh resolve. Yeah. Uh one is infrastructure because you know that

uh our uh penetration of broadband especially for mobile broadband even though it is uh above uh 90 95% but it is still uh based on 4G uh coverage. you know that uh AI uh we need uh more

coverage for 5G and then uh the penetration of uh fixed broadband and backbone is quite uh low because you know Indonesia has uh hundreds of district area and 10 thousands of uh

subs district area uh today uh the penetration still uh 70% uh 70% by subd district area that's why we need to push the penetration of uh the backbone. Regarding of the data

center uh today our providers of data center we have many data center but the uh the GPU at the GPU basis still uh limited. So uh I think uh we need uh they invest more uh regarding to the uh

uh processing for AI and then uh this is relating to the infrastructure and relating with this uh framework of regulate regulation. Uh right now Indonesia we had set up the root map of

uh AI national root map AI and also we uh uh preparing the guideline ethical of AI. Uh talking about the national AI root map, uh we uh sure that uh we need to uh have uh um strategics that uh real

that not just theoretically because you know uh uh when we execute our vision in national root uh we uh have uh four uh strategic direction. One is uh governance uh collaboration

collaborative and the second is uh encouraging uh innovation ecosystem and the third is to strengthen capabilities and capacities including infrastructure and the last is mitigating risk. You

know that uh this uh national road map is important for us because uh uh we need uh clarity for five five years ahead uh uh uh regarding to the uh issue that come from AI regarding to the uh

ethical AI guideline. uh we set up the uh uh the rule and clarity of uh responsibility of AI actors and also uh we preparing the instrument for monitoring and evaluation because you

know uh ethic not just ethic we have to uh monitor it one &gt;&gt; and the last is uh we have to put the safeguard for the people uh how they using and develop AI that's the main uh

thing that we uh uh preparing &gt;&gt; Thank you, BuayU. Um I think it's been mentioned already and I and I'm glad Ambassador Garcia mentioned it and of course in her in his address um uh

Minister Kanav mentioned and I'm going to uh turn to um Dr. Parakana. Um you did mention something about um in our in our sorry I'm going to bring the discussion that we had in the green

room. Um I'm calling it the green room. It's not green. um uh about how how you as a private company utilize um and and how that could be beneficial for climate resilience and and and development in in

in especially in in vulnerable um uh uh countries. Um so can you say a little bit about that? Um Dr. Parakana of course is the founder and CEO of Alpha Geo. Please

&gt;&gt; thank you. Thank you so much Ena. Thank you all for being here. Well AI as a as a concept evokes this notion of leaprogging. Do you remember when we used to use that term all the time?

Leaprogging and of course it applied very appropriately to mobile telefan to fintech to renewable energy solar panels. So you know faster better cheaper and inherent in that concept

which is very important now when we talk about AI is the notion of second mover advantage right that's what leaprogging was fundamentally about having second mover advantage. Now why that's relevant

right now is because of course uh developed countries in particular particularly the United States and others have in invested enormous amount amounts of capital in the capex

requirements of AI. You know some significant percentage of US GDP growth for example is attributable right now to that AI capex related um uh infrastructure investment. But that is

not something of course that nations of the global south so to speak developing countries can afford. And so the question becomes is there an advantage to late development when it comes to AI

that can save developing countries of the south a lot of money while still enjoying the fruits &gt;&gt; of that innovation. So it's important to not especially in the context where

you're making trade-offs between electricity, food, water, the basics for your population. While of course there's now this almost emotional and hype and pressure to invest you know to clear

land to build data centers to divert energy we have to ask ourselves is that the right way to allocate capital or should one be taking advantage of cloud computing edge computing sovereign cloud

solutions that can generate the same or better output bang for your buck with less capex expenditure. And that's the that's the the moment that we're at and it's important to remind that we're

having this conversation in India and one of the virtues of India hosting this event is precisely that uh India's rise as an AI superpower you know breaks the narrative out of this conventional

wisdom that it's a two-horse race between the US and China and that you're doomed in some way to choose between your data being you know uh hoovered up by one or the other player. Instead what

India is offering uh at least in more than in theory is uh rapid diffusion of the latest technologies right cloud-based models and solutions through the tools of digital public

infrastructure DPI which has been you know for one of the benefits of this event now over the course course of weeks that people have learned this allimportant acronym DPI which I I've

adhered to or believed in been supporter of for for quite some time because it does hold the promise for uh neutrality for a menu of options for being delivered in a way that protects

sovereignty of data but in a very affordable way and India has done it been a pioneer of it obviously domestically with ADAR and so forth and for those if it hasn't been uh disclosed

enough this week you know more than 50 countries are building payment systems and ident identity systems on that stack so that's a great example of DPI so think of AI high in that mold of second

mover advantage leaprogging following the mold of cloud-based um sort of solutions that can be low cost. Now let me just quickly talk about two areas where there are huge gaps in public

sector access to data or ownership of or or simply knowledge of solutions that AI and particularly the AI that we that the way in which we apply data science is to geospatial data. And these are also two

areas that are of critical fundamental if not existential importance to developing countries. One is sustainable urbanization and the second is climate adaptation. Anywhere you go in the

world, actually rich or poor countries, if you survey the average person on the street and ask them what is the biggest problem plaguing your society, nine out of 10 people that I speak to in

dozens of countries around the world is is affordable housing, right? Just sustain urbanization that is so organic, so rapid, so unplanned, accelerating around the world. And but now finally

governments have the tools g again geospatial tools mapping tools understanding which districts which settlements are expanding and why where are people coming from what kinds of

housing need and needs need to be built where right governments have always been fighting backwards or if if not given up quite frankly on grappling with these issues but now we have foresight AI

powered geospatial tools that can look decades ahead and say this has been your time series urban expansion this is how you map it out. This is um where you should be building what and

when. And so bringing together demographics, bringing together uh infrastructure, uh bringing together migration, fiscal spending and directed targeting in a way

that is a great use case for AI that almost the entire developing world could use and has barely begun to use and is very cost-effective. Right? So that's number one. The second equally, if not

more important, is climate adaptation. Climate risk is both acute and chronic. We're talking about monsoons, floods, uh fires that are becoming more frequent and devastating. And of course, complex

climate modeling is not the kind of thing that any individual country can or should finance. We have global climate models that are AI powered that are developed with the world's best

institutions that are publicly uh financed that are now available to be downscaled for your country and this is something that again in especially developing countries especially

countries of the south that are most affected by climate dislocation by climate risk can and should take advantage of but again to be clear they have barely begun to do so yet. So

targeting infrastructure investments, targeting your your infrastructure to adapt to climate risk. Where do you need to build seaw walls, flood barriers, flood control measures,

uh, uh, irrigation systems for drought, all of that. We again just like urbanization are years and years and years behind. And there's almost no country on this panel, almost no country

in the world, even wealthy countries that are ahead of the curve on this. The entire planet is behind as we know from COP summits. But it is countries of the south that are going to be the worst

affected on the fastest timeline if you're not using the tools that are available right now. AI powered climate modeling adaptation scoring in order to plan your national infrastructure and

then putting together the public private partnerships to get it done. &gt;&gt; You're behind. So this is about global public goods, right? affordable housing, you know, a manageable urbanization at a

global scale, climate adaptation for people everywhere, but it has to be delivered locally. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And that's why it's incumbent on each

nation represented here, each nation of the global south to really, you know, harness and take advantage of these of these tools. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much, Dr. Parag. Um, again,

lots of questions in my head. Um, Kip Wayne Scott, um, executive director of global AI policy from JP Morgan Chase. Um, one of our biggest supporters as well. Thank you so much for supporting

us for this uh for this event. Um you are not here just because of that. Um I can assure you um uh but I'd love to hear what you you know um what you have to say at in particular the question

that I uh that I brought forward earlier about the obstacles in particular in where you see it. Um but again financial services model risk management um and all of that uh in the safety uh

architecture of AI. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Go ahead. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Um a lot to unpack there. This is a great panel by the way. So

many esteemed panelists. Uh I really feel privileged to uh to share the microphone with all of you. Um you know it's it's interesting thinking about these things from the vantage of JP

Morgan Chase because we're really kind of interrogating the questions from sort of three different perspectives right one as one of the world's largest financial houses with that's deeply

invested in artificial intelligence. We have an acute interest in unlocking the value of this technology and seeing the growth uh potential of this technology. But there's a simple truth that we

recognize and that is that AI is only valuable if it is deployed and deployment depends on trust. And so really building out, you know, we we have an an interest in in this this sort

of multistakeholder dialogue about what that trust model that is going to unlock diffusion um not, you know, not just across enterprises um but in the public uh sphere across the global south um and

really putting this technology into organizations that are impacting people's real lives. The second perspective from which we're looking at all of this is as a deployer of the

technology ourselves. We are one of the world's largest deployers of AI. Um and you know what's interesting, we're we're also one of the most regulated industries in the financial sector. And

yet um financial services have been the earliest adopters of AI. We've been using artificial intelligence through this like sort of evolutionary um uh ramp uh of a you know really more than a

decade um to you know combat fraud uh to protect consumers um to create just more efficient you know personalization of financial services um and I think one reason why you see financial services

companies so ready and eager to adopt is because we have that existing trust architecture um you know trust isn't you know it's not just like a feature of financial

services it's the core business model and so you know we have um we have these uh you mentioned you know model risk management we have these these rigorous practices of evaluating models of

documenting governance and oversight of really ensuring that there's ongoing monitoring across all of our technology deployments in a way that just lends itself to a I would what I would call a

comfort um in sort of building the trust ecosystem um for responsible deployment. And then sort of the third prism that that we we look at this issue from is as a purchaser of these technologies and a

like kind of a almost a procurement lens here. We we spend $20 billion annually on our technology budget. That puts us in this really sizable position in the innovation ecosystem of you know

startups and scaleups that that they want to sell their products. They're building innovative new artificial intelligence applications um with the hope of selling it to JP Morgan Chase

and we see a real innovation inefficiency right now in the fact that there isn't a shared sort of set of expectations for trust um for you know what what these products should be

benchmarked against in order for us to to ingest them you know in a way that you know we have the confidence is going to serve our customers well is going to reflect reflect our, you know, our

responsibilities, our duty of care, um, as as a, you know, a regulated industry. And so, you know, it speaks to, I mean, I think one, um, the need to to bring, uh, these diverse perspectives to this

conversation around governance so that we can really kind of get past the the the sort of compartmentalization of like AI safety as as sort of a siloed conversation and accelerated AI adoption

as a different conversation. This is the same conversation. And you know what we really need to to I think the purpose of both of those conversations is to really align on this this trust model that is

going to ensure that that we can deploy these these technologies um you know in a very broad and impactful way across the economy. &gt;&gt; I'm going to put you on the spot while

you have your microphone. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; A little bit. um you've been here throughout the week and you've heard the panelists just now speak um from your

from what you've been hearing throughout the week where how optimistic are you in terms of you know I think um uh um uh his excellency so mentioned about collaboration how confident are you in

building these um collaborations to build um trust in AI um uh just from the conversations that you've had this week &gt;&gt; yeah I no I'm optimistic I think just the fact that we're here um in New Delhi

and having this summit in this environment. This is a much bigger summit. I think it's a more inclusive um cross-section of uh of voices. Um and and so I think that that that reflects

that this conversation is getting bigger. um that we've moved past um this this focus on technical capabilities which is kind of where we have been to now I I think

capability has really been you know almost commoditized and and legitimacy has not and we're in this this phase now where we really need to establish the legitimacy of these technologies and

they're that they are fit for purpose um that they can be trusted uh and deployed um you know across these these different societal sectors. And so I think that I am optimistic. Um it requires intention.

Um and you know I'm I'm seeing the intentionality I think around the curation of these conversations. I think there's a lot there's a lot to carry forward here. Um I I also some of you

may have seen you know we're we're very near the end of this summit and I think I before we were even halfway through excuse me I'm I'm getting ex you know it's I'm like running on fumes at this

point but we were more than halfway through uh the week and people were already writing up like the assessment of what you know what the themes were what the takeaways were and people were

saying you know oh this this summit is no longer about you know responsibility or safety or uh and I just I just uh that that isn't my perception of these conversations. It really is that you

know we're we're just talking about them in a different way. We're talking about them in how they are going to impact real lives, how we can take this technology into the economy in real

valuable ways. And in order to do that, we have to we have to include that sort of trust dimension. &gt;&gt; Okay. Thank you so much. We have eight minutes left and I've been told that we

have to finish on time, but I really want to get this question and hopefully be able to hear from uh from everyone. Um so Ambassador Garcia and um uh same uh Sang and Ibu Aayou um what are you

taking away? What are you taking home um uh from from this uh from this panel first of all? Um or from from the week that you've been here um reflecting on what um uh Kip just mentioned.

&gt;&gt; Yes. Uh thank you. First I think India was that successful bringing this summit to the global south for the very first time but this was the blet process that began in the UK 2023

have so Paris uh so this what we has been discussing here it's something that is more inclusive some new concerns were added to to the

agenda sustainability not that was not discussed before but with this perspective coming from the global south which is important. So I would conclude with uh three

recommendations because we need to be practical. We are thinking mostly we agree on high level principles in terms of AI governance but when we think of uh countries lacking

resources or having all the competing priorities uh uh to so they need to decide what to do and prioritize uh in many case. So I think they should start small and they have a a few small

scale quick impact projects so that they can build on proven success. &gt;&gt; So let's say focus on some let's say education, healthcare, agriculture, then focus on some specific projects and then

build on the to to reach the the next level. Second is that we need to seek u they need to seek international partners. Sometimes it's um it's useful and needed for to enhance national

capabilities. &gt;&gt; It's difficult for a single country alone to do uh this as investing infrastructure and do something that is expensive. So seek international

cooperation and third when I said I said it before engage in this discussions at the international level. &gt;&gt; Engage in tax diplomacy. Yes. And send more people to discuss where I think

it's important including the United Nations. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. Um Mr. Dang. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Thank you. Um having seeing the time in mind I'll just go very quickly

on the last sentence is that coming to this summit is I agree with our partners that it's very inclusive and we can see perspective from all the stakeholders from the government the industry

academia and even the startup. So learning from this I I have just one wish is that we have to be honest with each other. Yes. &gt;&gt; The industry, the government and

&gt;&gt; bear in mind that we are here to protect people for the people. So absolutely &gt;&gt; whatever we do we need to think about people first. With that um please consider that the when we think of a

governance frameworks the regulation of the law that the government might put should be the mechanism to promote the innovation. It's not an obstacle for the innovations. So for in order to do that

we need to build trust also and that's we need to be honest with each other. &gt;&gt; Thank you Ibu. Aayou quickly. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Actually uh I'm very impressed with the spirit of uh

prime minister uh Modi yesterday. I think every countries has the same spirit regarding to the AI. So what uh uh the the three points that I taking from this uh summit one is uh

collaboration indeed and then uh inclusive because uh if we consider about inclusive we need intention uh uh from government from industry from the people and then the last is uh

investment because uh investment you need uh you know that AI need uh more and more investment uh this is a collaboration come but the issue uh will come uh is

how we define the sovereign because uh sovereign is based on the needs of the countries how we define is it equal or not and still is it under question of me also

&gt;&gt; thank you so much about you um Dr. Prague, I'm going to have you bring it home in one minute. Um what you're what you're taking home in particular in your conversations with with some of the um

some of the different governments here. &gt;&gt; Well, the first thing is I actually want to echo Kip's point is that we're at an inflection point where we we can't we've been in phase one.

Let's say there was a lot of harping about trust. Can we trust? Can we not trust? But the and I think it's a good thing that that pressure was there. But now that that pressure to have

transparency in models has delivered to some degree and that it's been done in a way where public and private have not been on opposite sides of the discussion but have really partnered. So I think

we're really beyond that and now we can move from um you know models and theory into action and application and that's the part of the stack that we want to be on. The infrastructure buildout is

there. It's being provided. The apps are being developed. they're being deployed. So I would I have seen a little bit of but would want to see a lot more in few subsequent editions of this especially

as this uh summit you know migrates around the world now and and and remains perhaps in the hands of developing countries on the application side as much as possible and that we um think

not just about very specific verticals as we have been here and elsewhere sort of your healthcare education I've emphasized climate and others but probably something more societal and

around resilience you know resilience is a term that comes up a lot but doesn't really get quantified enough and if we can push for that that's going to help us to establish performance benchmarks

not just of models but in applications and that's really what I think everyone wants to see to make sure that AI doesn't become something of not just a financial bubble uh but something almost

of a a policy bubble as well &gt;&gt; thank you so much thank you so much Ibu Aayou Ambassador Garcia Mrs Kip um Minister Kenna um Dr. Parag and Depali for joining us um this afternoon. I'm so

sorry it was cut short. I have so many questions in my head. I'm just going to ask you personally later. Um thank you so much for joining us for this discussion. Um there's a time pressure

that is is making me sweat a little bit. Um but I know these conversations will continue. I think um the conversation uh the um what I hear what I'm hearing across the panel is that this is a first

step um of many steps that we have to do and that we've already uh and it's it's it has to move beyond that. It has to move beyond just the conversations that we're having here. How we follow up, how

we make it applicable, how we have conversations with um with other uh other governments, other private sector um stakeholders um for us to make um uh trusted AI at scale. um something that

we are um uh very confident with. Thank you so much um everyone. Uh a round of applause for the panelists. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you so much um to my team at AI Safety Asia

for putting together such a brilliant panel. Thank you. Oh, sorry. Um apparently now um there's uh for all of them. Okay. Um uh from the AI Impact Summit uh there's um some souvenirs for

all of the panelists. Ambassador Garcia, I'm sorry. There's um a little token of appreciation from from the AI impact summit. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Ambassador Garcia.

&gt;&gt; The session has ended. All the speakers are requested to exit the room.
