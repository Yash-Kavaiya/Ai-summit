## 📝 Transcript

risk is uh maybe underestimating the risk that is what I can say that can be addressed only through the governance uh particularly in the in the present uh

emergence of technologies &gt;&gt; actually I like what Sanjiv sir was telling us it's never going to be risk-f free but we'll have to move forward we'll have to figure it out and we'll

have to do it in a as much as possible compartmentalized manner so um any risk that we are overestimating Anybody from the panel who wants to talk about any risk that we are overestimating?

&gt;&gt; Let's give Vicram a chance. &gt;&gt; I mean I think the fundamental nature would be there is no zero risk is how do you equip yourself to handle risks because I think a point that Mr. Chri

Mr. Sel also made is as a regulator or a regulated environment. How do you create the tools to be nimble to adapt as the technology adapts? And I think that that is the important element. Right now the

tools are there. There is so much we can do that we're not maybe we're not doing as well. So maybe we can focus very well in the here and the now and equip ourselves to be nimble enough to deal

with anything that comes because anybody who's telling you what's coming with a certain amount of certainty I take that with a pinch of salt. I think that the future is a little unknowable at this

point of time but there are so much so much that is known and you know we should be able to tackle that right now. &gt;&gt; Thank you. I think that's great. Seal sir I'm going to again come to you. One

reform that India must prioritize. what is your view on &gt;&gt; that's a long uh issue um I have said this before uh and this will relate even here I do think we need to begin to

prioritize speeding up our judicial system because one of the things that's going to happen that as AI evolves it is going to throw up new kinds of problems that we haven't dealt with before Um

now there is no way xante we're going to work out what those problems are or what are the sensible solutions uh to them. Um if that is the case then I think the judiciary will be uh an important play

an important part because we are a common law country and when disputes of of of this new nature turn up uh then what is going to happen is that you will require for example uh let's say AI

gives you a particular kind of outcome somebody uses it to do something and it turns out to be a disaster who pays for the uh damages for Or for example uh in copyright law who

is the owner of a particular innovation at which point do you call it an innovation? Um and and is that innovation owned by the person who put the prompt in? Is it owned by the person

on whose data it got trained or it belongs to the algorithm that uh created that innovation? So all of these I would say that we need to begin to think of a judicial system that can deal with these

kinds of problems. We already have a clogged judicial system. But do remember that these uh very different kinds of uh and I would almost call them philosophical problems are going to turn

up at our doorstep very very quickly and we need to be thinking about them. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Um when UPI came in I think about a decade ago and we have the benefit of having the NPC chairman

himself being in the room. I think it was uh more than payments. It was trust in an invisible system. And today AI is becoming that invisible system that is sitting quietly in our credit

underwriting decisions, our onboarding flows, grievance redressal systems, even regulatory reporting. Uh and I think that's um it was a great discussion to talk about how do we embed trust in an

AI system that is fast evolving. Uh because at the end of the day we're thinking about the theme of the summit which is people, planet and progress all in the same breath. Uh people how do we

protect them from opaque systems or bias planet? How do we scale sustainably and responsibly and progress because it doesn't have to be only fast innovation. It has to be fair innovation. So I think

a lot of great thoughts today that came in uh in the panel discussion and I'm extremely grateful to everybody uh who made time to have this discussion. Uh Sanjep sa we could have some closing

thoughts from your side. &gt;&gt; Well you mentioned uh trust. Let me say that uh uh while it is uh fair to trust uh UPI uh but as I said it is relatively speaking not an emergent system

deliberately in fact uh you don't want the UPI to be innovating on the interface it can innovate at the back end however much you want but you don't want any surprises I send somebody 100

rupees and he gets 120 rupees or 80 rupees or on average you will get 100 rupees is that can't be the basis of a UPI. So in that sense the UPI based system is an backbone infrastructure. It

is not deliberately emergent. But AI systems are emergent. It can give you different answers at different points in time depending on what it's trained for, what is the

context, what is the things you have. And in fact that is the innovation. If you if you fix it in a box to start with, then you won't get the innovation. But on the other hand, if you give it

some open-ended thing, yes, I presumably it will improve, but sometimes it may deteriorate, sometimes it may lie to you. So in that context, what I'm trying to say is that in the case of

artificial intelligence, we should use it, but we should certainly should not trust it. uh in fact its future is based on a certain level of skepticism, healthy

skepticism that we must have about its capabilities. Um it will do amazing things but in my view we should be clear that it is probably much much better at solving

bounded problems. It can play chess for example very very well but I doubt it can plan your career. it's an unbounded problem. So in if that is how you think about uh AI then uh what you need to do

is to as I said begin to think this through uh in uh in in terms of how you apply it in particular boxes and uh and where it has a clear set of things that you're trying to do. So as I said

bounded problems and even there verify. &gt;&gt; Um with that we have audience questions. We have one question from Aditya the founder of first time. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Good evening. Uh that was an

incredible set of points that came up. actually made some really interesting notes about the capital markets equal in Sanjep that you drew. I thought that was a really interesting way of looking at

AI and we've been in so many summits. I think this is a very very interesting way that uh you've put it about risk and uh exante versus postante u I had one question for you and I had uh two

suggestions or requests for Pravin and Mr. Uh from a AI stack perspective, every uh every summit or every conversation across different countries is um looking

at all the different components of the stack and there are two things that kind of come up in most of these conversations which is around sovereign data asset and leverage that comes out

of it in terms of tools and models and so on. what where is India's perspective in all of this from a sovereign data asset utilization the model leverage and I think different countries are looking

at their stack as their stack and which they're going to give you access and so on and so forth so I think that is something that'll be great to get your perspective so obviously India with its

uh very large population has stacks of information on all kinds of things from health to consumer behavior etc. So in some ways this is a good place for uh huge amount of data for experimentation

on human behavior and so on. But of course um you know if data is the new oil then you we need to be clear that we own uh those rights if it's our data uh I mean I'm not even getting into the

privacy issue. I'm assuming here that it's all uh that has been taken care of. Uh so we are using anonymized data but even then we we should at least have the rights to that data and also to some

part of the processing of it. Um there's no point in u and uh saying that you know um that we have the data but we neither have the rights to it uh or and nor do we have the oil rigs to pump out

and pro and or the refineries to process the new oil. So this is the context in which you may have seen in the latest budget we announced uh almost quarter of a century uh sort of tax holiday for

putting up data centers in this country. Uh that's not a trivial thing to do. Why are we doing it? Uh well basically because as I said uh data centers are the oil rigs of this new kind of oil and

then of course we need new companies that will process this oil. Um those are the new I we have created one AI LLM but frankly everybody gets very excited about LLM. LLM is only a very limited in

my view not even the most interesting usage of artificial intelligence. It just happens to be that it is linguistically talented uh and consequently

you know we use it uh for that. But there are many many more interesting uses of AI. And as I keep coming back to you and stating that we need to create an ecosystem and that ecosystem

we all say oh you need to have you know half a trillion dollars of investment to create. Actually no much of where you will end up with this use or these refineries so to speak will be quite uh

bounded problems in in certain spaces. So there is more than enough space for uh startups with much more modest um budgets to do interesting things in AI. And I'm not just talking about people

building use cases on other people's. I'm saying literally bottomup uh uh uses of AI. So I think uh there's a lot to be done here. It's an open space. Um this is basically like

discovering the Americas. Um but uh you know yes Spain did have a initial uh sort of uh starting advantage but the great empire in the world was actually built

by Britain uh which was actually a late starter. So there are many many countries in the world who you do not think today to be a particular player in this game who will also turn up here and

one of them could do much much better than the the guys who you think are at the cutting edge today. So this is an emergent situation with all kinds of um what you say unintended consequences

uses positive and negative will happen out of all of this. I think the key here is to be nimble keep your eyes open including on the regulatory find and do not have set ideas where this whole

thing is headed because frankly we don't know. &gt;&gt; No thanks for that. Um you know we uh I'm the founder of first time which is a customer data platform. We work with a

large number of enterprises on data all consent and so we get a ringside view to the application of all of that that you're saying and this kind of leads me to the suggest

&gt;&gt; supplement we have AI course which is a uh which is a repository of data sets which is which is growing and then for the financial sector as well we are looking to uh say uh aggregate to start

with synthetic data and then maybe uh take up uh take collate data from the uh regulated entities. is with their concept. So that will come into use. &gt;&gt; Okay. Awesome. Actually that kind of

goes towards uh my suggestion bit for the two of you which is I think uh you know Raven when you spoke about the sandbox from an IFSCA perspective. I think the ability to extend that beyond

just IFSCA to you know also the other regulators in is is something I think will be very very interesting for uh at least folks like us because we work with a number of entities which are which cut

across different regulators and an associated point is uh you know today there are so many regulations that come in and I think there's a lot of there are two two opportunities that I see

exist one is there is different interpretation of the regul relations by different entities and second is as a large data processor not a data owner but a data processor I think there are

there is stakehold we are one of the stakeholders in that whole process and today we may not have the adequate access or a seat at the table from a uh regulatory interpretation standpoint and

there there is I think an opportunity for us to define something which is like you know what is a consentbacked API for data consumption for example and having a regulatory definition of that with

participation from a data processor like us and we'd love to kind of uh see if there are processes that allow somebody like us to engage with the regulators. &gt;&gt; Uh uh I we we are open to that idea but

but you have to remember one thing ISA is a jurisdiction you know it has its set of rules which are different from domestic India. Uh so there is a interoperable sandbox mechanism in place

between IFAC, RBI, SB and AI. So a a solution that spans across the four regulators can be tested within the sandbox. But the issue is not technological or or financial. It's

legal. Uh for example, in India, INR transactions are are the norm, right? In IFSC INR transactions are not permitted. You have 16 foreign currencies that are enabled and you have to do transactions

in those 16 currencies. So if you if your solution is not compatible across these these areas just to give an example then you know the sandbox experimentation will not go through. So

there are lot more nuances like this you know which uh which affect the rollout of pilots within the interoperable sandbox. So just to give an example &gt;&gt; yeah uh with respect to uh movement and

processing of data I'll not comment at the moment uh because there are certain things in works in IFSA. So I leave my RBI colleague for that. Yeah. Uh so just uh like uh my colleague said we already

have an interoperable sandbox across regulators uh and it is on tab. So so earlier it was uh it was uh team based but then now it's on tab any type of product can uh can be tested in the

sandbox. But just to clarify on the sandbox it is only when the regulated entity feels uh that the existing products or service is violating one of the regulation. So there are very few

number of entities which come to the sandbox because in general they are not required to be uh required to come to the sandbox. If if they if they feel if they are compliant to the regulations

there's no need to come to the sandbox but we but then we are also thinking of another sandbox where we also provide some uh more than in terms of monitoring the regulation we

can provide we can support the innovation in terms of say compute data or tools. So that is that's also in the thought process. &gt;&gt; Okay. you've been one of the

beneficiaries of the sandbox and the hackathon uh at five money and uh the process has been phenomenal the way the RBI fintech teams engaged maybe Adita I can share some uh notes with you offline

but I think thank you this has been a phenomenal panel and a great discussion on embedded governance when AI is making space in all things financial services how do we make space for governance in

AI that was the theme of the discussion and I'm very pleased to hear the views of this panel and I'm grateful for making time. Thank you everyone. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Uh I'm I'm actually not going

to say anything more apart from the fact that thank you and we will have a quick uh give off the momentos from India mission. So my criti my colleague Kiti will uh will do that. So starting with

Thank you. Can I insist all the panelists to stay back for another group picture? &gt;&gt; Maybe I love
