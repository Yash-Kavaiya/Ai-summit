<summary>📖 Full Description</summary>

AI workloads are driving explosive growth in data center power density—racks now routinely hit 100+ kW (vs. traditional 10–20 kW), with megawatt-scale clusters and facilities demanding hundreds of MW. Power demand from global data centers is projected to rise 50–165% by 2030, largely due to AI.

The AI era is forcing a fundamental redesign—native HVDC distribution + liquid cooling will make high-density, sustainable AI infrastructure possible at scale, dramatically cutting losses, material use, and operational costs compared to legacy designs. The transition is already underway among hyperscalers and will become standard within 3–5 years.

Velankani Group is a leader in making Indigenous AI Data Center Infrastructure which will cater the demand for the Future.
