## 📝 Transcript

to secure our citizens. I think that will be our focus and AI will be immensely used in that area and of course I mean we can talk about healthcare, education,

uh you know deep research, medical uh you know sciences. I think all those areas will flourish on the back of this. So from our company's standpoint AI is becoming a really integral part of how

we operate serve our customers, build our networks, manage our networks. I agree and maybe uh from my perspective just a couple of things. I am the lead director on Fizer and so to just think

about the opportunities for personalized medicine right now or the fact that every uh student in India can have access to any the world's information on their device. Uh how cool it is maybe

just a couple of two things for me in terms of the implications. uh the one is given the number of people who use AI in India will be greater than I think anywhere in the world over a few years.

I think the leadership that India can play uh not just in what these models mean, how do you think about data, how do you think about privacy and security and trust but one area we're

particularly passionate about Sunil is this area of content authenticity. we help produce the world's content and so I think if he can make sure that uh and the honorable prime minister talked

about that in fact in one of my meetings with him his eyes really lit up when he said I want every piece of information that's produced to have the provenence and the watermark so that people can

actually know what is real and what's uh fake but uh I I I just think it's just this incredible opportunity for India we're as a company incredibly honored to participate with

And I know I am really thrilled that you know the organizers uh allowed us this little opportunity to share how excited we are but I will let you uh have the last word.

&gt;&gt; No Shandu thank you very much. I just want to you know bring you in before we end today and for our an audience here. You know prime minister also spoke about uh making open uh standards keeping AI

open to the world for the benefit of democratizing and sense AI as opposed to caging it and having it in the hands of a few. Talk about it. A lot of you know people uh you know have views on this uh

from countries like India and many other all the you know European leaders who are assembled here today. There seems to be a very clear message engage with each other make open standards AI should be

available to all for the benefit of humanity. Is there any danger that some of the leading AI developers companies may keep it more controlled and uh we may have to fight that battle hard?

I I think you're going to have the inevitable challenge between commercial enterprises uh who want to keep information proprietary sunil and you know how they advance it uh with how do

you do good for humanity and so I I think he was absolutely correct in in reflecting that this is going to be an ongoing challenge uh you know I I can speak for Adobe I mean one of the things

we've always done is everything that we do is open standards I think the w reason why PDF has adopted uh itself so massively is because it was an open standard. But I think it'll

require companies and enterprises uh to behave differently and really recognize what is their sustainable advantage. And the sustainable advantage cannot I think over time be just the

model. It has to be the use cases of what people are doing with that model. And so I I think it'll require all of us uh also in companies to prevent again as he said from being disrupted. uh by not

just doing what we are doing but I'm I'm actually confident now uh I do think India is better positioned than most other countries the question is I mean you've again been a pioneer in bringing

your services and connectivity around the world I'm less confident about what will happen in those countries I'm a lot more confident about what will happen in India

&gt;&gt; so how can we showcase India's frugal uh uh power of innovation u look at the gaga the moon mission Yeah, &gt;&gt; India did it at $74 million. US did it at $92 billion and India had a

perfect landing on the moon on the difficult side of the moon. How can we persuade US companies, large conglomerates to use India not only for millions of uh you know people using

their products but how to learn from frugal innovation that we do have you know that's our secret source sunil I mean in many ways I see Raj and you know so many other good friends here from

India who've done well in the US I think it's because we use jugard and so you know I think to some degree you know that is the secret sauce that exists in India and uh you know that's how I think

we've all been able to, you know, uh, succeed on the global stage. But &gt;&gt; on that note, &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; thank you very much.

&gt;&gt; Thank you so much Mr. Sunil Mittal and Mr. Shantanu for that enriching conversation. Ladies and gentlemen, now it's my honor to introduce our keynote speaker, Mr. MKkesh Dhirubayani,

chairman and managing director of Reliance Industries, a global powerhouse shaping the future of business and innovation. Under his visionary leadership, Reliance has transformed

industries from energy and telecommunications to retail and digital services impacting millions of lives. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Mr. MKkesh Dhirubai Amani.

Distinguished guests, my fellow Indians, namaste. The global AI impact summit is a defining moment in India's tech history. A moment when India pledges to make AI

one of the driving forces to realize its dream of a Vix Bat. The dream of becoming a fully developed nation by 2047, the glorious centenary of our

independence. We are deeply honored that our most respected prime minister Shri Narendra Modi is the guide, philosopher and leader of this summit.

Honorable Minister Shriishna and his wonderful team deserve full praise for organizing this summit on a grand scale befitting India's ambition. Modi G's vision of AI powered Vix Bharat

is also a template for a Vix global south. If wisely used, I believe AI can usher in an era of super abundance. A world without poverty and a future of

prosperity for all the 8 billion people on our beautiful planet is now within sight within reach. Friends, artificial intelligence is not just another technology.

For the first time, humans are creating human-like systems that can learn, speak, analyze, move, and produce autonomously. AI is the mantra that powers every

yantra or every machine and system to work faster, better, and smarter. IC AI as a modernday akshaiatra the legendary vessel in Madharat that provided endless nourishment to all.

Likewise AI offers limitless augmentation in knowledge, efficiency and productivity. We are only at the dawn of this era. The best of AI is yet to come.

Distinguished participants in this summit today the world is defound is debating a profound question. Will AI concentrate power in the hands of a few or will it democratize

opportunity for all? Do we act as isolated nations or as a united global family? Our polarized world stands at a fork. One path has led to a situation where AI

is scarce and expensive, compute is concentrated, data is controlled and capability is locked behind barriers of capital and geography in the global north. In this dismal scenario,

inequality widens between nations within societies and across generations. But there is another path. A future where AI is available, affordable and beneficial to all. As our prime minister

said, India believes in this second future. Dear friends, from the podium of this summit today, I want to make a bold prediction. India will emerge as one of the greatest AI

powers in the world in the 21st century. My confidence is validated by an undeniable truth. In the coming decades, no country in the world can match India's strength in demography,

democracy, development, digital infrastructure, data generation, AI harvest. Let me begin as was said many times this morning. what India has achieved in the past 10 years. First,

India is the world's largest mobile data consumer. Nearly 1 billion internet users, data costs among the lowest globally. And in terms of quality, there is no difference between Delhi and the

remotest Indian village. Second, Aadhaar 1.4 billion digital IDs. Third, UPI processes over 12 billion transactions monthly. Fourth, India ranks among the top three startup ecosystems with

100,000 startups and 100 plus unicorns. Fifth, India's secure and inclusive digital public infrastructure stack is now being adopted by countries around the globe. Friends, in all humility, I

wish to state that Jio with over 500 million loyal subscribers was privileged to play a leading role in this transformation across broadband, 4G, 5G, and home connectivity.

With equal humility, I would like to announce that Jio will play an even bigger role in India's AI transformation. Today on behalf of the Reliance Group and Geo Intelligence I

want to make three announcements. Announcement one, Jio connected India to the internet era. Jio will now connect India to the intelligence era. We will deliver intelligence to every

citizen, every sector of the economy and every facet of social development and every service of government. Jio will do so with the same reliability, quality, scale and extreme affordability that

transformed connectivity. India cannot afford to rent intelligence. Therefore, we will reduce the cost of intelligence as dramatically as we did the cost of data.

Announcement two, JIO together with Reliance will invest 10 lakh crores over the next seven years starting this year. This is not speculative investment. It is not for chasing valuation.

This is patient, disciplined nation building capital designed to create durable economic value and strategic resilience for decades to come. Distinguished participants, the biggest

constraint in AI today is not talent or imagination. It is scarcity and high cost of compute. Therefore, here is my third announcement. Geo intelligence will build India's sovereign compute

infrastructure through three bold initiatives. One, gigawatt scale data centers. We already started construction on multi- gigawatt AI ready data centers at Jamnagar. Over 120 megawatts will

come online in the second half of 2026 this year and a clear path to gigawatt scale compute for training and large scale inference. Two,

our green energy advantage. We have an in-house energy advantage with up to 10 gawatt of ready green power surplus anchored by solar in both Kutch and Andhra Pradesh.

Three, a nationwide edge compute. An edge compute layer deeply integrated with Jio's network will make intelligence responsive, low latency and affordable close to where Indians live,

learn and work. From kirana stores to clinics, from classrooms to farms, intelligence will live at the edge. Our resolve is clear. Make intelligence as ubiquitous as connectivity. When compute

becomes infrastructure, innovation will become inevitable. Friends, geo intelligence is guided by five non-negotiable principles. First, AI for India's deep tech and advanced

manufacturing leadership reaching not just large enterprises but agriculture, small businesses and the informal sector. Geo intelligence will not simply be a search or an ask tool. It will

primarily be a resource for multiplying productivity and efficiency. Second, worldleading multilingual AI capability across all Indian languages. When farmers and artisians speak to AI

in their own words and student learn in their own mother tongue, this is not convenience. This is inclusion. Third, responsibility, security, data residency

and trust as GO's core guarantees not afterthought. Fourth, we will provide we will prove that AI does not take away jobs. Rather, it will create new highskll work opportunities.

And fifth, the AI story has shifted from who has the best model to who can build the strongest ecosystem for speed and scale of usage. Therefore, we will build deep partnership ecosystem with Indian

enterprises, startups, IIT, IISC and research institutions. We will work shoulderto-shoulder with India's leading industrial groups to embed AI across manufacturing, logistics, energy,

finance, retail, agriculture, and healthcare. We will empower startups with affordable compute and co-development platforms. We will aspire to produce global breakthroughs in

compute architecture, foundation models and energy efficiency designed in India, rooted in our values, powered by our talent and scaled for humanity. And we will partner with the very best tech

companies in the world, not as importers of intelligence, but as co-architects of a new AI century. Dear friends, I believe that social relevance, not momentary craze, should

drive AI growth in India. Jio has already started AI applications for the most pressing challenges in inclusive development. In education, we have Geio Shikshak, an adaptive AI teaching

assistant in 22 languages. When 250 million school children and 50 million students in higher education are empowered by AI teachers, no power on earth can match India's talent wealth.

In healthcare, Gio arrogia AI delivering first medical guidance in under five minutes in local languages on any phone. in agriculture, geoci converting satellite imagery and precision weather

into simple voice first advice to 140 million farmers to help improve their income in everyday life. Gio Bharat IQ a voice first AI companion helping Indians learn earn and access government

services at bhat scale from variables to fully connected homes geo frames an AI glass device and next generation AI devices will make intelligence truly

ambient as effortless and as natural as human convers izations. Through geo hot star AI will multiply Indian creativity with multilingual storytelling. We will popularize India's rich cultural

heritage with futuristic technology enhancing India's soft power globally. Friends, this inaugural global AI impact summit in India has received a massive response. What does that show? It shows

that AI is now becoming a people's movement worldwide. The success of this movement hinges critically on global cooperation and not polarization. Be it chips or rare earths, AI works its

magic through sharing not holding through collaborations not conflicts. The unique strength of India is that India serves as the vital bridge connecting the global south and the

global north. After all, south or north, east or west, all of us have only one earth, one family, and one future. Today at this summit, let us all pledge to transform this noble aspiration into

reality using the most powerful gift of the human mind, AI. Let us combine intelligence with empathy and let us build a better future for all. Thank you, Jin.

&gt;&gt; Thank you so much Mr. MKkesh Dhiruayani for your strong belief in India's capabilities and also for being uh at the forefront of India's AI revolution. Ladies and gentlemen, let's have a big

round of applause for Mr. Amani. And now I would like to invite Sir Damis Hazabis. He's the founder and CEO of Google Deep Mind. the co-founder of Google Deep Mind

and well he is also the Nobel laureate a chess prodigy neuroscientist and game designer before he became one of the world's leading artificial intelligence researchers Sir Dennis Hazabus brings an

almost uniquely cross-disciplinary mind to the challenge of building artificial general intelligence deep minds alpha fold solved a 50-year-old problem in biology and He's well just getting

started. Please welcome the co-founder and CEO of Google Deep Mind, Sir Habibus. &gt;&gt; Thank you. It's a huge honor to be here today um with so many of my esteemed

colleagues from industry, academia, and government. and congratulations to Prime Minister Modi and the Indian government on convening such an impressive summit uh at this very pivotal moment for AI.

It's fantastic to see how the summit has evolved over the years uh with the first meeting convened by Prime Minister Sunnak at BHley Park in the UK. It's become an incredibly important uh

convening point for international dialogue and hopefully cooperation in the future over the future of AI. When we started DeepMind in 2010, almost nobody was working on AI in industry. It

was just a dream. And it's been incredible to see how in the last 15 years where we've come from the beginnings, those humble beginnings to now where we are today where the whole

world is talking about AI. The reason we spent I've spent my whole career working on AI is I always believed it would be one of the most important and beneficial technologies

ever invented. And for me, my passion is to advance scientific discovery. And I always felt that AI would be the ultimate tool for um accelerating scientific discovery and

being a force multiplier for human ingenuity. From a very young age, I've been obsessed with the Greek questions of um of science, the nature of reality, the

nature of consciousness, these deep mysteries that are in the universe. And I think uh AI can help us find answers to these questions that we've pondered over for thousands of years.

We're already starting to see the beginnings of this uh with uh systems like AlphaFold that we built to solve the 50-year grand challenge of protein folding.

And we hope that this will just be the first example of amazing advances in science and medicine that have been enabled by AI. And we and others are working on many other branches of

science now to bring uh AI tools to help advance material science, fusion, physics, and mathematics. In fact, almost every branch of science and medicine can be impacted by AI.

And now in 2026, we're another threshold moment where AGI, artificial general intelligence, is on the horizon, maybe within the next 5 years. And we're seeing these general purpose systems,

foundational model systems becoming increasingly capable almost week by week. So this is obviously an amazing opportunity that we should all grasp economic um and productivity as well as

in the sciences. Um but it's also something that we have to approach with humility and understanding that we don't have all the answers yet as to how this technology is going to develop and be

deployed into the world. I've been really impressed uh with what I've seen in India. Uh I spent some time prior to the summit in Bangalore. Uh we have a really big office there, Google

and Deep Mind, a great research office where we do some really critical uh research um that we then bring to the our products and our technologies around the world in areas like efficient

models, continual learning and multilingual capabilities. I also had time to give a talk at uh the in Indian institute of science at Bangalore and I was incredibly impressed

by the students and the faculty there. Their enthusiasm and their energy for AI and um their ideas for how to use AI to um to improve India as standing in the world and to also seize all the new

economic opportunities and scientific opportunities that AI opens up. It's incredibly impressive to see the energy around the country and I think AI that India will indeed be a powerhouse for AI

um in the and across the globe. We have many partnerships. Sundar you heard Sundar announce many Google partnerships that we have with India. I'm especially proud of our deep

partnership with Mr. Amani and the Reliance Geo group to bring intelligence to everyone in India with our Gemini foundation models in partnership with Reliance. So we hope to build on that in

the next few years. So if I was to try and quantify what's coming down the line with the advent of AGI, I think it's going to be um the most moment one of the most momentous uh

uh periods in human history. probably something more like the advent of fire or electricity. One way maybe we can quantify that is it's I think it's going to be something like 10 times uh the

impact of the industrial revolution but happening at 10 times the speed probably unfolding in a matter of a decade rather than a century. So really there's an enormous amount of uh change is going to

come and uh and it's it's still to be written how we can make that beneficial for the whole world and I think the main way we should try to do this is by taking a scientific

approach using the scientific method uh to understand what the capabilities of these systems are to build good guard rails and monitoring systems to understand more deeply what these

systems are capable of and how we can make sure that they serve the purposes that we And then of course simultaneously we also have to be bold to grasp these new

opportunities to advance science and medicine and to improve human health and the human condition um that society and the globe badly needs. So I think we've got to try and navigate this uh moment

very carefully, very thoughtfully. And if we do so, I'm very optimistic that uh we'll usher in a a great new era. And but of course this can't just be left to technologists. And that's why

summits like this are really important to bring together all parts of society. The technologists that are building it, the scientists that are building it, um uh governments and how to how to deploy

it for the best use of of their citizens. Um but also artists, social scientists and philosophers. We need to bring uh uh all of these debates into the tent to understand how we should

navigate this next period in human history. And I think summits like this, international summits like this are critical to encourage this kind of international dialogue and cooperation.

And if we get this right, these next steps right, I think we can usher in a new golden era of scientific discovery and improve the lives and health of everyone in the world. Thank you.

Thank you so much sir Habus for your uh very profound and illuminating address. We really thank you. Sincere gratitude to your address ladies and gentlemen. And now I would like to invite Mr.

Vishal Sikka. He's the founder and CEO of VNI. As CEO of Infosys, Bishal Sikka led one of the most ambitious transformations in Indian IT history before leaving to build VNI a company

focused on human centered artificial intelligence. A com he is well a computer scientist by training, a philosopher by temperament. He is one of the most original thinkers of the

intersection of AI and enterprise. Please welcome the founder and CEO of VNI, Mr. Vishal Sika. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. Thank you so much for that. Wow. Wonderful introduction and

what an amazing event. Um I want to share three points from a long time that I have spent uh in AI. My first point is that what we see today in the world of AI, people who know what

they are doing with AI are astonishingly effective with AI. Recently a friend of mine um he and I were students together at Stanford. Uh he has a large uh service that he runs,

open public service. That service was built by 15 people, very world-class engineers over 9 months. Recently, he rebuilt that service entirely by himself in 14 days using one

of the generative AI coding tools. So, if you are counting that is about a more than 250 times improvement in productivity. uh now he's a genius and not everyone

gets a 250 times productivity gain but you will see that people who understand how to use AI are astonishingly uh effective with it and I had a similar experience recently with a customer of

mine who is a distributor of home goods and one of their main suppliers shut down their factories in one of their countries and

they did analysis using our product all kinds of simulation scenarios and over a few days they reached the decision that they need to exit that country entirely. I asked him you know such a monumental

decision to get out of an entire country how long would that have taken you before and he said easily it would have taken a year and it would have involved heavy duty consultants and things like

that. So we now have instant access to knowledge in any language. Uh a condensation of things that we can present in any way. Uh it is an

incredible power and yes it is deeply disruptive to the ways that we have worked before the way that we have done things in the past. But at the same time and even more importantly we can do

unprecedented things with this things that we could never do before. So this astonishing effectiveness and Yeshua referred to this as a jagged frontier. Uh it is not uniform. Uh not

everyone sees this. Um so that's my second point. Being effective with AI requires not only a knowledge of AI itself but understanding its limitations and how to overcome those limitations.

There is a huge gap between LLMs and the business users inside enterprises especially and how to bring value to those users and overcoming that gap is where a lot of value creating

opportunity is that bridging that gap requires delivering correct systems trusted verifiable reliable systems that deliver value to people. My own company works in

this area. A layer that sits above the language models and delivers value uh to business users while ensuring correctness uh and things like that. When we overcome that gap, we can

deliver massive value. Mesh talked about it just now. We can transform every existing system. Legacy systems, enormous complexities inside enterprises can be removed. industries can be

transformed. We can give end users wings. We can amplify them to deliver things that were not possible to do before that or in the best case it required professionals to do this.

Doing that also requires not just overcoming the limitations of AI but also imagination to see what is not there to see what is possible. India has all of this in great

abundance. The honorable prime minister has called for a billion entrepreneurs, people who can overcome these and deliver value using AI. And I think this is exactly what the world needs and what

India has the potential for. My third point is that we not only have to master today's AI but we have to leapfrog it. AI today has enormous limitations.

I have worked in AI for the last 38 years. You know one of our scriptures uh is goindam. It was written by the shankarachara and it has a beautiful

line. What it means is that when you are faced with a life or death situation, the knowledge of a book does not help you.

Knowledge without wisdom does not save us. That wisdom comes from living, from from doing, from being in the world. AI today has plenty of limitations. Yeshua mentioned hallucinations. That's

one of the main issues blocking the use of AI in enterprises. But beyond hallucinations, understanding the world, understanding physical activities,

um the physical movement, this is one of the next frontiers. Safety, safety of AI, and the honorable prime minister talked about this today, is an

existential issue. swarms of agents can be made to do completely reckless things and we don't yet have ways to understand or deal with this and Yeshua Demis also talked about

this. We have to solve this issue. We have to deliver AI that is safe. We have done this with nuclear power for the last 80 plus years. Uh we can and we must do this with AI.

Energy is another one of these issues. where I live in California on Highway 101 just north of Santomas. I drive by there every time I go to see my dad. There is a massive data center that is

coming up. It's 720 megawatt. And this idea that I write a prompt and these gazillion GPUs blast into existence to produce a response and then I make a tiny change

to that prompt and then I do that again. It just seems like a completely absurd idea. Uh especially to someone who has been around AI for such a long time. Um I have u thanks to the ministers

ministry of IT uh honorable Ashwini Vashnavj I have a colleague who has been accompanying me throughout this conference and he told me that yesterday he walked 32,000 steps and I asked him

what did you eat and he said I ate two burgers. Sham here. Two burgers. You know, we normally eat 2,000 calories in a day. That's about a 100 watt light bulb, like less than one

of these light bulbs. And out of that, our brain, our nervous system is maybe 15 20 watts. That's like when your laptop is in sleep mode, it takes more power than that. So there are many zeros

still to be removed from these models and the models themselves have to be removed. So I think that there is a um a tremendous opportunity

here. India is a country of the human potential. Um we have plenty of times before delivered the ability uh to you know

billion plus Indians. Meshw talked about uh Jio and um Sunil talked about Airel and how now we have billion plus Indians who have data and connectivity and um when I was young

one of my earliest childhood memories uh is of worry in my parents' faces around food. They used to tell stories of how there was a shortage of food and then the

green revolution happened and India is now one of the largest exporters of food in one generation. when you look at the time of intelligence,

it is not only an opportunity to learn about this technology, uh to learn to master this technology, to understand its limitations, but to leapfrog that and to build the

next generation of it. And as this um summit so vividly demonstrates, we can be on our way to a human revolution powered by AI, by good AI, by purposeful AI where every one of us a

billion entrepreneurs is not just making a living but is making a life not some artificial life or some artificial general life but our own life and the life of others. And that would be so

much fun to do. Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much Mr. Sika for your profound and very interesting remarks and of course your work at VNI also exemplifies the transformative potential

of artificial intelligence. And with this movement on the stage, you can make out that now we are heading into a fireside conversation. And well, this would be a remarkable

conversation we're going to have with Mr. Nandan Nilakani, co-founder and chairman Infosys and Dario Amote, founder of Enthropic. And before I invite our guests on the stage, let me

say a few words about Mr. And nilakani who is the architect of Aadhaar the world's largest biometric identity system and the intellectual godfather of India's digital public infrastructure

movement. Nandan nilakani has spent decades proving that technology built in the public interest can transform entire societies and Aadhaar is a big example before the world. His thinking on

artificial intelligence and open digital ecosystems is essential reading for anyone serious about this field. So ladies and gentlemen, I would now invite Mr. Nandan Nilakani and Mr. Dario Amoe

for this conversation which is being moderated by Mr. Rahul Matan partner triillegal. I invite all our three guests on the stage. Please welcome our guests on the stage.

Thank you. Dario, welcome Dario. Great speech in in the morning. Um you mentioned the that we are in the end of the or towards the end

of the exponential. This is something that you spoke about in machines of loving grace that we would have a country of geniuses in a data center. And um the models over the last I guess

uh two months have been sort of giving us a sense that we're getting there. But in your podcast with Darkh, you sort of walked that back a bit by saying uh you know we may reach a country of geniuses

in a data center but the impact on society will take a long time. Can you explain what that means because we thought we'd do Asia here and we we'd be finished and done with it.

&gt;&gt; Yeah, thank you. Thank you for having us Raul. um uh you know I I I would say there is this duality between the fundamental capabilities of the technology and the time that it takes

for those capabilities to you know to diffuse into the world right we're getting models that are very good at software engineering that are increasingly good at you know biomed

innovation we're not there yet but we're on this very fast exponential but when I look across the world and and you know I look across the enterprises of the world we have many enterprises as customers,

even if we freezed in place what the technology was capable of today, I I I think the economic impact could be much greater than it is because, you know, it just takes time. there are just

frictions to adopt things through through through through through through enterprises and you know I think I think I think I think even more so in in in the developing world and you know when I

when I um you know visited visited Infosys one of the things I talked about with with with Nandan was you know that the the we're both obviously very interested in you know making sure that

this technology gets to everyone and Nandon has has you know has devoted a big part of his life to to you know many things um you know many things in that direction and has you know built out

built out India's digital public infrastructure and so you know I I I think this question of diffusion is very tied to the question of how do we make sure that everyone benefits

&gt;&gt; so when the foundation models came nan you said that we should do use cases and it sounds like Tario is saying the same thing that even if we do the foundational model we will still need to

do use cases &gt;&gt; no I think it's great uh what the foundations models are doing and the speed of evolution but what we have learned is that diffusion of technology

is is a different ballgame and uh how do you get technology to a billion people and I think India we have a little bit of experience with that 1.4 4 billion people on Aadhaar, 500 billion people on

UPI, 20 billion transactions a month, the world's largest cash transfer system, the largest financial inclusion system, you name it, all that stuff. And we learned that diffusion is a

technique. It's both an art and a science. It involves institutions, it involves uh policym, negotiations, dealing with incumbents, dealing with newcomers, strategies for execution. So

the whole you know trust building. It's a whole host of thing and I think if all the investments in AI are going to deliver the value to society not to just to individuals we'll have to look at

diffusion pathways to take this to everyone and I think India will lead on that that's why I've always been saying that India should focus on becoming the use case capital of the world

you had a more recent essay which you call the adolescence of technology um which is a little more somber uh spoke a little bit about sort of dimming the enthusiasm of the first

essay. Um and I want you to perhaps unpack that a little bit. Um you know we we all have spoken about the risks of the technology but particularly in the global south where we think that AI is

um going to be hugely beneficial for us. We perhaps will have a different calculus on the riskreward ratio. What do you think about that and and how would your essay address that? I you

know I think that's that I think that's an insightful comment which is that you know I you know I think I think in the global south there's an opportunity for AI to accelerate catch-up growth to

solve a bunch of problems that are that are in the way of catch-up growth and so you know the the I you know I think AI is a technology that has you know big risks and big benefits but but in in the

global south the benefits may be even bigger than than they are than they are anywhere else but at the same time that doesn't mean of course that the risks aren't real um you know we we you know

we kind of India is the world's largest democracy you know we need to think about how democracies handle AI and you know how how how we you know how we can how we confront other other countries

that are that are authoritarian um you know that's one of the risks I talk about another risks I talk about is making sure that AI systems are uh safe and predictable and you know

autonomously behave in a way that's under our control and you know everyone in the world has to worry about that that affects everyone in the world um And then you know I think of particular

relevance to to to India is you know the concerns I raised around economic displacement right where you know the the I think the signature of this technology is going to be that it it

greatly grows the economic pie for the whole world and again you know huge upside because the opportunity for catch-up growth like you know growth can be can be very very fast um but uh you

know there's there things are going to change and there's some potential for disruption and you know I think what I've thinking about as I visited India these last few days and the last time I

visited is you know how can we work together with the companies in in in India to kind of drive this growth for everyone to make sure that the existing companies large and small continue to

prosper along with us and the other makers of of of of AI and and you know also on a philanthropic basis how we how we make sure that the benefits reach everyone both in an economic sense in a

health sense in kind of other senses. So you know I think I think I think India is you know it kind of offers a particularly keen distillation of of you know especially the benefits but but

also the risks. &gt;&gt; Now then you've had experience with an adolescent technology uh with you with the whole DPI. Uh in the early days of DPI it was challenging there were uh

challenges with getting you know the big vision which of course now we're looking at and in hindsight it looks like it was easy but the early days was difficult. So as the father of a of a mature uh

technology would you want to give the father of a an adolescent some advice? I know that makes me a grandfather. So so I think uh it diffus when I when you talk about diffusion and you know

you have to think of AI everybody agrees is like a general purpose technology like people give the simile to fire or electricity or whatever. It's about starting from the user and how can we

improve their lives? How can we take a billion people and help them to learn better? How can we take a billion people and give them better healthcare? How can we take a half a billion farmers and

improve their earnings? You have to start from there and then figure out how to make it happen. And it's not just technology. Technology is just one piece of the puzzle. It's about institutions.

It's about trust building. It's about negotiations. It's about guardrails which you know Dario mentioned. It's about working with different stakeholders and making them go towards

a common vision. So the it's it's diffusion is difficult. It's not not a simple task. So I think I feel that India will demonstrate this because we have the experience of diffusion at

population scale in all the various areas and obviously diffusion of AI there are some differences that we need to think about data you know guard rails and so on but I think we can build a

pathway or multiple pathways to that goal and that will show the world because I believe right now in AI There's a race to the top and a race to the bottom.

And the race to the bottom is faster than the race to the top. So I think all of us who have a stake in AI being useful to humanity have to accelerate and redouble our efforts to make the

diffusion happen. Otherwise the consequences are going to be very very difficult because there's going to be a backlash. If the only thing that AI does is uh you know create deep fakes or

raise the price of your power bill or you know all all the other things that are happening people are going to respond. I mean the the resentment resentment of the blue collar worker led

to the train wreck of globalization. The resentment of the white collar worker is going to lead to the train wreck of AI. So I think we really have to work very hard to show profound useful cases of

AI. &gt;&gt; Tia, you uh were in India in October and you're back again now. Uh you spend a lot of time actually with the developer community. Um uh you clearly uh were

impressed because you've come back so quickly. Could you tell us a little bit about you know what your experience is uh with how India is building and using AI perhaps just go through the stack I

mean enterprise um small business you startups then developers what's what's different about the way India does it &gt;&gt; yeah so so I would say there's there's

just there's just an excitement here and a technical acumen and we can even see it in the statistics of usage of quad you know use of claude for technical kind of programming and software

engineering mathematical tasks the fraction is substantially higher here in India than it is in most other places in the world um and you know every time we every time I I I go to speak at one of

these you know kind of you know we'll host these builder or developer events in in India just there's there's a lot of excitement you know I can feel the brimming excitement of like you know

what is something that we can build in in just the last four months you know the the use of cloud and quad code has has doubled um uh has doubled in India and you know I'm I'm I'm you know I'm

sure it's the same for the other de I don't say that to promote claude and claude code like it's more a statement about the kind of excitement excitement in India on on the enterprise level I

mean you know the the two of us just just announced a partnership just yesterday so you know we're we're really excited to work with all the you know all the large enterprises in India they

know much more about the Indian market they know much more about you know distribution they know how to serve serve enterprises within within India and you know they're much better at that

than we are and and you know can we plug our technology in into what they do and and you know create something that kind of you know that kind of wins for both sides right we would we would like to be

able to you know jointly win with the with the companies in India and then and then finally I think there's another element that's that's almost unique which is that there's an excitement to

build but there's an excitement to build for public good and for philanthropic benefits so you know Nandan uh uh uh kindly introduced me to the Xstat Foundation of course builds digital

digital um digital digital infrastructure and we've already started to work on a number of a number of projects really to reach people in rural areas. Um we're trying to combine quad

with something called open agrronet which you know helps um helps um farmers in rural rural regions to kind of find better information and and and you know better better advice to be more more

effective and and efficient and we're looking to expand that that that a great deal. So I think that's something you know that's something totally totally unique to to to to to to

India and that you know through folks in the private sector we would get we would get connected to these efforts and you know there would be mutual enthusiasm to promote these efforts

&gt;&gt; and you of course have an office you've uh declared a managing director but actually more importantly u set 4.6 six which dropped yesterday very inconveniently so I couldn't try it

apparently is doing very well on 10 indic languages so there seems to be a bit of a focus uh in your development as well um uh on on India can you tell me why that's important why language

cultural context is is important and what you know India can uh can play what role can play in that &gt;&gt; yeah so you know you know language models have always been multilingual but

of course they're better at languages than they're that you know that they've been they've been trained more on um uh and you know of course you know as as I learned when I first came here India has

uh you know a very long tale of of of of regional languages and you know we see this as something related to access something related to making we we provide we provide benefits for everyone

right if it can only speak the most common languages then there's a long tale we're not reaching right the farmers that we mentioned you know many of them speak speak one of the less

common regional languages and So we we've put in place we put in place a push you know collaborating with folks in in India to acquire more more more um more data for uh for this long tale of

Indic languages and Sonnet 4.6 represents an improvement. We're you know we're not all the way there yet. We want these models to you know to be you know to to be you know as good even even

far out in the long tale of these languages as as they are at you know speaking English. Um uh and we're making progress towards that. We're not there yet, but we want to keep going.

&gt;&gt; Now then, uh, after you built DPI, I mean, I say after like as if you stopped, you still continue to do it, but after you did the bulk of the work, you spent some time and effort actually

taking it out, um, to other countries. And I was wondering whether you've thought about that u for AI and um you know as we we you know it's been mentioned so many times today that this

is the first uh AI summit in the global south and so I think perhaps countries of the global south if there's a model as it were for doing this would benefit uh from those ideas. Um so as you think

about it is it is it costs is it skill is it data um infrastructure what is it that uh you know countries need to think about for this? &gt;&gt; Oh sure no you know finally it's about a

lived experience if you have done it you can do it better next time. So what we did in the DPI part the digital public infrastructure is that after uh several years of that experience we worked with

global philanthropists set up something called core develop and said let's take DPI global and today we have some version of DPI running in about 40 countries around the world. We recently

had a summit in uh Cape Town where we had 1200 delegates from 109 countries. So you know it's become a global moment and we feel that AI has to be if AI has to really be impactful we need something

similar. So we yesterday we just launched something called 100 diffusion pathways by 2030. We like to have targets. So &gt;&gt; can you explain that?

&gt;&gt; Yeah. So the idea is that a diffusion pathway is basically a way to reach a particular goal which which you got from learning from from doing things and then packaging it and it's not just technical

packaging. It's about guard rails. It's about how do you get institutions on board? How do you make you know how do you make data available? There's a whole host of things. But think of it as a as

a toolbox or a playbook for doing things and then this is a global initiative. So we're going to work around the world and create multiple diffusion pathways and then share them with each other so that

we can accelerate this thing and you know anthropic is part of that. We have Google as part of that. Gates foundation is there. UNDP is there. The Kenyans are it's a global global coalition because

what we learned from the agriculture experience you know we implemented uh we worked with Maharashtra on their agri stack which is uh called Mahavistar and that took us 9 months to figure out how

to make it work safely at scale. We this using the same learning we it was done in Ethopia which took three months because we had the learning of Maharashtra and then using the same

learning at the you know the PM was very keen to see it in animal husbandry. So we worked with Amul and we did that in 3 weeks. So you can see the trajectory of time right from 9 months to 3 months to

3 weeks. So what that shows is that if we can do this lived experience and keep improving and package that and take it to the world, we'll move the implementation of AI to the real world

and that I think is strategically important for the world of AI. &gt;&gt; So uh 100 by 30 is the new &gt;&gt; yeah 100 100 uh diffusion pathways by 2030

&gt;&gt; and we welcome everyone to join this moment. You have many such catchphrases but the one that really stood out to me at some time ago was um India needs AI and AI needs India. We've spoken a bit

about the India needs AI but why does AI need India because that's this is where we're going to show it working you know I mean I think because of the history of India's digital journey and thanks to

the leadership of Prime Minister Modi who is the biggest champion of all the work that that's going on. We have a political leadership that's committed. We have technologists. We have enough

people with the right uh value system to make this happen. And we have done this before and therefore India will be where you'll see most of the deployment of AI in a tangible way where farmers able to

make more money where children learn better where healthcare is better where you know people talk in their own language. So you have universal access. So this is where you're going to show

this and we the world needs this to be shown and the AI companies need need this to be shown because they have to show real stuff where this is working at scale for people. So I think yeah it's

very important. &gt;&gt; Tario uh if uh I can ask you if you were to rewrite machines of loving grace which is a beautiful 20,000word or something essay uh for India um if you

were if you were to think about you know what is that utopic vision of what AI could be for India what would it be? I I mean obviously not 20,000 words but you know whatever few ideas you could have

now. Yeah, I mean you know you know I think I think a lot of what was there was was universal but there there you know there are some things that I would accentuate that are possible when you

have such a large population for running you know running running this kind of large possibility possibility of experiments right you have you have here a very a very large population for kind

of studying and improving human health um you know there's there's uh you know worldclass medical research so I think I would double down especially on some some of the sections about you know

accelerating the cures for diseases. You know we just had Demisabis who you know has has you know basically solved the the protein folding problem with AI and kind of shown us all the way. Um uh and

and you know what we need are like you know 50 50 improvements like that. Um uh and you know you know the the hope is you know working together between the between the AI developers and you know

the folks who diffuse diffuse AI and do the actual medical research you know can can can all of us you know working together between the AI companies and and folks in India really really

accelerate progress. Um you know I I would I would also say accelerating the rate of of of of economic development. Um you know there is so much technical potential and technical adeptness in in

in in India. Um uh and it it actually almost seems like a a perfect case study for the idea that AI could really accelerate economic growth because it seems like the the the base ingredients

are are kind of all there and AI could help to tie them together. So you know in the developed world I've wondered you know well could AI lead us to you know 10 10% growth rates which sounds absurd

but you know that the thing I imagined in the positive scenario of machines of loving grace but I think here in India there's a lot of catch-up growth to be done there's an enormous amount of

technical potential and ability and you know the you know as I'm seeing there's this eagerness adopt to adopt AI so India is one of the few places in the world where I wonder you know could

there be 20 or 25% growth which is you know sounds absurd is is unknown anywhere in the world but but as I think about this it kind of stacks all the factors for for a very bullish um very

bullish picture of how that growth could happen. So you know I you know I think I think I could I could imagine being in India being one of the one of the you know countries countries in the world

that most embodies this certainly the big the large country that that most embodies this &gt;&gt; and Nandan um with all of these things there needs to be some unlock so if you

were to advise governments of the world governments of India governments of the global south what should they do to unlock this um 20 25% growth that Dario dreams of

&gt;&gt; I don't know about 25 and all that if I get 10 I'll be happy. uh but but I think uh a number of things obviously I think people before have talked about the need to create uh massive compute we

need to bring in the models we need I think the focus has to be on inclusion uh I think this AI has to carry everybody everybody must feel it everybody must benefit from

it and that's why I think the language is very important we want people to be able to speak to the computer in their language in their dialect mixing English Hindi Tamil whatever they should that

needs to be done. I think that's a big thing. And then I think making agents work for people. I think if we can make agents work for people then it means more inclusion because they can get

complex things done because you're hiding all the sophistication behind the agent. So I think there are a lot of things we can do which will which we'll you'll see now in the coming years. We

already have three or four examples in agriculture, in healthcare, in language, in uh uh you know education, in electricity. we have a very good example of P2P trading. So I think all these are

examples of how AI will actually benefit people and then it'll I think as to Dario's point India is a country which is very positive about technology in general and AI in particular and we need

to take advantage of that and not let them down by giving them truly transformative applications using AI which you will see in the next two to three years.

&gt;&gt; Nan Dario, thank you so much. What a lovely conversation. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you. Subscribe. &gt;&gt; There's no audio.

&gt;&gt; Thank you so much Mr. Nandanda Nilleani and Mr. Dario Amote and thank you Rahul Matan for moderating it. Well, it was quite an engaging conversation I must say and they are the pioneers and the

thought leaders of artificial intelligence and they shared their profound perspectives. I thank our panelists ladies and gentlemen. Our next speaker is Mr. Rishad Prem GI. He is the

executive chairman of Vipro. The son of one of India's most beloved business leaders. Rishad Prem gi has carved out his own identity as a thoughtful steward of Vipro's transformation into an

artificial intelligence native technology services company. He's also an unusually candid voice on the responsibilities that business leaders carry in times of technological

disruption. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the executive chairman of Vipro, Mr. Rishad Prem gi a warm welcome once again that's Mr. Rishad Prem gi

&gt;&gt; you know thank you for those of you who are here for being here um once in a generation a technology emerges that doesn't just change what we can do it truly changes what we must do

AI for me is certainly that technology and how we as a country how India responds in the next few years will shape not just our own economic trajectory, but our ability to solve

problems that matter to over a billion people. For the past several years, the conversation around AI has focused just not on the possibility.

What can it do? How powerful could it become? How quickly could it evolve? But we are now at an inflection point. The conversation has fundamentally shifted from possibility to practicality,

from experimentation to adopt adoption and from pilots to scaled impact. This shift matters and it matters tremendously because technology creates value only when it is applied to solve

real world problems responsibly and at scale. So what does this moment mean for India? It means India has the opportunity to become one of the world's most consequential environments for the

application of AI. Not just as a builder of the technology but as a place where AI is tested against real world complexity and made to work at scale. Our context as a country is demanding

systems here must work across multiple languages, across urban and rural settings and across populations with very different levels of access, need, data quality and infrastructure.

That raises the bar, but it also makes success meaningful. We already see what this looks like in practice. In education, AI can support learning outcomes in local languages and

help address teachers shortages across skill and skill mismatches. In healthcare, it can enable earlier disease screening and strengthen rural care, especially where access is

limited. And in public services, it can help build smarter, safer infrastructure and reduce leakages in welfare delivery. Which brings me to India's strengths and why I believe India is well placed today

to take advantage of all of this. Let me just highlight a few that have that that matter most and have been highlighted by many. One of the most significant is our experience with DPI. UPI today processes

over 20 billion transactions every month and has transformed how individuals and businesses participate in the digital economy. It has demonstrated that technology can scale rapidly when it is

accessible, reliable and most importantly inclusive. India also has one of the largest and fastest growing pools of AI talent in the world. We are truly the AI and

talent destination of the world. Approximately 650,000 professionals in India work in AI related roles today and this number will double by 2027. This talent brings not only technical

capability but importantly practical experience in applying technology in complex real world environments. Equally importantly many of the foundations to build out this talent are

already in place. Government initiatives to train 10 million young people in AI along with industry partnerships with universities are expanding access to practical job ready training. Curricular

is evolving and people are giving opportunities as apprenticeships to get exposure to real world applications. This capability is reinforced by a vibrant innovation ecosystem.

India is home, as many of us know, to the world's third largest technology startup base, including more than 4,000 startups in the deep tech and AI space. Together, these companies are helping

translate technological capability into practical real world applications. We are already seeing what this looks like on the ground. In agriculture for example, farmers across Karnataka,

Maharashtra, Telenhana, AP and Punjab are using AI systems trained on satellite imagery and local crop data. These systems provide early pest alerts and in some regions have reduced crop

losses by nearly 25%. In small commerce, artisans in Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and UP are using AI related platforms connected to open networks. Products are automatically cataloged,

descriptions translated across languages, prices optimized, and logistics coordinated, allowing small sellers to reach markets that were once out of reach. And we are also seeing

deliberate investments in the future. National initiatives are expanding access to compute infrastructure and building capacity across the AI stack in our country.

At the same time and equally importantly, we as a country are taking a very pragmatic approach to governance, putting early guardrails in place, but balancing accountability with innovation

so AI can scale safely and with confidence. All of this lays a strong foundation for India to lead in the EI AI era. But there is one more factor that I believe

positions us as a country uniquely. Our long engagement with global enterprises. Today the constraint as many have said is not access to technology. The real world begins when AI is introduced into

large real world organizations. In those environments, technology has evolved over many years. Application landscapes are complex. Data is fragmented. Workflows are siloed.

Processes vary across geography, business units, and regul regulatory regimes. Decision making is rarely uniform. Making AI work in this environment means

modernizing legacy architectures. It means curating and labeling data to create highly specialized contextaware models. It means orchestrating across agents it in ways that are reliable and

secure. And it means earning confidence of security teams, risk leaders, regulators, and critically the people who are expected to use these systems every day. This is where a more

practical pattern has emerged in enterprises. Models designed for specific processes or decisions tend to deliver the most reliable results. When AI is closely uh

aligned to a defined workflow, it becomes more predictable, easier to govern, and more effective over time. What enterprises need today is not a model that does everything, but models

that do the right thing consistently inside how work actually happens. But technology alignment alone is not enough for these systems to deliver value in organizations. Organizations themselves

will have to invest in change, taking people truly along, helping them adapt to new ways of working, redesigning roles and decision- making, and building confidence in how AI is used. That

includes reskilling people, reskilling teams to work effectively with AI tools so that so that they understand the outputs and exercise judgment where it matters most.

When models are well aligned to workflows and people are supported through the transition, AI becomes just not deployable but it becomes sustainable at scale and that plays

directly to India's strengths. We have decades of experience working inside complex enterprises helping them modernize systems, manage risk and take people along through this change. And

that works in environments like these is not just deployable, it is resilient, responsible and truly scalable. The same dynamics that determine success inside organizations will also shape how

countries navigate this moment. As we look ahead, India's advantage in AI will not be defined only by the size of our models or the scale of our infrastructure. It'll be defined by the

choices we make about where we apply AI, how we diffuse it, how responsibly is it deployed, and whether we can translate capability into real impact for governments, citizens and enterprises.

India's advantage will come from developing talent at scale. Not just people trained on AI, but people who can apply it with context, judgment, and an ability to adapt to change. That is why

AI fluency must extend beyond engineers to teachers to nurses to administrators to supervisors to small business owners among everyone else. The dividing line will not be human versus machine. It

will truly be between those who adapt and those who hesitate to adapt. Technology shifts inevitably create uncertainty. But for countries that act decisively, they also create

opportunity. India has embraced such ships in the past and I believe we are really well positioned to do so again. I want to close by sharing a personal

story from the work of the Azim Premi Foundation which is also the majority shareholder of our company Vipro. You know India sees 2.7 million tuberculosis cases every year making it

one of the country's most serious public health challenges. Every early detection is essential but confirming TB often requires patients to travel to distant public hospitals for

sputum molecular tests. For many the real barrier is not medical capability but it is access. To address this our foundation is running a pilot in a rural community in Tamil Nadu. Community

health workers carry portable X-ray devices directly to people's homes. AI analyzes the X-rays instantly and identifies signs consistent with TB, enabling that early screening and faster

referral without requiring patients to travel. If successful, this approach can help detect TB earlier and extend the reach of health care into communities that need it most. With a national

doctor to population ratio of roughly 1 is to 800 and even deeper shortages in rural India. AI does not replace care. It multiplies scarce expertise infinitely.

The same last mile challenges exist across other countries in in continents of Asia, Africa and Latin America. Home to more than four billion people. Solutions that work here in India at

scale, lowcost, multilingual and resilient can travel far beyond our own borders. If we can do that, India's contribution can be vast. Not just in building AI but

in applying it to solve problems for enterprises, for our own country and for the world at large thoughtfully, inclusively and with impact at scale. Thank you for listening to me.

&gt;&gt; Thank you so much Mr. Prem G for your visionary insights which I'm sure will undoubtedly guide the path forward. And we also thank Mr. PremG for highlighting how uh AI is being used by VIPRO for

human centric projects and for the welfare that is what India is aiming at to have an impact at ground level to change the lives of human beings. Ladies and gentlemen, few individuals have done

more to bring artificial general intelligence from the realm of science fiction into boardrooms, into parliaments and living rooms than our next speaker

Altman, CEO Open AI. Under his leadership, OpenAI launched Chad GPT and forced the world to reevaluate his relationship with artificial intelligence. So ladies and gentlemen,

please welcome CEO of Open AI, Mr. Sam Alman. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. It's really a treat to be here in India and it's incredible to see the country's leadership in

advanced AI. I was last here a little over a year ago and it's striking how much progress has happened since then. We've gone from AI systems that struggled with high school

level math to systems that can do research level mathematics now and derive novel results in theoretical physics. It's also striking how much progress

India has made in its mission to put AI to work for more people in more parts of the country. And India's leadership in sovereign AI building on infrastructure SLMs and much more has been great to

watch. More than a 100 million people use India in India use chatbt every week. More than a third of them are students. India is also the fastest growing market now

for codecs, our coding agent that works to help people develop software faster and better. India, the world's largest democracy, is well positioned to lead in AI, not just

to build it, but to shape it uh and decide what our future's going to look like. It's important to move quickly. On our current trajectory, we believe we may be only a couple of years away from

early versions of true super intelligence. If we are right, by the end of 2028, more of the world's intellectual capacity could reside inside of data

centers than outside of them. This is an extraordinary statement to make, and of course, we could be wrong, but I think it really bears serious consideration.

A super intelligence at some point on its development curve would be capable of doing a better job being the CEO of a major company than any executive certainly me or doing better research

than our best scientists. As we prepare for this possibility, we are guided by three core beliefs. Number one, we believe that democratization of AI is the only fair

and safe path forward. Democratization of AI is the best way to ensure that humanity flourishes. On the other hand, centralization of this technology in one company or

country could lead to ruin. The desirable future a couple of decades from now has got to look like a world of liberty, democracy, widespread flourishing, and an increase in human

agency. Some people want effective totalitarianism in exchange for a cure for cancer. I don't think we should accept that trade-off, nor do I think we

need to. AI should extend individual human will. We'll probably need super intelligence to help us figure out the new governance mechanisms to ensure that this happens fairly at scale and to

avoid problems like extremely unbalanced compute access or something else. Second, we believe that AI resilience is a core safety strategy. We don't mean that this is the only

safety strategy. We will continue to need to build safe systems and solve difficult technical alignment challenges. But increasingly, we need to start broadening how we think about

safety to include societal resilience. No AI lab, no AI system can deliver a good future on their own. For an obvious example, there'll be extremely capable biom models available open source that

could help people create new pathogens. We need a societywide approach about how we're going to defend against this. And third, this future of AI is not going to unfold exactly like anyone

predicts. And we believe that many people need to have a stake in shaping the outcome. The development of AI has already held many surprises and I assume there are

bigger ones to come. We understand that with technology this powerful, people want answers. But it's important to be humble about what we don't know and always remember that

sometimes our best guesses are wrong. Most of the important discoveries happen when technology and society meet, sometimes have some friction and co-evolve.

For example, we don't yet know how to think about some super intelligence being aligned with dictators and totalitarian countries. We don't know how to think about countries using AI to

fight new kinds of war with each other. We don't know how to think about when and whether countries are going to have to think about new forms of social contracts.

But we think it's important to have more understanding in societywide debate before we're all surprised. Of special note and related to all three points, we continue to believe that

iterative deployment is a key strategic insight and that society needs to contend with and use each successive new level of AI capability, have time to integrate it, understand it, and decide

how to move forward. This has been working surprisingly well so far. If we are right and systems continue to improve at this pace, it's going to change the economics of a lot of things.

A really great thing about AI progress is that it looks like many things are going to get much cheaper and have much faster economic growth. We're already seeing what AI is doing for access to

highquality healthare, education, and more. In the coming years, we expect to see robots make many products and phys physical goods cheaper as supply chains get automated.

The limit to how far this cost reduction can go may only be government policy. But the other side of this coin is that current jobs are going to get disrupted. As AI can do more and more of the things

that drive our economy today, it'll be very hard to outwork a GPU in many ways. It'll be easy in some other ways. For example, we really seem hardwired to care about other people

much more than we care about machines. We're somewhat less concerned about the long-term future. Technology always disrupts jobs. We always find new and better things to do. The people of 500

years ago would have thought that our current jobs often look silly, like ways to entertain ourselves, create stress. And the people 500 years from now hopefully will look at us, hopefully

look to us like impossibly rich people playing games, trying to find ways to pass their times. But we should all hope they feel much more fulfilled than we do today.

I'm confident we will keep being driven to be useful to each other, to express our creativity, to gain status, to compete, and much more. But the specifics of what we do day-to-day will

probably look very different. Each generation has built on the work of the generations before, and with new tools, the scaffolding gets a little taller.

This collective external lattice, the set of tools that we have built up around ourselves is remarkable. and we are capable of doing things that our great great grandparents couldn't have

dreamed possible. It is a moral imperative to make sure that our great great grandchildren can stay the same. And technology and especially AI is how we're going to get

there. For a democratic AI future, it is not enough to just give people tools and wealth. We also need to give them agency and power.

The vision that AI companies lay out fundamentally reduced to either unilateral control or decentralized power. Sharing control means accepting that

some things are going to go wrong in exchange for not having one thing go mega wrong. Cemented totalitarian control. This is a fundamental trade-off of

democracy and it is one that we believe in very strongly as the way to give everyone collective agency over the future. Of course, this is not to suggest that

we won't need any regulation or safeguards. We obviously do urgently like we have for other powerful technologies. In particular, we expect the world may need something like the

IAEA for international coordination of AI and especially for it to have the ability to rapidly respond to changing circumstances. The next few years will test global

society as this technology continues to improve at a rapid pace. We can choose to either empower people or concentrate power. Thank you very much. Thank you Mr. Sam Osman for your very

interesting and compelling remarks. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to now welcome Mr. Bradsmith, vice chair and president Microsoft. Mr. Bradsmith has been Microsoft's consience and its

chief diplomat through some of the most consequential debates in technology policy from privacy and cyber security to AI regulation. His book, Tools and Weapons, remains one of the most lucid

accounts of the responsibilities tech companies carry in the modern world. So, please welcome the vice chair and president of Microsoft, Mr. Brad Smith. Good afternoon.

It's always an important day when the world comes together under one roof as we have today. It gives us an opportunity together to ask important questions, even hard questions, and

think about how we want to answer them. As we think about this summit, the first AI summit in the global south, it's only right that we start, I believe, by focusing on AI and what it means for the

global south. In some ways, I think the best way to start thinking about AI is to look more broadly and think about the state of the world in which we live. We live in a tumultuous time and in a

fragmented world. But I think in so many ways, the deepest and most enduring divide has been the economic divide between the global north and south. And what I believe we need to recognize is

that this economic divide is a result more than anything else of a technology divide. The technology divide created by unequal access to electricity.

Electricity became one of humanity's most important generalpurpose technologies. Meaning it spread across economies. It was applied in every industry. It boosted productivity. Where

electricity went, economic development and prosperity followed. But as we all know, electricity did not spread everywhere at the same pace. It was literally 144 years ago that the

first electrical power plant started operating in lower Manhattan. And yet we come together today and we still live in a world where 700 million people lack access to electricity.

Now comes AI. AI perhaps more than any other technology this century will play a bigger role either in closing this economic divide or in exacerbating it

and making it even wider. That is perhaps the single most important question for us I would suggest today as we think about the role of AI in the global south. How can we do

better? Because we need to do better. What will it take? I think it's going to take a few things that will require that we all come together and work together. First, the obvious. We need to bring

infrastructure to the global south. That means data centers and commute compute. It also means more connectivity. It me it means more electricity. That is going to take not only the

world's best technology, it's going to require an enormous amount of investment. That's why we at Microsoft announced yesterday morning that we're on pace to

spend $50 billion by the end of this decade to bring AI to the global south. And of all the countries in which we are investing, India, not surprisingly, is one of the largest.

But we'll need to harness private capital, investments from tech companies, other sources of private capital, government funding. We'll need governments and others to generate

demand for the use of AI in the global south because that is the only way to get the wheels of the market spinning and to do what we need to do together. That's the first thing we need to do

together. There's a second thing we need to do. We've talked about it here already today and it is so clear when you study the history of technology. Infrastructure is

not only hardware. It's not only wires and grids. It's skilling for people. Because the key to enabling a country and a population to use a general purpose

technology at scale is to give people across the country access to the skills they need to put it to work. And that's why it's such good news that we seem so many governments supported by the United

Nations and supported by private companies investing in more skilling. It's actually something that should speak to all of us. Certainly, as a tech company, we're committed. We've launched

through Microsoft Elevate new initiatives, including one we're announcing this week, Microsoft Elevate for Educators to equip teachers with access to help their students learn how

to use AI. But the truth, it doesn't matter where you work, you have a role to play. Because the lesson of digital technology, I was an example of this was that it took employers to open their

doors to computing. It takes employers today to open their doors to new AI tools. It will take employers to invest in the skilling of their employees. It's not just for the next generation.

It's for every generation that this fully matters. Then there's a third challenge for the global south. We need to make AI work effectively for the global south and

that requires some special initiatives at least two. First, we need to make AI as effective in every language as it is in English. And today it is not. Performance tests show that's the case.

That's why one of the good things to come out of this week is new announcements to invest upstream in better data in other languages to provide better tools and measurement

systems for AI that is built in other languages to build out data providence with a view to linguistic diversity. Diversity that we need to advance around the world. And we need to use AI in the

global south to solve the problems that matter to the global south. Oftentimes, as we're doing here in India, that's about improvements in agriculture or as a number of partners including Microsoft

are doing this week, launching a new initiative to address food security across Africa. These are just two of the myriad of opportunities we have to put AI to work in ways that will bring

faster benefits to countries in most of the world. If we do those three things well, build infrastructure, invest in skilling, address real world problems, then I think it may create the

foundation to think more and do more about the question. I am willing to bet will be a bigger part of the conversation in the next few AI summits. What will AI mean

for the future of work and jobs? Within these walls, I think we're mostly enthusiastic about the future of AI. But outside these walls, I think we need to recognize that increasingly around the

world and especially in some countries, many parents are asking a common question. What will AI mean for my kids? What will AI mean for my family? What will AI mean for our future? I get it

that some people are excited and they'll do well, but what about us? Us meaning most of the people who live on this planet. I think we have something to prove. I think we have something to

prove not only to communities and countries and our customers, but to ourselves that we can not only embrace but pursue a brighter future for people. It's great to come to conferences like

this and hear people talk about all of the advances in technology, but let's remember one other thing as well. Human capability is neither fixed nor finite. It's great to think about what it would

mean to have computers in a data center that would be like an country of geniuses. But let's also recognize this. Compared to the people who lived in the bronze age, all of you, all of us are

already geniuses. Whenever technology advances, it creates a new platform, a new foundation that enables people to stand taller and reach higher if and only if we're committed to

using that technology well. As AI makes it possible to cure more diseases, then it is right that we expect that it will improve human health. As we use AI already every day

to find faster answers, it gives us the opportunity to ask more questions. The fundamental fuel of human capability has always been the same, curiosity.

We need to look at AI as the next great generator for human curiosity and we need to take some inspiration because we all know the world could use a little more inspiration.

I often think about the following. Before the invention of the washing machine, it took someone almost always a woman between six and eight hours to wash a load of laundry. But as the

washing machine improved, that was compressed to 30 minutes. But do you know what happened? One thing happened more than anything else. Everyone wanted to wear cleaner clothes.

Everyone expected to wear cleaner clothes. People did their laundry a lot more often. They had better clothes and they had more time and they put that time to work to do more with their

lives. Ultimately that is the question for us and this too is not just a question for companies. This is about what tech will do to people is people will use

technology to do for people. And it's not people who create products. It's every government. It's every company. It's every nonprofit. It's every employer

because we all have the opportunity to work with our people to manage through the change that is coming to show people how with the right AI skills, they can create jobs and careers

that will be brighter for their future. That will not be easy. But if that's not our goal, then we're missing the big picture. As we come away from this AI summit, it

reflects so much progress. But I would say one thing as well. Each of these AI summits is a proud moment for a great nation. But we have an opportunity rather than

have summits that are islands that are disconnected from the summits before or that follow. We need to build bridges. We need to be build bridges between these summits. We need to define clear

goals. We need to have common measurement systems. And every year we need to ask the same question. Did we make 12 months of progress in the year that just preceded our meeting? So, how

can we build on that progress to do more and move faster in the year ahead? For those of us who come to these meetings in different countries every year, I hope we will take that away.

Let's aim higher, not just for technology, but for what technology can do for people. Let's be clear in defining what we want to accomplish. Let's put in place the ability for us to

measure our progress and all hold ourselves accountable as a global community. If we can do these things, then we can use these summits and we can use this next generation of technology

to build a better world. I know that's what we within these walls want us ourselves to do. But even more than that, I know that the people outside these walls are hoping and expecting us

to do just that. Thank you very much. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much, Mr. Brad Smith, for that very energizing address. Ladies and gentlemen, I think he really deserves an energetic applause from you all. His

address has actually given a very constructive direction to the discourse on artificial intelligence. And well, now we are moving to the next conversation for which our guest is the

person who's often called the godfather of deep learning. Our guest is Mr. The Yan Lakun, executive chairman, Advanced Machine Intelligence Labs and his foundational work on convolutional

neural networks underpins virtually every image recognition system in use today. Now at the frontier of next generation AI architectures, he's one of the field's most provocative and

independent voices. Please welcome our next speaker, Mr. Yan Lakun. And this conversation will be moderated by Miss Maria Shaquille, managing editor India Today. Please welcome our guest and our

moderator Mr. Yan Lakun. Welcome. Good afternoon everyone. So let's begin with the big idea here, Professor Lakun.

Are we on a path to creating the smartest mind that humanity has ever known? And will that happen in our lifetime? &gt;&gt; Maybe in the lifetime of some people

here. Uh possibly not in mine. We'll see. It will take a while. uh but I think the more interesting thing that we're going to build is uh an amplifier for human intelligence. So maybe not an

entity that uh surpasses human intelligence in in all domain although that will happen at some point uh but at least something that will amplify human intelligence in

ways that will accelerate progress. &gt;&gt; So then will we end up defining and redefining genius? What will a genius be? &gt;&gt; Well, you know, I think uh several

thousand years ago or even a few centuries ago, what people identified as genius is very different from what we currently identified as genius. And uh I think there will be more evolution of

that that concept of of genius. Um you know in the past perhaps you know genius was you know some act of uh of creation or invention but maybe not at the theoretical level like we we tend to

think of it today. Uh it was you know more practical certainly in the very ancient past people who figured out how to cultivate crops or domesticate animals probably were seen as genius.

So you know we have often seen and this is a thought that you have all you know pretty openly shared that AI is powerful but not intelligent. When we make that distinction and there

are conversations around LLM where do you see intelligence and AIdriven power? Yeah, I think there's a lot of confusion really um because we tend to anthropomorphize

systems that can reproduce certain human functions. So what's I mean LLMs are incredibly useful. There's no question about that. Um and they they do amplify human intelligence like computer

technology going back to the the 1940s. Um but LLMs to some extent except for a few domains are mostly information retrieval systems. They they can compress a lot of factual knowledge that

has been previously produced by humans and can give easy access to it. In a way it's kind of a natural evolution of you know the printing press, the libraries, the internet and search engines, right?

It's just a more efficient way to access information. uh and there are a few domains where the intelligent capabilities of those system actually um is is more than that it's more than just

retrieval. So for generating code uh maybe doing some some type of mathematics that you know that we we're getting the impression that it's uh it's beyond this but it's still to to a large

extent domains where reasoning has to do with manipulating symbols. The problem is that, you know, why do we have systems that can pass the bar exam and win uh mathematics olympiads, but we

don't have domestic robots? We don't even have self-driving cars, and we certainly do not have self-driving cars that can teach themselves to drive in 20 hours of practice like any 17 year old.

So, we're missing something big still. &gt;&gt; So, what are we teaching a 17 year old then? Well, so the good, you know, the question is how does how does a baby

learn or even an animal, right? Animals have a much better understanding of the physical world than any AI systems that we have today. Uh which is why uh you

know we don't have smart robots. Um and and so you know we learn we learn about about the world how the world works mostly by observation when we are uh babies a few

months old and then we learn by interaction and we learn mental models of the world that allows us to apprehend any new situation even if we haven't been uh you know exposed to it

beforehand we can still handle it. So um a big buzz word in AI today is world models. And this is really this idea that we we we develop mental models of the world that allow us to to to think

ahead to apprehend new situations, plan sequence of actions, reason and uh predict the consequences of our actions which is absolutely critical and LLM don't do this really. There is the sense

uh professor that uh perhaps u AI will unlock an era of radical abundance. Uh will this abundance benefit us? Well, so there you know if you talk to uh economists uh they tell you

you know if we can measure the improvement that AI will bring to productivity which is you know amount of wells produced per hour worked um it's going to add up to maybe 6% per year

okay this is from economists that actually have studied the effect of technological revolutions on the labor market and the economy um people like Philip Amore more Eric Bson um and uh so

that that seems small it's actually quite big and you know it's certainly going to accelerate scientific progress progress in medicine um I do not believe there's going to be like a singular

identifier point identifiable point where the economy is going to take off and there's going to be abundance um and there's also the question of the you know policies surrounding this you know

is are those benefits going to be shared across humanity or or you know different categories of people in various countries and that's a political question has nothing to do with

technology. So if uh economists see this as boom, will then openness survive? &gt;&gt; It's not going to be an event. It's it's it's going to be progressive. There is this uh uh false idea that

somehow at some point we're going to discover the secret of you know human level intelligence. I don't like the phrase AGI because human intelligence is specialized. So, I don't like the, you

know, artificial general intelligence phrase, but it's not going to be an event. We're not going to discover one secret. We we're going to make continuous progress, and we're not going

to be able to measure that progress by just having a series of tests are going to test, you know, whether a machine is more intelligent than humans because machines are already more

intelligent than humans on a large number, a growing number of narrow tasks. Um and so you know it's a it's it's not like a uniform you know scalar measurement of of quality. It's it's a

collection of quality. But what's more important is that um intelligence is not just a collection of skills. It's an ability to learn new skills extremely quickly and even to accomplish new tasks

without being trained to do it the first time we apprehend it. That's that's really uh what uh you know intelligence should be should be measured at. So we're not going to be able to just

design a test that is going to figure out you know our machine is more intelligent than humans. &gt;&gt; So if it's about upskilling and ensuring that you're relevant then only perhaps

you're intelligent. uh will that then mean that the countries that adopt AI and the you know the pace at which India and the scale at which India has adopted AI the challenge would be to create

talent which is upskilled and reskilled and have the required skills for this &gt;&gt; absolutely so the the relationship that we're going to have with intelligent AI systems is going to be similar to the

relation relationship that uh a leader in business politics or or acade academia or or some other domain has with their staff. Okay, AI is going to be our staff. Every one of us is going

to be a manager of a staff of you know intelligent machines. They'll do our bidding. They might be smarter than us, but you know certainly if you are an academic or a politician, you work with

staff that are smarter than you. In fact, that's the whole point. You need to, you know, attract people who are smarter than you because that that's what makes you more productive, you

know, uh for for an academic students who are smarter than their professor and teach, you know, it's not the professor that teaches graduate students. It's the other way around actually. Uh and

certainly uh we have a lot of examples of politicians who are surrounded by people who are smarter than them. uh earlier today when Prime Minister Modi addressed the gathering he said

that India doesn't fear AI we are seeing this as our destiny future which is Bhagya do you see that with a summit of this nature being hosted in India it's a

message to the global south and that's where perhaps the next big innovation in AI could be coming from &gt;&gt; well long term it's going to come it's going to come from countries that have

favorable demographics and and that means India Africa um you know the youth is the most creative part of humanity and uh the sort of uh a a a deficit of that in the in the in the in the north

largely so um you know the the scientists of the the top scientists of the future and in fact many of the present are from India and in the future will be from uh mostly Africa. So

um what does that mean though right it it means incent having incentives for for young people to kind of study first of all so the idea that somehow we don't need to

study anymore because AI is going to do it for us and you know that's completely false absolutely completely false and it's not because I'm I'm a professor okay that I'm saying this uh on the

contrary we we're going to have to study more we see for example a trend where in industry in the past in certain countries it's certainly true for India but it's also true in European countries

um and certainly in the US we see more demand for people with more education P at the PhD level for example the the number the the the demand for PhD level scientists in industry has grown in the

last 15 years in part because of AI but because of everything because technological progress and you know hinges on scientific progress and scientific progress is brought about by

scientists and you know scientists mostly have done PhDs and so there is more demand for education not less and and so for for countries um in the global south that means you know

investing in education and and youth &gt;&gt; and making AI more accessible something that India believes in democratizing AI AI for all is the theme of this uh summit as well. Do you think AI can

become that accessible particularly uh for a country as large as ours with 1.4 billion people? &gt;&gt; Yeah, in all kinds of ways. Um unfortunately the uh the the cost of

inference for AI system has to come down um to to kind of become practical for uh the vast majority of population in a country like India. Right now the inference is just too expensive um and

you know energy cost and things like that. It's mostly energy cost actually. Uh so this has to come down but then it will play a role in education. AI will improve the quality of education, not

degrade it, you know, once we figure out how to use it best. Um, it will improve u, you know, agriculture, uh, and and &gt;&gt; healthare in particular. &gt;&gt; Healthcare of course, right? Um so I

don't work at mida anymore but there was an experiment a couple years ago or a year ago that was that was run by my former colleagues where they gave smart glasses to yes agriculture you know to

farmers in in India and and and they could talk to the the AI assistant to figure out like you know what is this disease on my plant or should I harvest now or or what's going to be the weather

you know and &gt;&gt; it is being used a lot in agriculture as well. &gt;&gt; That's right. It is assisting farmers to ensure that uh their produce gets

better, they make right choices. But when you say about education, will AI assist education in terms of making students or youth of the country more literate or will they become more AI

dependent? &gt;&gt; Well, I mean, we're dependent on technology, right? I'm dependent on this pair of glasses otherwise I don't see you. Um so that has been that's been

with us for centuries. Yeah we'll be dependent on AI of course but but AI will facilitate access to to knowledge and thereby kind of be a tool for education. Um I think the effect on

society you know might be extrapolated from what was observed um in the 15th century when the the printing press started enabling the production of uh printed matters and the dissemination of

knowledge right it uh it it had a huge effect on on society worldwide at least in countries that allowed it to uh to flourish and I think it's going to be a similar transformation with with AI of

course in the modern help just more access to to knowledge. The internet played also a similar role and um you know I think this this is just going to make people more informed, smarter, able

to make uh more rational decision if it's deployed in the proper way. &gt;&gt; So if you were to define this moment which we are witnessing in history, we are living it. How will you say it? Is

it like the advent of electricity? Yeah, people have made that claim including made that claim including economists. It's the new electricity. Um I think it's more like the new printing

press really. But uh again in the sort of this vision of uh you know kind of more dissemination and sharing of knowledge and amplification of uh of human intelligence.

But um you know the the the impact on on on on society and and the way countries need to be run uh is is very difficult to to to predict at this point. I'm I'm sort

of a an an optimist in the sense that you know I think societies will figure out how best to to use the technology for for for for the benefits of their population. While I am an optimist,

nevertheless, I'm going to ask this question to you, professor. Um, are we overestimating the change or underestimating what has struck us? &gt;&gt; So, usually in technological shifts of

this type, we are overestimating the changes in the short term and underestimating them in the long term. Uh I think for AI it's a little bit different because there's been a huge

amount of hype uh and expectations that you know the transition to human level AI superhuman level AI is going to be an event and it's going to happen within the next few years and people have been

making that claim for the last 15 years and it's been false. In fact, they've been making it for the last 60 years or 70 years and it's been false. Every time in the history of AI that scientists

have discovered kind of a new paradigm on on on AI of AI, how you build intelligent machines, people have claimed, you know, within 10 years, the smartest entity on on the planet will be

a a computer. And that just proved to be wrong, you know, four or five times in the last 70 years. Um, it's it's still wrong. We're still very far from that. We're not very far. We're we're getting

close, right? We're seeing the end of the tunnel, but it's not like, you know, we're going to have super intelligent systems within within two years. It's just not happening because of this gap,

right? You know, where is the robot that can learn to drive in seven, you know, in 20 hours of of practice like a 17-year-old, even though we have millions of hours of training data of

people driving cars around, we should be able to train an AI system to just imitate them. That doesn't actually quite work. It's not reliable enough. Okay, so let's try and wrap up this

conversation with who gets to define intelligence now onwards. Will it be actually humans, machines or both together? &gt;&gt; Uh probably both together but mostly

mostly humans like we we we set the agenda. uh and we um the biggest difficulty is not to get fooled into thinking that uh a a computer system is intelligent simply because it can

manipulate language. We tend to think of language as the epitome of uh human intelligence, right? But in fact it turns out language is easy to deal with u because language is really a a

sequence of discrete symbols of which there is only a finite number and that turns out to to make things easy when you train a system to predict what the next word is in a text which is what

LLMs are based on. It turns out the real world is much much more complicated and and it's been known in computer science for many years. is called the Maravec Paradox after roboticist Hans Marave.

And so the the the company I'm building and the research program I've been working on for the last 15 years or so is intelligence for the real world. You know how how to deal with

highdimensional continuous noisy signal that the real world is which your house cat is perfectly able to deal with um or a squirrel or or whatever but not computers yet. that that's the that's

the big challenge for the next few years in AI dealing with the real world and that's the point of the company I'm building. &gt;&gt; So AI has to deal with the real world or

real world has to deal with AI. &gt;&gt; AI has to deal with the real world the the messiness of the real world the unpredictability of the real world. &gt;&gt; All right. Thank you so much for this

conversation professor. &gt;&gt; Thank you Mr. for sharing your insights on artificial intelligence and thanks Maria for moderating this conversation. Ladies and

gentlemen, I would like to now welcome Mr. Ankur Vora. He's the president of Africa and India officers and chief strategy officer at the Gates Foundation. And well talking about him,

Ankur is a development economist by training whose life trajectory was influenced by his parents' dedication to purpose and India's economic reform that lifted millions out of poverty. Ladies

and gentlemen, please welcome Mr. Ankur Vora. Thank you honorable prime minister Modi for hosting this summit. Is a person okay?

Thank you honorable Prime Minister Modi India's leadership on AI is remarkable. It is fitting that India is hosting the first major international AI summit in the global south.

I grew up in Gujarat watching my parents serve patients at a community health hospital. I joined the Gates Foundation in 2013 inspired by the mission that every

person deserves the chance to live a healthy and productive life. Earlier this year, I stepped into a new role overseeing the foundation's work across our Africa and India offices.

I never imagined that I would stand on a stage like this at a moment like this speaking about technology that may shape the future of billions. I feel humbled by this opportunity.

Many people predict that AI will help the world be better for everyone. Others predict it will only benefit the privileged few. But the fact is it's not a matter of

prediction. It's a choice. Technologists can choose whether we use AI to take on the world's greatest challenges or just the most profitable

ones. Policymakers can choose to build rules that ensure everyone benefits and not just a few. That means governance,

safeguards, infrastructure built for inclusion. Here in India, leaders have already made that choice. India has built worldclass digital

public infrastructure like Aadhaar and UPI. This has improved the ease of living for billions. India is investing in Bhashini and AI

Kosh to ensure languages and high-quality data sets are no longer a barrier and innovators do not have to start from scratch. During its G20 presidency, India

strengthened global consensus around using AI responsibly and for good. Because of these choices, lowcost open-source AI tools are ready and improving lives already.

AI is not a leap into the unknown for India. It is the next chapter in a journey of building solutions that serve everyone. If the world follows this approach, AI

could possibly compress progress of the next 20 years into five. That progress means fewer children dying from preventable causes, fewer women dying in childbirth,

more infectious diseases eliminated, millions rising out of poverty. If you step back, the real test of AI is simple. Will it help make people's lives better?

That fundamental question guides how we think about our work in health, education, and agriculture. Since 2000, the world has cut child deaths into half.

That represents millions of lives saved. Within our lifetimes, we could see the end of preventable child deaths. AI can help us get there faster. In subsaharan Africa, there are 6

million fewer health workers than we require. AI tools, when deployed correctly, can free up time of existing workers so they can help more patients.

Last month, Bill announced Horizon 1000 in partnership with OpenAI, the government of Rwanda, and ministries of health across the regions. The effort will deploy AI tools in 1,000

primary health clinics across Africa. Imagine visiting a local health center that offers AI powered guidance. Simple cases can be resolved immediately.

complex ones are referred appropriately and millions of lives are saved. AI will not just speed up innovation, it can help bring that innovation to community clinics,

to health workers like my parents and to the patients who depend on them. That is expanded access. Another area where AI can make a material difference is in education.

There are two hard problems in education. First, accurately assessing where each child is in his or her learning journey. And second, once a teacher knows that,

helping her customize her lesson plans for that child. Earlier in my career, I worked to bring Pratam's teaching at the right level model to Africa, to Ghana.

I have seen firsthand that works, but the challenge has always been about cost and scalability. AI now makes that challenge surmountable.

It makes activities like personalized assessment far more affordable and easier to implement at scale. With Vadwani AI here in India, we developed a tool that analyzes short

audio clips of children reading. Each assessment takes only two minutes. It costs about 5 pesa. That is less than 1 cent per child. The result is more children being

supported, more hardworking teachers having the time and ability to do things that they love the most, shaping the next generation.

6 million children in Rajasthan and my home state of Gujarat have already benefited from this revolution. So it is clear AI will make a difference in health and education.

But can it also help advance economic opportunities for the poorest? More than half of the workforce in the global south is engaged in agriculture. Every country that has moved out of

poverty has seen rising farm For a farmer, every cropping season comes down to a handful of decisions. What to plant, when to plant, what seeds to buy, what fertilizers to use, when to

sell. If even one of these decisions goes wrong, it can wipe out an entire year of income. And that does not just affect a harvest.

It affects the choices the farmer's family can make for that year. AI can ease that uncertainty. It can provide timely localized information so farmers can make better

decisions with confidence. Earlier this week, Bill and Bill and I met Anaperna, a banana farmer in Andhra Pradesh. She showed us how she used an AI

assistant on her phone to identify a pest attacking her crop. She took a photo on her app. Within 48 hours, a drone had precisely treated the affected area.

She saw technology help her in real time to save her to save her harvest and protect her family for the season. When Bill and Melinda first thought about the Gates Foundation, the vision

behind it was simple. Innovation should serve those who are left behind. At that time, it meant vaccines, diagnostics, better delivery systems.

Today, it also must mean artificial Globally, the Gates Foundation has three objectives. No mother or baby should die of preventable causes.

The next generation of the next generation of people should grow up in a world without infectious diseases. And millions of people should escape the clutches of poverty.

AI can accelerate progress across all three. For the first time, we can deliver precision at scale, replacing one-sizefits-all solutions with the

right fit solutions that are cheaper, faster, and more inclusive. To support these efforts, the Gates Foundation is launching Advantage India for AI. Yes, that is AI for AI.

This initiative will bring together innovators and philanthropists across India and the global south to advance AI AI for social good. Ultimately history will not remember the

models we perfect or the speeches we give. It will remember the lives we improve. It's not a prediction. It's a choice. Thank you, Mr. Ankura. Your perspectives

on leveraging AI for social impact have undoubtedly added depth to this summit. And ladies and gentlemen, our next speaker is Miss Julie, chair and CEO Accenture. Miss Julie has

repositioned Accenture as one of the world's largest AI and technology transformation companies deploying hundreds of thousands of professionals across every sector of the global

economy. Her perspective on what AI adoption actually looks like at scale beyond the hype is grounded in hard operational reality. So please welcome the CEO of Accenture, Miss Julie.

guest. Thank you, Prime Minister Modi, Minister Vashnau and your outstanding teams for convening us for this critical summit around AI. The breadth of distinguished

guests from around the world is a recognition of the importance of broad global partnerships to capture the incredible potential of AI and address the risks. It is also a recognition of

the importance of India in our AI enabled future. At Accenture, we're incredibly proud to have over 350,000 and growing reinventors here in India. We also have one of the largest AI

workforces in the world, tightly integrated with our growing AI hubs in the US, Europe, the Middle East, and Japan. And I want to thank this take this time to thank all of our people in

India for your incredible commitment to value and to our clients. Today I want to leave you with three perspectives that we believe will help us ensure that AI's immense potential is

captured for the benefit of all. First, using AI as an engine for growth is the only path for global prosperity for all. Second, the agenda ahead of us is

unprecedented. Companies, countries, and individuals must reinvent how they work, how they work together, and how they learn. And finally, it is humans in the lead,

not humans in the loop, that will determine our future. As we turn to the imperative for growth, I want to take you back for a moment to 2013.

Oxford University had just published a widely read study that said based on technology progress at that time 47% of US jobs would be automatable. Dire headlines and predictions soon

followed. One of those technologies was robotic process automation or RPA. And there were predictions that IT services would be badly damaged because it would automate so many jobs. And in fact, we

used RPA to automate thousands of jobs. And we also as an industry embraced the new technologies of digital and classical AI and we created many many more jobs. We helped our clients adopt

RPA and those who did created investment capacity to invest in new technologies and to grow and in fact the IT services industry has thrived over the last decade including many of India's most

successful companies that you've heard from today. At Accenture alone in 2013 we were roughly 275,000 people and 29 billion in revenue. And today we're over 750,000

and growing and $70 billion in revenue. What the last decade has taught us is a critical lesson. When companies and countries embrace new technologies and then use them to drive

growth and productivity, they prosper. Advanced AI should be the same. In fact, in our latest quarterly survey of sea suite across 20 countries, they agree 78% say AI's greatest value is in

growth. Now, as we think about what growth should look like, there's two important considerations. First,

AI should make the impossible possible. AI should make the impossible possible. If in a few years as a CEO you cannot point to new products and services, new

levels of performance that were not possible before, then you have not captured potential of AI. Think about the consumer and retail industries.

LLMs are about to become the new mall. This is an entirely new way to engage customers and to engage in commerce that did not exist in 2022. If you think about pharma, we see a path

toward bringing drugs to market much faster than the average of 9 years, not possible before, which means that life-saving drugs will get to people faster and pharma will have accelerated

And we are just beginning to understand how AI will create new drugs, new materials, new products across A second consideration around growth is that we must commit to providing access

to the technology and the talent for small and medium-sized enterprises. If we are to use AI as an engine for growth, we need to make sure that the engine for growth, these types these

size enterprises have access. 50% of the world's GDP are small and medium-sized enterprises. And in the global south, it's 70% of employment to do so. There will be lots of business

opportunities. So many industries will serve small and medium-sized enterprises, but that will not be enough. Private and public partnerships will be critical to making sure there's

access. For example, we're working with the US college system where we're funding internships of college students at small and medium-siz enterprises. It's a win-win. Statistically, if you

have an internship, you have a better chance of getting a job. And it's providing these enterprises access to some of the cutting edge talent. And so we must make sure that we're continuing

to focus on the small and medium-siz Now I know and we all know that advanced AI is much more powerful than the technology advancements of the last decade.

And of course that means that the impact is more profound. But that doesn't change the critical lesson that AI must be used for growth and

What it does change are the sets of actions, the time frame, the need for global collaboration, the need for more public and private partnerships, and the urgency of what we must do in order for

AI to drive growth. So companies companies must be willing to reinvent how they operate their processes, how they've been doing work for the last decades. Underneath the

headlines of a failure of AI is mostly a failure to reinvent. Companies have to invest to reshape their workforces and companies must commit to creating

sustained entrylevel jobs. Now entry-level jobs makes economic sense. They're the only way to create future leaders and they bring needed truly AI native talent to each of our

organizations. But AI fundamentally is changing what an entry-level job looks like. And so a commitment means we have to be intentional about changing the roles,

investing in training, which is exactly what Accenture is doing. We will hire more entrylevel into more entry-level jobs this year than last year. But the skills we require and the way we're on

boarding those individuals is fundamentally different. Now countries must also reinvent. They must reinvent their role and how they work with the private sector. They have

to themselves as governments become the best credential for why AI matters. They must work with the private sector to help create lifelong learning because education is no longer a destination.

We have to have lifelong learning. India is doing a great job of embedding AI into the educational system starting in primary school and governments across the world will need to do so.

At the same time as countries are thinking differently, individuals have to think differently and recognize that formal education is no longer the destination.

But perhaps the biggest fundamental change that must be made is that companies and countries need to pound the table for global standards. These standards should apply to safety

but also to the industries where AI can make the greatest impact. For example, in pharma, if one country is allowing pharma companies to use the latest technologies to discover drugs and then

test drugs, but other countries don't follow suit, it means that you won't be able to scale. You won't be able to bring it. And we know that most often that impacts the most vulnerable.

Now we have a view of course that we have to reinvent. But as we think about that reinvention core to our future is the fundamental belief that it is humans in the lead not

humans in the loop that will shape that We should not confuse how you deploy AI responsibly. Of course, all of our compliance programs have humans. They have technology.

That doesn't change the critical lesson that we've learned over and over again. Technology, no matter how powerful, is only a tool. It is simply a tool. It is leaders who decide how to use those

tools. It is leaders who decide to commit to reinvent, who dedicate their time to making sure that people come along the journey. And it is leaders who must choose to work together to ensure

the safe widespread adoption of AI. There are lots of headlines today that predict less. Less jobs, less opportunity, less human relevance. We are here because we see a future of

more. At Accenture, we live by eight leadership essentials, the qualities we believe we need to run our company. And one of them is particularly important.

We expect leaders to lead with excellence, confidence, and humility. As we look to our collective future, we should have the confidence to have the unwavering belief that together we can

make a future that is better for all. We also must hold ourselves individually and collectively accountable for executing on that belief with a high bar of excellence because our people

around the world are counting on that excellence. And finally, we must all have the humility to know that we cannot do this alone.

Thank you very much. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much, Miss Julie Sweet. I think I can take a tagline out of an address which says that AI should make the impossible possible. But thank you

for your thoughtful articulation of AI's impact on industry and on society. Ladies and gentlemen, our next speaker is the youngest billionaires in history and he's now helping to define how one

of the world's largest technology platforms deploy AI at unprecedented scale. Next speaker is ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Alexander Wong, chief AI officer at Meta, the founder of Scale

AI. Alexander Wong built the data infrastructure that powers much of the modern AI industry before joining Meta as chief AI officer. So with a round of applause, please welcome Mr. Alexander

Wong. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much for having me. Namaste. Uh it's fair to say my upbringing wasn't typical. My parents were physicists in a town called Los

Alamos in New Mexico. Los Alamos is a government lab town where for decades scientists have come to push the boundaries of what's possible in mathematics and supercomputing, in human

genome studies, vaccine research, space explorations, and material science. My mother studies how plasma behaves inside stars. At the dinner dinner table, we'd talk about physics problems, scientific

trade-offs, the reasoning behind how systems work. One kid in my town made huge balls of plasma in their garage for a science fair project. You know, normal high school stuff. Growing up in a place

like Los Alamos leaves two things deeply ingrained in you. A belief that anything is possible and that science should serve society. Those ideas are what led me to study AI

while I was at I was at college at MIT. They led me to start my own company, Scale AI. And last year, they led me to Meta, where I am now the chief AI officer.

If you believe that anything is possible, Meta is one of the few companies with the resources, talent, and ambition to push the science of AI forward at scale.

If you want to make technology that serves society, Meta has an incredible opportunity to get this technology into people's lives. Three and a half billion people use at least one of our apps

every day. That blows my mind. It's more than half a billion people in India alone. People are already using our AI to do amazing things. Across India, creators use our AI to automatically

translate reals into the language of the person watching. Small businesses talk to customers through WhatsApp business agents that they create in 10 minutes on their phones. And they use our Genai

tools to create ads and reach customers way more efficiently than they ever could before. And India has worldclass developers building genius things to solve societal challenges.

For example, there are more than 20 million people with disabilities in India who are locked out of education, jobs, and digital services because the digital world wasn't designed for them.

So, I stem built voice first AI powered infrastructure that helps people with disabilities to learn, discover careers, and complete digital tasks independently, like converting textbooks

into usable formats or giving personalized career guidance that takes into account their disability. In healthcare, researchers at Ashoka University used our SAM 3 model which is

trained on billions of natural images to speed up the identification and segmentation of cancer tumors and at risk organs. Their model ENOSG can help radiologists and radiology oncology

teams do in seconds what it takes hours to do manually. The beauty of generalpurpose models is the same technology that can segment tumors in the brain can segment leaves

to help farmers assess the health of their crops as aggropoint has done. We recently open sourced our omnilingual models which recognize speech across more than 1,600 languages and can

rapidly adapt to new languages with just a few audio samples. It's not a fantasy that in a few years we'll have real time voicetovoice translation for every spoken language on

earth. Now build that into your glasses. Real-time translation in any language just for you. That's transformative. Perhaps most especially in countries like India where so many languages are

spoken. In fact, language is an area where we're collaborating with the Indian government on through its AI coach platform. We're providing data sets in 10 major Indian

languages so people can build AI models that deeply understand Indian languages and contexts. I'm sure you're used to people from big tech world making lots of grand but

vague assertions about what AI will be able to do. But we don't have to be vague. People use our AI right here, right now. They're getting value from it and they're building amazing things with

it. And that gives us confidence about what we're building towards. We're releasing new models this year with the first coming in the next couple of months. These will be deeply integrated

with our products in a way we're really excited about. We're optimistic about the trajectory we're on. The first models will be good and as the year goes on, I think we're going to be pushing

the frontier. Our vision is personal super AI that knows you, your goals, your interests, and helps you with whatever you're focused on doing. It serves you,

whoever you are, wherever you are. We all lead busy lives. I'm sure you'd want to do more if only you had the time and head space. That's how I think about personal super intelligence. Say you

want to be healthier. Your personal AI could help you see through a personal health plan covering diet, exercise, and sleep, and your daily routine. or you have a project you'd like to get done,

like putting on an event. It can track your progress, reach out to venues, arrange invites, remind you of things you haven't considered, and more. If you love to go fishing or paint or want to

travel more, it can help free you up so you can do more of these things. And it can give you advice when you need it and or help you show up as a better friend or in your community.

It won't just do your admin. It'll be an extension of you so you can be you more. I get that some people will worry uh what companies that what companies like Meta really want is to get you

hooked and leave you passively staring at screens. But the whole point of personal super intelligence is the opposite. It's about helping you be more active in your life in pursuing your

goals and deepening your relationships. I know people are going to be skeptical when I say we're doing we're going to do this work responsibly. But you don't have to take us at our word, take us at

our incentives. This is a competitive space, which is why we're seeing so much innovation. Given how intimately your personal AI will know you, people aren't going to hire us for the job if we're

not doing it responsibly. Our AI needs to work the way we say it does, as well as we'd say it does, and as safely and as securely as you need it to. It needs to help you in your life.

And if it doesn't, people simply won't use it. We'll lose customers. We'll lose public trust, and we'll lose out to our competitors. That's why we're transparent about our

models. We publish model cards and evaluation benchmarks and data so you can see how they work, their intended use, and how we assess their performance. And as they get more

advanced, we're looking at ways to share even more. It's why we invest in the science of model evaluation, growth, improving the existing tests, and building new ones for risks we haven't

yet confronted. And it's why over many years, we've developed ways to identify and mitigate potential risks before we release a model through risk assessments, scaled evaluations, red

teaming, and fine-tuning. And we can monitor aggregate trends in how people use AI in our apps. So we have a feedback loop that can flag potential risks and help us improve our models.

As the models improve, the governance around them has to keep pace. So we're innovating with how they learn and apply principles and how they're tested and evaluated using AI to strengthen checks

and balances. Realizing the full promise of AI is as much a matter of getting policy right as it is investment. There are four building blocks for AI.

Talent, energy, data, and compute. Governments and industry need to work together to make sure there's access to each so we can realize AI's potential and do it

in a way that means you can build for your needs, not ours. That's in part about having bold national AI strategies and policies that encourage innovation, not patchworks of

inconsistent regulations that make it harder. But above all, it's about collaboration between public and private sectors to deliver these four building blocks and to design and deploy AI that

works for your citizens and your economies. I don't want these amazing technologies to be one-sizefits-all. I want them to serve your needs designed

for the challenges and opportunities that are unique to India to societies across the global south and all over the world. I want them to serve you as an individual. No matter who you are, where

you live, what language you speak, or what culture you're a part of. That's only going to be possible if the public and private sector are on the same side. We need to be partners working together

in a spirit of openness and collaboration and with a sense of shared ambition. I truly believe we're on the cusp of a moment where really anything is

possible. We want to work with you to build AI that serves our societies. I hope you'll work with us. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Mr. Alexander Wang, our heartfelt gratitude to you for your

remarks, for sharing your findings as well. And well, your vision for AI and innovation, it does inspire many of us. Well, ladies and gentlemen, please join me now in welcoming Mr. Roy Jacobs, CEO

Phillips. Mr. Jacobs leads one of the world's most storied healthcare technology companies through a pivotal transformation, putting AI diagnostics and patient monitoring at the center of

Philip's mission. His work sits at the critical intersection of AI and human health where the stakes could not be higher. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome CEO Phillips, Mr. Roy Jacobs.

&gt;&gt; Thank you so much. Good afternoon. It's a true honor to be here among so many brilliant minds and very bold ambitions and building of the visionary path of the prime minister. I want to share how

we are walking that path designing and developing in India and delivering to the world. And since I have your attention, let me share something that I want to

leave behind. We believe that artificial intelligence will have its biggest impact in healthcare because healthcare needs it.

And maybe some of you are skeptical, but let me try you to convince you otherwise. For decades, healthcare has been adopting technology cautiously.

And there are different reasons for this. For today, something fundamental has changed in healthcare. Health care systems are under immense

pressure. Rising demand, chronic disease, stretched workforces and high expectations of patients and society. The pressure is only accelerating

and that will also accelerate the adoption of data and AIdriven innovation. AI is already today helping to provide better access to care.

It's embedded in clinical workflows. It's augmenting human expertise. It's improving imaging precision. It's enabling earlier detection. It's extending care beyond walls.

And so the task now is how do we build an intelligent care system that is predictive, trusted, more effective, and accessible for people everywhere.

Because ultimately it's not about AI or technology. It's out it's about the people that are served by technology and AI. Just consider for a moment the pressure

care teams are under. If you ask clinicians what they lack most, the answer is almost always time.

Time to think, time to explain, time to connect with patients. In many health systems, nurses and physicians spend hours on documentation and administative tasks, hours not spent

on the patient. AI has the full potential to change that equation. The first wave of AI is about removing friction,

automating repetitive steps, reducing clicks, supporting documentation, making systems more intuitive. This may not be flashy, but it is transformative and it does generate huge

impact. When AI listens to a clinical conversation and drafts structured documentation in the background, that is not replacing a clinician. It's giving

time back to the clinician. When AI prioritized work list so that the most urgent cases rise to the top, it's not making decisions independently. It's supporting better clinical

judgment. This is AI working quietly in the background so clinicians can focus on what matters most. And this is real Let me make it even more tangible

because AI is already reshaping what's possible across healthcare. Imagine a patient in a regional She has been waiting for weeks for an MRI scan. The backlog is long. The

technologists are stressed. Clinicians are not available to support. Traditionally, an MRI required significant manual setup, precise parameter selection, and highly

specialized expertise to conduct a scan. Variability was inev inevitable and access was limited. Now, imagine something completely different.

The patient arrives for her MRI and checks in smoothly. Her clinical information is already available to the system that will conduct the scan. AI helps position her first time right

accurately and selects the optimal scan protocol. It's tailored to her autonomy. And as the scan runs, the image quality is continuously monitored and adjusted automatically.

This is autonomous MRI scanning. The result, clear, precise images delivered efficiently and consistently. The radiologist receives AIdriven insights and quantitative biomarkers.

And Philips is working to make that a reality. It means more patients diagnosed earlier, earlier detection of chronic and complex

conditions. It expands capacity and access to care. It reduces variability. It scales expertise. And over time, it helps reduce the overall cost of care.

And at Phillips, we have been laying the groundwork for this future through advanced automation, integrated MR workflows and an AI engine that scans faster while

enhancing quality. We are also leaders in heliumfree MRI systems. That's a hardware breakthrough. And together, that does not only make it more sustainable, but it allows us to

install MRI systems outside of the hospital, closer to patients where it was previously not visible to go to. That means even more access, more resilience, and more patients served.

But diagnosis is not the only part of the story. Let's enter a hospital room. There is no lack of data. Actually, there's an overload of data. Many devices, alarms going off, dashboards to

be read. Now, image a hospital room transformed into a smart healing environment. Data from devices flow into a unified platform

where AI continuously analyzes vital signs and clinical trends. False alarms are reduced. True risks are elevated early. A subtle deterioration pattern in patient is detected by AI

hours before it comes visible. The nurse is alerted within context, not with noise, and the physician receives predictive insights. Preventative action can and will be

taken. The true patient crisis never fully materializes. That is the power of agentic AI software that can perceive, reason and act within

the fine guard rails always under human oversight. It reduces burden. It anticipates risks and it turns data into action. That's how we can give time back.

With all of this excitement, we must be clear about one thing. Healthc care runs on trust. AI in healthcare needs to be transparent.

It must be validated continuously, not approved just once. It must operate within regulatory frameworks. And those evolve as the technology evolve.

Clinicians need to understand how systems arrive at their recommendations. Patients need to know how their data is protected and regulators need confidence that safety and efficacy is rigorously

monitored all the time. Innovation and governance must advance together with speed because trust determines adoption and adoption determines the success of valuable

application of AI and healthcare. If they move at different speeds, trust erodess. If they move in alignment, adoption accelerates.

Now, I'm very happy to be back in India. India represents a remarkable opportunity in this transformation standing at the intersection of scale digital infrastructure and ambition.

The country's digital infrastructure including initiatives under the Ashman Barat digital health mission is laying the foundation for interoperable health records and longitudinal patient data.

the foundation for a big data play. Unique health ideas and digital registries create the possibility for the continuity of care for population at scale.

This matters enormously as we have heard earlier today. AI systems thrive on structured highquality longitudinal data. When patients can be followed across settings

from primary care to hospital to diagnostics and to the home, the power of predictive analytics increases dramatically. But India also brings something else to

the table. Real world complexity at scale. urban and rural settings, public and private systems, high-end tertiary care systems and primary health centers. The diversity of care environments

creates an unparalleled test bed for scalable, resilient solutions. Solutions built for India's scale and constraints have the potential to inform global models of care.

And at Phillips, we see India as a global innovation engine. We already here for 97 years and through our Philips Innovation Campus in Bengaluru and the healthcare innovation center in

Pune, we have made significant investments in R&amp;D, manufacturing, digital platforms, AI engineering and clinical collaboration. Our teams in India contribute to global

development as much as to local development and they do that across imaging, monitoring and connected care. The work done here does not stay here alone. It shape solutions deployed

around the world. For example, AI algorithms developed and validated with diverse data sets here improve robustness AC across geographies. That's done by more than 4,000 engineers

that we have in India developing for India and for the world. These software platforms engineered here connect ecosystems in multiple markets. Clinical workflow solutions co-created with

Indian partners inform designs that scale globally exactly as the prime minister says we are doing that today. And this is the kind of distributed innovation model that healthcare needs.

Not isolated breakthroughs but integrated globally connected ecosystems. If you look ahead in 10 years, success will not be defined by the number of

algorithms deployed. It will be defined by the outcomes they generate. Earlier detection of disease, fewer avoidable complications, shorter waiting

times, greater access, more times for clinicians, nurses, and technicians. The Philips Future Healthcare Index, one of world's largest recurring health research initiatives, tells a clear

story. 76% of Indian healthcare professionals are optimistic that AI can help them improve patient outcomes. 79%

of the Indian patients are optimistic that AI can improve their personal healthcare. This shows us that patients in India are ready for this and that Indian health

care professionals are asking for this and so are policy makers and government as we heard today. The promise is real. It's for today. Healthcare will move from reactive to

predictive, from fragmented to connected, from episodic to continuous. The systems we build today will shape the health of billions tomorrow.

So let me return to where I started. AI will have its greatest impact in healthcare for the world. And when we look at this in a decade from now, we will look at the outcomes

and impact it has delivered. It will not be remembered for what is optimized on the screen, but for the billions of lives that we could improve with it. That's the responsibility.

That's the exciting opportunity. And that's the future that we are committed to building together with all our partners together here in India and across the world. Thank you so much.

&gt;&gt; Thank you so much Mr. Jacob for your enlightening words and also for highlighting how AI can be a gamecher in the field of health sciences. Ladies and gentlemen, I would now like

to welcome Mr. Martin Schroer who is the chairman and CEO Kindrill. As the leader of the world's largest IT infrastructure services company spun out of IBM, Mr. Martin Schroer manages the technology

backbone of thousands of enterprises across the globe. His view of what it takes to actually run AI in production environments offers a necessary corrective to summit stage optimism.

Ladies and gentlemen, please join me in welcoming the chairman and CEO of Kindred, Mr. Martin Schroer. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Good afternoon everybody. Uh first

I want to thank the honorable prime minister of India Shri Narendra Modi uh for convening this distinguished uh group of ministers, policy makers, global leaders, fellow CEOs uh and of

course everybody watching on the live stream. It is an extraordinary opportunity for us uh to be here with you as we all focus on how to usher in this new era of AI uh responsibly for

people for industry and for our communities. Today I'm proud to represent the collective knowledge and experience of Kindred's engineers, technical practitioners,

problem solving consultants, the people who support the mission critical systems that the world depends on every day as the largest IT infrastructure services provider. A question that we

continuously come back to at Kendra and one that I suspect many of the policy makers and the business leaders and the technologists and the citizens here among us have is how do we actually make

AI work in the real world for realw world impact not a demo not a pilot or an experiment and not in theory but in day-to-day operations under real constraints with people working

alongside AI agents at national and enterprise scale. Well, scale means something here in India that's different than anywhere else where failure of these systems is just not an option.

Because when AI moves, when it moves from labs into the systems that power economies, the hospitals and the banks and the transportation networks and the energy grids and the governments,

getting it wrong, and these are the systems we run every day, getting it wrong is not just an inconvenience. It actually impacts lives. And these systems sit at the heart of what this

summit represents. the people, the planet, and the progress that we're all working on. Progress in all three depends on the ability to operationalize AI reliably and again at scale. So

today, I'll share a bit about what we're learning working with our global customer base and our partners to close the gap between intelligence and reality and where AI either becomes part of how

we work and how work actually gets done or never makes it out of the experimentation phase. And what we're seeing is not an innovation problem. The innovation is real, but it's a readiness

problem. We've conducted global studies with business and IT leaders uh countless times. And our research shows that while more more than twothirds of global

organizations are already heavily invested in AI, almost half still struggle to see meaningful returns. And in India, in India alone, 75% said their innovation efforts stall after the proof

of concept stage. So based on our research and our experience with our customers customers both in regulated and unregulated industries, the reason the leading indicator for why project

stalls, not because of the technology isn't smart. It's it's brilliant. It's brilliant. It's because we haven't industrialized it yet. AI today is not industrialized. the infrastructure, the

data, the operations, and the people simply aren't ready to support AI adoption and deployment at scale. Our customers really want greater clarity and greater support on four

critical questions. First, an oper on operational conduct. They want to know how to deploy AI when data is fragmented across clouds, across their core systems of record, and at the edge of the

environments in which they operate. when business processes were never designed for AI and when regulations differ by sector and by geography and when trust, security, and resilience are imperative

to how it works. Second, and more systemically, they're asking, can this system really run 24 by7 without failure? Can it withstand cyber attacks and outages and data drift and

regulatory scrutiny? And can the people trust it when it matters most? when can it can they trust the decisions it's going to make? Those are the systems we run every day. Third, they're asking

about agentic AI, whether they're truly to ready to use it in mission critical environments. Are they able to meet the the regulatory requirements that come with those those environments? And are

they able to integrate with existing systems? And fourth, they're asking about their workforce, how to prepare people for new ways of working with AI. Nine in 10 leaders

expect AI to fundamentally reshape work. Yet fewer than one in three believe their workforce is ready or that they're equipped to help their teams get there. All of this all of this ladders up to

trust. Can leaders trust these AI systems and the insights they provide? And that trust is built when AI operates within clear guard rails where actions are accountable and transparent and

explainable which is essential for organizations in every industry and especially especially in government, in banking and other regulated environments.

These are the core readiness questions and the core readiness challenges that we see every day and they're at the heart of why so many AI initiatives stall. They remind us that innovation

must operate reliably, predictably, and securely day after day in the real world. So, I'm thrilled that this year's AI summit is India because India is one of

the world's most important proving grounds for industrializing AI at extraordinary scale. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Modi, India has recognized AI as a strategic

national priority. Building policy and digital and talent foundations needed to support innovation and again at scale through initiatives like digital India and the India AI mission and investments

in digital public infrastructure. Excuse me. India has positioned itself not just as an adopter of AI but as a global contributor to how AI can be deployed responsibly and inclusively.

AI powered platforms like the unified lending interface are expanding access to credit at scale excuse me reducing loan times from weeks to minutes and while improving transparency and

inclusion India's digital experience offers an important lesson for the world when technology must operate at a national scale across public services and

financial systems healthcare transportation and energy reliability governance and human integration are not features they are prerequisites Kindra is very proud to be a partner to

many of India's india's leading companies and government agencies. Our local engineering teams have built scalable platforms for banking, for citizen services, for telecoms and for

airports to handle the millions of users and transactions every day. At Bangalore International Airport, we've applied Agentic AI to shift IT operations from a reactive response to a proactive

resilience, supporting, excuse me, self-healing capabilities that improve operational predict predictability and strengthen trust in in the airport's digital backbone.

Through our community partnerships in India, we're helping build digital and cyber security skills because safe, responsible AI adoption depends on people being ready, not just technology.

And because sophisticated adversaries are already using AI to move at machine speed tomorrow, tomorrow we're opening a new cyber defense operations center in Bangalore so we can detect and contain

threats that already start at the edge of the network before they become disruptions. So we are deeply committed to helping India and our partners around the world implement AI at the scale to

drive people, planet and progress outcomes in every part of the globe. Conversation about agentic must now shift from intelligence to industrialization from

what AI can do to how it's orchestrated and how it's governed and secured and integrated and how it's sustained with agents and humans partnering to drive business impact.

This is a transition every every major technology invention has gone through. Invention comes first, but impact only comes when societies learn how to industrialize it safely, reliably, and

at scale. A critical part of this indust industrialization is operationally operationalizing the governance of AI. That means moving governance out of policy documents

and into live systems, embedding auditability, logging, explainability, and compliance directly into how I how AI operates. We're seeing how our approaches like

policy as code can establish clear guard rails for agentic AI to drive trust and compliance, excuse me, giving regulators, boards and the citizens alike that confidence in

these systems are controlled, accountable and safe. So what do we do next? Excuse me. We get ready by focusing on the fundamentals. Infrastructure that

can scale, security that earns trust, and people with the skills to operate AI responsibly. This readiness perspective is particularly important for policy

makers, excuse me, because the impact of AI not be measured only by productivity gains or economic growth, as important as those are to drive the future. It will also be measured by how

institutions help people adapt in the next phase of industrial automation and how work evolves. Excuse me. AI can absolutely change the world. It

can change work. It can change skills. It can change mindsets. And it can change operating models. But it will only change Oh, thank you very much. It will only change the world when it is

embedded responsibly and reliably into the systems that society depends on every day. The future of AI will not be decided in the research labs or the boardrooms. It'll be decided by the

choices and the investments we make now. By how we close the gap between experimentation and industrialization. The work ahead is hard because this is not just a technology shift. It's a

human shift. We have to build trust in AI. We have to re reskill our workforces at scale. And we have to ensure these systems are worthy of the societies that depend on them. The responsibility

belongs to the companies and the governments alike. And it is a responsibility worth embracing because when AI is industrialized responsibly, it doesn't just optimize. It strengthens

the institutions people rely on every day. And that is how AI truly changes the world. Thank you very much. &gt;&gt; Thank you Mr. Shiter for your remarks. And ladies and gentlemen, now I would

like to welcome Mr. Olivia Bloom, global CEO Schneider Electric. Schneider Electric sits at the intersection of two of the most pressing challenges of the AI era, energy efficiency and digital

infrastructure. As data centers consume ever growing share of global power, Olivia Bloom is leading the company that is helping make that infrastructure sustainable. Please

welcome the global CEO of Schneider Electric, Mr. Olivia Blue. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much. So, first of all, I'd like to congratulate congratulate the prime minister and the entire Indian

government and all the associates for this beautiful full event. This week has been tremendous and that put together an ecosystem of stakeholders who are really moving technology to the next level.

Now, I I'd like to tell you a little bit uh about my own story. I landed in 2007 in India was appointed at that point of time managing director of Schneider in India to to develop Schneider electric

and I discover a country where the major issue was really access to power access to reliable power. Now I am sitting in front of you you know I'm standing actually in front of you as a CEO of a

global company Schneider almost 20 years later and guess what what is the biggest problem of the planet access to reliable and clean power. So it's not only the issue of India, it's issue the worldwide

planet and we are just at the beginning of a new era because we are facing issue with access to poor in many geographies. You heard many stories of problem of peak load in different geography

including the US where you have poor cut and we have not even started the era of AI. What AI changed to the world? AI means more compute. More computes means more energy and we just don't under

estimate today. We don't know exactly what is going to take but that's going to put the pressure on the energy system which has nothing to do with what it is today. So we know that energy is already

a priority for government for nation everywhere in the world. It's even a geopolitic topic but we are entering a new era where AI could transform the planet. And since this morning you have

heard many many speakers talking about how AI could impact our life, our businesses everywhere in the world. But the real question is how we take the energy system to the next level and what

AI can bring to make energy more efficient. So we do believe for a company like Schneider it changed everything because we are the first time in the history of Schneider after 190

years in the power sector where we are at a point where we can connect the physical and the digital world and it was not possible before. Now let me look back since 2015 what happened in 2015

something very important happened in the world which was the climate agreement you know the Paris agreement where the world has put a huge focus on energy and if you remember at that point of time a

lot of people spend time on the supply bring clean energy everywhere in the world which was great but Schneider I think was a very very strong advocate to say look working on the supply is very

important but we have to spend even more time to work on the demand side on how we make energy efficient and guess what in the past 10 years company like us but not only we've been really really strong

advocates that if we build a world which is more electric if we build a world which is more electric and more digital we might have a path really not only to decarbonize the planet but to give

access to energy everywhere in the world I think we've made good progress we've made good progress but it has been complicated because we faced a lot of resistance in the system we face

resistance with poor grid actors. We face resistance by companies implinging implementing those new technology. We know large company don't like necessarily to put all their data on the

cloud. You know they want to do it on premise and so on and so forth. But let's make it clear I don't think all the technology we are ready everywhere in the world to make energy system much

more efficient. So I think it has been a good journey in the sense that we've started really to electrify more and more in the world but I think we have just started to scratch the surface. Now

let me come to the topic of AI and the conference and I will come back on energy. I'm sure you are aware that in any kind of report we are talking about more than 200 gawatt of capacity that

needs to be built in data center in the next coming years by 2030. We say usually that 50% will be AIdriven and we see the acceleration for a company like Schneider. We see the

acceleration since two years and we started this to see the acceleration when we build our partnership with Nvidia when we started really to understand the next generation of chips

that will be used to Nvidia. For those who are not very familiar with what is a data center, we are talking about a couple of years about a couple of kilowatts per racks in the data center.

Then we move to 10 20 30. What we are building right now in India it's something which is already around 80 kilowatts per racks even more. And what we are doing in the US right now with

the GPU which are available for Nvidia is already at 150. We are foreseeing a world with Nvidia where it can go to 500 to 1 megawatt and that put a tremendous pressure on the energy system that force

every single company to reinvent the energy system. I'm sure some of you have heard about the concept of 800 volt DCs. So which are the new type of electrical architecture you will need to have for

the data center of tomorrow that will be able to power the AI industry. But again I'm coming back there is two faces of AI. There is one which is there will be many many new infrastructure that has to

be built but we have really to invent this next level of infrastructure to make sure that they can support what the AI would need. But the second part of the equation which is even more exciting

for me is that probably we are entering a new era where for the first time we can make energy more intelligent. But let's be very realistic. There are a certain number of data from

IA which are telling that to support the global economy. The world will need another 10,000 ter of energy to be produced of

electricity to be produced between 24 and 35 and another 12 on top of that between 2035 and 2050. when we are looking with our research team at shadow electric who are

building energy scenario we believe that those scenario don't include what AI will bring to the planet so the scenario in terms of electrification that you need for the planet it's not about

making usage more electrical and supporting the electrification of the planet for cars for heat pumps for electrification of process what bring AI on top of that it's another level of

pressure on the energy system and if you look at this conference which has been great where I've learned a lot where I've spent a lot of time with great people. I've not heard enough about

energy and I've not heard enough about the need to make energy much more intelligent if you want to support the next AI journey. Now for a company like SH electric is really really

fascinating. We created the company 190 years ago. We have been a great company in the physical world 10 years ago and I mentioned the price agreement. This is when we decided to make sure that every

single asset that will connect that will sell in the market will have to be connectable. So we are entering a new era where all energy system are connectable and if we are able to apply

all the great model all the great foundational model which have been bu been built by a lot of partner with whom we are working it. We can for the first time in our history connect the physical

and the digital world and that's what we call energy intelligence and by doing so we believe we can overcome many of the difficulty that we faced in the past 10 years to make energy system more

efficient that can eventually also solve one of the biggest problem of the planet which is the climate transition because again it's not only about clean energy it's about more efficient and we believe

we are entering in this new era where if we able to connect system to collect data to apply fundamental model that will connect the physical and the digital world we can save between 10 20

30% of energy consumption in every single application in the world and I'm just going to tell you and finish with one example think about your home you are all sitting today in this conference

or some of you are connected and while we are speaking there is a lot of energy consumption in your home. Tonight you will be back to your home. You have an electrical panel somewhere in your home.

Very likely your electrical panel is not connected today. Imagine a world tomorrow where every single connected if every single panel in the world electrical panel in a home will be

connected. Imagine a world where you are able to extract data. Imagine a world where you can apply AI agent and where we can manage energy for you while you are not

even in your home. You can save again between 10 20 30% of your energy consumption. Actually I can prove it. I'm testing it in my own home. So I'm telling you it works. Maybe you don't

know but consumption of energy in home is the largest consumption of electricity in the world. So the good news we are entering in a new era where we know that the world will be more

electrical and for the first time in our history we can say that the world can become more electrical if we are able really to leverage the power of the new technology and I will just finish by

telling you that why I'm extremely pleased to be here in India you know almost 20 years after I started the really my journey in this country is because India has a lot of different

factor which are very very different than the rest of the world and what I've learned a lot by spending you know six years of my personal life in India. India is one of the country where

equipment are under tremendous pressure more than in any other country in the world. Point number two, India is a extremely cost competitiveness country where you need to bring the best

innovation at the best price. Number three, the level of innovation. I know in India some people say also jugat in India but the level of creativity that you can have in India to create new

system that will solve the most complex problem of the planet can be done in this country and when you look at the number of engineers you have in power automation digital you have all the

ingredients which are together at a point of time where we need to make AI a big transformation for the planet for a company like sher I can tell you it's not only worlds India is the third

largest country of Schneider in the world. This is the largest one in number of employees, 40,000 employees. You don't know it, but this is the largest R&amp;D center we have in the world with

8,000 employees, largest number of software engineers. So, I'm super excited because we are starting a new phase for the planet, a new technology revolution which is called AI where

India can be the place where a lot of innovation start with. I came to India you know 20 years ago where we we are bringing a lot of product from outside. I think we are at a point of time where

India can innovate the next technology that will make the world more efficient. So we call that shadow electric energy intelligence. I've been very very excited to be part of the summit. We've

met a lot of people from government, from construction company, from technology company who have really this strong appetite to make sure that AI will bring progress for all and making

sure that India can be at the center of that transformation. And I always say to my team, you know, because now I'm leading generator globally. If you can crack the code in India, we'll crack the

code everywhere. Thank you very much. Thank you so much Mr. Bloom for highlighting all those facts which concern the power consumption so far as AI is concerned which is of course an

very important factor especially when we talk of sustainability when we talk of innovations and I must thank Mr. Bloom for highlighting the role of innovation and sustainability so far as uh energy

sector or energy secured future is concerned and all those numbers which you could see on the screen here were actually mesmerizing and this also gives hope because on one end we are talking

about how to leverage artificial intelligence in the areas which touch the lives of common people and at the same time it's like hardware and it's the software part and when it comes to

the hardware part that is where the whole world is now you know moving forward to have more data centers to have more advanced servers to have more GPUs installed and of course when you

talk of power that comes with this hardware to maintain this hardware to have a higher computing power you have to have electricity for cooling and for all those aspects well they're all

experts who are sitting here who know all these facts so well but then this is one important aspect which I think it's raising a big question also in front of the whole world as to how do we find

answer to it I could see the uh the statistics the numbers which were being showcased for India as well and then of course honorable prime minister has given us a goal of uh you know zero

emissions by 2070 and the way we are going moving ahead so far as the non fossil fuel is concerned the we are really working hard towards that and the goals that we had set for ourselves, we

are trying to achieve those goals uh well in advance when it comes to the alternative sources of energy. Yes, there are questions which are being raised about all the alternative sources

of energy as well when it comes to uh the environment and the pollution and things like that. There are a lot of questions being raised but I'm sure as everybody is hopeful that the science

will find answers to such questions but for the moment we are here at AI impact summit and artificial intelligence as is helping us find solutions to the common men's problem and that is what India is

aiming at to achieve through this AI impact summit that is we are looking at those aspects of AI where we can leverage AI we can use AI to have find common solutions to the problems of

people not only in India but across the world and especially global south because we feel that if we find solutions to the problems of India we are able to provide those solutions to

global south as the factors more or less are really common the problems are common so well now let me move on to our next speaker ladies and gentlemen I would like to invite Mr. Arthur Mench,

CEO and co-founder Mistl AI. In just a few years, Arthur Mench and his co-founders built Mistral AI into Europe's most significant large language model company, proving that worldclass

frontier AI need not be exclusively an American or Chinese story. His work is a model for what sovereign AI capability can look like. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome CEO and co-founder of

Mistral AI, Mr. Arthur Mench. Prime Minister Narendra Ram Modi, President Mun, your excellencies, distinguished ministers, ladies and gentlemen. Good afternoon everyone. Uh

it's an honor for me to stand before you. Uh I'm the co-ounder of Mr. Ali, but I'm also someone who believes that AI should be a tool for empowerment and not for dominance. While others may

speak about scale or speed, I want to talk about something a bit more fundamental which is who is in control of AI deployment, who benefits from it and how can we ensure that it serves the

money and not the few. So we believe that the futures belong to the people that are building the AI that are deploying the AI and that actually owns it. uh in a world where multiple digits

of the GDP are going to be produced by AI in the coming two years, uh we need to ensure that everyone that runs AI workloads actually have access to the turn on and turn off button and can

actually make sure that there is a business continuity and that they are not uh dependent on external providers that can actually turn off that button. The global AI landscape is evolving

rapidly. Uh but too often the narrative is shaped by a focus on control, surveillance and geopolitical leverage. Uh there should be another pass. At Mistral we believe in a different future

in a in a future where openness post trust and where autonomy is a fundamental right. Countries and regions which must own their AI destiny uh it's not a privilege but it's a necessity for

preserving digital autonomy and for shaping their own futures. So we need to decentralize AI deployment. uh and the first brick for that is open source. Human advancements has always been uh

built on top of sharing knowledge of openly collaborating on science on transparency and on collective uh uh work. Open source is not a radical idea. It is

what has actually allowed us to build the cloud infrastructure that today we rely on. It is what has allowed us to build a secure internet. Today in AI we are facing a dichotomy in

between open source technology where a few companies like Mistral are working on making the world knowledge compressed into models that can be used uh as uh the basis for creating applications and

for serving the enterprise the states education healthcare and another world where these models are actually compressed by a few large private corporations that actually use them as

as uh leverage uh against uh their users. The second brick uh that we believe in is in empowering directly all the regions through deep collaboration. So open source is uh is the tool and if

you want to make better open source models, we need to collaborate and that's what we do with multiple states. Uh we collaborate with their local ecosystems, we collaborate with uh with

research uh institutes to make sure that languages makes their way onto our models. uh mistral models have always focused on making uh rare languages uh more uh more usable uh and it's

especially the case for Indian languages which has this 22 languages diversity um we uh like to collaborate with uh with uh companies and with uh research labs that are working on acqu on acquiring

the content that is needed to make the models better and that is what uh is making us wake up every day. Beyond that and beyond the open source that should become the foundation of uh

artificial intelligence. If we want to make sure that every company and every state actually owns their destiny in the in the coming econom in the coming economy which is going to be mostly

driven by AI we need to go beyond the hype and look at what AI can actually do to for our daily lives. Uh AI is not about replacing human. It's about giving them a way to delegate many of their

task. It's about enhancing uh what serves them and it's about solving real problems. Uh so at Mistral we work with public services, we work with healthcare, uh we work on making sure

that citizens can access information in an easier way, in a faster way. We work on making sure that unemployed people for instance in France are actually able to find a job faster thanks to AI

asination. AI should be a tool that empowers people that empowers businesses and that ensures that governments can improve the quality of their services uh can improve the lives of their citizens

and can improve the the quality of life of of communities. However, it only works if everybody can access it and if everybody understands how to use it. Uh that's why multilingual AI is actually a

very strong necessity. Uh that's also why we need to focus on training people uh and on bringing them the technology at an afford a affordable price. Uh to do so uh we work uh as a model provider

and as a software provider. We work with infrastructure provider across the world uh to deploy and modify our technology so that it is aminable to large communities so that our small models can

actually be deployed to create u products that are cheap to serve and therefore are affordable by the masses that mal we're not waiting for the future uh we're trying to build

practical and impactful solutions uh on top of the open source models that we're creating uh we are creating the enterprise layer on top which allows to uh custom Optimize systems to make small

models that sells purposes to automate task in enterprises so that people can focus on the things that matter and on the creative aspect that is going to be the most important uh quality uh in

human life thanks to artificial intelligence and uh we focus on making impactful solutions. I would say that uh we are at a risk today uh in the world to be uh we're

facing too much concentration of uh power in artificial intelligence. uh we don't want to be in a world where three or four enormous companies actually own the deployment and the

making of uh of AI actually own uh access to information because really artificial intelligence is the way we are accessing information today and actually owns the infrastructure itself.

the the the entire network that is converting energy into intelligence. We want we need to make sure that every country's every uh economic uh community actually has a strategy to own a part of

it, not all of it. Uh we're always going to be partnering and that's is extremely important to accelerate. But ownership and ensuring that nobody gets excessive leverage is going to be critical if you

want to ensure that uh the geopol the the the world we live in remains stable. AI is going to change pretty profoundly the way economy is being run in the next few years. is going to change the

equilibrium in in the world and uh in order for the equilibrium to remain sustainable and stable we need to to ban excessive leverage and that in that India is a is a leader in uh in betting

on self-reliance which uh is absolutely critical uh for a country this size to wrap up I would say this uh that um the true potential of artificial

intelligence is to level the playing field. This is entirely rewriting the way we build software. Uh it is changing all of the previous established dominations and it's enabling every

country to actually accelerate their economies. It's enabling startups to build large and growing businesses that are disrupting the old incumbents that have been increasing their margins way

too much. And uh it's democrat democratizing access to knowledge. It's uh enabling nontechnical people to start building technical tools. uh the generation of code which we have been

heavy investors on especially on the and and and a leader in releasing open source coding models is enabling a very large community of people that were not builders before and that are becoming

builders and that is definitely going to change the way we look at uh the way people look at their jobs the way people um becomes entrepreneur becoming an entrepreneur today in every part of the

world is made much easier with AI and we need to accelerate that um to ensure that on the other hand the technology we're building is not widening the digital divide we need to

ensure that no language and no culture are left behind we need to ensure that the technology that we're building is affordable and therefore our focus on open source is I believe uh a very a

very important aspect and it's an aspect that requires a community of people that believes in this model and and uh and this model has has already proven its benefits in the course of uh of

technology in the last 30 years. We believe in partnerships over dependency. Uh so when we work with states, we actually transfer some some knowledge on how to build the technology, on how to

run it and we ensure that we can disappear. Uh we ensure that uh once we have shipped the technology, this is in the hands of our customers, this is in the hands of the partners that we work

with. uh whether it's collaborating with local governments, whether it's collaborating with businesses or academic institutions, we're committing to transferring that knowledge. We

believe that India opportunity is extremely large. Uh in that uh its talent uh a quarter of our researchers are actually Indians. uh its diversity of culture and its ambition and the the

the the the size of uh the market and the size of its industry is giving it is giving it immense leverage when it comes to building artificial intelligence that will be differentiated that will be a

major way uh a major uh product of export and that will uh provide them uh with uh even more leverage on the international scene by controlling its own AI. India can become a global hub

for innovation uh and it can also lead the way for the entire world. A call to action I would say we need to seize the moment. This is really an acceleration moment. Uh we've gone from a place where

chatbots were actually pretty amusing two years ago to a world where now we can delegate task uh over multiple hours and actually have a um an army of of AI delegates that can do a lot of things on

our behalf. And so it's enabling anyone to build much faster. Uh but what that also means is that the people that are not catching that wave are going to be left behind. And so to governments I

would say you need to invest in AI infrastructure that you own uh that you make sure to distribute to local and regional providers. You need to prioritize investment on local talent.

You need to make uh all of your engineers and everyone uh better at using AI. you need to invest on content. Uh we're all about compressing knowledge. Uh this is something that

humanity has always been doing. Uh and to compress knowledge and to make sure that your language and your culture is represented. Uh the aggregation of content and the usage of those contents

to make open source assets is absolutely critical. Uh and the time is really no. Uh we need to not miss that to the businesses. I would say adopting AI is going to take some time. Uh but it's

going to bring uh immense leverage and you have unique assets in your companies. You have IP, you have knowledge, you have fullcore knowledge. The way you're processing your the way

you're operating your business is different from the way your competitors are operating it. And what that means is that you need to build your own AI systems. The same way you train unique

employees, you will need to train unique AI agents. And that will only happen if you take a meaningful part of the value chain and you uh and you make it internal.

Finally, I would say the future is how to how to shape uh the AI revolution is here. the the the path that that it can take is is is really there are multiple paths it will take. Will it be a tool of

dominance or will it be a force for empowering people? Uh will it deepen divides or will it bridge them? Will it allow uh people to we will it allow certain countries to leaprog? We believe

it can happen uh but we believe it only happens if we work as partners if we work with a commitment to transparency and openness and if we choose to look at AI as a next vector of of autonomy. uh

and a way to ensure that uh every country uh remains um uh self-reliant. So we choose a future where AI is built for the many and by the many and for the many and India and the world deserves

nothing less. So I would say let's build it together. Thank you. Thank you so much Mr. Mench for your compelling insights and also for highlighting the importance of

technological independence in this digital era. Ladies and gentlemen, I would now like to invite Mr. Rajesh Subramanyan, CEO FedEx. At the helm of one of world's largest logistics

networks, Mr. Rajesh Subramanyan is deploying artificial intelligence to optimize supply chains, predict demand and make global trade more efficient. His vantage point moving 15 million

packages a day offers a uniquely grounded view of how AI performs in the real world. Ladies and gentlemen, let's welcome CEO of FedEx, Mr. Rajesh Subramanya.

Thank you very much for the kind introduction and for the opportunity to participate in this important discussion. Gatherings like this are critical to

advancing technology and making global progress collaboratively, responsibly, responsibly, and equitably. And that's truly our charge at this pivotal moment. The recent exponential

growth of AI has the potential to be one of the most significant events in human society since the advancement of electric power systems and the introduction of the internet.

AI is no longer a trend. It's the next industrial system, a union of compute, the energy and labor that will redefine how economies operate and how humanity evolves.

We understand the science and now it's about rapid amplification and application. Building AI capabilities is not optional. It's essential. Intelligence

is not an asset. its infrastructure, the foundation of the future of global progress, productivity and economic As such, we have an opportunity and a responsibility to be more than

consumers. We must be architects of AI. Every company, government, and institution should ask, how can we use AI to expand our ability to solve our

most pressing problems from broadening the economy to eradicating disease to improving energy efficiency. One of the most exciting aspects of AI is the potential to turbocharge problem

solving at scale. And that's always been the guiding principle at FedEx to solve problems by connecting people and possibilities. Our journey began at another

technological inflection point. Half a century ago, our founder Frederick W. Smith realized that we are moving towards a computerized automated society. He saw the world changing and

he seized the opportunity. He created an industry for the computer age, a noble way to move critical goods reliably and at scale. The integrated air and ground network would become

pillar of the modern economy. And flight by flight, route by route, hub by hub, we built a network that connected the world, shaping business, communities, and global commerce.

Along with pioneering overnight shipping, we invented tracking, we also fueled a massive growth of high-tech, advanced pharmaceuticals, international trade and e-commerce. We are indeed the

heartbeat of the industrial economy. Now, the world is going undergoing a fundamental shift. The patterns and the rules of commerce are changing. Impacts from the pandemic and shifts in tra

trade policy are driving towards a new period of reglobalization. Global supply chains are moving from one equilibrium state to another and FedEx is right in the middle of this

transition. In my 35 years at FedEx and monitoring global trade, I've never seen change at this space and scale. We've also never had a powerful

technological force for affecting change. AI is a force multiplier for shaping modern supply chains in a more connected, complex, and opportunity rich We've always been a datadriven company.

We have nearly 700 airplanes, 200,000 motorized vehicles, and more than 500,000 team members. We handle $2 trillion in goods annually, move more than 17 million packages daily across

220 countries and territories, and generate two pabytes of data every day. We realize the value of our data, our insights and supply chain intelligence early, and we set about organizing and

engineering our data ahead of the current AI revolution. And when you power the industrial economy and generate over two pabytes of data, the potential to harness that

intelligence with AI to create smarter, more resilient supply chains is immense. And it is a capability only a few organizations in this planet can match.

And for the past 50 years, FedEx built the world's most reliable network for moving physical goods. Over the next 50 years, our differentiation will come from orchestrating the intelligence that

governs modern commerce. That is our And to get there, we're using AI to transform a realtime network data into actionable insights that enable prediction, orchestration, and

optimization across the entire supply chain. This is not just visibility into what happened, but intelligence about what will happen next.

Identifying vulnerabilities and addressing them before they become disruptions is probably the most crucial element of supply chain resilience. Over the long term, we will power solutions

allowing FedEx and our customers to anticipate disruption to re reroute flows, rebalance capacity, and prevent localized issues from becoming systemic failures.

More importantly, we are scaling these capabilities responsibly and grounding them in strong data governance, cyber security, and ongoing focus on AI literacy so our teams know how to use

these tools effectively. Now, this opportunity is not just operational, it's also commercial. We are extending our intelligence through digital tools that solve problems for

customers and enable them to optimize their operations. Through collaborations and platform integrations, we can embed our intelligence directly into customer

workflows, helping businesses make sourcing, routing, inventory, and fulfillment decisions with near realtime supply chain insights. We create common data platforms with our

customers to build the best supply chain solutions together. This goes far beyond a supplier vendor relationship. Our customers are often co-creators and many of our digital tools are shaped by the

feedback for small and medium businesses seeking to grow internationally. Just one example is our clearance solution have become increasingly important to our customers with ongoing

shifts in trade requirements. FedEx import tool was first developed in India to simplify international shipping for small and medium enterprises. Their feedback helped us design features such

as predictive logistics, automated shipment tracking, and real-time customs updates, all powered by AI, and this is now rolling out globally. What used to be a complex process became

much simpler, giving small businesses better visibility and control over their shipments. Our AI powered capabilities go far beyond traditional logistics, positioning FedEx as a digital backbone

of supply, demand, and decision networks across industries. Today, technology is business, and business is technology. As global citizens and leaders, we must think this way. We must use the AI

revolution to propel global progress. From our experiences at FedEx, I encourage you all to get in the game. You cannot innovate from the sideline. If you don't like change, you will hate

extinction. See this opportunity with AI. Our actions must be decisive because the opportunity is genuinely transformative. Ask not why, but why not. Question all

ways of thinking. Take risks and embrace change as an opportunity for exploration and growth and keep asking questions. Nothing will matter more in the age of AI. As AI increasingly contains more of

the world's knowledge, it becomes an even more powerful tool for anyone with Have a bias to action. The world is be becoming more agile by the day and action is critical to keep pace. There's

al also so much more to discover including tremendous opportunity in how we apply emerging technologies. We have barely scr scratched the surface on how we use AI and machine learning to manage

global supply chains. For a company with legacy of delivering what's next, I cannot tell you what the end state of AI will look like. But I can tell you that we will be ready for

it. The transformative potential of AI is immense and with that potential comes the responsibility to ensure that its benefits are widely accessible. How this

latest generation of AI comes to life and how it impacts every aspect of our civilization is up to us. FedEx is ready for this journey. We're embracing AI and eager to solve

problems, drive economic growth and global progress and deliver a better and a brighter future. Thank you for your attention. &gt;&gt; Thank you Mr. Rajesh Dramanyan for your

available insights and also highlighting the importance of practical application of artificial intelligence in global logistics. Ladies and gentlemen and I now take the pleasure of introducing our

next speaker Mr. Jeet Adani, director Adani Digital Labs representing the next generation of one of India's most consequential business families. Mr. Gadani is driving Adani group's

ambitions in digital infrastructure and AI with data centers, green energy and ports as the foundation. The group is positioning itself as a critical enabler of India's AI economy. Ladies and

gentlemen, please welcome director of Adani Digital Labs, Mr. Jeet Adani. global leaders, innovators and friends, good afternoon and namaste. We gather here today at a decisive

inflection point in history and it is indeed a privilege to have the opportunity to speak to the audience that is reshaping our world. If you really look at it throughout

history, electricity powered industry, oil reshaped geopolitics and internet transformed commerce. And today AI is going to redefine

sovereignity. The central question before our country India is not whether we will adopt AI. The questions are will India import intelligence or architect it? Will we

consume productivity or create it? Will we plug into someone else's system or build it itself? The time for asking these is now over. As my country India rises, she does not

rise to dominate. She rises to stabilize. She rises to anchor a world searching for balance. And she rises to build systems that are inclusive and enduring.

And when India builds technology, she does not build for exclusion or control. She builds for inclusion. But in this geopolitically charged century, I believe that inclusion

without capability is weakness and capability without sovereigntity is foreign dependence. So today I want to speak about three pillars of sovereignity that will define

India's AI century. Energy sovereignity, compute and cloud sovereignity and services sovereignity. These are not technical abstractions but they are the foundations of modern

nationalism. The first pillar energy is actually intelligence sovereignity. AI is written in code, but it runs on electricity. As we all know, under peak

load, advanced processors generate extraordinary heat. Systems throttle when power falters and performance drops. This is not just an engineering detail. It is the strategic truth. If a

nation's energy systems are fragile, its intelligence systems are fragile. In today's AI era, power grids and data grids have become inseparable. This means that India's renewable

expansure expansion across solar, wind and storage is no longer just climate policy. It is strategic infrastructure policy and energy security is going to be equivalent to intelligence security.

In this era, sustainable energy has become our competitive advantage. So what is going to be different in India? Because of all of this, we see that renewable clusters will colllocate

with AI data centers. Industrial corridors will integrate energy and compute planning. Storage and grid stability will become national priorities.

The second pillar, compute and cloud sovereignity. If energy is the fuel, compute is the factory. In earlier centuries, nations built steel plants and shipyards.

In the digital age, nations invested in semiconductor ecosystems. And in today today's AI age, sovereign compute capacity has become strategic It matters now where compute resides,

under whose jurisdiction it operates and who controls this access. Cloud sovereignity does not mean isolation. It means autonomy. It means India must host critical AI workloads

domestically. It means we build data center ecosystems at scale. It means domestic access to high performance compute for our startups, academia, defense, healthcare and manufacturing.

If intelligence infrastructure is concentrated externally, strategic leverage concentrates externally and external concentration creates national fragility.

In earlier centuries, nations have built navies to secure those important trade routes. Today, we built sovereign compute to secure our intelligence routes.

And lastly, the third pillar, services sovereigntity. We all know that India's IT revolution made us a global digital services powerhouse. But much of the productivity dividend

occurred not in our nation but elsewhere. The AI revolution gives India a once- ina century opportunity to change that Our AI must first amplify our Indian

productivity. It must enhance our agriculture resilience. It must personalize our education at a massive scale. It must optimize our networks of logistics and ports. It must improve our

energy of this energy of our energy and distribution efficiency. It must modernize our manufacturing competitiveness. It must expand our healthcare and

diagnostics across rural India. It must deepen our financial inclusion across tier 2 and three towns and villages. AI must become a force multiplier for Indian citizens before it becomes a

margin multiplier for others. This is not protectionism. This is preparedness. This is not isolation. This is strategic maturity. Earlier this week, the chairman of the

Adani Group made one of the most transformative announcements in India's technology history. Our group will invest $100 billion to build a sovereign green energypowered AI

infrastructure platform for the nation. This is not just data center expansion. This is the trigger for a 5 gawatt $250 billion integrated energy and compute inter uh e ecosystem engineered to

anchor India's intelligence revolution. It signals a decisive shift from importing intelligence to architecting it from consuming AI to creating it by integrating renewable energy grid

resilience and hypers scale compute into a unified architecture. This commitment ensures that India's AI future is not only powered but secured, sovereign and built at a national scale.

I stand here today as a citizen of the new India. I belong to a generation that did not have to fight for freedom. We received it as a gift secured by sacrifice.

But history does not reward inheritance. It rewards guardianship. So today our responsibility is to strengthen it, to secure it, to defend it. This is modern nationalism at its

highest form. We must focus on capability over rhetoric, resilience over vulnerability, execution over entitlement. The question is no longer whether India

will participate in the AI century. The question is whether the AI century will carry India's imprint in its infrastructure with her intelligence with her standards and most importantly

her values. I believe deeply and without hesitation that she will because when India rises she does not rise to dominate. She rises to stabilize she rises to build and she rises to include

and this century will remember that. Thank you. Enjoy. &gt;&gt; Thank you Mr. Chit Adani for sharing your insights with us and your vision as well as for enriching this August

gathering. Ladies and gentlemen, it's my privilege to now welcome Mr. Vinod Kosla, founder Kosla Ventures, co-founder of Sun Micro Systemystems and one of Silicon Valley's most visionary

investors. Mr. Vinod Kosla has been making bold bets on AI, on climate and healthcare for decades. He has argued that AI will replace 80% of the jobs and that this is cause for optimism rather

than despair. How? Let's listen to him. Please welcome the founder of Kosla Ventures, Mr. Vinod Kosla. &gt;&gt; Good afternoon. I am going to talk to you about some

applications of AI that should be done immediately. I am not going to talk about business or technology or where it's going. I'm going to talk to you about what can be done today.

If I can if I can get my slides on the screen. Okay. So I'm going to talk to you about what can be done today in the next year or two to

reach a billion and a half people in this country with really impactful immediate benefits and unless AI benefits the bottom half of the Indian population

uh we're not going to see a huge amount of uh impact. So the first thing I'm going to talk to you that's possible today and in fact millions of kids in India are using

today is AI based personal tutors and I'm going to talk to you about 24 by7 almost free doctors available to everybody on through AI. This is not helping a doctor. This is building a

doctor. And of course, every farmer should have AI level PhD aronomist available to them in their local small plot. This is all possible. They don't even need to know

how to read and write. Just speak and look and take pictures. So, let me start with AI tutors. There's a lot of children in India who don't get much help in their education.

In fact, in rural India, teachers don't often show up. So, it's very important that this kind of a service be available so every child has their destiny in their own hands.

Thank you. The screen wasn't showing uh my slides. Uh my wife has been running a nonprofit ck2.org that offers it. Now these are worldwide usage about 400 million students have

already used this service of AI content which is all free and AI tutors. In 4 million students have benefited by using the TI tutor. more than 12 million have used it constantly. So it is

already in widespread use. Um this already CBSC compatible. The national education policy compatible. The curriculums available in English or Hindi or Odisha or Megalia in these

state standards. Plenty of studies to show that they can be very efficacious. Does a student learn better with AI than without? In fact, I would venture to

guess a student learned better with AI than if they had a personal tutor. Rich people can afford personal tutors. They won't do as well as people who have access to this AI.

It's a holistic kind of approach. I won't go into much. It's a pretty complex system. that and and I won't go into the complexity

of the system but this is not just a chatbot this is not just uh a key um sort of use AI simply this has been built based on and we've been working with Saram here

in India to propose diksha which is a large collection of content in India which is mostly unusable to be honest and build a 3.0 version of DIA which is an AI first experience.

This is built on billions of student questions that have already been asked on the CK12 website. Billions that is used to train the model to know how to teach a student. So it also has a pre

teacher professional develop development curriculum. So teachers can keep up with it and keep up with most modern education. Again, compatible with the national

education standards in India and the CBSC curriculum. Uh before I go talk about AI doctors, I'm going to make a couple of comments. Uh,

the AI tutors I'm talking about are far superior to human tutors. Here's what they can do. They can quickly assess a student where they are in minutes, 10 minutes or 15

minutes and then teach and tutor to the gaps in what the student doesn't know through a complex process called tracing knowledge tracing or keeping their uh tracing what they don't know.

Moving on to AI doctors which are also entirely possible today. In fact, these will make available 247 to every Indian for almost trivial or no cost.

Full primary care expertise, full disease management, chronic disease in India has been going up very very dramatically. free mental health therapy, prehysical therapy, and health

and nutrition coaching. A level of comprehensiveness in in AI help that isn't available with to the people who have the highest most best paid doctors in the world. None of

this is available at this level even in in the US or most western countries. more than that is possible here for almost no no cost. So and of course these AIs will be smart enough to know

when to triage up to a human to do whatever functions only humans can do. But let me not delude you. There's very little a human can doctor can do that this AI can't do today

uh other than the physical parts. If they have to feel your stomach of course an AI can't do that yet. I also fundamentally believe these services AI based doctors and AI based

personal tutors should be part of the Aadhaar system. Aadhaar allowed us to offer UPI. There's no reason we can't offer on the same identity based system where the

hard work has already been done within a year or two to every Indian this these services. So what I'm specifically proposing to build a section 8 nonprofit company to

build operate and transferring to the Aadhaar ecosystem such uh such systems I think they're relatively simple to do. they need many cycles of iteration to adapt specifically to Indian conditions

all the index languages all the differencing diseases uh in in in each part of India so I'm very very excited about this and what you can do for not only

education healthcare the third element I want to talk about is aronomy having every farmer have a PhD level aronomist available locally 24/7 alongside a UPI like service as part of

the Aadhaar system. A tutor that can gauge students. It can find and teach to gaps in students and make the current dicksha system much

more useful, much more friendly and leverage all the great content that is in the dicksha system in India today but is not really usable because there's no way to organize it and have an AI tell

you what part of this vast library is relevant to you on the day you're trying to do your homework or prepare for a test. You can multiply India's doctor's

resources. So many years ago, I looked at the question of what how you could scale the doctor patient ratio in India to the same level that is in the west like in

the United States and it wasn't possible even if you had a trillion dollars in decades to do this. That's how far behind we are. But this will get us get us in India an

opportunity to get well far ahead of the level of care available in a country like the United States at least at the doctor level. There's still surgeries, there's still drugs. Uh those are

separate matter all areas in which AI can help. But u that's sort of my hope. So you talk the AI talks directly to patients. It diagnoses, prescribes,

tests, prescriptions. Um we are using technology from a company that's been developed over the last five years and with Saram's help and adaption

to Indian languages using the Serb model and you start with physician approval of the dialogue. So you oversee the AI with the doctor initially for the first couple of years. So think of AI as an

intern fresh graduate, an MBBS graduate who works for the doctor. They let them do a lot of things but then they oversee them and watch that. That's the model I propose is possible in the next year or

two and within two or three years I think that need for supervision will go away. And of course there's emergencies and times you have to send somebody to the

emergency room or the hospital. So AI can do that. Um the same is possible with aonomy. This the third service. I won't go through the details of this. Uh I will

try and finish up here. But I want to finish by saying the future is here today. These massive impact services that couldn't be done with hundreds of billions of dollars can

be done very very cheaply. Scale medicine, scale teaching, scale education, scale aronomy. And these services impact the bottom half of the population more and they need it more

than almost anybody else. That's exciting. If we don't do that, it is a massive opportunity loss for us. Thank you Mr. Costlite. It was a pleasure listening to you and all your

wonderful ideas giving solutions AI solutions to India's problems and no doubt AI can be a gamecher to make this world a better place and such ideas I'm sure will help us achieve that goal too.

to invite on stage Mr. Nikkesh Aurora, CEO Paulo Alter Networks. As cyber threats grow more sophisticated with every advance in AI, Mr. Nikesh Aurora has built Paulo Alto Networks into the

world's leading cyber security company by platforming defense. A former president of Soft Bank and senior Google executive, he brings rare breadth to the challenge of securing our AI future.

Please welcome the CEO of Paulo Alter Networks, Mr. Nikkesh Aurora. Good afternoon everyone and thank you very much for being here. Uh I want to thank the honorable prime minister for

bringing us all together and uh as many of you were here this morning not unlike Sunda from Google uh about 40 years ago I used to take the priag express from New Delhi to Vonasi a city that was a

city of temples and had the revered panaras in the university which is now a hotbed of AI innovation. You've spent the morning hearing about AI's vast potential from curing ancient

ancient diseases to Daario's idea of having a country full of geniuses in a data center. Having spent my career at the intersection of major technological shifts, I can say I have never seen

anything that has moved so fast from a technological perspective. Coincidentally, it was about three years ago I was on my way to BHU to give the convocation address and Chad GPD came

out. That moment changed everything. AI is accelerating faster than our institutions, our governance frameworks and even our intuition. This widening gap, if not handled right,

is going to become a tangible threat to national security, economic stability, and social cohesion, making it a defining challenge of our era. As an internal optimist and

representing the world's largest cyber security company, I'm not here to throw cold water on our optimism and the idea that AI is going to solve every problem. I'm just here to come and say that for

us to enjoy the benefits of AI, we have to make sure we have to solve for inclusion, for trust, and for safety while we continue to make advances on AI. I would say at the current moment,

the balance is tilted not in the favor of trust, inclusion, security. It's al actually tilted in the favor of speed. you're seeing features and capabilities coming out as fast as they can, probably

faster than we can absorb them. Every morning you wake up and something new happens. You know, um there are agents that are doing things for us. There are new models being thrown out which can

make music. I only don't know where this is going to stop. So while we've been enjoying the capabilities of Claude, Chad, GPT, Gemini, which are teaching us how to do all kinds of

stuff, um AI has already moved on. We're now battling towards the agentic future where the agents are going to take care of everything and we're going to kind of lose control.

The challenge we have is, you know, we talk about agents. If you think about it, Sundar also mentioned Whimo, a car that will drive you from point A to point B. That car is effectively an

agent. That agent used to be a driver who's no longer a human being. It's an agent. It's going to drive you everywhere. That was a very expensive agent. It took a lot of training to

train that agent over a lot of time. However, it does give us a glimpse into the future. a future where we can actually build a trustworthy agent that can take over the task of a human being.

But I was at Google in 2009 and I remember riding in the first iteration of a self-driving car. That was 16 years ago. So it's taken a long time to get one job replaced

by an agent. So all of those of you who are really worried that our jobs are going to go away, it's going to take a little longer than you think. We're not going to trust agents that easily and

that quickly. However, for us to be able to trust agents, once again, we have to build a future where the ideas of safety, the idea of security, the idea that we can trust an agent are developed

cohesively with technology, not outside of that technology. So, and once you get there, you realize we're not going to stop at software agents. I think if you saw the lunar

year celebration in China, there were robots which are dancing and flipping around much better than actually I can do. So I'm sure most of us would not be able to compete with the robots. These

are version ones of robots. Imagine these things are going to be changing light bulbs and digging streets in the middle of the night when there's no electric there's no lights because they

don't need lights. They can operate without lights. They can operate without food. They can operate without anything. There is a rumor that these are the things that are going to be sent to

build the data center in Mars. It won't be humans because Mars is not quite friendly from an oxygen perspective yet. So if you believe that that's what the future entails, there's a lot of

questions that it brings up. It brings up questions of how are we going to take care of these agents if they go rogue? How are we going to manage these physical agents if how are we going to

control them? How are we going to govern them? So all these are challenges that we have to solve correctively before we go ahead and go live this beautiful future of AI. So from our perspective

from a cyber security perspective from a governance perspective I think there are three big challenge we have to challenges we have to solve I think the first challenge is challenge of

governance and accountability in the early stages of AI adoption systems are advisory you ask it to write a letter to your girlfriend ask GBT to write a letter to your parent a thank

you letter it can do that that's pretty cool it's an advisory system you can change it you're a man in the middle you're in control this is great soon you will give control to an agent which is

going to be your agent is going to do things for you. That's okay, too. As soon as you give control to an agent which can act with its own agency, now you have to worry about who's

responsible for the actions of those agents. If you use them in a social context, who's responsible? If you use them in enterprise company context, who's responsible? If your agent starts

giving away money, who's responsible? If an agent goes ahead and balances your portfolio the wrong way, who's responsible? So there is a whole series of questions that are going to kick in

from a governance and accountability perspective at an individual level at a nation state level at a global level. These are problems that need to be solved. That is why we have to come to

summits like this and talk about this from a public private partnership perspective because the the extreme option is let's ban it. If you ban it, it'll go away. It's not going AI is not

going to go away if you govern it out of existence. It cannot be governed out of existence. So we have to figure out how to sit down and solve the governance and accountability problem before it's too

late. If you don't solve that problem, we will erode trust in AI. If you erode trust in AI is going to cause a series of problems that we're not going to be able to solve. So the second problem

that we're going to run into with AI is this problem of human impact. AI is currently threatening to take away jobs. AI is currently threatening to take away agency from human beings. I think it's

important for us to understand how that was going to manifest itself. I think all many people have talked about that every technology inflection in history has resulted in a significant period of

societal and economic disruption but ultimately every inflection we've had whether it's agriculture or industrial revolution electricity you pick favorite one that you want it has resulted in

upskilling and reskilling of society. I think the the farm agronomy production is up 20x and the number of farmers is down 90%. So we found a way of retraining people upskilling people

without social uprising and we need to figure out how to understand the human impact of this. How to build plans from an upskilling perspective. I have a conviction that we're going to need five

times the number of technology people in the future than we have today. So we need people to work on these things. Who is going to train the robot who's going to dig the street? Who's going to train

the robot that's going to build buildings for us? Who's going to train the robot that's going to go out and build a data center? That requires training. That requires development.

That requires people who understand how AI works, how technology works. So there is a solution to the problem. If you're an optimist, the solution is sit down and plan for it to understand how

to make the social change happen simultaneously while Sam, Dario, and Sundar are busy building amazing models for the future. And last but not the least, as you know, since I work in

cyber security, it is important to understand there is a security problem. A security problem manifests itself in many ways. There's lots of data being used and AI is going to consume more and

more data. You know, as I don't know if you experienced the new models, the model says, "Let me know more about you so I can be most helpful." My fear is in about six months if I'm talking to my AI

model, it might know more things about me than I've told my wife. So, I don't want my wife to get her hand on my Gemini prompts because I'm surprised what it might tell her. But if you

expand that and take that more seriously, you will see that AI is going to become your therapist. It's going to become your nutritionist. It's going to become your advisor. It's going to

become your friend when you're lonely. And you're going to tell it things that you don't tell anybody. That's fine. Do whatever makes you happy. But when you do that, the risk is if that data falls

in the wrong hands, it's not a good idea. So you have data concerns. What do you do with data that you're feeding AI? How does it stay segregated? How does it stay that belongs to you?

You have a problem where we're using the biggest application today for LLMs is coding. Well, that's great. Um code can be malicious. Code can be tampered with. So you got to make sure as people are

busy writing code and rebuilding your systems, your companies, we have to build a secure system around the code to make sure that AI is doing it in a secure manner. You have problems with

agents. We talked about agents, you know, great. How are you going to make sure that the robot that you bought to go clean do your dishes and your laundry at home doesn't go rogue and start

threatening you? How are you going to make sure that nobody can intercept the control system of the robot and it starts to go rogue on you? You need security. You need to make sure that

this is built in a way that can be secured, governed, and controlled. Including that, you also have to worry about adversarial AI. What if AI turns against you? How are you going to make

sure that we build security systems? Where is the kill switch? If AI starts to act in a way that is not good for us, I'm not trying to scare you. These are all problems that we can solve

collectively, but there are problems that we have to tackle whilst we're busy getting excited about AI. So, we have to solve the problem of governance and accountability. We have to solve the

problem of social and human impact. And we have to solve the problem of cyber security or safety as you build this AI models. However, despite the complexity of this challenge, I remain deeply

optimistic. I think this optimism is because of the unparalleled strength and progress we've seen. In three years, we've actually painted the future which none of us had

imagined three years ago. So, if you can do that, I'm sure we can collectively solve the problems if you put our hearts and minds to it. And I know there are many such companies that are inclined

such in such a way. There are many governance bodies that are inclined towards solving this problem because we have something no model can replicate. We have human judgment. We have shared

values and we have the ability to collaborate. So I think that's important. That is why we come to places like this to talk about this with each other to collaborate to be able to solve

these problems. India has already shown the world what is possible when innovation is paired with inclusion through digital public infrastructure systems like Ahar and UPI. They

demonstrate how technology deployed with public good in mind and scaled across a vast population can leaprog traditional development methodologies. I hope we can apply the same energy in India to

solving the problem of AI to make it more inclusive, more fair, more social, more trustworthy. With that, thank you very much for listening. Jah, &gt;&gt; thank you Mr. Nikeshaura. We deeply

appreciate your perspective and your remarks have actually strengthened our understanding of digital resilience in this rapidly changing world. Ladies and gentlemen,

I would now like to invite on stage our next speaker who's a woman of substance who's been placed among the top 50 women leaders by Fortune magazine six times. She's one of India's most influential

business leaders. Miss Rashni Nard Malhotra, chairperson at Cclnies, who has steered HCL Technologies through a period of remarkable growth while also championing education and the arts

through the Shiv Nadder Foundation which is one of the largest philanthropic foundations based out of India. Her leadership brings both business rigor and social purpose to the technology

conversations. Ladies and gentlemen, join me in welcoming Miss Rashni Najar Malhotra. &gt;&gt; Thank you respected leaders, distinguished guests

and everyone who has joined us here today. A very good afternoon to you all. By now, every major theme has been covered. The trillion dollar projections, the model sizes, the

disruption curves, the pro productivity deltas. So let me try and draw your attention more on perspective rather than information. Every decade has a defining sound. In

the 1990s, it was the hum of the dial-up modem connecting India to a newly globalizing world. In the 2000s, it was the ringtone of the mobile revolution, placing

communication in every hand. In the 2010s, it was a silent scroll of the smartphone, reshaping how we live, work, and learn. Today, the defining sound of

our era is quieter still. It is the invisible harm of neural networks. Learning, reasoning, creating, reshaping the founders of society itself. Artificial intelligence is no longer

something we switch on and switch off. It is with us at all times, even when we sleep. It is an assistant, a guide, a teacher, sometimes even a companion. From the most mundane tasks to the most

advanced scientific discovery, AI is becoming allencompassing. But this is not merely another technology cycle. This is a structural shift.

For the first time in history, knowledge itself is being commoditized. When knowledge becomes programmable, industries are redefined rather than merely evolving.

Business models change. Individuals are empowered more than ever. Nations have an opportunity to accelerate growth and move up the order. Our generation is fortunate.

We are witnessing multiple technology revolutions within a single lifetime. Yet what truly distinguishes this moment is not just scale but speed. When knowledge and intelligence becomes

abundant, judgment becomes scarce. When answers are instant, questions become valuable. The competitive edge in the AI era is not computing power. It is clarity of thinking.

We began this AI journey with awe. Can machine write? Can they see? Can they reason? Can they create? Today those questions are getting answered at an accelerated speed. So

instead of telling you what AI will do, let me suggest something more uncomfortable. AI is a mirror. It will reveal who we already are.

The real question is not what AI can do but how responsibly we will deploy it. How inclusively we will scale it and how wisely we will govern it. Technology is a gamecher but only as long as humanity

remains its master. This summit therefore is not just about AI alone but also about leadership. Every technological revolution eventually asks a human question.

The printing press asked what should be preserved. The internet asked what should be connected. AI asks what should be delegated.

And that question forces another. What is uniquely human? If AI writes, calculates, diagnoses, predicts, then leadership must mean more than knowing things. It must mean deciding things.

For decades, India's technology growth followed a simple question. Scale drove revenue. As delivery expanded, so did output, influence, and global credibility.

That model powered corporate success and became central to India's export story. AI is reshaping that equation, shifting us from scaleled growth to intelligenceled growth. The future will

not be built by doing more of the same, but by reimagining how value is created. AI carries a powerful duality. It is both deflationary and expansive. It reduces cost, time, and effort through

automation while simultaneously unlocking new markets, industries, and As knowledge becomes commoditized, differentiation shifts. The real question is not whether disruption will

come but whether we will leave it lead it and I believe HLTech will lead it. We are evolving from a peoplecentric delivery model to an integrated system of software products, intelligent agents

and human expertise delivering outcomes at scale. This is more than just a business shift. It reflects a broader national ambition to build intellectual property that creates enduring

compounding value. India must move from being a tech services-led nation to an IPled nation. Services scale with effort. IP scales In the AI economy, value occurs to those

who build and own platforms, models and products, not just those who deploy them. That shift is not only economic, it is transformative. And this is not new for HCL or to HCL.

50 years ago in 1976, Shivnado founded HCL as one of India's earliest bootstrap technology startups. By 1978, India's first indigenous computer had been built and found a

place in many homes all over India. HCL was driven by a belief in building, not adopting. That belief, that DNA, those guts, that grit continues to guide HCL Techch even today. We are moving beyond

traditional delivery to a unified model where software, intelligence systems and human expertise operate as one, driving measurable, scalable outcomes. Alongside this shift, we are building

entirely new AI service lines. AI factory designs and manages next generation AI infrastructure. Physical AI brings intelligence into the real world where systems sense, understand,

act autonomously. Robots with embedded decision-m warehouses that optimize themselves and infrastructure that anticipates failure before it even occurs.

This reinvention will multiply opportunities, create new industries, new professions and avenues of employment for India's vast talent while expanding economic prosperity for the

nation. How do we make this transition? If AI will define not just companies but countries, then this is a strategic shift and it requires three decisive

moves. First, from scaleled growth to IPled value creation, IP compounds. It strengthens competitiveness, anchors strategic autonomy and ensures long-term economic resilience. Second, from

adopting to building, deployment matters, ownership transforms. Nations that build models, platforms, and software will define the era. India has the talent, the scale and the complexity

to be the ultimate test bed. Third, from fragmented effort to national AI Compute must be treated as digital publicruct infrastructure. Democratized compute can unlock innovation across

startups, universities, enterprises, and institutions. When compute is accessible, innovation decentralizes. When innovation decentralizes, IP multiplies. That is how an IP nation is

built. Not one by champion but by one an ecosystem. But ambition without purpose is incomplete. The true test of AI is not how fast it

scales but whom it serves. Responsible AI is not a feature. It is a foundation from awe to accountability. That is the journey. Speed is meaningless without control. Scale is unsustainable without

trust. Now at HCL, we have 226,000 HCL techies with an average age of 26 or 27, similar to the average age of our nation. So I talked to them.

You've been following the T20 World Cup. you'll know that India won by 61 runs on Saturday in Columbbo. What a match. And if you watched Ishan Kishin's innings, 77 of 40 balls, you saw something that

is a perfect analogy for AI. In T20 cricket, when a power hitter walks in and starts clearing the boundary from ball one, the captain doesn't take her fielders off the field. She resets the

field. Deeper on long on a sweeper on the leg side. Third man back. Every ball the field has to adapt. Not because the fielders are less important, but because the nature of the game has changed. The

batsman is hitting harder and faster than ever before. And the only way to compete is with smarter positioning, sharper reflexes, and better anticipation.

AI is the power hitter. It is clearing boundaries that used to require entire teams. But the game is not batsman versus nobody. AI is a team sport. Our job is to set the field to position our

nation where the ball is going, not where it was. To invest in the skills that AI cannot replicate. The ability to read the game, to anticipate, to make the judgment call in the moment that no

algorithm would risk. India is repositioning. HCL Tech is repositioning and the repositioning will be deliberate and it will be supported.

Let us commit to building AI that serves people, protects the planet and accelerates progress. I sound started with the sound of the decade. The hum of AI will define this

decade. But what the world would remember for centuries is the leadership who shaped it responsibly, wisely and with clarity. Thank you Miss Rashni Nad Malhotra for

your inspiring reflections and also for highlighting the transmotive role of artificial intelligence as well as the disruptive role of artificial intelligence drawing our attention to it

in shaping our future. to introduce the speakers for a ministerial conversation. The speakers in this fireside conversation is her excellency Sena

Lawson, Minister of Digital Transformation Togo, His Excellency Nar Patria, Vice Minister of Communications Indonesia, His Excellency Rafat Hindi, Minister of Communications Egypt.

Minister Lawson has made Togo one of Africa's most watched digital transformation stories, building mobile first government services that reach citizens who were previously entirely

excluded from the formal economy. Her work is a reminder that AI's greatest opportunities may lie in the global Minister Patria representing the world's fourth most populous nation and one of

Southeast Asia's fastest growing digital economies. His Excellency is navigating the complex challenge of building AI policy for a country of 270 million people spread across 17,000 islands.

Egypt is positioning itself as an AI hub for the Arab world and Africa and Minister Hindi is leading that change. With a young population and growing digital infrastructure, Egypt's

ambitions are both compelling and instructive for developing nations navigating the AI transition. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to invite our speakers. Please with a big round of

applause I would like to request you to please welcome the minister from Togo from Indonesia and also from Egypt. I request our honorable dignitaries to kindly take

your place on this stage and this conversation is being moderated by Miss Djani Kosh. Distinguished fellow Niti Aayok I request Miss D Jani Kosh to kindly join us.

AI Summit is a place where everybody looks forward to such ministerial conversations and this is one such conversation that everybody is looking forward to because

when we say that this is the first ever AI summit which is being organized in a country of global south it makes a difference and here we have very elite panel with us

her excellency Cena Lawson Minister of Digital Transformation Togo is going to join us his excellency Nazar Patria vice minister of communications Indonesia his excellency Rafat Hindi, Minister of

Communications Egypt. We are expecting our other guests to join us very soon as Miss Djani Kosh, distinguished fellow Niti Aayog is going to moderate this conversation and this will also give us

an insight into the countries of global south, how they are adopting artificial intelligence, what are the challenges before them and how the world has to come together. This global cooperation

is needed so that nobody is left out of the touch of artificial intelligence, the benefits of artificial intelligence. And that's when honorable prime minister says it's AI for all. This is what we

mean that it should reach each and every person of the continent of the world and AI should bring a change into the people of global south too. only then we can say that we are going moving ahead in

the right direction. So keeping that in mind ladies and gentlemen this ministerial conversation is going to be of uh utmost importance when we talk of AI impact summit because this

conversation will also bring to the four those points on the basis of which we can say that AI is making an impact into the lives of people especially the people of global south and when we talk

of the challenges the difficulties which face Indians our countrymen that is the time when we can say that if you are able to find low cost AI solutions to our problems. They will also be the

solutions which can be adopted very very easily by the other countries of the global south. So here we are bringing to you this ministerial conversation. Our guests are here and this elite panel

from these countries from Congo, Egypt and Indonesia will bring to bring before us those aspects on which they've already been working the challenges which they think they need uh

cooperation from other countries as well. if they want to counter these challenges because when you talk of global south ladies and gentlemen unless global south develops unless global

south adopts artificial intelligence it cannot bring a change in the world and that is what this summit aims at that we must impact the lives of common men nobody should be left behind and when we

say this we say servan hitai servan sukai which means it's AI for all everybody Everybody should be benefited. So ladies and gentlemen, please welcome our elite

panelists. Here we have her excellency Cena Lawson, Minister of Digital Transformation Togo. Please welcome her. His Excellency Nazar Patria, Vice Minister of Communications Indonesia and

His Excellency Rafat Hindi, Minister of Communications Egypt. It's over to you Miss Djanikosh. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you very much and good afternoon everyone and thank you to all

of those who are here. Um so we are all finally here and I as you can see this is truly a very powerp packed panel. So since this is about um the impact summit the AI impact summit and since we are

gathered from all over the world to talk about the creation of impact by AI I want to first start with you uh Mr. Petra um you know when you think about the journey that we've had till now the

global community has had till now with AI a lot of the focus has been on building the infrastructure so how do you think we have really done on putting that infrastructure to work to create

impact if you had to rate it on a scale of 1 to 10 what would you give the world what score would you give the world &gt;&gt; uh thank Thank you, Vani. Uh, this is really a challenging questions actually.

Um, if I had to give a number, uh, I would give six. &gt;&gt; Six &gt;&gt; out of 10.

&gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Why six? Because um well if we talk about the emerging technologies like artificial intelligence is

it is the words like a buzz like a mantra right now everyone talking about uh AI and AI right now is here is with us and many people they do they don't scrutinize anymore

about the useful of uh AI they just use but the problem is the level of adoption &gt;&gt; of uh this technology this emerging technology especially for the global s

countries like Indonesia and maybe some of uh African countries Asian countries um we still have a digital gap &gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; uh especally Especially for Indonesia,

we are archipilago country. We are aripilagic. So we have seven 17,000s islands. We have a big uh five big islands in Indonesia. And each island have a very unique uh characteristic,

very unique uh people, culture and so on. And the infrastructure is the telecommunication infrastructure is very very important for our country that unite our country with this uh uh

telecommunication infrastructure. We uh try to improve we try to cover all of the archipilago by our uh telecommunications uh network. And now the internet

penetrations uh into the population is already about uh 80% um our population right now is 250 million peoples. And now what we do with

these uh infrastructures uh digital infrastructure or telecom telecommunication infrastructures we want meaningful connectivity. Yeah. That's it. uh meaningful

connectivity that means how we use this connectivity with the uh emerging technologies like uh artificial intelligent on top of these infrastructure to give benefit to the

people. So government try to be the uh accelerator to build this meaningful connectivity &gt;&gt; Now that's very well said. So six out of 10 and the main gap or the main reason

is we still have miles to go before everyone has access and access has to be meaningful. Right. I think that's that's that's very well said. Uh Miss Lawson, would you agree with that or would you

have a different take on that? &gt;&gt; I Hello everyone. Good afternoon. Yes, I do agree. Absolutely. I think that um when we talk about AI for for us at least Africans it's it's not about the

technology it's it's about what we can do with it and so uh so few comments number one is that in terms of AI talent uh the African continent represents less than 1% worldwide

uh in terms of infrastructure we also have challenges you know a lot of the uh a lot of countries uh don't have connected uh um schools or hospitals. So we are still building our

connectivity. Um and I I would say that um but if you look at few examples few achievement that we we had using AI in terms of impact we can see that even today it's

uh equal to nine out of 10. So every time we implement it in our way solving our problems then the number comes you know closer to 10 than than than anything.

I would also say that um the African Union position was to use artificial intelligence in real life use cases. So the impact uh for for us and the sectors the priority sectors are uh government

uh infrastructure and and the way we function it's health education agriculture. So I think that if we succeed to implement AI in those sectors then our continent will change forever.

I I really like that the fact that you brought out three very important mission critical sectors rather than saying we need to go and do all thing everything but I think that priority is so

important and by the way part of the seven working groups that was there under the AI summit uh one of the working groups which I had the privilege of co-chairing along with Indonesia and

Netherland was economic impact and social development and one of the things we decided that's needed right now to accelerate impact is a creation of AI commons that brings together best

practices knowhow so that was one of the key outcome of of part of the working groups that we launched uh Mr. Hendi, if I may come to you. Um, when we talk about impact, one thing we realize is it

means so many different things to so many different people. Can you give us an example of something that you believe is is truly um um a northstar with respect to how impact has been created,

right? A great example of how impact has been created. &gt;&gt; Yes, thank you. uh in Egypt, the most meaningful uh impact uh AI um has been in expanding the access uh to the

essential public services uh such as health care and education uh in a large scale and at nationwide. uh we uh we are using AI tools for early detection for breast cancer and some uh

diabetics related uh conditions and we are now launching uh a new tool a powerful tool for AI for AI powerful tool for education uh support uh to be used uh in high school with high school

student and teacher across the country. um for the first time uh uh advanced medical screening and learning support uh uh become available for underserved community. We usually have uh uh uh able

to do it in big city and uh in uh elite institution but now we are able uh to do it uh with uh with underserved community. Uh three made this possible in Egypt. uh a government first approach

that put uh public interest first and uh sovereignty AI capability uh that reflect our language and our local uh need. Uh also the global the strong partnership uh happen between across the

government and uh national AI ecosystem and the global partners. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Uh Mr. Patria, any good example that you would like to share of impact creation in Indonesia or any

other country that you think has done a really good job of it? Uh well uh we yeah I will share one one example from from Indonesia. Um

how this uh artificial intelligence can can uh helps. So we because we are very diverse uh uh nation and also archipelago country. So sometimes in the public services for

for instance a healthcare we need um uh effective and efficient uh technology adoptions to help these healthcare um uh sectors.

So now we try to uh to to encourage our uh young generation that build the startup and um we try to facilitate them in what what what he call is a AI innovation hub and one of their product

is try to help doctors in the remote area to to to diagnostic the tuber tuberculosis um the the tuberculosis or TBC um is

is coming uh you know on the stage and and it it becomes very difficult for the doctors in the urban area to detect because they have a very limited uh access on the uh modern equipment or

sophisticated technology uh to detect this uh uh diseases but with the artificial intelligence. So this uh startup tried to gather all the big data uh from the uh uh health center

in the remote areas and then uh make a simple program and give it to the doctors and combine with the X-ray machine and they can uh it can help uh doctors to the uh to identify whether

this is TBC or this is just uh um ordinary lung problems. So uh I see the this these initiatives in the certain sectors already copied to other sectors for the

education for the agriculture. many startups try to adopt this uh AI technology right now and I I I can see and we can feel that the enthusiasms is really really high but the problem we

need as a government as a policy maker we need to to give the safeguard and to accelerate in building this uh healthy and fair ecosystem to uh to to boost the innovation on artificial intell

&gt;&gt; fantastic Okay. Uh, Miss Lawson, any favorite impact story that you want to share? &gt;&gt; Uh, yes. I have a a great impact story. During the the pandemic,

uh, we were able to use AI to prioritize the beneficiaries for our financial aid program. So, uh, at the height of the pandemic, uh, we built a program to distribute

cash using mobile phones, right? So the uh the question then was how do you prioritize beneficiaries? We started in 2020 and um in 2020 we we didn't know if the pandemic was going to last for a

long time. So we had one certainty which was that we needed to be super efficient in prioritizing who needed the money the most. And so we used uh two AI algorithms. one uh applied to satellite

imagery we drew uh the poverty map of Togo and then another uh based on machine learning with uh telecom uh meta data we were able to uh isolate the phone numbers of people who were yeah so

so that was really our first major experience using AI and then after the pandemic the question for us was we want this to be sustainable, right? How do you because it was during the pandemic,

we had a partnership with Berkeley. So, we were working really figuring out things as they were coming. But afterwards, we wanted to build capabilities inhouse. So we now have

within the ministry of uh public sector efficiency a team of 25 people data scientists and we support other branches of government because when we talk you know here we talk about AI and everybody

really knows what AI is and the type of applications that you know things we can do with AI but a lot of people don't know so it's very important to have a team of people who work say with the

ministry of agriculture or the ministry of environment and producing images or and and and really data that can help these ministries improve policies. So I think this is this is a great learning

experience for us. It's applying AI to improve policies. &gt;&gt; It's such a such a brilliant example because one it impacts the grassroots. Yes.

&gt;&gt; Right. the people who need it the most and second it's you know government has a lot of I mean especially in the global south a lot of government usage is um augmentation of services

&gt;&gt; I think what you're doing is really enabling better development of policies and that's that I would in fact request you to please share this &gt;&gt; case study so we can put it in the AI

comments that we have built so I would really request you to do that u in fact the next question is also to you miss Lawson which is as government what do you think is the biggest roadblock to

scaling impact creation where it can reach population is it data is it infrastructure is it regulation or is it even geopolitical dynamics &gt;&gt; so I think it's a combination of various

things we're tackling all all of these things but but first it's infrastructure because that's the starting point okay but you also have something when I was referring to the data lab a lot of

people don't know this this universe exist right that you can apply you know you can use AI to to to gather information as to when you want to design a a a new infrastructure like an

itinerary for example when we build our fiber optics network we we use satellite imagery and so on but a lot of people just don't know it exists right so they can't ask the they don't know which

question to ask right and so even if we're there so we do a lot of outreach within government going and saying look this is what we were able to do using AI and so on so I think that uh what I

would call institutional capacity is a roadblock because people just don't know so it's a lot of training required the other thing is um and I think it's it's also um one thing that we've been

working on is right now AI is in French or English right it's not in uh it's not we have in Togo we have 42 languages and dialects and for AI to to if we want massive AI adoption we need to be able

to provide these models in local languages so that's one very important aspect of what we've been up to &gt;&gt; 42 languages &gt;&gt; wow

&gt;&gt; and dialects you know I'm I'm sure that uh yeah &gt;&gt; yeah yeah that's &gt;&gt; so so that's that's the challenge but that's also the opportunity Because when

you think about creating impact for AI, think of education. Imagine, and that's what I imagine, imagine a world where every school children has an AI tutor, &gt;&gt; right?

&gt;&gt; Being able to explain to them um you know, math and science in local languages in their own dialects. That's for me the power of AI really. &gt;&gt; So beautifully said. Um so institutional

capacity is one of the biggest roadblocks that you see. Uh Mr. Pedra, is there anything you want to add to that? Um in terms of the biggest roadblocks to

mass scale uh impact creation. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Uh I agree with colleagues from Togo. Um I think it's the the problem today uh for the global soft countries like um Indonesia and I think uh some of

uh African countries and other Asan countries is now we are facing the geopolitical condition that you mentioned uh is really a challenging times today

&gt;&gt; um &gt;&gt; because We we are facing asymmetric uh uh uh conditions amongst global swords and global north and that's one problem because the

platformizations the the dominance of the platform is u so um important yeah to to to to define or to determine the the progress of the um fair ecosystem in one countries.

place that the first thing and the second one I think the uh infrastructure is one of the critical things that we need to to to pay attention we need to

improve we need to um heighten the the the standard of uh services uh on this uh infrastructure and then regulations I think regulation is also uh very important in this sense because uh

&gt;&gt; do we overregulate No, no, no. We don't we don't we we don't intend to heavily regulated this uh uh AI sectors because we try to balance uh protections and also

innovations. Um that most important I think if you heavily regarded so no innovations at all. &gt;&gt; That's I cannot agree more. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So yeah, we try to balance and the

most important the last thing that the most important I think um we need to improve our research and development and then attract the investment to uh support this innovations and to nurtures

our digital talent that the most important that we have uh do in the short term. extremely well said and I think between the two of you really captured it while infrastructure is

always important and you always want to you want more compute you want to build it out but if you don't have institutional capacity then investment in that infrastructure will not give you

the returns and regulation needs to help innovation needs to help scale and R&amp;D is absolutely critical so I think these are brilliant points I know our time is up so my last question and I would

request all three of you to answer. If we look at the next 5 years, the future, how should AI success be measured? Today we are primarily looking at how many models we are building, how big are the

models, how should we be looking at AI success, what's the northstar? I'll start with you, Mr. Hendi. &gt;&gt; If I have to choose, uh now uh uh it would be this uh the percentage of

people that have access. Wonderful &gt;&gt; to high qual quality AI enabled &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Not the number of model, not the compute. Uh um the people benefits is

the most important. They have to benefit from health care, from education, from agriculture and government. And the KPI matter for three reasons actually. First, it shifts the focus from

technology to people. And AI is advancing very fast but access to it is not that fast. We need to make sure this happened and this what I can see for 2030 maybe for for AI. Second it

exposes the global gaps not hiding them. &gt;&gt; So gaps in compute that gaps in infrastructure in local language models. Uh so this is very important. The third one is it's framing AI as a development

tool not a dominant tool where compute power is shared and public service is pritoriized. I think this what I &gt;&gt; fantastic forward. Yeah.

&gt;&gt; So success is not the size of models or the size of your compute infrastructure but how many lives we are able to change and are we able to do that in a way that no one is left behind. Right. It's

inclusive. Brilliant. Um anything you all want to add any different thought Mr. Petra and then Miss Lawson. &gt;&gt; Um yeah just a very short on this. Um I just want to add three more

&gt;&gt; but the the first one I think is similar like college from Egypt. Um in the next five years AI should be accessible &gt;&gt; that the first one and the second one for the global south countries AI must

solve the problem. that that the most important and the third one I think AI need to be trust um trusted yeah need to be trusted so it need to comply with the transparency and

accountability uh standard so no more AI deficit people yeah so because uh people have a good awareness on this uh AI uh product especially generative AI like AI defect or synthetic reality that

produced by the uh these AI machines. So I think that that three points we can uh uh give mark whether this AI workable in the society or it's become a disaster to the society. I cannot agree more with

you on all three, but I think the one that is most important is trust because if it's not trustworthy, it'll never be adopted. It'll never be used. So, I think that is brilliant. Brilliant

point. Uh Miss Lawson, the last words to you. Um I would echo what uh what has been said and for me success would be if five years from now every tool is one phone call away from um to access any

public services right um and so that's how I'm going personally I'm going to measure success for uh with regards to AI in in Togo because then it talks to the people right because um So far we've

been talking about digital transformation which was really going from paper to screen but what is going to be a real gamecher is if I can talk to the machine and the machine can reply

and so on. So so that's one thing and obviously the the comment about trust is a very important one. Um we are a very young continent. uh half of the African population is less than 18 years old and

75% is less than 35 and so it's very important for us to have a trusted you know AI infrastructure and and so on and so there's a lot of work that we need to do we didn't mention to have also

standards and platform for data exchange which is going to be extremely crucial in our relationship with um you know the global north. So these are really important issues that we need to tackle

if you want um to be successful 5 years from now. I think that's that's very very well put and uh you know this was this was ladies and gentlemen and you know such a powerful discussion because

what's coming out of it is how this despite all the differences between countries I think governments today are thinking very similarly about artificial intelligence it success again is not

about the size of your infrastructure but about how many lives changed and in order to scale transformation of lives. You need to ensure your technology is trustworthy. You need to ensure it's

inclusive by design. You need to invest in capacity development, innovation. And it's fantastic to see everyone thinking along the same lines because it really brings to for the importance of

collective action and collaboration and I think that's what has come out of this summit. So with that, thank you to all three of you and please give them a huge round of applause. Thank you.

Ladies and gentlemen, I thank our elite panelists who were a part of this Her Excellency Miss Choo, his excellency Nazar Patria, His

Excellency Rafat Hindi, honorable ministers from Togo, from Indonesia and from Egypt. And I thank Miss Djani Kosh for moderating this And now I would like to invite Mr. Lass

Richard, executive vice president and chief technology officer, NXP Semiconductors. As we all know, artificial intelligence runs on chips. And last, Reger is at the

frontier of designing the semiconductors that will power the next generation of edge AI in cars, in medical devices, in industrial systems. NXP's work on secure, efficient, realworld AI hardware

is essential to everything on the stage. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the chief technology officer of NXP Semiconductors, Mr. Lass Reger.

&gt;&gt; Namaste. Hello everyone and uh thanks for having me here. Um when we are talking about AI at the moment there is a lot of talk about how do we pump AI in big data

centers? How are we energize these big data centers? But very honestly there is a lot of questions. What is this AI for? What is this AI at all doing? And if I'm looking at my own lifespan I'm coming

from an analog world was born in the 1970s. Then there was some heavy digitization in there over the last 20 years when someone stuffed a laptop into a mobile phone uh and we called it

smartphone. So we had a data display device. We could run topics that were on demand. So on demand I need a pizza, I need an Uber, I need to switch on the climate control in my house. And now my

Markcom people would say lass we are entering a phase of the world that anticipates and automates. And this little world that anticipates and automates is driving mega trends

around us. And these mega trends are unchanged over the last 15 years. We have demographics changes. We have infrastructure upgrades. We have supply chain constraints. We have renewable and

we have energy constraints. So out of all of these drivers, what is this modern world that anticipates and automates able to do for us? Well, jumping forward maybe 20 years. How is

the cocoon that I'm living in going to look like? I will have a shelter. I will have my house and that house is totally barrierfree. That house will check about my health,

my wealth, will protect me. I can enter and I can leave without touching anything. No one else can do the same and my pro uh property is protected very seamlessly. No

barriers for me but maximum safety and security. How will be my manufacturing landscape look like? Well, most of the manual tasks are gone. I need better education

and I'm maybe the most advanced equipment operator in the world. Look at airplane pilots 70 years ago. There were guys my size. These type of muscles and arms were flying in thunderstorms. Real

heroes, mechanical pilots. Today we have more pilots but they are all genders, shapes and sizes because they are

operating flying intelligent robots. So when I come from Germany here to India, a pilot mechanically has to work for 30 seconds at the end of the runway, pull up the plane and all the rest is

happening already today autonomously. And that's going to get better in the industrial world and of course also in the transportation world. How are cars going to look like in 20 years?

Well, they are rolling cocoons, rolling robots, and these cars are rolling living rooms. You have seen this during the COVID pandemics in China, for example. A lot of people used their cars

as their office extensions. Too many people in the in the house at home, the kids were too noisy. you go to these type of places. So you have a rolling cocoon again that is anticipating and

automating what you want to do, what you want to achieve. And what does this all have in common? I mean most of the people are asking me now, okay, last nice you are predicting

that there is 50 billion of these smart connected robots out there in 10 years from now. But they have so different form factors. What does that mean? Well, simple answer, they have all the same

ingredients. Each of these little robots has to sense its environment. So what's happening around me? Has to connect to the cloud to get the data. Last wants to drive from here to Mumbai. How is the

traffic situation? Getting the information from the web. And then you start thinking of a smart advice. This is where AI comes into the play. At that moment, you have to think of what is my

best advice to the arms and legs to my robot and whether these arms and legs are an automotive powertrain and a steering wheel is a manufacturing arm or is the wireless connection to my climate

control from my smart thermostatate. I don't care. Sense, think, connect, act are the ingredients for every of these 50 50 billion robots. Now the only thing is that all is nothing if you cannot

trust your device. Because if your fridge starts ordering 500 liters of milk for the next weekend, you go shopping alone. If your car does erratic driving, you start driving manually

again. And if your terate sets your house on 50° centigrade and your flowers are dried out and your cat is dead, you go organizing it all manually again. So trust is the essence.

And how does a nerd like me define trust? That's very simple. This is functional safety. Like in automotive, make sure that your braking system never ever fails. And make sure that your

connected device, your car or whatsoever is never ever being hacked. And then you can trust your device. You can be sure that it doesn't turn against you. So these underlying levels make

sure that you are energy efficient because otherwise you cannot be battery powered. Make sure that you are trustworthy so safe and secure and then make sure that

you can sense, think, connect and act and you can build every robot in the world and that is of course interesting for a semiconductor maker because for us volume matters in these semiconductor

chips. Now you will ask me yeah but last we have so long already these discussions on autonomous vehicles in 2018 uh the entire press community thought in 2020

my kids are going to the kindergarten without a steering wheel and without me autonomously that did not happen. Why? Because we have designed these robots wrong. And how do you design the robots

right? Well try to copy from nature that normally works. And here on stage is a 90 kilo bag of water with a couple of bones or in other words a biological robot and that robot has a certain

architecture. That robot has different layers. That robot has a realtime system highly functional safe and that is my spine. And if I stumble the reflexes in my spine tell me already straighten your

leg in real time highly undisturbed very very fast. No AI, not big AI, very deterministic system. Then I have in green my cerebellum that is working also in a highly functional safe environment

for heartbeat, stomach control, stability control. I can stand here and stand in a stable way because only the blue part is trying to find out what is the next sentence that I'm firing

towards you. and green and orange are working to manage the infrastructure in a functional safe way that is standing here in front of you. So why don't we copy these approaches into vehicles,

into cars, into houses, into planes again? Well, there simple architectural constraints and building blocks that we need and we need to scale. But how big does the AI really have to be? So that

AI in these systems can be comparatively tiny. If you're talking about transportation robots and how these transportation robots should look like, well, look at intelligent transportation

robots, insects, for example. These insects have a 100,000 neurons and an ant is already a very, very nice, very sexy transportation device. It's not as intelligent as a human being with 90

billion neurons but for most of the tasks it is also not needed in this way and Ashini Vishnar said it very nicely in Davos 80% of the AI tasks around us will be on very tiny efficient and and

very very tailormade models at the famous edge so in the end devices and this is what we are designing for so in Other words, NXP is trying to building all these Lego blocks where you

can start scaling small, medium and large devices. You have these devices here. This is for example, sorry, the very small device. This is a complete drone control unit that also flies with

AI artificial intelligence and reaches targets not only remote control but is operating the entire drone and is finding via via the camera its way. What I have here is an IndiMade AI

accelerator from Kinara and Hydroat that NXP has acquired. This is carrying 10 billion parameters in a large language model. So it is not as big as CH GPT but the combination of those two systems

carries a large language model and operates an intelligent system at the edge for a power consumption of seven watts. So in other words, you can build these type of plug-in combinations

and you have a system for example at a computer tomograph that is taking my entire X-ray pictures and is writing the doctoral report that is operating at my fridge

and tells me how many bottles of milk are missing. You do not have to have it always on and always operational. So these seven watts are only consumed the moment where the

fridge tries to find out what is missing and then you can go to sleep again. That is the answer for this global quest of how many nuclear power plants do we need when we send one question to chat GPT

and that is what the edge is going to solve for all of us. But beyond all of that we are always talking about AI and the brain structure of these robots. Most of the cars that have created

fatalities in the last 10 years, these autonomous vehicles didn't create these fatalities on the roads because they had a bug in the brain structure. They created these

issues because they were more short-sighted than I. So, wouldn't it be great to have these robots with superhero senses? Wouldn't it be

great if these robots out there would have telepathic capabilities? I do not need to touch anything, but the stuff around me is arranging like Dumbledore. One move of the magic wand,

everything is arranged. Wouldn't it be great to know what is ahead of your line of sight? Like Yoda, telepathy. Wouldn't it be great to have x-ray vision like Superman? You look in rain,

in snow, and in fog, what is around you? Wouldn't it be great for the very old ones amongst us to be like a hitchhiker's guide through galaxy? You have one bubble fish that you plug into

your ear and you understand the entire universe, every language that is spoken. A German can understand Hindi without a big barrier in between. And wouldn't it be great if our robots would have better

ears than Daredevil or an in real life and would be able to hear what is being spoken out there in the outer ranks. If we would have that, then the driving robot that replaces Lass

is way better than Lass the driver himself. But I am the entry ticket for driving 250 kilometers an hour on the left lane of a German highway with my car. Now you

think we cannot have that for our robots next to this little bit of AI that we need. Well, let me tell you, we have it already. We have ultra wideband technology that is opening gates and car

keys from my watch to everything around me. I have car to car communication over more than one mile of distance in 3 milliseconds. I can immediately tell the device there is an ambulance rushing

into the crossroads. Switch the traffic lights to green for that ambulance and to red for me. Telepathy. We have radar systems over 300 meters that see two persons sitting like you next to each

other and we can detect them in rain in snow and in fog. We have meta standards. So the English for smart connected devices where is a common language in place and all devices are talking to

each other. The home gateway is talking to the window blinders is talking to the solar cell management. This is the entry tickets for this democratization of AI functionality and for the entrance of

these tiny devices here with a little bit of AI a lot of functional safe and secure architectures to building the right devices. And what we have done with a little bit of AI and a couple of

microphones in cars, we can take with the incar microphones the sound in a way that we hear a bicycle bell behind the cars and we can easily detect whether there is vulnerable road users for

example behind the cars. We can do this in any other settings as well, but automotive is there a very nice one. So in other words, where are we at the moment? When I'm talking to my fellow

nerds and the and the semiconductor researchers, it is not about AI alone. It is how you can build systems that you absolutely can trust. How can you go low power? And

then the key question, how big does the brain has to be? And the answer is somewhere between 100,000 and 100 billion neurons. Beyond all of that there is very very interesting

questions that we have to solve and where India is deeply with the Europeans in research and in the activities. How do we make the wiring harnesses lighter? How do we battery operate all of that?

how we are sensing in the right way. How do we think? So all of these separate topics and to not make it too nerdy and too complex, all of these silicons here are

driving then these form factors. A lot of people are only talking about humanoids and sorry to say humanoids are the tiny fraction of robots because why should a a robot look like a human

being? I mean that only makes sense in a very human environment climbing stairs or whatsoever. Otherwise you have robots that looking like ultrasonic uh devices that are looking like like uh uh infant

monitor devices on on the neonatlogy stations in hospitals. There is no need to look like me. But all of this we are equipping already with silicon in the 100 thousands today

and the ingredients are always the same. And just to get this pitch here down on the on the runway to say it in the drone language, what do you need to do? What do we need to work on? What does the

industry do at the moment? Well, in a very simple way, we are working on safe and secure architectures that are ultra low power, ultra energy efficient.

again otherwise this dream of 50 billion smart connected devices will not work because these 50 billion smart connected devices need three times the energy that mother earth can provide. So that is the

absolute must for these markets to come into play. Then what we need to work on is we have to push the boundaries the envelope of physics and we are doing we are sensing better than human beings in

the meantime. And then what we need to do it's just a simple game that semiconductors have done since 50 years now. We need to scale in the right way. So we need to

build these little Lego bricks and say okay here is a complete drone control unit that you can fly autonomously. You want to fly with large language models and very very smart AI slalom between

the trees. Plug this little dongle in and you have everything on board that you can do. And the same you can do for building control systems with manuals. You can do this for any form factor that

you like and that is what we are doing at the moment while the AI net um models are getting much much more efficient smaller and we carry them here. So my pitch is when PM Moody says

he wants to bring AI to everyone. This is the answer. The answer is not data centers. They will exist. But the democratization of AI and equipping everyone in Togo as we heard earlier or

in India or in Germany with the right levels of AI that create the world that anticipate and automates. The answer lies at the famous edge in the end device. Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Thank you Mr. Lasser for sharing your deep insights into the various aspects related to the semiconductors and artificial intelligence. Ladies and gentlemen, I would now like to invite on

stage speakers for our next remarkable panel discussion. I would like to invite our esteemed speakers, Her Excellency Paula Bogante, Zamura, Minister of Science and Technology, Costa Rica. His

Excellency Omar Alama, Minister of State for AI, United Arab Emirates. Mr. Shiram Krishnan, Senior Policy Adviser for AI, White House. This discussion will be moderated by Dr. Samir Sarin, President

Observer Research Foundation. Could I please request our esteemed panelist to kindly come on the stage? Good afternoon. We'll we have 20 minutes and we have a fantastic panel here. So,

I'm going to dive straight into the conversations. Um, we've been here through the day and we've heard a few ideas and and propositions and I'm going to basically ask each one of you uh to

elaborate from your vantage points uh on some of those propositions. The first of course would be what does impact and diffusion mean where you sit? The opportunity and the challenges of AI uh

are of course different and differentially experienced. So from your vantage point what does impact mean from your national perspective and a global perspective and of course the diffusion

opportunity and maybe I can start with Shiram the diffusion opportunity uh that we are sitting on today. &gt;&gt; Uh thank you for having me uh it's such an honor to be here uh I want to uh

congratulate uh you know prime minister Modi and everyone for just having this fantastic event and it's been such a privilege uh to be here these last few days. I know we have 20 minutes. I'll

keep this very short. U with the Trump administration when we got into office about uh 13 months ago, we desired uh President Trump immediately chartered us with coming up with an AI action plan.

Um and it came from a sense of posit positivity and optimism when it comes to AI. And in July last year, we c we set three priorities for what we believe uh America should follow. one, we want to

build infrastructure. So, President Trump has done a lot of work on making sure uh we can build data centers. We making sure that we build grid capacity, making sure that you know we can build

infrastructure while at the same time um without having regular Americans see their power uh and energy bills go up. So, that's infrastructure. There's a lot more there, but you know, in the

interest of time, I'll just keep going. Number two is innovation. uh at the heart of AI are amazing entrepreneurs and builders a lot of whom uh you saw on stage here uh this morning and we want

to be uh sure that they can continue building these amazing models and applications and um chips and uh everything else they do. So we've been doing a lot of work there and I think

most essentially we've been trying to make sure they're not encumbered by red tape and bureaucracy. So, President Trump signed uh an executive order in December uh which tries to stop ownorous

legislation from getting in the way of innovation. And third is we want to share this technology with our allies and the rest of the world. uh whether it is our advanced chips from Nvidia or AMD

or uh Google or whether it be uh the models and applications on top, we want to share our technology with our partners all over the world and we've been spending a lot of time on that. So

that's those are the three things that we have been focused on. &gt;&gt; Great. Um Minister Alama, let me turn to you again. A powerhouse in the region, powerhouse globally now. AI a big

feature of your government, a big priority in the bilateral as well between UAE and India. How do you see the opportunity minister uh in terms of both uh the the ability to to empower

your own people but also and region but also others around the world the role UAE can play here. Thank you very much and um I must say that it's very impressive to see India

convene the world on such an important subject like artificial intelligence and also hearing uh his excellency prime minister Modi this morning emphasized how India wants to not just be a

champion for the global south but the champion for transparent AI the champion for open-source systems and that is reassuring especially in a world where we have halves and have nots

&gt;&gt; and if I'm going to reflect that on the UAE we are a country that is blessed to be part of the halves right we are a country that has infrastructure that is able to build artificial intelligence

and that is able to diffuse it across society so if you look at Microsoft's AI diffusion uh report the UAE ranks first globally locally in the UAE the main focus is AI for quality of life

improvement uh if you look at it some countries are looking for economic gains others are looking for political advantages we are looking for quality of life improvement because we believe that

this will translate into every other domain in the future. If you look at externally, we were at a certain point of time in our history have not. So we were a country that wasn't as rich as it

was pre- oil and in that we understand the need to give back and the need to invest alongside and the need to create with others and you see that the UAE played a big role in building data

centers and empowering people with AI literacy and you know being able to use AI across Africa, Latin America and many other continents as well and I think we're going to continue to do that.

&gt;&gt; Now Minister I want to ask you one short question. You were the first minister of AI in the world. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Uh like do you have bragging rights now?

Like does everyone come and like bow to you and and &gt;&gt; actually you know what saddens me is I expected by 2026 that every country will have minister of AI and we still haven't

gotten to that point yet. &gt;&gt; But but thank you and and I know that Minister Al Lama became a minister before he did his military service. So that's something all of us should think

about. Um you they picked the right man for the right job. So I think well done to the leadership in UAE. Minister Zamura um another small country another beautiful country uh again another

country that could really transform itself using the power of AI and of course there are there are headwinds that you need to encounter. So from your vantage point how do you assess this

opportunity this challenge um perhaps this transformative engine? So the the one thing is that we need to you know talk about and and have clear for everyone to understand is that the

reality from countries that have like your excellency was saying is way different from the ones that have not right or don't have &gt;&gt; we I come from a small country 5.2 2

million people which is laughable from India standards uh small economy one of the smallest countries in Latin America and we have done a lot of things better than other Latin American countries but

truth of the matter is depending on who do you compare we're way lower than we or we have much more to improve than what we thought we had to do AI has one of the things that AI is bringing to up

to our attention is we have to do a diagnosis as where do you stand on the road of improvement, economy improvement and you have to face reality in the sense of this is where you need to focus

on and that's what AI is bringing up to our attention. So, and this is a homework that every country must be doing. What needs to do, what needs to happen next is the countries that are

way ahead of the others, they need to look at us and say, "How do we help you with the AI implementation?" And by the way, what do I mean by that? 70% of 190 plus countries have implemented 5G.

&gt;&gt; You cannot think of AI without 5G. So what are we doing to hug the countries that are still launching or you know have 4G within their uh &gt;&gt; networks

&gt;&gt; right? Uh what are they doing? How can we help them? When we started working on an AI strategy, four countries out of 33 Latin American Caribbean countries had an AI strategy. Four out of 33. So what

did we do? We spoke with the OECD. We're working on an AI toolkit toolkit to help every country understand where do they stand. So again, what is AI bringing doing to us? It's bringing to our

attention where do you stand in the AI race and what do you need to do to keep improving? Uh but we're not going to be able to get to the ideal point unless the countries that are ahead of us look

behing AI solutions. You you rais a very important point. How is global cooperation going to play out in this domain? How are partnerships going to

serve humanity? I think that's one of the key principle conversations we want at this forum. Right? So let me ask you, let me start the second round with you on what is the kind of multilateralism

that is likely to emerge and how can countries with 5 million population but by the way let me just tell you minister between India and Costa Rica together we are 1.5 billion people. So don't worry

it's big numbers so we will negotiate together. Now uh my question to you is how what kind of multilateralism is going to work for for countries such as yourselves? Is it going to be through a

regional grouping basis? Is it going to be through like-minded countries? How is the multilateral arrangement of the future going to look like? &gt;&gt; I think a little bit of both. You know

you said India and Costa Rica. Let's talk about Latin America and the Caribbean. If we combine all 33 countries, we're talking 650 million people. Then the number sounds

attractive, right? So I do think that we need to like-minded countries get together within regions and start negotiating or deciding what the path is going to be. And we can do it with

countries from other regions, say Asia and Costa Rica or Africa and Latin America, not Costa Rica. The truth of the matter is we're sharing some common problems. some countries, small

economies for example, what do we need to do to make sure that we keep moving forward and we call the attention on the countries that are you know in the upper floors let's say

&gt;&gt; catch their attention right Minister Alama you've been in this forever so tell me how is the world government summit and the big events that you host how do you think partnerships are going

to emerge in this particular technology domain in this highly polarized world people are being forced to choose how do we retain the ability to be able to build bridges across.

&gt;&gt; So this has evolved as a discussion and things have changed drastically over the past 9 years u since I was appointed. Historically, no one was talking about um you know trying to confidentially uh

keep what they have for themselves and not discuss it with others or trying to create groups um of you know influence whether it's on the left or on the right. But with the advent of LLMs and

very powerful AI systems that can do things that historically were not even uh seen to be possible in the next 10 or 20 years, we're seeing a shift in narrative. The UAE's approach has always

been the world needs a convenor. The world needs a place where you can have dialogue. And I think you know what is going to harm the world is ensuring that there isn't dialogue and there are

silos. Even at the height of the cold war, there were dialogues on nuclear proliferation. There were dialogues on the dangers of nuclear weapons. And there were countries like Switzerland at

the time where the world could come and talk about what is acceptable and what is unacceptable. And we believe that the UAE can play that role. It can convene the world. It can come and put the

topics of importance. And it can ensure as well that we can magnify the voices not just of the countries in our region but as our excellency the minister said countries in Latin America and the

Caribbean countries that today are unrepresented in this dialogue. &gt;&gt; Um you know we attend the G20 meetings and there was a process on the Hiroshima Accords on AI and on in that you can see

it was only the 20 countries or 25 countries that were there. &gt;&gt; The AI dialogue needs to be a global one. It cannot be one that is limited to one geography or one set of countries.

&gt;&gt; You know, let me take from a US perspective, from a Trump administration perspective, you are investing in building partnerships, whether it is a critical minerals group or the pacilica

that that's gained much currency in recent conversations. How is multilateralism of the future for you? Um before I get to that, I think I want to emphasize something which uh his

excellency the minister mentioned a moment ago which is uh Prime Minister Modi just outlined a totally compelling vision for what AI can mean to all of humanity and uh and I think and I think

it was so compelling in so many themes and I also want to particularly congratulate the serum team for their launch yesterday. Uh I think it is quite inspirational in terms of what a small

team of entrepreneurs have accomplished in such a short time and as as somebody who kind of nerds out on these things I found that very very impressive. Um I think speaking for the u speaking for us

uh in in in the administration we approach this from a spirit of partnership. Um uh you know we want to see the world uh leverage and use uh our technologies. Uh you saw many of the

companies represented here on stage today. Whether it be our uh advanced semiconductor chips, whether it be um you know people building models or whether it be people building

applications um you can kind of choose who you want to work with. If you want to build a model you're going to be training on um you know Nvidia or AMD CPU. If you want to you know the one

code you're probably going to whatever would be your use case and if you look at the action plan we put a lot of emphasis into making sure we can export our AI just to give you one example you

know we entered into um this AI accelerator partnership with the UAE back in May last year as part of President Trump's uh visit um um and I think that's kind of the template for

many more to come. You mentioned pack silica u um I think the announcement was I think it's going to be formalized uh tomorrow that is another partnership uh you know headed up by my dear friend

Jacob Hellberg in the state department which is about how do we ensure supply chain security and do it with all of our allies and we've had many amazing uh countries sign onto it and I think it's

a great effort so what I would emphasize is you know we are trying to approach this with a spirit of partnership where we want to bring our technologies to our allies and to and to kind of really work

with them together uh on all things AI. &gt;&gt; So let me pose the final question to this panel as we as we reach our 20-minut mark. I thought we should perhaps look back at the first session

this morning when I thought I thought President Macron made a very interesting speech which had a number of issues that we could all take um we could actually have a debate on. you know for example

uh it's one of the questions he raised was the nature of regulation and I think the implicit in his speech was uh the the question of the balance between innovation and restraint in some sense

right so maybe as we conclude this conversation u from all of the panelists we could start with how do we see the future of AI regulation and maybe minister Alama I could start with you

this time uh then come to you Minister Zamora and end with you Shriram on on regulation and what you think about it so let me start with you. &gt;&gt; So are you commenting on President

Mcron's statement on regulation? &gt;&gt; No, no, no. I'm just saying he he kind of very early morning he told us about some questions that we need to answer on safety, guardrails,

care, empathy. That's the question, right? So what are we designing it for? &gt;&gt; So there isn't a one model fits all when it comes to regulating technology. And I think as well there isn't a country

that's going to get it right from the get-go because they are all knowing. &gt;&gt; And we've seen that uh through many iterations of different regulations that were put in place and then revoked and

removed in the UAE. Our view is simple. First we actually like to engage. So we engage aggressively with the different partners whether it's from the private sector or other countries as well.

Second is we like to build up gradually rather than go from extreme to extreme. And I'll give you a simple example. Um you're going to realize that when Chad GPT came out, in a short period of time,

there was a country in Europe, I'm not going to mention the country, who announced that they're banning Chad GPT. In the same month, the cabinet in the UAE announced that we are going to be

embracing uh LLMs and CH GPT completely and getting as many people in the country to use these tools as possible. And this sounded counterintuitive. You know, why are they banning it and these

guys are jumping on board? Our assessment was that this tool is going to be a net positive for the society. Now with that if there are negative ramifications the way that we're going

to approach it is gradual restriction rather than going from zero to 100. That's how the UAE approached it and we typically like to work with others to ensure that our regulation as well are

compatible with other whether it's blocks or countries. So you see that there are certain regulations that are compatible with India. Many regulations are compatible with the US and maybe her

excess the minister will say this for countries of our size we can't bully large companies and I don't think we can afford and it's true we can't afford to swing you know left and right on the

pendulum just because you know we're trying to threaten them. Our approach should always be approaches of cooperation of collaboration and also of continuous proactive assessment of the

impact on citizens. &gt;&gt; I'm just going to end with one final example. &gt;&gt; Go ahead. &gt;&gt; Today the conversation that social media

is bad, &gt;&gt; right? So this is one of the things that we are hearing and my question is it took social media so we've had social media for 15 years now. Mhm.

&gt;&gt; It took us 15 years to reach to that point and today the only answer is that we restrict. Uh there has to be constant assessment and proactive engagement with the private sector while at the same

time putting constant restrictions you know slowly but continuously to ensure that you don't have to go to the extreme. I know that Europe is very wise when it comes to them putting the

regulations for themselves. Our approach in the UAE is to try to engage and see what comes out for. &gt;&gt; Very diplomatic. But but uh you know I I think your point is well taken.

Regulation is a art form and not necessarily the exercise of a hammersmith you know policy option for the government. So it's very well taken. Minister Zamura your view.

&gt;&gt; So regulation the way I see it is depends on the view of the beholder. Who are we talking about? Because I hear regulation on innovation. Sure. How much money the five big tech companies

invested last year on innovation? Over $200 billion which is also the amount of money India is planning on invest for the next two years. &gt;&gt; Costa Rica's GDP is a hundred billion

dollars. &gt;&gt; So that gives you a perspective. Innovation, what's the average um percentage invested on innovation per GDP for OECD members? 2.7% of the GDP.

Costa Rica 0.3%. Latin America 0.65%. We're not even at 1%. So we say let's regulate innovation. Let's start innovating first &gt;&gt; and let's then regulate it. So as his

excellency was saying, it's not a onefits all sort of formula. So and then I go back to we have to think when when talking about regulation, what is each country's reality? How about data? Let's

talk about data. Data privacy, data governance. How about the value of data? Because some of the countries that's all we can provide because we have to still again we're building working on building

blocks. How about the value of data which at the end of the day it's what algorithms need to become better. How about talking about regulating data and the value of data? Those are things

again it depends on the perspective of each country and what is it that we what value can we provide? can we put on the table and let's discuss that because we can talk about ethics we can talk about

governance we can talk about the goal of AI which should always be the improv improving of humans lives but what is the reality of each country nowadays when thinking about data I mean of AI

&gt;&gt; Shir let me turn to you for the final word the prime minister this morning Indian prime minister this morning said very eloquently that AI is India's destiny and in some sense uh that would

define the governance approach for the opportunity that it offers us. Right. So now in that backdrop in in the American tradition of of building entrepreneurial value, how do you where do you tilt on

this debate? &gt;&gt; Well, um I think uh we I think for us we always sort of seen AI through a lens of optimism and positivity in terms of what it can do for American citizens and the

world at large. When it comes to regulation, there are some things which we absolutely do care about. We care about protecting children. We care about protecting IP rights. We care about uh

making sure that AI doesn't have censorship or doesn't have ideological biases embedded of any kind. But having said that, what we are trying to battle right now um with this executive order

is we don't want a patchwork of regulation. we are still very very early uh when it comes to AI and we don't want to hinder innovation by having bureaucratic red tape or having in

America 50 different states with 50 different rules that entrepreneurs have to deal with before they launch something. So that's been our approach. &gt;&gt; So it's more about coherence and

predictability and certainty that allows &gt;&gt; Yes, we need clarity in regulation so that entrepreneurs can do what they do best. Uh I think this has been a fantastic conversation 20 minutes of

pure content. So thank you very much to all three of you for coming to India for sharing your wisdom with us and of course best of luck for your AI journeys and hopefully our paths will intersect

and we will build a prosperous future together. Thank you very much. Please join me in applauding this part. Thank you so much your excellencies for this insightful and enriching

conversation. Uh I thank her excellency Paula Paganti Zamura, his excellency Omar Alama, Mr. Shiram Krishnan and also Dr. Samir Surin for moderating this conversation. Ladies and gentlemen, we

are honored to have the right honorable Rishi Sunnak with us. former prime minister of the United Kingdom Mr. Rishi Sun. He was the force behind hosting the landmark AI safety summit at Bleach

Park, the point where the international conversation on AI safety truly began. He understands perhaps better than almost anyone how technology intersects with geopolitics with democratic

institutions and with the everyday lives of citizens. And of course we are honored to have you here with us sir. May I please invite former prime minister Rishi Sunnak on the stage to

share his his views on the summit. Please welcome with applause the right honorable Rishak. Namaste. Thank you. It's such a privilege and indeed a pleasure to be

with you today. Now, as we've been hearing all week in Delhi, artificial intelligence can do many things, but it will never replicate that sense of wonder that you feel seeing the red

fort. The pleasure that you get from biting into a sweet loo or if I can say this here in Delhi, the joy you get from watching RCB's Smitty Mandana hit the perfect drive.

Now, when I launched the first AI leaders summit in 2023, I created that summit to be a forum where we could all from presidents and prime ministers to CEOs and CTOs to developers and

development specialists come together, share the latest advances, and work out how to ensure that we tip the balance of this technology in favor of humanity. ity. So I'm grateful that South Korea,

France, and now India have taken up the baton. Back at Bletchley, we committed ourselves to an AI future that worked for humanity. And that is why the first

summit began with safety. There were risks, new risks that we knew that we must avoid. And I'm proud that the frontier labs today are working with our AI security institute to test models

before they are deployed, ensuring their safety. But I also knew that AI progress and AI safety went hand in hand. It is by showing the world that this technology

is safe that we will be able to fully reap the benefits of it. And the public sector is where trust in AI will really be won or lost. When people see faster services, better healthcare,

simpler interactions with government, that's when the debate about AI becomes real rather than abstract. Now, the pace of change that we're about to see is going to be quicker than

anybody realizes. I truly believe that there is nothing in our lifetimes that will be more transformative for our economies, for our societies, indeed all our lives than artificial intelligence.

But we do have to appreciate how quickly this is happening. From the invention of the telephone, it took around 75 years to get to 100 million users. It took the PC 15 years,

the internet 7 years. So how long did it take chat GPT? 2 months. So we do need a regular forum where we

can all meet and discuss this technology and that is what this summit provides. Under Prime Minister Modi's leadership, this summit will deliver impact. It will show us how we can make AI work not just

for the developed world but for the developing world too. How it can improve health and education in every corner of the globe. How it can enhance human dignity.

how it can raise the floor for humanity. And there is no better place to discuss this AI transformation than India. The AI debate is moving from technology to strategy, from what these tools can do

to what countries choose to do with them. Indians are among the world's most prolific users of both mobile data and AI tools. You are the second largest

contributor to AI projects on GitHub anywhere. The India stack has shown people how technology can benefit them in their everyday lives. This digital public infrastructure are the UPI and

now Aayaus man health accounts provide universal digitally verified foundations on which AI applications can now reach 1.4 billion people. The energy that I've seen this week, the

young people that I've spoken to are testament to the vibrant startup ecosystem here in India which has produced over 125 unicorns with new fantastic businesses like Soram AI

leading the way. A remarkable culture, a frugal innovation is why India could send Chundran to the moon for less than the cost of making the movie Interstellar.

And no country will realize the benefits of AI if its citizens are fearful of it because people don't adopt a technology that they are scared of. Again, India has huge advantages here.

At a time of mounting AI pessimism in the west, this nation stands out for the fact that almost nine out of 10 Indians are optimistic about AI. And all of this is why in the latest

Stanford University ranking of global AI powers, India has overtaken the UK into the medal places. Although I should say England remain just ahead in the ICC test rankings.

Now the sprint to be the first company and indeed the first country to achieve AGI dominates our headlines. But what India shows is that the real race is the race for everyday AI to spread this

technology throughout your economy and society. Now history teaches us that leadership in technology does not only depend on who invents it but on how effectively it

is deployed and adopted in your country. Take the printing press invented in 1440 in mates in Germany. But as Jeffrey Ding shows in his book, Technology and the Great Powers, it was the Dutch Republic

that extracted the most value from it and in turn became the publishing powerhouse of the world. Now, San Francisco may be today's mates, but it is increasingly India that is doing what

the Dutch Republic did so effectively and maximizing the benefits of this new Because when it comes to AI, adoption is all. It will be those countries and those companies that adopt, adopt, adopt

who will be the biggest winners. Now, India can also lead the way on showing how AI can address the great challenges of our time and raise the floor for humanity.

If we are to feed a global population of 10 billion people in 2050, food production must increase by 70%. By 2030, we will have a global shortage of 11 million health workers and 44

million teachers, meaning hundreds of millions won't get the care or education they need. And there is already a $4 trillion funding gap for achieving the

sustainable development goals. These problems threaten to cause famine and hardship to destroy the human potential of billions and to make the world an ever more unequal place. But AI can and

is helping us solve these problems and at a fraction of the cost. Look at how Agrosmart is enabling farmers in Latin America to access on their phones in their fields the kind of up-to-date

weather and soil information that up to now has been the preserve of the largest commercial producers and the results have been sensational. It is boosting crop yields by a fifth

while havinging water and energy use. Now this technology offers the chance to achieve a breakthrough in agricultural product productivity on the scale of India's green revolution. And if AI

helps us achieve this, we truly can feed the world. Now for most of human history, the most dangerous thing a woman could do is give birth. One in 18 married women died from

childbirth in 17th century England. Now that number has fallen by 99% today, but in subsahara and Africa, maternal mortality is comparable to what it was in England four centuries ago.

An AI can help us tackle this inequality. Take the prompt service in Kenya, which offers 3 million pregnant women health advice by text message in their own

language. The AI can flag high-risisk cases and ensure that they quickly get the health care and medical care they need. For 74 cents a patient, this technology is saving lives and tackling

one of the great injustices of our time. Now, no country has become healthier and wealthier without expanding education. As Kofian reminded us, knowledge is power. Information

is liberating. Education is the premise of progress in every society, in every family. But today, too many children lack access to quality teaching and resources. And

again, AI can and is changing that. Take MindSpark, which is teaching half a million pupils already in India. These children are being provided with personalized lessons in just the way

that the most privileged children in developed countries are. And for just a few dollars a month, their rate of learning has doubled. The genius of this technology is that it doesn't require

super fast broadband and a fancy laptop, but just a simple tablet with preloaded content that draws on 20 years of research and 5 billion student interactions.

Think of the dreams that are being sparked by this. The human potential that will no longer be wasted. So, in conclusion, today we can see the Bletchley vision of

an AI that favors humanity becoming a We're seizing the opportunities of the greatest breakthrough of our time while giving our citizens the peace of mind that we will keep them safe. AI will

deliver huge economic gains. It will have twice the impact of the industrial revolution in just half the time. But what we are seeing here at this summit is how AI will raise the floor for

humanity. Rural clinics will soon be able to offer the same level of medical expertise as big teaching hospitals. As the son of a doctor and as the parent of two girls blessed with the best medical

care the world can provide. As the grandson of someone born in rural Tanzania, I know what a difference this will make. It will lead to an improvement in human health and

happiness that we have not seen before. Farmers on their small holdings will be able to call on the combined expertise of the world's best aronomists and soil scientists. In the greatest step forward

ever for equality of opportunity, every child will now have access to a personalized tutor. It won't matter if you're born in the Luchin's Bungalow zone or in Ali Rajpur. You will, thanks

to this technology, have the same educational opportunities. It will be the greatest democratization of knowledge ever. Friends, this is the new world that we are entering. Never before

in human history will so many people receive a boost to their quality of life. That will be this technologies greatest achievement. and that will be your legacy. Thank you.

Thank you so much sir. Your reflections on artificial intelligence and its use in overcoming the global challenges has really elevated this summit. Thank you so much. We are deeply grateful for your

valuable contribution. now invite Mr. Beulu Somaya, managing director, Lightseed Venture Partners, one of the most respected technology investors in Asia. Mr. Somaya has backed

some of India's most consequential startups from the earliest stages. His view of where AI investment is going and which bets are likely to pay off is one of the most grounded in the room.

Please welcome the managing director of Lightseed Venture Partners, Mr. Beil Somaya. Thank you very much for the founders in the audience and

live streaming. I want to take you back to 2008. If you were involved with the innovation economy in India at that time, you were living in a strange kind of tension.

On one hand, there was a sense of inevitability around the arrival of the internet and the creation of the digital economy in India. On the other hand, if you focus solely

on what was happening in that moment, there was very little evidence that we could all point to. Internet penetration was in the s low single digits. Smartphones were a luxury. Broadband was

a distant promise. And the main question anyone was asking was whether India would ever be more than a services economy for the rest of And yet within 15 years, India became

the world's third largest digital economy. Not by copying what happened elsewhere, but by inventing something entirely of its own. a digital stack, a payments

infrastructure, and a consumer internet economy that served a billion people at price points the world had never seen before. The companies that emerged were not just

Indian versions of American ideas. They were fundamentally different companies built for a fundamentally different context. At Light Speed, we think about that

moment often because we are sitting inside a very similar moment right now except that the technology is AI not the internet. The window of opportunity is shorter and

the stakes are much higher. So let me ask you all a question. In 2008, if you had known with certainty that the internet was coming to India, not if, but when, what would you have

done differently? What companies would you have started? What investments would you have made? Because here is what I believe with real conviction.

The arrival of AI in India is not a question of if. It is a question of how and how fast. One of the most important mental shifts in the innovation economy and it took me

many years to fully understand this is that what matters is not where you are but how fast you are moving. Scale is a snapshot but the slope or the trajectory is the story.

When people talk about India and AI today, the conversation often gravitates towards infrastructure gaps, compute access, data quality, language diversity.

These are real challenges, but they are the current state, not the destiny. And in technology, the current state is almost always a misleading guide to the

India's slope right now is incredibly exciting. The pace of AI adoption among developers, the sophistication of the startup ecosystem, the depth of engineering talent, the hunger to solve

hard problems. These are indicators of the trajectory that lies ahead and trajectory not position is what creates value in the innovation economy. Now two areas where AI has the greatest

potential to be transformative for India and you just heard this from the former prime minister are health care and education. Worldclass health care requires

specialists who are available reachable and affordable requires follow-up monitoring personalization. In most of the world and certainly in

most of India these things are rationed by geography and by income. The quality of health care you receive is a function of where you were born and what you can afford.

AI will break that equation. Not by replacing doctors, but by making the intelligence of the best diagnosticians in the world accessible to a primary care provider in a third

tier city. By making a first level triage conversation available to anyone with a smartphone. By turning the enormous volume of health

data generated across India into insights that improve outcomes at population scale. The opportunity is not just to digitize an existing system. It is to reimagine

what healthcare delivery looks like when intelligence is abundant and geography is irrelevant. Education is the same story. For decades, the highest quality education

in India has been rationed by examination performance and proximity. For every student who made it through, there were thousands who didn't. Not because they lacked potential, but

because they lacked access. A truly intelligent tutoring system has never existed at scale anywhere in the Building it for India in India's languages for India's learners is one of

the most important things our current generation of entrepreneurs could do and it is now within reach in a way that has never been possible before. The impact of getting these two things

right is not just economic, it is civilizational. A country where every child has access to a genuinely excellent education and every person has access to the best

personalized health care. That is a different country in a different India than the one that exists today. Now there is an absolutely profound change underway the impact of which

deserves more attention than it currently receives and that change is that the cost of intelligence has collapsed. It hasn't declined, it has collapsed.

The cost of running sophisticated AI inference has dropped by orders of magnitude and it continues to drop. What cost hundreds of dollars per query two years ago costs fractions of a cent

today and the models are getting dramatically more capable not less. Why does this matter for India specifically? Because price has always been the

friction point in this country. Every technology wave that came before smartphones, broadband, software had to solve the affordability problem to unlock the India market.

Sometimes it took a decade. Sometimes it required entirely new business models. Sometimes like in healthcare and education, it led to halves and have nots.

AI is different. The underlying cost structure is compressing so rapidly that the question of whether AI will be affordable for Indian consumers and Indian businesses has already been

answered. The question is not whether the economics can work. The question is simply who will be fast enough to build the right applications before this

window closes. For the first time in the history of technology, a person in a village in Rajasthan with a smartphone will have access to the same underlying

intelligence as a knowledge worker in Manhattan. Not an inferior version, not a stripped down version, the same intelligence delivered through applications built for

their context in their language at a price point they can afford. That is not a small thing. That is a compression of centuries of knowledge inequality

into a very short window of time. And there is a deeper implication of this cost compression that we have not yet fully appreciated. One that is specific to India in a way that is

different than most other countries. And that is that we have historically operated with a scarcity mindset for good reason. Scarcity was our lived reality. scarcity of capital, scarcity

of infrastructure, scarcity of But perhaps the deepest and most consequential scarcity of all was the scarcity of talent. Talent is the raw material of

innovation. It is the thing that you cannot substitute or work around. You can raise more capital. You can build more infrastructure. But you cannot conjure on demand a great engineer, a

great product thinker or a great operator. And in India, the talent pool while deep and absolute terms has always felt insufficient relative to the scale of

our ambition. The best people were overs subscribed. The gap between what founders wanted to build and what they had the human capital to execute has been a constant

constraint. How many companies have been slowed or never started because a founder could not find the right 10 people? This is the constraint that AI is

dissolving. When intelligence becomes abundant. When a founding team of five can do the work that previously required 50. When every developer has a sophisticated

co-worker available at all times. When customer support and legal analysis and financial modeling and content creation can be augmented dramatically. The talent bottleneck changes in

character. It doesn't disappear. Judgment, creativity, domain, expertise, leadership. These remain scarce and human. But the leverage available to

every unit of talent expands enormously. A firsttime founder in Bangaluru or Hyderabad or Pune building with AI tools available today has access to a level of organizational leverage that a

well-funded startup in Silicon Valley didn't have just three years ago. The playing field is meaningly more level than it has ever been. Now this mindset shift is is not

trivial. Scarcity thinking is deeply ingrained in how we hire, how we plan, how we measure organizational capacity. We have to move from how many people do we have to what is the effective

intelligence that is now available to our team. But this is the frame we need for the world that we're entering. The founders and leaders who truly understand this and act on it early will

build fundamentally different leaner, faster, more ambitious in scope than those of us who carry the old constraints into a new environment. Now, I want to be direct about one thing

because I think that many of us right now are focusing on the wrong part of the stack. While the foundation models, the large language models, the reasoning engines

are largely being built outside India with the exception of Serb. This will not be the primary area of opportunity in India. The primary opportunity area here is in the

application layer. That is how this technology diffuses into the economy. Making it real for businesses, for consumers, for institutions. And this requires building applications that

understand specific workflows, languages, cultural context contexts, and very specific regulatory It requires the kind of close to the ground insight that comes from being

inside a market not just observing from the outside. And this is exactly what Indian entrepreneurs are uniquely good at. The history of the Indian consumer

internet is a history of taking global ideas and rebuilding them from first principles for a market that global players fundamentally misunderstand. And that skill and that instinct is

exactly what the AI application layer demands. Now I want to close with something that I mean sincerely not as a formality that everyone that is listening to this

is not just a spectator about what is happening in India. You are the protagonist for it. And that is not a comfortable position because protagonists carry weight. They

make decisions under uncertainty. They move before things are obvious. They make mistakes and endure criticism. But those are the people that shape our In 2008, a small number of entrepreneurs

and investors in India looked at a world with very limited internet penetration in India and decided that the trajectory and the potential was more important than the current scale.

They built companies that didn't yet have customers on infrastructure that didn't yet exist for a market that hadn't yet arrived. Most people thought they were too early

and some of them were. But the ones who got it right created something unlike anything we had seen before. So we have been here before and Indian founders have shown emphatically that

they know what to do. The only question is whether we will move with the conviction and intensity that this moment deserves. I believe we will. Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Thank you so much Mr. Beel Somaya for your enlightening address and also for contributing your expertise to this summit. Ladies and gentlemen, I now take this opportunity to invite Professor

Surya Ganguli, professor of AI, neuroscience and physics, Stanford University. Professor Ganguli's research sits at one of the most intellectually fertile intersections in science today.

Using the mathematics of physics and the insights of neuroscience to understand how intelligence, biological and artificial intelligence actually works. His work is helping build the

theoretical foundations that practice so urgently needs. Please welcome Professor Surya Ganguli from Stanford University. &gt;&gt; Uh thank you. Um great. So we got the slides. Uh so we went from a world

leader to a VC to now a professor now. So we're going to have a little bit of a change of pace. It's going to get a little bit more technical and because I'm a professor, there's going to be an

exam at the end, right? So, pay attention. All right. So, I'm going to talk about advancing the science and engineering of intelligence. So, um the last uh decade uh of AI research has

has led to stunning advances in the engineering of intelligence, yielding AI systems that stand poised to transform our society. Yet alarmingly we understand almost nothing about how they

work and we desperately need to. At the same time our brain is the product of 500 million years of vertebrate brain evolution and it is still orders of magnitude better than AI along several

axes and we also need to understand why. So I work in a unified science of intelligence across both brains and machines that seeks to both understand uh biological and artificial

intelligence and create more efficient, explainable and powerful AI. Today I'll work on understanding and improving intelligence along three axes. Data efficiency, energy efficiency, and

melding uh brains and machines. First, data efficiency. So um AI is vastly more data hungry than humans. We get about 100 million words of language experience. AI gets 10

trillion. It would take us 240,000 years to read everything that AI read. So why is AI so data hungry? Well well in AI error falls off as a power law. Falls off very slowly as a power law

with the amount of data. This is an example of a famous neural scaling law which captured the imagination of industry and motivated significant societal investments in data collection,

compute and energy. But despite the importance of these neuroscaling laws discovered over half a decade ago, we lack any scientific theory for why they exist for any modern large language

model and why they are so slow. Just last week, we posted the first theory to do so. From first principles, we could analytically predict the slope of these neural scaling laws and we connected

their uh shallow slope to the weak surface statistical structure of natural language itself. The black line is our theory and the colored lines are experiments in modern LLMs. And you

can see there's a good match. But can we make the scaling laws better? We actually can. We actually showed both in theory and practice that we can bend the slow power law down to a much

faster exponential draw. The key idea is that large random data sets are extremely redundant. If you already have a billion random sentences, it's unlikely that the next sentence is going

to tell you very much that's new. But what if you could find a non-redundant training set in which each new data point is carefully chosen to tell you something new compared to all the other

data points? We developed theory and algorithms to do just this. And that's what got us the better exponential. In a completely different line of work, we asked if the process of evolution

itself could speed up learning. And we showed it actually can. We evolved robot morphologies, shapes of bodies from generation to generation. And we showed that successive generations could learn

faster. They did so by designing the body to be easier to learn to control. This is an example of something called the morphological Baldwin effect. It's an effect that has long been conjectured

in evolutionary theory, but hard to test in the real world. We demonstrated it for the first time in our simulations. Okay, let's go on to energy efficiency. AI is vastly more energy hungry than

humans. Our brain only spends 20 watts of power, but modern AI can consume 10 million watts. So why is AI so energy hungry? Well, the fault lies in the choice of

digital computation itself, where we use very fast and reliable bit flips at every intermediate step of the computation. Now, the laws of thermodynamics demand

that every fast and reliable bit flip must consume a lot of energy. Biology chose a very different route. It gets the right answer just in time using the slowest, most unreliable

intermediate steps possible. Biology does not rev its engine any more than it needs to. It also codees computational and physics much better. For example, it directly uses Maxwell's equations of

electromagnetism to do addition instead of using complex energy hungry transistor circuits. So biology matches its computation directly to the native physics of the universe.

So to bridge the vast energy gap between brains and machines, we need to rethink our entire technology stack from electrons to algorithms and optimally match computational dynamics to physical

dynamics. For example, given a particular computation, what are the fundamental limits on on its speed and accuracy under energy constraints?

We recently solved this question for the computation of sensing which every cell has to do. We found fundamental limits on the lowest achievable error achieved by any chemical computer whatsoever.

That's the red curve. And we also found the family of optimal computers that hug this curve. And we showed remarkably that these optimal chemical computers behave a lot like

something called G-rotein coupled receptors which hide in every single cell and they do sensing. So this yields a connection between what neurons do and what optimal physical sensors would do.

popping up a level in neuroscience, we can now measure not only neural activity, but also energy consumption in the form of ATP usage, the fundamental chemical fuel that powers all life's

processes. We can do this across the entire fly brain. So, by analyzing the couple dynamics of neural computation and energy consumption, we discovered that the

brain actually works like a smart energy grid. Remarkably, the brain can predict where and when energy will be needed in the future, and it produces just the right amount of energy at just the right

time at just the right location. So, in summary, we still have a lot to learn from evolution in our quest to build more energy efficient AI, but we don't have to be limited by evolution. We can

go beyond evolution to instantiate neural algorithms in quantum hardware that evolution could not discover. For example, we can replace individual neurons with individual atoms. A neuron

in different states of firing correspond to atoms in different excited electronic states. We can also replace individual synapses between neurons with photons, quanta of

light. Just as synapses allow two neurons to communicate, photons allow electronic states of atoms to communicate through photon emission and absorption.

So what can we build with this? As one example, we could build a Hotfield associative memory network. This is the same network that recently won John Hopfield the

Nobel Prize in physics. But this is a quantum version this time that can be built with with atoms and photons. And we can show that the quantum dynamics endows the the memory with superior uh

capacity, robustness and recall. We can also go beyond this to build quantum optimizers made entirely out of photons. These photonic computers solve optimization problems in interesting new

ways and we can analyze their energy landscape. So the marriage of neural algorithms with quantum hardware leads to an entirely new field that I like to call

quantum neuromorphic computing. Okay. Now returning to the brain, the marriage of neuroscience and AI enables a powerful new path forward by melding minds and machines as follows.

Imagine a scenario where we read lots and lots of neural activity from the brain. Then we use AI to build a model or a digital twin of of brain circuits. Then we can do rapid incilico

experiments on the digital twin and use explainable AI to understand how it works. But we don't have to stop there. We can control the brain too. We can use control theory to learn specific neural

patterns that we can write into the digital twin to control it. Then we can transfer these same neural patterns into the actual brain to write into the brain and control the brain. In essence, we

can learn the language of the brain and then speak directly back to it in its own neural language. So as one example of this program, we recently developed the world's most

accurate digital twin of the biological retina and we used explainable AI to understand it. And in silicico, we could reproduce two decades worth of experiments in a matter of days. So this

shows a general path forward to dramatically accelerating neuroscience discovery using AI. We also carried out this program in mice where we able to use AI to read the mind

of a mouse. We could look directly at neural activity in the brain of a mouse and we could decode what it was seeing at the low level of resolution that mice can see. This shows that we can learn

the native language of the visual brain. But we can go further than that to write to the mind of a mouse by by writing in carefully designed neural activity patterns. We could make the mouse

hallucinate a particular percept. In fact, we could control the mouse brain so well that we only needed to stimulate 20 neurons in the mouse brain to do this. So in essence, we could control

what the mouse saw by writing directly into the brain using the native language of its brain itself. We also applied this to um to uh to epilepsy.

Sorry. We also carried out this program in epilepsy where we built a digital twin of the epileptic brain. Our twin could reproduce actual epileptic seizure dynamics across the entire brain. We

then used explainable AI to understand how these seizures were starting. Then we used control theory to to be able to control the seizure amplitude in the digital twin. Then we injected these

same control signals into the actual brain and controlled seizure amplitude in the actual brain. This shows how to meld brains and machines to control Building on all this, we're actually

creating a new startup called Metamorphic. It will work closely with the Enigma project at Stanford University and together enigma and metamorphic will scale up the

construction of digital twins to encompass the entire primate brain starting with the visual brain. Such such scaled up digital twins offer a powerful path forward to building robust

biohybrid AI systems that are taught directly by brain data and to treat brain disease in new AIdriven ways. More generally, the possibilities of melding brains and machines are

limitless, both to advance AI and to understand, cure, and augment the brain. To close, what I think we really need is a unified science of intelligence that spans both brains and machines to help

us understand both biological and artificial intelligence and create more efficient, explainable, and powerful AI. Importantly, this pursuit must be done out in the open and

shared with the world. And it must be done with a long time horizon. This makes academia an ideal place to pursue a science of intelligence. And I believe it's imperative to expand

public investment in the academic study of intelligence because the academic studies of yesterday laid the strong foundation for today's AI technology. And it will be the academic studies of

today that lay the foundation for tomorrow's technology, enabling us to go beyond large language models and diffusion models and so forth. Despite the huge and exciting advances happening

now increasingly unfortunately behind closed doors at companies, I'm extremely excited about what the science of intelligence can achieve out in the open for the public benefit of all. Thank

Thank you so much professor Gangali. We sincerely appreciate your thoughtful address which highlighted the cutting edge technology the research and also its transformative potential across

various industries. It was more like biology meets it the technology ladies and gentlemen. And now I have the privilege of inviting our last speaker for the day, Mr. Amit Zaviri, president

and chief product officer, Service Now. Mr. Zaweri has spent his career at the intersection of enterprise software and AI, most recently leading Service Now's push to embed AI agents into every

corner of enterprise workflow. his perspective on agentic AI, what it actually delivers versus what it promises is grounded in millions of enterprise deployments. He'll be in

conversation with Arjun Karpal, CNBC's senior tech correspondent. Please welcome our guest and the moderator. &gt;&gt; All right. Hello everyone. &gt;&gt; Hi. Thanks so much for joining us and if

you're watching online, thank you so much. Uh Amed, let's just kick off. you've got this view that trust is the new infrastructure in this age of AI. Can you just unpack what that means?

&gt;&gt; Yeah, no thank you Arjun. I think uh if you look at what's going on in the AI space, there's huge amount of interest in terms of using it in enterprise use cases as well, right? And without

understanding what it'll do for you and having any idea of what it landed up uh implementing inside your system, it becomes very hard to really depend on it. That's right. Without trust and

safety and understanding of what's happening in your underlying environment, it becomes very hard to expect to use AI in a lot of these enterprise use cases because your

companies will not be able to do any auditing, compliance, visibility, and you wouldn't really be able to really not run business without any kind of understanding of what's going on. So

trust has to be a big part of it. &gt;&gt; And trust I guess in the enterprise sense of the word probably has lots of different definitions, right? We're talking about trust amongst employees

for example, but also uh from the cyber perspective, from the security and safety perspective you were just uh mentioning there. So it's worth digging into some of these. How do you design

some of these in the enterprise? Uh let's start with perhaps the human element at this point because there's a lot of concern from people right now about potential job losses and and the

impact AI could have on on their roles as well. So from the human perspective, how do you design trust within the organization? Yeah. No, I think it's it's still something which I think the

industry is still is trying to figure out. To be honest, the way to think through this one is uh one, everybody has to accept that AI is useful and there's a lot of opportunity to embed

that in terms of your day-to-day lives. Second, I think there is a reality that this thing is transforming how world works and it's moving very fast. So once you understand the principles and the

value of it, then you start start building together in terms of what the cultural shifts needs to be, how people need to work together and how do you help them uh understand the value while

keeping their jobs uh very important and be able to bring them into the conversation. So there's a huge amount of cultural shift inside the company uh as well as be able to kind of educate

everybody in terms of what it delivers for you. So what we've been doing at Service Now for example, we've been uh retraining our employees and giving them access to a lot of the AI capabilities,

making sure that get to see what it does for their day-to-day life at the employee productive level and see that okay you know what I could do my job faster better more efficiently and free

up more of my time to do other things which I couldn't get to. Second thing after that once you get them reskilled is to really now take it to the enterprise level not just an employee

like now how do you improve your processes and the processes which are cutting across multiple departments can I make that thing work faster can I get better understanding of how it operates

and can you land up freeing up a lot of the human painful work you used to do right a lot of the repetitive task uh I would say we used to call it skull crushing task which is making it so

difficult in the day-to-day life that they can't really get anything done beyond that So if you remove those barriers, people start trusting that oh you know you this is helping me it's

getting my job done better and it's also getting me more understanding of new technologies and you start accepting that in your day-to-day work environment and take that to the next level because

you start innovating so it's a step process I would say and what we've done today today service now we've seen the adoption go up a lot be it in engineering be it in finance be it in

customer support be it in go to market because they started playing with those technologies and bringing it in the day day-to-day work environment and from there they've been starting to now

innovate and come up with new ideas to how make their make their jobs better and how do you make the customers life better long term does that set them up then for success when you know

inevitably we will see the changing nature of work and also we've already seen some companies you know make layoffs and and blame it on AI whether that's true or not it's another debate

but um certainly uh there will be changing nature of work and organizations are rethinking the workforce. So by doing the reskilling is this setting employees up?

&gt;&gt; No, I think you're right. I mean with any technology transformation there's always worries about job losses. It's nothing this is not the first time a technology shift has created that

anxiety. It has happened with the cloud when cloud happened. It happened with the web uh when the transformation happened towards that. I think the the difference here is the speed sometimes

and the uncertainty of understanding what it does to you as an individual in some cases. uh but I think uh the worry the lot of the news out there where saying you because of AI we reduce our

staffing some of them are just using that as an excuse I've seen so far uh if you look at our business AI business has grown significantly and we have been able to add more people because we were

able to expand our TA we've been able to get into lot more new segments of market because of the investment uh re we've been able to reinvest a lot of that money we save because of AI into a lot

of new areas and that is one thing which I think a lot of companies are starting to realize. Uh you take out a lot of the mundane task and move into the high value task. You can you can increase

your top line. Sure you help on the bottom line with AI. There is a lot of work you can now outsource to autonomous I agents and uh agentic workflows instead of having to do it by humans but

the humans are now able to do a lot of other things you couldn't and get into a lot of new segments. Our business has grown significantly because we've been able to now take that uh savings and

invest into a lot of new areas. You you mentioned Agentic there and I'm glad you did because the other part of this trust equation is what you were mentioning earlier around uh safety and security as

well. Um given the excitement around agentic AI and how much businesses want to want to adopt this is there enough focus being put right now on the vulnerabilities from a cyber perspective

when it comes to agentic AI &gt;&gt; I would say that's probably the biggest concern for companies when they think about AI and Agentic right if you look at last year early last year when we

used to go and talk about agentic uh uh workflows or AI most of the companies were worried about not having any kind of visibility worried about vulnerabilities worried worried about

security, worried about control. And once we started introducing them the capability of controlling some of this implementation and having security profiles around the AI implementation, a

lot more companies started adopting AI, right? And last late last year, I would say middle of last year and late last year, the volume of our agentic workflows being adopted by customers

went up by 55 times, 55x because what happened was they start feeling comfortable that one they have visibility into all the AI systems. Second, they have ability to secure it

because you don't want to uh lose access to your data or get it accessed externally without any without any kind of permissions. And once you start giving them that comfort factor, they're

starting to see the benefit of taking Agentic AI and implementing that into the businesses, uh be a workflow around case management, incident management, triaging, uh be able to resolve issues

and that is a very very valuable things for them. But once you only can do that once you have the security part of it. So for example, we've been investing aggressively in the security space. Uh

our security business itself is a billion dollar plus, but we've been adding now for AI agents. The AI agents are changing roles every second you call them based on what requirements you

have. So how do you manage the permissions? How do you manage their identity? So we bought uh recently a company called VZA which does access graphs for non-human identities which

makes it much more valuable to our customers because now they know that those agents are guaranteed to not do something nefarious or they don't won't have access to data you're not allowed

to have and whenever you chain the roles they're only getting to do things based on the roles. So it's a very important part of it and I think a aentic AI and things like that will not be adopted if

you don't have a right kind of security uh technology as part of this implementation. It cannot be on the side. It has to be part of the product. &gt;&gt; There's certain tech companies who will

sort of uh talk up the the capabilities of Agentic AI right now and talk up how enterprises are adopting AI. From your perspective, has the adoption of AI from enterprises been faster, slower or about

right than than you had anticipated? &gt;&gt; I think uh there was a lot of expectation early last year. There were everybody thought that aentic AI and AI AI agents will be proliferated across

every enterprise. I thought that was probably uh little more optimistic and unrealistic because there were a lot of technologies which are missing to really provide you a platform which guarantees

everything before you go and adopt it. A lot of those things started happening I think I would say middle last year and now the volume of adoption has gone up but it is probably more thoughtful than

probably uh experimental the way it was before. A lot of people were experimenting with it but they were not wanting to put it in production because of the security things you talked about

trust and safety uh and compliance. Now with a lot of the things customer are seeing from vendors like us where providing AI control tower for example to make sure you have visibility and

control they're feeling more comfortable. So the volume is starting to go up. Uh use cases are getting much more defined. And what I've seen so far is that once you implement one or two

use cases you start seeing ROI. then the next more use cases become very very fast. So you have to make it easy to be adopted. You have to provide the security and everything else around it

and then get them to see the ROI and once you get the ROI I think the customers all feel that this is something valuable to them and is something they want to invest in.

&gt;&gt; I mean can I get your take on a on a comment we had on CNBC this week? I was speaking to the CEO of Mistral AI in Europe &gt;&gt; and it was around this conversation

happening in financial markets right now around software. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Um and how much are these agentic AI systems going to do the job uh of software that enterprises currently pay

for uh and these SAS businesses and he said you know he believes that 50% roughly of current you know software being used by enterprises uh could shift to AI. I just wanted to get your take on

that given how how embedded you are in this industry. &gt;&gt; No, I think that there's a lot of this debate about what is AI going to do to the software industry. I think uh AI is

going to be a synergetic part of any software you're going to build going forward and it's already happening now has to be with AI mindset and AI as part of the platform and the foundation. The

companies which are going to suffer are the companies who are not adopting AI fast enough. Right? So any vendor who's thinking about AI as a side thing or something which is coming later I think

it'll be very difficult to really justify customers buying that product. Companies like us and others who are starting to make a we have been doing that for a few years where they've been

making AI part of the foundation part of the platform are already accelerating that adoption because customers want see value. uh second I think they do believe that this is going to be very

competitive advantage to them as well and so I we see a lot of synergy we do a lot of partnership with open AI anthropic we work with mistrol we work with Google and gemini because I think

there's a synergy between what a lot foundational models and AI technology provides and all the things you have to do around it what that's what software industry can do so what we're doing is

we're building on top of it but it's like 5 to 10% of IP comes from those models 90 80 90% comes from technology we built because you have to build lot of context around enterprise use cases.

You have to understand those what it means. You have to understand why an exception happened, how you handle it. Models are basically telling them what to do but they don't know why. The why

part, the context part comes from technologies and software we build and the companies who are going to do that much more better, understand domain, understand expertise and have a lot of

experience will win in this market. And that's the difference I think. &gt;&gt; I mean, we got about a minute left. I just wanted to get your take on on the future. If we were sat here uh in a

year's time at another AI summit, what do you think are going to be the key things we'd be speaking about? &gt;&gt; I think we still be talking about security and risk as uh definitely

because there's a lot of work still to be done. Regulations uh every every places you every country is now thinking about what AI means to them, what kind of regulations they want to put in for

privacy, security, other things like that. I think the other one which is starting to come up a lot is physical AI. So we're doing a lot of work in OT operational technology because a lot of

the shop factories are changing with physical AI with humanoids and droids and things like that because they are going to be the next generational way of manufacturing. So how do you now secure

that? How do you bring them as part of the processes? How you integrate that into your environment is going to be critical discussion as well. &gt;&gt; Fantastic. Thanks for all your insights.

So incisive appreciate your time. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; Round of applause Davio service. Thank you everyone. Mr. Amit Zaviri and uh thanks Arjun
