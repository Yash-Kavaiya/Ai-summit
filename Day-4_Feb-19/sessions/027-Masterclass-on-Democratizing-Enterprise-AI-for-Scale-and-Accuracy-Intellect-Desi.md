## 📝 Summary

As India accelerates its journey toward becoming a global AI powerhouse, the transition from "experimental AI" to "enterprise-grade AI" remains a critical hurdle. While Generative AI offers transformative potential, the primary barriers to adoption, within governance and business sectors, remain trust, governance, and accuracy.
This Master Class is designed to bridge the gap between the raw potential of AI and its practical, secure implementation, moving past the hype to address the "latent force" of enterprise-ready technology.
Guided by the Sutras of Progress, Impact, and Trust, the session provides a strategic roadmap for "Democratizing AI." This approach ensures advanced intelligence is no longer confined to data science labs but becomes accessible and scalable across all levels of an organization. By aligning the 7 Chakras of the Enterprise—from foundational Infrastructure to Strategy and Innovation—an organization evolves into a Cognitive Enterprise, where institutional wisdom is a shared resource and every individual is empowered to solve high-value problems.
