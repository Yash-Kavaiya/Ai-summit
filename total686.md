<summary>📖 Full Description</summary>

AI systems deployed across diverse cultural contexts often fail not because of technical limitations, but because they overlook social norms—the unwritten rules that shape human behaviour and decision-making. A recommendation system that succeeds in the United States may not resonate in India. A health chatbot that effectively engages American users may alienate Indian communities if it does not reflect local expectations and communication styles. This research-focused session convenes leading scholarship and applied work examining how culturally grounded design, local data partnerships, and participatory methods can improve AI performance across contexts. The emphasis is on embedding social understanding into model development to ensure effectiveness, legitimacy, and equitable impact across geographies.

Global policy discourse largely treats AI and DPI separately. AI discussions focus on model safety, compute governance, workforce displacement. DPI conversations center on digital identity, digital payment, data exchange. AI-DPI convergence can create exponential value and new risk categories. While this convergence accelerates, critical questions remain: How can DPI lower barriers for local AI innovation while preventing new forms of exclusion? How can responsible AI systems be built in resource-constrained environments using DPI approaches?

> As India accelerates its journey toward becoming a global AI powerhouse, the transition from "experimental AI" to "enterprise-grade AI" remains a critical hurdle.. While Generative AI offers transformative potential, the primary barriers to adoption, within governance and business sectors, remain trust, governance, and accuracy.
This Master Class is designed to bridge the gap between the raw potential of AI and its practical, secure implementation, moving past the hype to address the "latent force" of enterprise-ready technology.
Guided by the Sutras of Progress, Impact, and Trust, the session provides a strategic roadmap for "Democratizing AI." This approach ensures advanced intelligence is no longer confined to data science labs but becomes accessible and scalable across all levels of an organization.

<summary>📖 Full Description</summary>

AI workloads are driving explosive growth in data center power density—racks now routinely hit 100+ kW (vs. traditional 10–20 kW), with megawatt-scale clusters and facilities demanding hundreds of MW. Power demand from global data centers is projected to rise 50–165% by 2030, largely due to AI.

The AI era is forcing a fundamental redesign—native HVDC distribution + liquid cooling will make high-density, sustainable AI infrastructure possible at scale, dramatically cutting losses, material use, and operational costs compared to legacy designs. The transition is already underway among hyperscalers and will become standard within 3–5 years.

Velankani Group is a leader in making Indigenous AI Data Center Infrastructure which will cater the demand for the Future.
