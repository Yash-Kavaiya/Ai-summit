## 📝 Transcript

resources and economic growth. Now if you look closely these are not just the themes they are system requirements of a system in place. You cannot have AI at scale without the right talent. And I

think some of us in the room have already started feeling pain of that. You cannot achieve scale without the elastic infrastructure. You cannot run infrastructure without sustainable

energy. And equally adoption begins with trust. We have few folks in the room from AI use cases who have been trusting AI. Resilience is built on sensing and inclusion is driven by access. These are

not independent ideas. They are deeply interconnected parts of one system and at the end of the day impact is defined by real and inclusive economic outcomes. Today, India stands at a unique

inflection point. The world is increasingly looking at India not just as a market of AI but as a nation capable of shaping how AI is built, governed and deployed at this population

scale. From digital identity to real-time payments to public digital platforms, India has shown that when technology is designed as shared infrastructure, it can unlock both

innovation and inclusion. So the real question before us is what does it truly take to build AI system as critical infrastructure not as pilots, not as dashboards, not as

isolated experiment but as reliable continuously operating systems embedded across agriculture, climate, energy, telecom, finance and public institutions. This becomes especially

relevant as India begins to build platforms like agree stack and invest in climate intelligence and foundational model that can serve not only the national priorities but global

challenges because planet scale problems such as food security, climate resilience and sustainable growth require planet scale intelligence. Today's conversation is not about the AI

hype. We are well past that stage. It is about scale, durability and value of AI can provide. At SAS shop, we see ourselves the very much in work in progress building decision systems that

deliver end to end intelligence including the last mile across critical sectors like agriculture, infrastructure and food security. As we continue this journey of deploying AI scale, we are

equally here to listen and to learn and to draw inspiration from how other sectors and geographies are navigating different dimensions of impact driven by AI and treating it as a system. By the

end of this session, we hope the room leaves with greater clarity on one central idea. What does it take to build planet scale intelligence for economic growth and AI as the next layer of

digital public infrastructure with that if UPI was India's model for financial inclusion AI has the potential to become its model for intelligence inclusion open interoperable and

accessible at the population scale with that it is my pleasure to invite our moderator Pratib Basu CEO of sataw to guide this discussion and for helping us unpack some of these question parts with

a very esteemed panel starting with Gorov Agarwal. He's the chief AI scientist at Jio. Gorov operates as national scale AI deployment where latency, reliability, capital allocation

and data governance matter as much as a model accuracy. His work spans multiple multimodel data sets, telecom networks, distributed system and platform AI infrastructure. Welcome Goro.

Next up, we have Arun Sharma, CEO of Rzonia. Arun leads the large scale power transmission infrastructure, the backbone that supports renewable integration, data center expansion,

national energy security, etc. I think we have uh Derek Jose, the MD industrial AI at Accenture. Derek has spent decades operationalizing AI in asset heavy environments, manufacturing,

energy, and utilities where uptime, safety, and climate exposure define the P&amp;L. He brings a practitioner's lens to converting AI pilots into industrial operating system.

We have Michael Zan, global partner at Dalberg Advisers. Michael works at intersection of technology policy, inclusive development across emerging markets. His work examines how detection

capacity, financial data can reshape institutional design for climate resilience and economic inclusion. In addition, we have a surprise guest with us. We have Goratia who is leading

the uh manufacturing in of at ITC as well as looks at the strategic decisions over there. Thank you. Now I hand over to Pratip to begin the discussion and please join me in welcoming our

panelist. &gt;&gt; Well, thank you Diva. Thank you so much uh to all the panelists for joining us. As uh Diva mentioned uh despite the very heavy uh security that uh is is today at

Bharat Mandapam. So um we'll move over from the security hassles uh to the more exciting part of our uh panel which is uh understanding from your experiences uh uh about how uh from your vantage

point you are looking at building uh AI the impact of AI uh in your uh respective areas of work as well as uh uh how uh the experiences that you have had in deploying uh large scale systems

uh is is sometimes disconnected to the overall impact uh whether it's business impact or impact on the ground. So I'll start my uh questions first with Michael uh maybe going in this order to to the

left. So Michael um if governments in the global south want to invest in intelligence uh and infrastructure for inclusive growth and at Dalberg you have been at the

forefront of so many programs uh globally uh and it spans agriculture, finance, climate, energy. Um which investments have you seen yield the highest compounding returns and also uh

what were the gaps uh of of uh or gaps or leakages that you saw uh which you could point out to things like capacity building uh lack of data standards uh opensource tools stuff like this from

your experiences if you could share a few uh notes. &gt;&gt; Uh thank you Praep. Uh I mean I think the good news is that we're seeing a lot of interest growing interest from

governments around uh the world and I personally I I spend a lot of my time in Africa uh in Southeast Asia a bit in South in South Asia and a bit in Latin America looking at geospatial

intelligence as well as an AI overlays on geospatial intelligence as tools for everything from energy transition planning to um uh food system surveillance, food security uh and to um

climate resilience of physical infrastructure. So the good news is I think interest is growing in um kind of planetary intelligence solutions. Um I mean I think there is a realization that

uh you need these kinds of you need dynamic and more granular and more dynamic intelligence to deal with things such as the roughly $800 billion a year uh uh economic losses for infrastructure

due to climate um uh climate damage uh and climate disasters. uh to address problems really intractable problems such as the fact that you know we've got nearly billion people globally um who

are suffering from severe food insecurity 300 million uh from uh extreme hunger in last year alone um and and that's a problem that's increasing um with uh climate events. So how do you

plan for that? uh how do you plan around that and how do you plan for anticipary response um and uh other challenges such as energy transition uh for the hundreds of millions you know over 700 million

who don't have energy access the challenge in adopting these kinds of solutions we see a few different challenges um of why these things aren't being adopted quickly enough or adopted

at large enough scale uh so the first is I think as you mentioned Praep the issue of uh technical capacity, capacity and talent um you know to localize these

solutions to provide uh the local data pipelines for the solutions and um I think the issue is often not sensing but sensemaking right that analytical capacity to actually make use of these

insights that's one problem the second is uh I think institutional incentives often there is not an empowered decision maker who also has a budget to purchase such systems. Often decision-m is

distributed across many different institutions, ministries and so forth. Uh so there are politics involved and and and who actually can pay for these things. And then procurement systems are

not fit for purpose like people just don't understand what what it entails to u invest in a um you know national scale let's say or subnational scale intelligence system. Uh the third point

I I wanted to make and then maybe I'll hand the mic over is um I think there's something here about um I mean there are issues of trust but

there are also issues of um a lack of uh quantification of the both the economic case to invest and adopt such systems. um and and kind of a lack of quantification of the opportunity cost

of ignorance, right? So, so people think about these things as you know, you know, how do I how do I compare the cost of investing in this versus uh doing one-time surveys as opposed to will this

investment dramatically reduce costs uh for the whole system around let's say the the food system or physical infrastructure. So maybe those are some initial observations.

&gt;&gt; Those are great points. Uh Michael, thank you so much for sharing especially on the aspect of uh opportunity cost uh uh which which is sometimes fuzzy and people don't think about it. Um speaking

of opportunity cost uh uh at at India where you have so much of scale for addressing each of these issues infrastructure for AI has uh traditionally been a challenge but uh uh

of late uh several companies in uh and and big ones jumped into the AI infrastructure game. So my question to Golo directly feeds into that uh aspect which is uh since uh you you you're

working at Reliance you're heading the Reliance AI arm which is building a gigawatt scale AI ready data center uh how do you envision public private partnerships gorov uh and open data that

ensures that the AI infrastructure that we are building becomes a shared asset for economic growth of the nation across different domains energy finance climate So yeah would love to hear your thoughts

on that. &gt;&gt; Thanks again and for having me here. Can you hear me? Okay. &gt;&gt; Okay, that was too loud. Okay, so uh you know I'll probably start on why uh why

that massive infrastructure is needed uh you know and I'll take a you know go away from agriculture to other longstanding uh core problems in India countries like India. I won't call it

global south as Praep said he doesn't like we are in north so why are we calling ourselves global south it doesn't make sense geographically I think we should just go back to our

geography uh you know healthcare education let's pick on education uh while we talk about the magic of AI there are still tens of millions of kids if not hundreds

of millions of kids living in villages remote villages who don't have access to good schools or teachers I mean I'm talking about the ones who are really interested Ed in in studying

uh AI can solve problems for them like you know it's like we Indians have leaprogged so many times we didn't have you know we had trouble of getting phone lines I remember when I was a kid it

took years for us to get phone line so finally the mobile uh happened and there are more mobile connections than phone lines I think AI has that power to do the same for education healthcare you

will never have enough number of uh good doctors or good teachers but AI can do that but at what cost? We are talking about a kids

probably from a poor family or relatively weaker section of the society sitting in a village but they have good internet connection thanks to you know Jio and many others actually at at a

cost they can afford. Uh so but but you know if you look at the AI cost today uh this is interactive session in a you know like like a like a chatbot acting like a teacher speaking

in the same dialect let's say of the kid currently the cost of accessing that AI even with some hallucination is like 10 rupees per minute. Just imagine if a child wants to study

for 3 four hours in a day 240 minutes 10 rupees per minute 2,400 rupees. I mean that's not a solution for India. Uh it it sounds great and I think it sort of works. Uh you know I don't know

how many parents even in urban areas will be able to afford that kind of uh you know money. So I think in India uh uh anything you build at scale it has to be cost effective whether it is internet

connectivity whether it is transportation whether it is AI so one of the reasons now coming back to your question Praep I think the reason we have to have massive inflate every level

of the stack from energy sometimes we miss out on energy I mean in America people are having discussions about energy in fact many of the people who are not in the AI ecosystem they are

upset that their electricity prices are going up because of AI. I don't know how much of that is true but there has been discussions uh around that. So you need energy, you need uh data centers, you

need GPUs, you need uh AI frameworks, you need models and you need the applications. All right? So while to us it sounds like you know uh AI tutor or AI teacher is like just an application

but the cost the 10 rupees per minute that you are paying it going to every participant in that stack. So, so in India for us to get down to I don't know what is the affordable say

situation in this 2,400 is clearly not in my you know stupid mind I think it should not cost more than a glass of milk you know even if the person you know kid is poor they say okay I will

not drink milk today I'll rather study possibly right I mean uh so so more than it should not be more than 20 30 rupees so we had to come down to like you know 10 20 pesa per minute level from 10

rupees so it's like 100x lower it's not even 10x lower and the only way we can do is if we have GPUs is something tricky but every other part of the from energy to application

if we own when I say we I talk about ecosystem not just as part of my employer I think as a ecosystem we own in India instead of uh you know have to have to pay for it like we pay for oil

we have a better chance of getting to that reality so I I take the example of education because to me if we can't solve educ education, healthcare, long-standing problems for for the

largest mass of humanity which is in India. I think I think we as AI scientists should be ashamed of ourselves. So so only way we can do it is if we can bring the cost down and

hence that massive infrastructure built and largely owned here is important. That's the only way we can get to the cost uh levels that will work for us. I don't know if it answers your question

but it sort of covers it. No, absolutely. Uh the fact that AI infrastructure has to be made affordable uh to meet the the needs of India is one of the most important uh reasons why we

need to have our own sovereign uh AI capabilities across the stack. Um so thank you Gorov for answering that in detail from your uh perspective. My next question would be to Derek. uh Derek uh

you know there there have been now comments made already by the panelists on the affordability of AI, the adaptability of uh AI across different industries uh and also the aspect of

opportunity cost and ROI. U you have been uh heading so many initiatives at Accenture supporting large enterprises in their transformation. uh but uh mostly industrial AI initiatives that

begin as pilots right and uh only a few in the enterprises make it from pilot to actual system level scale uh where it becomes a part of your business process operating systems. So uh what from your

experience separates those few 10% maybe uh you know initiatives that actually cut the uh business case with uh your clientele. &gt;&gt; Uh

great question. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. So uh I'll take an actual example of something we executed. Uh so this was for a consumer product company um based in uh Poland. uh they

manufacture mayonnaise and the number of defects which defective miners either they don't adjust the set points too well so it comes out very uh very thick or it comes out very liquidy so to speak

right I mean so the problem statement was how do you recommend a set point to the operator so that you don't get a thick minis or a fluidy man so that's what we started off with

and we ran and the algorithms it learned but the most important aspect of it when we actually wanted to scale was earning the trust of the frontline operator. Okay. Uh so those guys are very

skeptical about the recommendations made. So we almost spent 7 months benchmarking a human operation with an agent recommendation. Okay. uh so so so in order for us to earn the trust they

have to see the data point so that's one dimension of scale I would say the second aspect of it is uh the incentives you design for the operator has to be aligned with it so the operator gets

incentivize he gets a production benefit right so the number of rejects is low he gets a production bonus so to speak now he began to see that production bonus which he's getting has when he uses AI.

Okay. And naturally his behavior started aligning. So one of the blind spots in scaling is designing incentives for the frontline folks so that they see that adoption of this this is a friendly guy

who's going to help you make money so to speak right if you're able to bridge the gap between the outcome of the operation to the outcome of the individual through incentive design. uh I I I think a lot

of alignment can happen and many people miss this human aspect of it. People respond to incentives and behaviors have to be modified. So that is one aspect of scaling actually the so the the mantra

for scaling for us is earning the trust. So it's a simple equation. Trust means reliability. Reliability of the tasks the agent is doing. Scalability for multiple plants. So we did it for

multiple countries, Poland, Thailand, India. So it was able to scale across multiple countries. It was able to scale across large volumes of data structured or unstructured. And last important

thing was it was able to align with the incentives for the operator. If you have so if any of these dimensions are missing no it would becomes uh part of the PC graveyard so to speak, right? So

you create a lot of some shiny new demos but it doesn't operationally scale and become but another important aspect of it is agents are like humans they'll fail. Okay. So one of the expectation we

had to set was don't look at the first instance of a recommend look at the seventh instance of it. So one of the metrics we introduced was what is the learnability of it. It's like a child

right it learns to crawl then walk and run right. So the rate at which it's raining uh learning is more important than the absolute performance of task in the initial phases. So understand that

expectation is set uh people start judging the first time the agent recommends. It's like no screaming at a child when it falls down he'll never learn right. So uh so and that's also

one learnability metrics are important part of scaling and if the learnometry so initially the reliability could be low but if the learnability is high eventually it'll catch up. Yeah.

That's that's a great example. Uh uh honestly uh when when uh even from our experience we have seen that unless the incentives are aligned whether it's uh at the core an AI initiative or any

digital initiative uh the success uh of uh an adoption in enterprises really happens. So thanks for sharing that anecdote uh Derek. Uh my next question uh is to Gorov. Gorov, you have been

leading the digital initiatives at ITC's perwood division for a while now and uh the kind of uh core business uh you are into is exposed very heavily to climate risk whether it's your procurement

planning uh the entire supply chain risk regulatory compliances. So how do you see uh AI changing your kind of business in the next you know 5 to seven years with everything that's happening around

and uh what do you see as uh gaps uh in connecting all of these uh elements of your business right thanks so I'll start off by saying that you

know my true belief is AI is here to augment human capacity right and if with that premise if we keep that in mind um you Humans have a certain way in which they think and in a certain way in which

they're able to do risk profiling for example AI is not there as yet right while I know it's the shiny object in the room but at the end of the day um you know it is it is not easy to crack

and get answers from from AI you know it could be we've and I I don't know how many people know especially youngsters who haven't seen the transformation from no AI to AI or no computers to AI. I

think the AI research started way back in 1950s, right? And and that's where we are, you know, here today where we all gathered here, you know, a lack and a half individuals buzzing around Bharat

Mandum to you know understand and unravel the mysteries of AI. So a it's not easy. Um right but having said that does it have a huge potential to unlock value as we move forward absolutely even

within our business or the other businesses that I've worked with. um you know we've seen a dramatic amount of uptake of machine learning or AI tools within our processes but I've realized

that in all cases it's only worked when we've actually taken a step back relooked our at our processes and really redesigned our processes uh and not the other way around. So we're not using AI

just from a sense of just you know it's a cool technology and let's go and figure out where it will fit but it's the other way around to really figure out what are those pain points uh that I

need to solve today which the human uh you know cannot do because maybe there is massive amounts of data that needs to be analyzed um and you know where can I really apply AI because everything

doesn't warrant you know AI to be applied or an agentic AI workflow to be applied but you know we can solve these in simple workflows as well. So really figuring out those problem statements

and then getting everybody around it. Now coming back to your other point of you know where do we see this unlock value yes at least from our business perspective and not only in the paper

business but all of ITC and there are a lot of FMCG c you know businesses as well across the globe you know which are you know reliant on the agri uh food chain. It could be uh you know

procurement for example we saw disruptions during COVID where our supply chains got disrupted. Uh you know things like the Swiss canal led to those disruptions led to supply chains getting

disrupted. So there are multiple of those uh areas where you know you will see disruption and when you actually see technology which can actually help you uh risk mitigate it can help you give

you alternatives of A versus B versus C help you simulate situations and scenarios you know that's where things started start getting real and the benefits start getting unlocked so it

you have to take it step by step uh and you have to take it um you know with everybody along and I you agree to what Derek said it's finally a change management problem. Um I think all of us

are smart enough to solve the technology challenges. Uh you know it will evolve you know mood's law played out really really well for all of us you know doubling capacity and you know

intelligence and stuff like that that's how we are here. So I think we will solve for all of that as as humankind but I think we have to take everybody along and I think that's important right

we seeing three outcomes uh you know that that will that are playing out today for for our business and it will continue to play out as we go forward and only get magnified. One is that we

seeing efficiency improvements uh productivity improvement efficiency improvement bottom line impact through the application of AI. Second, we are seeing new value, new revenue stream,

business models getting unlocked uh from a revenue uptake perspective from a business standpoint. And third, most importantly is the whole aspect of societal impact, it could be

sustainability, it could be safety in the shop floor. All right. So those are very very important outcomes and we are seeing an impact of AI across these three outcomes and I think it is only

get magnified as we move forward. &gt;&gt; Those are excellent points, Gorov. Thank you so much for sharing and I like it how uh everyone points seem to be interconnected making my job easy. So so

uh the change management aspect is is something which uh people do not speak about much because usually I have seen at least from my experience that that's the reason of going over from P to

actual scale uh and managing that as process is very important indeed. uh it leads to the next question I actually have for you Michael because you have been uh part of uh architecting so many

different uh initiatives uh across uh uh agriculture, water, climate risk across the world and uh there is a saying that you build for India uh then you build for the world.

Would you agree with that? How do you see it structurally same or there are nuances and differences when you try to uh scale systems that are built uh in India across let's say Africa East

Africa Africa also use I should say one part of Africa yeah I think India is an amazing sandbox but some elements of this translate some do

not so you know a few I think obvious points one is around digital public infrastructure All right. Um and and the the the different layers that India has that are quite well

developed simply do not exist in in many other places. And so that that is one constraint where you can no you cannot plug and play when when those DPIs are not in place. Uh I think the second

place is uh the second point I think is around scale. India's scale allows for certain kinds of business models that are just not viable in a place like Rwanda with a 10

million person population or Kenya with a 40 million person population. Um and so you need some business model innovation uh to actually be able to make these

models work. But I think the the third really comes back to this point of uh change management and institutional design like the boring plumbing of actually transferring innovation. That

boring plumbing is uh really really difficult and timeconuming and requires partnering locally you know and and actually actually building local ecosystem. For example, building local

ecosystems of developers that can localize solutions that can develop the local data pipelines that can develop the local local benchmarks that u and and that inherently will have more trust

from the local ecosystem and more entry points to adapt the Indian innovation. That's that's uh great to to understand that uh you know we do have pathway for scaling innovations uh uh from India to

uh other parts of the world as well with the limitations of and and let's say caution. Uh so thank you Michael uh for for answering that. My next question is uh again back to Gorov uh Gorov if India

were to design a true planet scale intelligence stack which spans telecom networks uh agriculture climate financial systems energy what architectural choices would determine

whether it becomes a growth engine uh you know for the nation and and uh you know that's something which also becomes u let's say a system that others could also emulate elsewhere.

&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, uh it's fascinating. I think in this case, India differs from west definitely. Again, if you look at the uh you know look at let's say WhatsApp chats of of your bluecollar workers,

your maid, your cooks, your drivers. I mean you should not do it but still let's say you have seen it. Uh they are full of voice notes. I have never used a voice note in in my

WhatsApp or anything. I was very surprised first time I looked at it. um you won't see that very commonly in the west at least till now I don't know if things have changed but

the reason is we are comfortable we are like typing junkies like that's how we grew up but the rest of the bharat as we call it right I mean they don't have access to computers uh they have mobile

phones which are not very good computer devices and they don't know English that well uh many of them don't know even their mother tongue that well they can speak in their mother tongue uh other

thing is like uh you know while we talk about digitization and these smart devices, smartphones. I mean try typing in your mother tongue [snorts] and good luck with that all the matras and

everything you know. So good luck with that. It's going to take double the time. So voice is the new typing in India in countries like India. Uh but instead of voice notes just

imagine if uh if your new interface of everything you do is voice then it is as good as typing. So I think uh you know so the reason I'm giving this anecdotus is it's not just

about the scale but the reality of of the of the people the masses that we are creating with we have to understand that it's kind of different I mean you can try to scale chity Gemini as much as you

want in the current avatar but till uh till they became voice first interfaces there's no adoption there was no adoption I mean they were just fancy gadgets as someone said right

they So I think those are the realities. So the text tech that we build here not only it has to be cost effective. Uh but also it has to understand the realities

of India and and we India is a very smart very people call them price sensitive. I think we are careful with our money. You know we will pay for anything uh as long

as it makes sense. So the same will be true for a especially again beyond the you know top 20 30 million population. I think they will pay for it as long as it it makes sense. It's serves their lives

in a good way. Like there is probably hardly anyone in India remaining who doesn't have a you know a data connection a mobile data connection. I mean it's cost five six rupees a day 7

rupees a day and and they get enough out of it maybe entertainment but it serves their needs you know human needs. So I think same thing will happen with AI whether it is their needs to

uh to solve their you know issues or or getformational uh content regarding a benefit from the government or whether it is booking a ticket whether anything as long as it

you know it sort of serves a need that is critical to them at a price they can afford I think you will do it. So I think I will not go back to the technical part of the stack. I think

that we have covered the scale and the cost of sustaining that scale is important but I think we have to understand the use cases that are critical to the Indian needs and and and

I think some of those are human needs actually you know uh you know as I started my response with it's not like we were born with the ability to type we were born with the ability to speak so I

think many of these needs uh you know maybe because of we still being a developing nation they are or are the educational standards are not as as you know at par with the west but I think

they just remind us those are the basic human capabilities and AI has to come to that rather humans having to learn something to use AI so I think that is the sort of the spin we have to realize

and I I think many of the western countries are realizing for companies like Reliance it is the bread and butter uh right I mean so if we don't do it there's no mass adoption and and at

least the larger corporations in India they rely on mass adoption. Uh right uh that is that is their core sort of business acumen and and so that the stack has to cater to those needs, cater

to those uh human capabilities rather than just putting it out there and assuming people will learn it you know figure it out. So like like every other system

essentially at the top of the business ar business architecture are the choices the requirements the needs uh that you are trying to solve. So that's that's a great point and it it brings back

everyone to the first principle thinking uh that for whom are we solving essentially. So thank you uh Gorov uh for that nuanced answer. Um Derek you know you have gone from

building flutra which was focused on industrial AI uh to now leading the industrial AI practice within uh uh the accenture. So in that in that journey what fundamentally changed uh your

understanding of what makes intellig intelligence durable uh especially in uh physical systems uh that operate under climate stress. Now why I'm asking this question is because uh your uh uh work

actually spreads across different kinds of uh uh industrial uh verticals right and uh uh those are the those are the places where the impact of climate uh is is highest on physical existing uh

systems machinery logistics supply chain uh it would be great to have your perspective on that because uh again it boils down to uh the question of whether we can build one general you know uh AI

that solves for all or do we have to actually make choices specific sometimes uh to the problem that uh we are solving at hand. So as a startup actually you're on a

speedboard. You are zigzagging. You can quickly maneuver. But when you're part of a large corporate, you're on an oil tanker. It moves very slowly but steadily so to speak, right? Uh so but

but big difference I saw in in the in the industrial AI side is as a startup we were not selling outcomes. We are selling products and features. But a large company uh has the ability to

guarantee outcomes, put skin in the game [snorts] and absorb the risk of not meeting that outcome. It's a big difference. So they can strike mega deals with that. Right?

So that's the difference. I I'll bring it alive with an example. Uh and and this is something. So if you look at uh refinery, right? Many refineries are situated in the heart of communities.

For example, BPCL is in the middle of Mumbai city, right? U and they're always emitting gases for example methane gases what it gets into the community. So by law

we are required to monitor the emission of dangerous chemicals into the community so to speak. So we're working for this customer in Houston and so if you look at a there's a company called

Marathon Oil in 2025 they fined about 240 million because of the excess amount of methane they emitted into the community that's a big number right so if you look at traditional monitoring

which was done you had sensors placed and sensors have that blind spots it you can't instrument the whole refinery so to speak right so what what today is available is drone in. So what what they

did actually was this refinery. Uh so it it had various dexes of so you will have a drone flying over at a low altitude. It can detect the presence of dangerous gases and it can also isolate the

particular valve from which it is leaking. So it can really zoom in and say this is where the root cause of the problem. So there is a drone scan on it and now you have even satellite scan on

it. So satellite is observing at a higher altitude the emission of methane gases and what is the dispersion rate into the community and stuff like that. Drone has a limited range and they can

also benchmark two refineries this is emitting more in the than less and all of that. So so if you look at the uh monitoring it has gone out of the fence earlier it was inside the fence but now

you're gone on a larger span. So you're looking at different textures of data. You're looking at vision data. Then you have to look at local law. So in this case what we wanted to do was uh what we

actually did rather was we looked at the vision data which AI models were there. It'll detect the presence or absence of methane and then there are two types of laws. One is a federal law which says

how much emission is possible and there are so many clauses in it and then each state has its local state laws. California has a very tight law whereas Texas because of the lobbying it's very

loose okay loose set of laws. So so the agent had to look at emission data the agent had to look at federal laws. The agent had to look at local laws and project the risk out of non-compliance

to it. Okay. So you're looking at structured data unstructured and suddenly what you have is a set of clauses becomes your knowledge graph on which the agent acts and reasons out

saying that you're not complex. So and and this enables a tighter guaranteeing of outcomes because you're looking at a much more broader spectrum of data. U I I call it three eyes right? You know if

you look at an oil and gas operation you have eyes on the sky right you have eyes on the ground sometimes you have spot robo or sensors and if you are having an underwater operation you have underwater

rovers right you have three eyes so your perception actually gets dramatically magnified when when you have the size and that allows you to promise a lot of uh outcomes to the customer so

it's that's very interesting uh to know Derek uh uh These are uh stories that are not found on unfortunately still on AI you know one has to actually come and listen uh to experience. So thank you

for sharing those anecdotes. Uh Gorov uh um c you highlighted previously uh about uh you know the key trends that you see affecting your business uh and also uh how uh the aspect of change

management is important. Um since you have been in the center of AI tech product business uh in your role uh at ITC uh what are the things that people don't really talk about when it

comes to AI implementation? Um if you could touch upon things around cost the risk of errors uh on the business uh the impact it these have in terms of actual adoption and scaling across enterprises

uh I think that would be great uh learnings uh for uh the entire audience especially given IT's reputation of being an AI first organization. Uh so like I was mentioning earlier

right while it's not easy um you know there is there has to be a concerted effort and um you know a method to the madness if I would sort of say today right because uh at the end of the day I

think what we've sort of realized the golden you know source for us uh is to make sure that everything hinged is hinged around a problem statement that we are trying to solve right uh so as

long as we are able to find out what problem statement we are trying to solve. uh and then work backwards from there on saying what are the business process how do I reimagine it to what is

the data requirement because data becomes the fundamental uh you know uh bedrock for any AI model to work right um and then work myself back to say what model will help me solve it what are the

outcomes I'm looking at um I think that process sort of has sort of ste us in you know worked for us and um you know at at the end of the day help us deliver value. Now we are very very diverse

conglomerate and a very diverse business. So if I look at my agri business you know it could be things around drone tech satellite imagery. If I look at my paper business again we

trying to find out you know with specifically regulations and you were talking in the previous uh this thing about regulations like there is a European Union deforestation regulation

which asks us to map every plot from where I'm actually procuring wood which goes into making paper for example. So I can't do that without uh you know the uh uh you know the power of AI at the end

of the day and also without the power of satellite imagery and geospatial tagging and things like that. So every business if I go into my foods business then it is about deploying AI for maybe an ad

campaign that we are running right. So earlier we used to do filming uh get artists do scripting you know all of that has now been transformed in you know using with the power of AI where I

can create digital aftars uh convert them into real life aars convert that into a DVC you know before I actually take it to market and I can I can specifically do an ad campaign uh you

know on every geography it could be a pin code level it you know it it depends on you what are the genre and who is actually looking at it what is the TG so I can actually create so it gives me a

lot of flexibility but at the end of the day you know when you have to do this you have to take baby steps uh and like you were mentioning earlier right it has to the baby has to crawl before it can

start running and that's sort of very very important so we've sort of taken it uh you know stepby-step process making sure that whether it's my manufacturing process whether it is you know my risks

and compliance from a finance perspective or whether it is my supply chain making sure that I have you know high a high high degree of OTF numbers which is on time and full you know

numbers back to my customers or it is customer experience at the end of the day or engagement uh you know with the community on products uh that we want to really build like there's a new product

which sort of we we launched something called right shift which is for uh adults of 40 and 40 plus now some of those came out of the insights uh you know that our AI engine threw to say

that this is a you know a segment that people are actually looking for and there aren't really you know products available in the market which cater to that segment so a lot of insights which

come back from AI action is taken and then AI is used to maybe take that back to market so that whole loop needs to get closed at the end of the day right in all of this there are obviously

challenges like we spoke about people people process technology that's the way I look at And still today we our fundamental belief is that people remain at the

bedrock of making sure that all of this happens and the value gets unlocked. The second piece is we are we have a relentless focus on quality and that's where we see most of our AI deployment

to make sure that the quality the product that we deliver back to the masses uh you know is supreme quality and that's where we differentiate ourselves and we continue to. So we

we're an organization which is obsessed with quality. So whether it's vision systems, whether it's deployment of AI algorithms, across factories, you know, across product lines, you know, quality

becomes quality becomes uh, you know, one cornerstone that we look at, you know, a lot of our use cases getting employed. &gt;&gt; Thanks, that's a very rounded and

wholesome answer. uh and I think uh I am feeling a lot more enriched with the last 1 hour of insights concentrated insights that uh I have received. I'm sure the audience feels the same way. So

thank you so much uh uh everyone Michael Gorov Gorov and Derek uh for being on the panel with us. In the interest of time since I can see there's a timer there uh

we uh would like to conclude the session uh where I pass on uh the the mic to my colleagueuh Diva for a quick closing remark by my co-founder Rashm. Um over to you D.

&gt;&gt; Uh what emerged clearly today is this intelligence does not scale because models are large. It scales because systems are aligned. We have heard about localization for equitable access. We

have heard about institutionalizing the design and plumbing. Uh change management, sovereign AI infrastructure for cost effectiveness and also business viability and value creation. Before we

formally conclude, as Pratep was mentioning, I would like to invite Rashmit Singh Sukmani, our CTO at Satar to share some closing remarks and reflection from technology perspective.

I think after a long time I've uh seen such a deeper discussion especially on the AI part right I've been a firm believer where AI cannot be just a image interpreter or data interpreter and then

that's a journey of what we have been seeing in last two years it has become more like a contextual intelligence layer embedded inside platform shaping data workflows data and connecting the

decisions end to end of it and I think we as an industry are moving towards that right uh I'll not take much of time in the interest of the time as well uh the three thing that I have identified

based on the conversation here uh the first one is definitely we all have to go away from the project thinking to more like an intelligence infrastructure I think that was one of

the key outcome that has came up uh second from analytics to decision authority this is where we want AI more like a compliment impmenting a kind of a service not like a replacing a human.

Yeah. Uh the third one would be the compute capacity to decision economics. I think that option the compute infrastructure the great point that you made especially on the GPU and the

example that you gave on the education. I think this is where it's not just the model a bpoke model that's going to solve uh the issue. It's more like a system architecture which has to be now

powered by the infrastructure more from a system thinking point of view and that has to be reflected more in terms of algorithm your design around that and finally

I think uh it is important that uh today uh we architect interable intelligence system that can span chips, compute, sensing models, applications, energies and institutions. uh this

requires coordination not fragmentation meaning definitely as you look at like everyone has to come together it's not like some big companies are built link but someone has to also utilize that and

we Indians are especially great at apply intelligence and I think we'll be playing that part especially from the not from the global south but somewhere in the northern geog northern hemisphere

uh then leadership and it's not experimentation I think there should be a proper thought leadership ersship around AI as a strategy not like a a component of your infrastructure as

such. Uh one final thing it has to now become a n national capability. We have been talking about foundational model. We have been talking about system architecture as such. Right now we all

have to think from an angle of how can it become a national capability where everyone as a citizen can utilize those services. With that I'll hand over to Dya to take it forward from here. Thank

you. Thank you Rashid and we would like to now present a token of appreciation for all the esteemed panelists and thank you for your time and insights and I will

call upon my colleagues to do that if I may. So we have gorataria sir. Did I write from here? I
