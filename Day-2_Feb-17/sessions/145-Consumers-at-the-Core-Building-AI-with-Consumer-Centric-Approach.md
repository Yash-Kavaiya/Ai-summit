## 📝 Transcript

Thank you once again everyone for joining us uh today and and in fact thank you uh government of India and ministry of electronics and IT to give us this opportunity to host this panel.

uh I think the most unique thing about this panel we were talking about all of our co- panelist is there's a one session which is completely focused on consumer empowerment uh which is somehow

is an important element and needs to be there in when we discuss any new and emerging technology as part of it. So uh before I jump into inviting our speakers to share their views and perspective, I

just wanted to share few elements for everyone to think around those aspects when we are looking at how AI helps on consumer empowerment and how AI also creates risks and I'll try to give

smaller one or two examples which are very specific to India at this point of time. How AI helps to be consumer centric. It's basically it helps you to have personal recommendations and

services. It incre in increases the decision making time over there. Uh it provides you a 247 digital assistance which increases the accessibility part of it.

uh there is a real-time risk monitoring which increases because of AI if you look from a consumer perspective and also there's the new language AI which has come which helps you to go beyond

English specifically looking at the regional languages two very recent examples is how the banks are using AI specifically from a fraud detection and monitoring perspective and how effective

they have been the second example is how telos and all are using the voice-based AI chatbot eosystem systems which are more regional into nature if you look at it over there.

But if I quickly look at what the risk that are emerging from AI from a consumer empowerment perspective, uh the most crucial part is there's a

opaque automated decision making which the consumer is difficult to challenge or kind of question those over there. uh there is deep fakes, audios and videos which has the impersonalization and I'll

talk about an example also about it. Uh there is hyper personalized targeting which is which knows too much about the person and tries to use those emotional questions

to influence your buying behavior. And lastly is is again how do you hallucinate AI for giving you the wrong decisions as part of it. two specific act examples again if you look at the

kind of impersonization has happened on fake deep fakes AI videos for people to take financial decisions using finance ministers pictures and others also as part of that over there so with that

background I think I'd like to first invite our keynote speaker uh Mr. Rohit Mah Singh, former secretary government of India and he was also member of NCDRC and I think sir you led the entire AI

part at consumer affairs at the initial. So we wanted to hear from you more in terms of where do you see the risk where do you see the answers to those risk and also specific recommendation that we

should look at as a follow-up from the action summit uh sorry impact summit specifically which we should take as a recommendation to the government. So &gt;&gt; that's

that's old school. Good evening everyone. First of all, let me thank the organizers for uh calling me here. I retired from the government one and a half years back. So it's good to be back

in a suit and a tie after a while. Uh my last posting was uh secretary department of consumer affairs and then I moved to member national consumer dispute redressal commission NCDRC.

Then I quit for some personal reasons. I'm a techie by education and have done many assignments in government of India and state government of Rajasthan on technology

and uh I'm amazed to see the energy at this summit and uh this summit is different. I follow what is happening in global AI and I followed what happened at Blessley

Park and then Paris but this one is different. I think what this has done is has been able to put people at the center.

So while US and China can fight over who has the most efficient LLM whether it is you know Claude or Gemini or Chad GPT or Deep Seek or whatever hidden is being developed in

China. I think when it comes to shaping responsible AI I see India has a role to play and India should play it very aggressively

as in the times of Mrs. is Indra Gandhi you know we headed something called the non-aligned movement the Russia was this side and US was the western powers were the other were on

the other side and we played the middle game and we were good at it so I think the time has come to use that principle now coming to consumers and revolutions whether technology or

other revolutions any revolution it changes the balance of Visa v the consumer when we were buying from the corner stores the mom and pop shops the kirana

dhan there was a different dynamic between the buyer and the seller the whole equation was different and then 10 15 years back the amazon and the flip cards started coming and grabbing that

space and the whole power equation changed so consumer became became less and less powerful and the seller became more and more powerful.

Now with the advent of AI this balance, this power distribution redistribution is going to further aggravate and we need to be very careful because unlike the other technologies, this is

transformative. This is going to be a way of life. This is not like digital revolution. This is an age of intelligence. So it's going to make a lot of difference which are

already visible. So we have to all of us all stakeholders have to take a call that when this redistribution happens whether we are able to put some in favor

of the consumer or everything will be governed by opaque systems which consumers neither understand nor control. So AI is very powerful in the consumer

game as the previous speaker said you know it can either exploit the consumer or empower the consumer. It can do partly both. It will depend on the systems on the regulators, the

government, the developers and most importantly the consumers as to how this is going to play out. If it empowers, it's going to democratize access, which it has done. Although the $20 bill of

chat GBT still hurts when you convert it into rupees, but it has democratized. It has reduced cost. It has improved access. But when it comes to exploitation,

the manipulative algorithms which are leading to unfair trading practices are abundant. When I was secretary consumer affairs two years back, we did an analysis as to how these

online platforms are heavily indulging in what we called the dark patterns. They are manipulating the consumer behavior. They are nudging the consumer to go in a direction

without your intent and it is harming the relationship which was fair between the consumer and the seller. Then there is of course algorithmic discrimination. If you're looking for a credit score and

your residence is not very he, you will get a bad credit score. Your insurance premiums, everything. So there is algorithmic discrimination which is mostly beyond our control. There is

privacy invasion. You starting from a simple you go to any shop. I went to my barber yesterday and he said not the regular one and the lady said sir can I have your phone

number. I said no because the moment it gets into that system and when I was in the government we had issued guidelines that no seller can force you to give your telephone number unless you want

to. I had a little tiff at a store which I will name because without naming you can't shame them. Decathlon I went to the Ansul Plaza decathlon and the lady there I wanted to buy a

basketball and said sir you can't buy unless you give your phone number so I said no I will not give you a phone number but I still want to buy of course I didn't tell her who I was at that time

I was the secretary so I could have I had more weight I could have thrown it around I didn't so uh she said sir the way our software is there in the posos the terminal I have to put a number so I

said you put your her and then she talked to her manager and put her number. That's how strangulating this whole thing is about privacy. We don't realize that every day we are sharing so

much information and it's all it's all being embedded there. Nothing is being deleted in the digital world. If you think by deleting your account, by deleting a file, you're deleting

anything. You are not. It's all there. So people, some people don't bother about privacy. They will put every half an hour something on the Facebook or Twitter or Instagram

I did this I did that so that's good for them but people who want to vehemently protect their privacy which I think many of us should we should be careful and this AIdriven technology is going to

take it away without your knowing about it and of course there is lot of fraud so all these conferences that are taking place they must realize that at the center of

AI governance is the consumer. So ideally this rule should have been the most covered which I hope it will be when you have the next session and uh because everywhere you want to buy

something your insurance premium j medical decisions online content everything is driven by this again I will name them we ran a an investigation on Uber

if you are buying the Right? It depends what phone are you using. If you're using an expensive phone versus a cheap phone, the rates will be

different. We did it. Same thing happens when you're shopping online. I worked under Mr. P who was my minister and we did it together. We sat next to each other in his office and we

bought something from Amazon. I said, "Sir, you use your the other phone." He of course had the expensive phone. And then we realized that the rates we are getting from the same portal sitting

next to each other were different more if your battery is running low your Uber cost will come higher because the algorithm knows that you are desperate and if your battery is less than 20%

your cost will be higher. So these are the things which are happening unintentionally and we should be very very wary. So where where this all this is leading to I think the the currency

of AI is trust. So if we demolish directly indirectly partly the trust then we are going to destroy this relationship between consumer and the

seller which is going to be very very bad. And uh a lot of people say lot of uh techies including my son they say that you know if you put too much into regulation and

trust you are stifling innovation. Partly true. So we have to see which point on the development curve we are. If you are very new and things are just for example let's say three years back

when maybe chart GPT was just launched two and a half years back on that point if you regulate too much of course you will stifle innovation but three year hence when it is becoming part of

everybody's life you have to regulate otherwise it'll cause so much harm so since I had to do some government kind of stuff so I wrote that what should be the five pillars of

consumer centric AI. First and foremost of course is transparency. When I am using AI I should know what is it doing. Am I talking to a person? Am I talking to a bot?

Does he know everything about my background or am I the is it the first interface or they have information plus is it just pattern matching which a lot of LLMs do or is there a reasoning which

some of them started doing. So the consumer should know how the interface is being driven by AI or not. The second is accountability. If I do get harmed, if the consumer gets

harmed, then who is responsible? If chat GPT sessions are leading someone to a suicide or I read just this morning that somebody made a bomb out of a clawed prompt. So who's responsible if you're

getting into that extreme situation? Is the user solely responsible or is there responsibility on the system on the algorithm or whatever is being used? So that has to be clear. Third of course is

fairness and uh non-discrimination. We just spoke about the kind of phones that you use and you get even otherwise fairness will depend on what algorithms what data was it trained on. If it is

trained on western data and an Indian guy is looking at a solution obviously he will get he or she will get answers biased towards the western world. So those biases have to be removed if not

removed have to be reduced to a minimum. Then we spoke about privacy and data protection which is the fourth pillar and the fifth is accessibility and inclusion. sitting in the heart of Delhi

in air conditioned bhat mandapam we are chatting about AI but what about the guy you know 500 kilometers away 5,000 km away 3,000 km away of course a lot of use cases I was very happy to read

yesterday's Indian express maybe uh I still read newspapers old school there was very good examples of how AI use cases are being promoted in three of my favorite areas, education, healthcare

and agriculture. And if you're pushing that then the people who are supposed to use that they have to be included in terms of access to technology, regional languages, the local context etc etc. So

uh in the end I want to say that technology is changing exponentially human capability is not. So people who talked about AGI and super intelligence it is true it will happen

and we will be left behind. So because human capability is limited and in the end all of us stakeholders including those sitting the high and mighty on the panel we have to decide where consumers

are just data points or empowered participants. Thank you very much. [applause] &gt;&gt; Thank you sir. Uh I think I'll just take your permission to add one more pillar

to that and specifically connecting to your point in terms of the audience numbers. I think that consumer empowerment has to change to consumer awareness and knowing your rights. I

think that is still a very limited element. it is still available maybe in this room or maybe not in this room itself but that has to go to a large so knowing your rights why you're giving

those data points and what you get is a most important thing that has to come from uh AI as principles as we speak uh so we have exact 27 minutes 2 minutes for me for asking the questions and five

minutes each speaker so I'll request everyone to be very to the point and to the specific recommendation that they want uh for either the industry or the government or academia or state civil

society to work together or specific actions. So I'll start with uh Sarita ma'am I think you you you're looking at the entire DPRG part and I think DPRG has been very actively using AI now what

we have been seeing specifically addressing public grievances and also improving the functioning governance part of it. So could you give it a overview of what are these initiatives

and how it has helped the ministry specifically because you handle the biggest number of consumers that even a big tech company can also handle. Good evening.

&gt;&gt; Good evening to all. Uh yes, the department of administrative reforms and public revances has been in the forefront of creating an enabling ecosystem

for development of e-services. As we all know that digitization is the prerequisite for enhancement of services through the application of specific AI models and this ecosystem is developed

with the help of the developers, the uh scientists, the technologists and also the administrators in the field who are the first or a level of consumers who will develop up these uh

platforms, the digital public infrastructure platforms with the use of the latest technology for the consumers which are mostly the citizens and the consumers in case of uh the government

is of course the uh whole of citizenry. Different target groups are of course there and one of the important aspects that is handled which is very important for the government is of course the

grievances. So as the government provides the services, the feedback of the citizens and the grievances of the citizens are centric to the success of any governance and therefore the present

government working on the the policy of the government of India is uh maximum governance, minimum government and at the same time ska sad, subka vikas, subka prias as we know. So basically

governance for the people truly can happen with the help of the next generation administrative reforms which are embarked upon through digitization. As a young DC uh 20 years back uh we

really struggled to have that ecosystem trying to know from where to get the knowledge partners from where to have the funds how to converge them and of course the developers themselves. Today

we are seeking out people from the DRPG who want to develop such infrastructures for the citizenry. The objective being obviously transparency in the delivery of services.

Inclusion to the last mile. No one is to be left out. The holistic development is another goal towards which the AI models can be developed. Of course, the predictive analytics uh analytical

models and the uh generative uh AI models are used to a large extent and the DRPG encourages the dissemination also of the uh innovations in the field of digital public infrastructure through

the recognitions through national award for egovernance which is uh given since 2003. The very development of the categories and the award indicates how the evolution of these digitization and

adoption of technology has happened from the very basic digitizations for citizen services to now using AI for even the pandemic responses and mitigation of disasters. The awards if you see there

is a specific category for the use of AI and emerging technologies and therein there are some of the remarkable ones which include areas of bhashini you must have heard digi yatra all of you must

have heard but I wonder if you've heard about nadrris this is a AI and ML trained model developed by the scientist uh by the for predicting the diseases in livestock

So the way they work on the data depending on what are the climatic conditions depending on what are the uh of course the samples are also drawn because livestock is a very important

area of livelihood for our country and is the fastest growing sector also here the loss of livestock is a loss of uh livelihood it's a loss of loss to the economy uh which is uh many times than

what you find in agriculture purely sector. So similarly at the state level if we see you would find use of AI in cases such as Voka Sati this is again a an initiative which is developed in Asam

in the northeast. This is helping the citizens through uh the chatbots for uh easy access to uh at one place to all the services and also faster grievances. This these are the use case models the

best practices from across the country which you see which the DRPG is encouraging through its games. &gt;&gt; Thank you ma'am. I think some interesting stories uh and examples that

you have shared. I think we need to promote these more to understand specifically the stockp. Uh I'll come to Arin and Arin because consumer international works a lot around a lot

of jurisdictions around 100 plus. So my primary question to you is do you see across governments or industries present in these geographies uh AI by AI by design keeping consumer centric approach

is there uh is it more of a compliance mechanism or is it more of a self-regulation approach that they're seeing and a followup to that is what are the common minimum framework that is

required irrespect of a jurisdiction because always companies use those aspect of this is what has followed in US this has followed in UK EU so how do we come to a common minimum program on

that from a consumer centric perspective &gt;&gt; thank you a lot to cover in five minutes um hi everyone just want to say thank you for being here thanks for inviting us to be on this panel um I am with

consumers international as Koshel said consumers international is a federation of consumer advocacy groups so there are different advocacy organizations in different countries. We have the

pleasure of having two on this panel today. Um, and we represent more than 200 different consumer advocacy organizations across 100 different countries. The majority of these uh

consumer advocacy groups are in the global south. Um, and we take the different um visions that we see with these different members and we're able to represent them at the international

level and in global forums like this one today. Um so what's so interesting about the case of AI is that we're seeing so many different um things play out in different countries. So we just had a

meeting last week with some different members and they come forward from different countries and represent basically that they're having very different experiences in these different

countries and while there might be one consumer experience in one country it's very different than another. So when we start talking about what are the baseline things we might need to put

consumers at the center um when we talk about consumer rights at consumers international we're often talking about the United Nations guidelines for consumer protection which are basically

the bed the bedrock of consumer protection um at the UN and which consumers international was uh involved in drafting. So when we talk about these consumer rights and how they're acting

in different countries, we are basically seeing that the experience is very varied across different countries. Um but our members do a lot of work and then they come to us to look into what

can be the global trends um and what can be the main principles that we take uh forward and when it comes to different principles for AI and consumer centric AI a lot of what we're talking about now

is kind of three things one is um transparency so I think this has come up a couple of times already in this panel but consumers need to know when they're using an AI and what this means for

them. Um, consumers often end up interacting with AI systems and they're not aware that they're doing so or what it means for their data. So, when we talk about consumers, we're often

assuming that a consumer has an informed choice to use a product or service. But when you have an AI system where they're not aware of it, then how can we call them a consumer that knows what's

happening um with that product? Another important aspect that we're really looking into is data privacy. Um we've seen that there are the limits of individualized consent when it comes to

data privacy. Um and we've seen all the issues that consumers face when it comes to evaluating what data they will share. often they don't know what it means for them to share that data. So, um I

encourage everyone to look forward to some of the work we're doing this year which will focus on data privacy and AI um and thinking about how we can see it as a public good actually as something

that data is very social. We interact with each other. We share data. Um it's no longer an individual thing to be to be looked at in such an individualistic manner. And then the other thing we're

talking about is adoption and quality. So there's so much movement towards getting people to adopt and participate in new AI products and services. Uh we've seen this a lot I think in the

last months with Aentic AI for example. Um, and at Consumers International, we're really concerned with not just adoption, that we have consumers using new products and services, but that the

quality is high and that that leaves consumers in a place where they feel empowered and where they are resilient uh when they're using a given product or service. So, these are kind of three

three points that I would say kind of can underpin such vastly different experiences. Um, but what's so great about the work that we do uh at Consumers International

is that even though we have all of these different members with such different experiences and different emerging opportunities and risks that they're seeing in their country, uh we're able

to kind of bring those together, see those global trends um and represent the consumer voice uh in places like this one. So, thank you so much. &gt;&gt; Thank you Arin. I think uh just to add

to your point, I think one thing which the government is very looking is democratizing the AI resources. So in a similar DPI format, the entire GPU framework is being looked at which is

around 38,000 which has been allocated right now. So it's a again in a DPI framework itself. I'll move to aim and then a very specific question over here is if I look at a consumer pattern for

entire life cycle of a consumer which are the very specific areas uh sorry this is a question to see. So if you look at a consumer behavior entire pattern of a consumer decision

making which are the very specific areas where you think AI influences the decision or empowers the consumer a lot and what are the risk associated in that entire journey from an identification to

the final purchase and the services and where can consumer organization like voice specifically work on those pillars. &gt;&gt; Great. So I'll come to the conclusion.

Thank you very much for inviting me to this uh discussion. I think I'm going to start with the conclusion first. very strange but then that explains most of your question uh as an answer and I'll

try to explain it without mandatory accountability bias audits stricter enforcement under the consumer protection act and I'm sticking to my domain of consumer

protection act especially for high-risk AI in finance and e-commerce these risk could deepen the [clears throat] exclusion of vulnerable consumer turning potential empower government into

exploitation. Now this is something of a mindset. We are all slaves of AI. We all know that as as consumers we travel with completely AI enabled systems. Uh we buy e-commerce or generally nowadays uh

through UPI and other modes which are again AI enabled. So most of the things we are doing as consumers are UPI enabled or uh AI enabled. question here is basically is the consumer awareness

or what he's doing and how he's using AI uh relevant and if it is relevant then how much it is being practiced and who's the practice practitioner here it is the the companies who are the AI enablers

and as consumers we will say that we are dependent on you uh we are fully confident that you will serve us best with the AI it's very good it actually is a turning point for many government

schemes it from our consumer affairs if you look at the uh research that that has been done in terms of a report 2025 end report uh the graak chat box have facilitated rupees 36 46 cr in refunds

which is fantastic we couldn't dream that earlier on through the manual process AI has enabled that And because the system operates on a on AI, we obviously also have the language factor.

This is taking the same example. It is in 17 languages. So language is well covered here. AI enabled in fact and also AI assisted complaint filing again helping the consumers. These are very

very good things. But again these are run by government after due diligence. Are the corporates doing the same? Are the brands doing the same? We have our own doubt and risk management therefore

is paramount on this particular factor. As far as consumer mindset is concerned, when you travel, it has been uh said that it has been observed that you share your phone number 46 times. You share

your photographs. Think about it. when you travel next you share your photograph 11 times and you share your personal data to an extent date of birth and birth and other things uh at least

24 times this is something which is troubling because AI takes over that and what is happening to your data we don't know so in conclusion of this five minute unfortunate break I must say that

uh uh AI amplified dark patterns Roji already said that dark dark patterns are today into our lives as a bad patch. Everything is dark pattern and for those

of you who don't know dark pattern it is those numbers that crop up two seats left last two boxes for sale. I'm just giving you example for understanding. In fact, algorithms we are just fighting

for algorithm uh rhythm uh understanding. Why algorithms are developed without consumer consent or without consumer participations. They can be told you know to participate and

probably we can contribute. Manipulative personalization is something that is happening every day. Okay, I think Koshel himself gave an example and deep fakes as we know that AI is now totally

responsible for deep fakes and misleading the purchases in fact. So the pros and cons or well balanced out as Rohit G said this is the time to act for the government to take a decision does

it need a regulation or let it free flow. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you. uh in fact and that's why I wanted to come next to you is a follow-up question is which are the

sectors where you see actually consumer getting impacted because you work very actively in consumer grievance management and second thing is we have seen in a lot of sectors specifically

banking and financial where SRO framework has worked a self-regulatory organization where consumer groups think tanks they come or they form SRO and they are taking the burden from the

regulator but the benefit is because they work with industry they are better at that part. So do you need something of that framework is required and not maybe a policy which also creates the

balance between innovation and regulations. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So uh good evening and thank you for having me here. So three areas of uh vulnerability which

the consumer faces. Uh one is uh the fintech sector and we've talked about it extensively till now. uh all all the algorithmic biases and uh e-commerce dark patterns uh surveillance pricing

and everything but uh I would like to focus on what's working at the consumer grievance red wrestle uh systems at uh the uh NCH the national consumer help lines we now have uh excellent uh

mechanisms as uh Ashim mentioned that we have uh 17 languages ES and uh voice inputs AI powered speech recognition and uh uh voice processing and refunds of 4.5 cr till November 2025 that's uh the

data of refunds that the consumers have uh received. Uh secondly uh this grahak nai in collaboration with uh uh meta and uh that guides consumers through uh the consumer grievance uh

filing notices and everything and uh uh so helps draft legal notices and the pilot looks very promising. Similarly, we have something called ejagriti which is an integrated platform now for uh

complaints uh filing and virtual hearings and so are these really working is is the question. Now uh at the end of it the consumer court are clogged uh little dependency in consumer courts

like uh the AI is helping power uh generate uh complaints in in a speedy manner but unless uh for consumers it is a second punishment when he gets into litigation. First punishment of course

he's corned second is when he gets into this uh litigation. So unless those things are taken uh care of by uh say uh giving teeth to uh class action suits which now are you

know gets into lot of logistical and procedural issues also uh giving power to consumer organizations uh to uh take up uh uh such issues. So the these are uh certain um areas. Another uh area of

vulnerability is the service uh sector. Uh as a I'll just give you an example. uh just about a week back in fact uh I had this experience of I'd gone to an ATM and uh the had you know the vending

machine uh gave me less of uh cash that I had asked for and uh of course uh I uh connected to the service center and the same feedback loop they did not have that specific number for my kind of

complaint so we got into that frustrating feedback loop so that's is what happens with most of the consumers who are faced with a chatbot and uh the issue is that uh some most companies

they don't have a hybrid mode like you know you cannot escalate your issue to a human interface it it it is the same uh uh loop that you're and it's becomes very frustrating and at the end of it me

being from a consumer organization I have kind of given up on my complaint so you can imagine what must be happening to uh the common man on the around. Uh so um so this black in box inefficient

AI chatbots often fail to understand uh the nuanced or uh responses which needs customized uh uh inputs. So those are the issues. Then loss of accountability is another issue. Where where do I go

next from here? Who is accountable? And of course the lack of empathy. So uh these are uh certain issues that we are facing on the ground as consumers. Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you. Uh Sep, I've preserved the best for the last because you are an AI expert, you work with the industry, you hear the perspectives. &gt;&gt; Yes.

&gt;&gt; Now your views on how to address it to kind of come to a path where consumer is as empowered as well as it also helps the industry to grow at much more faster speed and make much more consumer

centric products. Yeah, I think uh you know the whole discourse here is like you know something it's also on every industry person's mind. It's not just like you know one-sided story and I've

been in AI for a long time. So I've you know um right now I head the AI org in Door Dash. uh before that I was at Netflix for seven years and one thing you see in these companies is like

they're actually very consumer obsessed right in the good companies and not all of them maybe but basically the the the guiding force is the consumer is right right and and you are building this

product at the end of the day to actually have the consumer get the best experience in the product that leads to long-term value of the consumer that actually leads to better revenue for

you. So it's actually you know a a a self sort of sustaining cycle but um as industry leaders what you know the responsibility we have is what I call setting the floor and also raising the

ceiling of this and and that comes from the sort of you know point point of like in your company's KPIs in the metrics that you're tracking safety the consumer rights the consumer transparency are not

options they're actually must be built into it's like a part of the infrastructure itself, right? And so we talked a lot about these algorithmic biases like there are I'll I'll touch on

them a little bit. So some of these biases are by construction, right? So these big LLMs, they learn most of the stuff from English and from the western world and

so they will actually fail and falter when you try to serve this, you know, very tail language that is not represented there. So it's on us who are developing these products to actually go

and build those models in a way that can be unbiased from the day from day one. There's the other kind of bias like the one you know you talked about which like Uber you know charges more and this is

because the algorithms are taught to like you know maximize profit or something right and then it's actually learning from the patterns and unint you know unintentionally it's picking up all

these signals and this is where we as industry practitioners we work very very closely with like you know uh academics who are looking into these problems because this debiasing of AI is a very

hard problem by itself But the best companies out there, they're actually working with the experts in the field to see how to debias these algorithms because at the end of the day, as I

said, you lose the consumer's trust. Once you lose that, you actually lose the long-term value of the consumer, right? Um the other thing that you know industry is very u kind of um you know,

it's front and center in our minds is the accessibility of the technology. It has also been talked about, right? That that's also part of the fairness. Um, and

you know, a device that's like, you know, not your best iPhone. It's like very slow. It's probably in a geographical region where the signal is very low. A company like like Netflix or

YouTube has to think of how to get the best experience even there, right? So, the technology needs to also be built in a way from ground up that's actually fair. And that does just doesn't apply

to like technologies like streaming services or delivery services. It's like all of AI essentially, right? So um the way to kind of you know like I talk to a lot of my you know peers in the industry

and there there are various things that all these companies are thinking about very very very front and center in their minds is how to kind of rein in these systems right so one thing I would say

is as we are getting into more agentic more of this generative AI the risks are larger so one of the ways that these companies are dealing with is by setting up what is called at teaming. So

essentially you build a system, the idea is to help the consumer, right? You build an agentic system that deals with consumer complaints. You built an agentic system that helps you, you know,

order food or, you know, plan your party tonight. But you can also ask the system, you know, how much of X should I take to kill myself, right? So essentially how do you prevent those

things is by these systems called red teaming where you adversarily attack these systems very very um you know comprehensively to figure out where the problems are at the edges right so just

to you know elevate and to conclude my thing I feel like as someone said you know in the early stages of this product development you cannot put too much of regulation because that will stifle

innovation but once it's like semi mature to mature you have to think of these because otherwise at the end of the day you are going to lose the consumer.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you everyone for being a patient audience and thank you for the expert speakers. I think only one line I would like to add at the end is we need to explain the consumers that AI is not

free. I think the feeling is AI is free. It's not free. Uh it is taking a lot from you to kind of grow and then it will again sell back to you again at a higher price. So thank you again. Thank

you all our speakers today and thank you again ministry for giving us this opportunity. [applause] Sorry, we can take questions now if uh or or after the session outside if

because there's a next panel which is waiting. Check. Check. Uh we have a next panel discussion starting from Indian Institute of Management Lucknau. I am

Lucknau. The next session starts in 5 minutes. We request you to please take your seats and uh be part of the panel discussion. I repeat uh the next panel discussion that I am Lucknau is about to

start. We request you to please stay and join for the panel discussion.
