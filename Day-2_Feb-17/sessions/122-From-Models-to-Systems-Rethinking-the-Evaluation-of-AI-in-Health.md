## 📝 Summary

AI is increasingly being adopted across health systems, but evidence on safe and equitable use remains fragmented and not consistently aligned with decision-making needs.

This panel will examine methodological gaps in digital health research and discuss a more holistic agenda for AI integration, governance, effectiveness, and equity, concluding with a set of recommendations.
