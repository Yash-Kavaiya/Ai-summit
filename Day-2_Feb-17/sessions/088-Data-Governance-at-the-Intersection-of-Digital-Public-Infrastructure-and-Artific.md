## 📝 Summary

Digital public infrastructures (DPIs) such as national digital identity systems, payments rails, data-trust frameworks and shared open datasets are rapidly becoming the foundation for AI  development and deployment. When AI systems are trained on or linked through DPIs, the governance of data becomes critical: who collects data, how it's aggregated, for what purposes, with what safeguards.
