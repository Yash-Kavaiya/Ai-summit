## 📝 Transcript

policy manager AI at JPAL where she leads project AI evidence focused on maximizing the social impact of artificial intelligence. She works at the intersection of AI policy and

evidence to help organizations use AI responsibly and effectively. A fun fact, previously she served as a senior adviser in the US Aid's office of the chief economist, advising a $300 million

global development portfolio. Joining us next is Theiago Rashid. Thiago is the co-founder and CEO of Letris in Brazil, where he leads an AIdriven program to improve literacy and

reduce educational inequality. Through letters, he uses AI to analyze student writing, deliver personalized feedback, and provide insights for educators and policy makers. Thiago

holds a master's in education from Columbia University and has been recognized as a Lemon Fellow. Please be seated. Hello everyone. Uh it's a great pleasure

to be here. First of all, thanks uh to J Paul for an invitation. It's really great to be part of this movement of this major initiative on AI and impact. I'm here to present a little bit about

our work at Latras in Brazil. I'm going to get started and then I'm going to pass by to Sam and then I get back to close the session. At least we work with literacy

and mastering the written language is [snorts] the most unique and important trait of humankind. That's what allow us to really register and create knowledge. However, this trait, this skill set is

just a privilege of a few. In Brazil, 90% of the adults are not considered fully proficient, fully literate. They are not able to read a high school book or to

write a one-page dissertation. More pragmatically, when we compare students that leave high school from private schools to public schools, we see a major gap on their

writing skills, specifically on the national exam. And the national exam is the most important instrument for you to access higher education in Brazil. So students of a higher income has a

major leverage compared to the students that are from public lowincome schools. At the end of the day, reading and writing is the most important skill set you have to develop all the other skills

you're supposed to develop at school. So at the end of the day, what we're trying to solve at Letus is the greatest gap in our educational system. Obviously the problem is inside the

schools and because of that we created an AI based program to be the official instrument for schools to develop students writing and reading skills.

When we talk about the problems that we have to solve, we have to go much deeper than just assuming that teaching and and learning is not working. And we know the very specific gaps we have. The first

one is that students they don't write regularly. They don't practice. It's like trying to learn how to ride a bike just with instructions or videos or content. It's basically impossible. If

you don't practice, you don't improve. The second specific problem we have is that the feedback when it happens, it's very poor. Students sometimes they just get a

number on a piece of paper and teacher expect them to improve. Moreover, when we don't have data, when we don't know where the student is on their learning track, teachers,

students, decision makers from the systems, it's basically impossible to put the student [music] at the center of the process. So collecting data and providing data

first to the students and to the teachers but also to the managers of the system. It's critically important. So basically what we've built is a program that allows students to prepare

for a writing essay. And in this preparation, we have reading comprehension and we develop other skills that are critical for them to be able to be proficient, especially on

writing. And when they finish writing, we give them very structured, in-depth feedback, very personalized to the points that each students needs to improve.

and they gave their organized data for the teachers to understand what they have to focus inside the classroom. So Thiago, before I get started, I'm going to ask you why you decided to do

an impact evaluation of the Lus product and then I'll talk about what that evaluation looked like. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So um we had internal data that demonstrated that our program was

working but that data had some bias wasn't super organized and most of all it was not externally scientifically validated and our goal in fact our mission has

always been to work with public schools and I don't know how it is in India but in Brazil it's super bureaucratic and hard for you to build something that is innovative and do it at scale with the

government because governments especially in Brazil they're not used to um buy or to contract innovation. So having an RCT, something that would validate our impact on learning for the

students was incredibly crucial for us to be able to close our first contract and to build a reputation that we needed to expand our program. &gt;&gt; Thank you. So I'll talk a little bit

about the impact evaluation that LRIS did in the state of Aspirus which you can see on the screen in Brazil. Uh this was a randomized evaluation. Um it took place over the course of just five

months. So this is a very short and and rapid turnaround evaluation that was really designed to give policymakers the information they needed on the timeline that they needed it. They needed to have

it using data and evidence that they would trust. So using evidence from the standardized test that happens for all students in Brazil. So there were 178 schools identified as being eligible to

receive the letters product and program. So they were ready to use edtech. They either had laptops or received laptops and they were randomly allocated into two groups. 100 of the schools 110 of

the schools received access to the letters platform and the 68 other schools served as the comparison group. So they continued preparing their students for the national exam in the

usual way that they did in the status quo and this evaluation was designed to measure the whole theory of change of this product. So first the evaluation

looked at just how many essays were students doing in their practice. Uh they als it also looked at the quantity and quality of the feedback that students received on their practice

essays. It looked at the essay scores and writing skills. So, both how students performed on the national standardized test, but also on writing skills on something else, on writing a

story or some other narrative to really see if we were building literacy and fluency with writing rather than just teaching for the test itself. And finally, the evaluation looked at

teachers time allocation to try to understand if this is working, how is it doing that, why is it working? And this was an evaluation that took place of course in partnership with Lus also with

JPAL at MIT, FJ, which is a university in Brazil and the Lemon Foundation as well. And what the evaluation taught us first is that there was really high take up

and engagement with this product. So 95% of teachers assigned practice essays with the tool if they were in the the treatment group and 82% of students in the treatment schools submitted essays

through the platform. That's really high engagement over the course of this five-month program. But of course that's not why was created to drive engagement on its own platform. The purpose was to

see if we were improving students writing skills. The good news is that letris did lead to big improvements in students writing skills and it also reduced the

inequality that Thiago was talking about between the public and the private school students. So over the course of the program, the lectures platform increased teachers one-on-one engagement

with students by 35%. So they were more likely to provide personalized attention and feedback to the students in the treatment group. It also improved writing test scores by 17 points and it

closed the gap between public school students and private school students on the national standardized exam which has big implications for where students can go after high school by 9%.

And to put this into perspective with with the graph, um if we look at this chart, this shows the state-wise ranking of the average student in eight different states in Brazil in 2019,

which is the year when this evaluation was conducted. You see the state of aspirant right in the middle there. So it's I think fifth among the states and that's for just the average student. And

if we look at the students who were actually in this study, so in the public schools that were selected to participate in this study, who did not get access to the platform, we see that

they're actually below average for their state. And this is likely reflective of the disadvantages that public schools have relative to private school students. But the students who got

access to this platform not only got caught up to the average student in the state but actually leapfrogged to be kind of second place in this statewide ranking which is a big achievement and I

I would guess incredibly compelling when talking to the ministry and talking to other state governments as well. And so with that I'm going to hand over to Thiago to tell the rest of the scaling

story and what happened next after these results. Thank you. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; So uh another thing that was very

positive about running an RCT with JOL is that it allow us to be selected as the best education technology in the world by UNESCO in 2020 uh 2020. Uh it's a most important I would say prize in

the field and they evaluate solutions in more than 130 countries where they have u a headquarter. Um but most important um in the first year

of implementation of our program as a public policy in Spirit to Sanento. So basically in 9 months of school the SPTO state jumped from the previous years where it was um 11th position 11th

place in the national ranking of the national exam to first. Uh that happened in one in just one school year. After that they stayed still the very best in

writing skills in Brazil but that's not the reality only for speed to Sanento after our experience in 2022 with the speeditanto other state [snorts] um became our partners and we

started to implement it as public policy becoming their official writing and reading development skills for high school and middle And those states since first year of

implementation they have their best position at the national ranking of the writing uh national exam. It's part important to mention that our program is not tailor as Sam said for teach.

Our program is very broad. We work with all kinds of writing uh geners. Um so we we really help students learn how to write biography, poetry, um um an article, a newspaper and so on. So uh at

the end of the day we use the exam metric because it's a relevant metric and it's standardized. So it help us really understand if our programs is not only impacting proficiency but also

impacting something that is very objective for the students which is being able to enroll in higher education. Today um letters uh is is ran in more

than 160 in 1600 uh schools around Brazil. half million students enrolled in our program. This is not the historical number. Historical number is more than two million students that have

gone through our program currently. [snorts] Uh that's the number of students that has letters that have letters as their official program on a regular basis. Important to mention that

since our first contract with the government which was 2022 with speed to center we've had we increase we more than um grew more than um 10 times uh the number of students that are being

supported and no government no program has ever been cancelled or not renewed. all the the the public networks that started working with us improved their performance and are still partners of

letter since then. Um when we talk about AI the first thing that comes to mind usually is algorithm. So people believe that we have a magical algorithm. Uh the truth is it's it's not

really about the algorithm. We [snorts] did start letters 10 years ago. All the information about the RCT we did was 2019. So way before GPT as well. um what allow us to reach the results that we

have are focus on implementation especially when we talk about scale especially when we talk about a very diverse set of audience we're talking about indigenous schools we're talking

about countryside very poor schools we're talking about schools without connection we're talking about um teachers that are not digitally uh literate

uh that all complexity demand us to have and build a methodology and an intelligence to be able to implement this program in a very different um diversity of settings.

For that reason, we understand that what we have created at Letrus which is very powerful is our capacity to really understand context and adapt our technology to that context. [snorts] To

make it simple, uh the first layer is related to infrastructure. So we must understand what's the infrastructure that that school has. Maybe that school has no computers.

Um maybe that school has no connection. Uh but we do have an app that works offline. We do have through that app the capacity of teacher to take a picture of students writing on paper and we

digitalize that automatically to give them feedback. Uh just to to site some examples, we need an education technology that works. And when we when I say education

technology is not a platform, is an experience. We it really has to be based on a very structured um pedagogy. It must make sense for the teaching and learning process. So designing this

technology with digital tools is crucial. Um, curriculum adaptation is also very very important because when we get to a large school network, curriculum is

going to be different from one state to the other. And believing that we're going to just ask your agent to adapt the activities for that curriculum. Uh, good luck. It that's not how it happens.

It's very important for the teacher that is giving that class and giving a letter activity to be able to give the content that is in the textbook for that students related to the assay that they

just did. So having this curriculum integration is also very important for us to reach high engagement. Last but not least, we understood that there is a very important layer to

everything we do, which is the layer of the administrators. We have very relevant data that allow them to make important decisions on how this process will be implemented moving

forward. So being able to provide for a secretary or for a technical team of a large network for instance what's the training that they should focus on for the next semester what are the changes

that they have to do to make on curriculum what are the schools that are [snorts] struggling the most and needs extra attention and so on. That kind of insight is crucial for us to reach again

higher level of engagement that will take us to high level of learning. [snorts] Um we've been partnering with JPAL for for a long time now. uh we have

different projects going on but there is one specific that we're looking forward we're looking forward to which is an RCT a new RCT and the goal of this RCT is going beyond school it's trying to

understand what's the impact of literacy proficiency to economic development of these students how much does that impact higher education enrollment and employability

um this is a project that is at the moment on hold. We had full funding from US8. Um you can imagine what happened. Uh so now uh we have IDB jumping in as a partner. still looking for the

additional funding and to understand that that work of looking at evidence not only internally but also with external partners that are professional in the field is really strategic for us

because once we have this kind of information this kind of learning that this kind of evidence based research brings that help us build what comes first what's going to be our future and

where we can reach because we know the value of having that evidence structured for us to grow and scale even further. Like to thank very much everyone uh I'll be around and again J Paul thank you so

much for inviting me to be here with you &gt;&gt; and maybe just one last note uh just to make a a connection to the the panel that we'll have up here uh in a moment um I want to just give a special shout

out to our partners at google.org or who were actually the source of the funding that JPAL used to make this evaluation the first one happen in the first place through an initiative we had on post

primary education. Um so a through line throughout the day is that that type of partnership that we've had. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. [applause] &gt;&gt; Thank you Sam and Thiago. It is now my

pleasure to invite the panelists for the AI in education customizing learning for all session on stage. To moderate this session, I invite Margaret Clark to the stage.

Margaret is a lead education specialist at the World Bank where she works to strengthen education systems and improve learning outcomes globally. Through her work, she explores how data and emerging

technologies, [music] including AI, can help improve teaching, learning, and education policy. [music] Before joining the World Bank, Margaret taught at universities in Australia and

the United States and worked as a [music] school teacher in Ireland and Japan. She also received a national teaching award from Ireland's Department of Education.

Next, [music] we have Bridget Oreer Gosling. Bridget is the director of AI and social impact at Google, where she leads global initiatives using emerging technologies to address major societal

challenges. [music] Through her work, she advances the use of AI through philanthropy and partnerships to drive impact across communities worldwide. Bridget has spent

over a decade at Google.org leading efforts on sustainability, climate [music] change, and crisis response. Please also join me in welcoming Rrookmani Banerjee. Rrookmini is the CEO

of Ptham Education Foundation, one of India's largest nonprofit organizations focused on improving learning outcomes. Through her work, she uses data and technology [music] to strengthen

foundational learning and scale uh and improve education for millions of children. Finally, I would like to invite Namya Mahajan to the stage. Namya is a

co-founder and CEO of Rocket Learning, a nonprofit using digital technology to strengthen early childhood education across India. Through Rocket Learning, she uses AI and datadriven tools to

improve large-scale education delivery for underserved communities. [clears throat] Namya holds an MBA and a degree in applied math from Harvard University.

&gt;&gt; I I can see you all better. I would also like to flag that if the audience would like to ask our panelist questions, please scan the QR code on the screen.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. Okay, &gt;&gt; great. Uh, good afternoon. Thank you very much for being here and I'm delighted to have with me on the stage

three very esteemed and experienced uh, experts in the area of education and AI. I think the leus example was a very inspiring one of how AI combined with rigorous impact

evaluation can scale to learning for all and we're going to hear a bit more on this theme from our panelists here who have a lot of experience in India and other areas. Um

um you can submit questions if you'd like uh to our panelists and I'll draw on them about midway through if you like. Okay. I'm going to get started in the meantime with some questions of my

own and I'm going to turn first of all to Miss Rrookmini Banerjee who probably needs no introduction to anyone here. Anyone working on education in India knows Ruck Mini and uh Pratam has been

around for a while. Um Pratam has been probably in the vanguard in terms of shifting the focus from access to quality and learning. Measuring learning relentlessly even

when it wasn't very popular. uh measuring the impact of different initiatives to try to improve learning. So you've been doing this for a long time, Rook Mini, even before AI was

around. So can you tell us how now is Prattam using AI in its programs and why are you using it? Why are you using particular kinds of AI? Thank you. Um [clears throat]

I think I'll start by saying that there were some things that we knew how to do and uh we were always very curious about how those things can be done better. Um I'll take two examples. One is assur

that uh is quite well known the annual status of education report and the simple tool and I think that simple tool which has been used a lot both for the actual report but also in many of the uh

large learning improvement programs to start understanding the variation of learning in the classroom. Uh it's very simple. It's just one piece of paper. It already works. But in our own mind we've

always wondered that while we are collecting the information collecting and you can see when when the child is being assessed everybody can hear the level that they are but what more could

you do with this and so when the opportunity to actually collect voice data from children uh and to be able to analyze it when we had that opportunity uh which has now led to the creation of

the paradhigh app which uh we are beginning to use. We found that uh we learned a lot actually from uh looking at the uh what children were doing. For example, uh kids who are just about

reading letters make mistakes and you look at what kind of mistakes they make and we can hear it. We can see it child by child. But when you analyzed a big large data set, you could see that there

were two major types of mistakes that kids were making. And I may not get the technical name right. So apologies to both the pedagogy people as well as the technology people in the room. But one

type of mistake was especially for Indian languages when kids mixed up the similar sounding letters t her things like this and they mispronounced that. The second type of mistake was when you

mixed up letters that looked alike. So you can you know there are there's lots of examples of those. Then when we looked at these children's learning data from say two months or one month down

the road, we could see that kids who had made one kind of mistake. So the ones that had made the the the phonetic mistakes actually progressed quite well. But those who had made the mistakes

which were mixing up what the letters look like had made less. Immediately we could plow this information back into changing the kinds of texts that we made for kids to read the kinds of exercises

that we did with phonological awareness and so on. So right from the beginning the assert tool although it's used in the assert report as an assessment tool it was this first step in instruction

and how assessment can aid instruction and just in using the kinds of uh processes that you know AI has helped us to use we can see that even with kids who are just beginning to a just

beginning to be able to read you could actually use that data for immediately improving many things about the instructions. So I can go on on that. The second example I want to uh uh cite

is that uh the assert tool uh actually began as the first step as I said to how do you help kids learn to read and do math especially those who are you know already at third grade or above and that

approach is now well known it's called teaching at the right level in English and we call it kamal in many Indian languages. So again there once you lay out every step of the process assessment

I described how do you group children by level instead of by grade what are the kinds of instructional activities that you do and so on and so forth recognizing that in any classroom you

have actually a mixed composition of children and I could have a classroom in which most of my kids are at letter or you know word level. uh Bridget could have a classroom in which most kids have

actually uh reached a certain basic level but there are a few stragglers. Namya could have a class which is very mixed but when we do teacher training or when we write a manual we address it

kind of to this to this composition and we say that as you go along adjust to the level at which the children are making progress. So complicated to have first a diverse group of kids second

think of progression for each of them. Third is to be able to do the appropriate activities at appropriate time and we expect that our teachers would be able to do so. teachers do that

and in fact we see that from the RCTs that JPAL has done that there's it has it's a very it has very effective results but how can you make those results better and so we've been working

right now on a project we are calling tech in tar in which we are really collecting a lot of data on exactly what happens in the classroom what do teachers think what do they plan to do

what doesn't get done how do they look at progress and so on and so forth and we are not yet ready to be RC ICT jal is waiting in the wings. Uh but I think it's taught us a hell of a lot in

working with the technology team to figure out how to make actually our even the human part of it better. So it's been a big learning opportunity and I encourage anybody who's in this business

to really hunker down work with the team because then you get to the core of what is this whole learning and progress all about. &gt;&gt; Thank you Rakini. I think Pratam has

never been afraid of change or or trying to innovate. And I think those are fantastic examples. Um and talking of innovation, uh Bridget, um you've been on the uh vanguard of of many

innovations in technology and AI for education programs in your work at Google.org. You've been on this area for many years. Um, so I'm guessing you may be a bit jaded by all the stuff that's

already out there. Can you try to get us excited about one emerging direction in AI for learning that you are particularly excited by and what evidence you think you would like to see

before you would strongly advocate to scale this? something that's just starting to emerge and how what kind of evidence do you think you would need before you would recommend it to

Rrookmini or Namya? &gt;&gt; Far be it to for to me to recommend anything to either of these two very um very expert women. You know, I I want to speak to this at two levels. So, I'm

kind of cheating on your one. Um I mean the first is that as we think about emergent models we're kind of in a space now where we have specific applications that are being built in meaning some of

what you spoke about is in this space right where we're really looking at whether AI can do specific things at the same time that we're watching the foundation models progress and I think

we need to be asking questions in both of those spaces. So thinking about um how are our foundation models doing when it comes to learn helping people to learn and we're actually not great right

now in defining what it really means to be good at helping people to learn. So one of the things that we took on from our team um uh within Google was to try to define kind of what are we we are

very good at understanding kind of pedagogy and learning science. Obviously, decades of work have gone into that, but distilling that down to the types of things you would then want

to see in an AI model is not something that we've all necessarily wrestled through yet. And so, we took an approach of of working with educators and pedagogy experts, some of whom we're

lucky enough to have in our our teams, to really distill down practices like does it encourage curiosity? Is there sort of a questioning intent? Um, are you guiding people through kind of a

process and not getting to kind of cognitive overload versus, you know, not giving everyone a wall of an answer, but sort of taking things piece by piece, things that good teachers innately do

and and learn to do, and then looking at how our model was performing and then trying to approve it against those metrics. So, what resulted from that was a a model called learn learn LM, which

now has since been um kind of pulled into the core Gemini models. So I don't tell say this necessarily to say our model's the best at learning although I think it's pretty good but more to say

we need more of this right we need more of an ability to to sort of codify these practices and it does get to this translation point you're raising Rokamini right how do we translate the

things that sort of we innately learn in the learning education space so that we can translate it into this model development and process and then I'll just quickly speak about kind of the the

application side right okay great we have these models maybe they're excellent now what and I think Here the question really comes comes down to two things, right? What do we already know

about what works which of course this uh summit has been spending a lot of time on and how might we think about what AI can do to help us do that more effectively for many many many more

students than we're able to today. So the tech tech for Tarl did I get it right? Uh process is a version of this I think right where you sort of know that Tarl works but it's also not able to be

implemented everywhere. We don't have perhaps enough teachers caregivers educators to fill that role and we certainly don't have implementation in in kind of every country in every place.

Could AI do that I think is kind of the question that we're asking. And so this sort of leaning into this idea of personalization, whatever that looks like, adaptive learning modes,

modalities that allow students to receive information and process information in the way that's best for them. I think that's the the sort of joy of education that, you know, when we

when we all have found that spark that we really seek and I think the question is, can AI help us do that? And that is a very big and hard question that we don't know the answer to yet. And I'm

and we're still I think building the scaffolding to even get to that get to that answer. I didn't answer the second part of your question. So I'll just say very quickly which is like how do we

know if that's working and if scale? I think I'll just say something quickly here which I think is we've talked with our our colleagues at JAL about this too which is I think there's sort of a we're

in this real tension of needing to try things and maybe try things before we fully have them down to the sort of efficacy and implementation because of the rate of change but also

because of the real opportunity. And so I think one of the things that really gets to is sort of what's the cost effectiveness of some of this, right? If it's relatively cheap and probably not

going to cause harm, should we try it in more places and learn while we're still doing the kind of core evidence building to come? And I think this iterative cycle is part of what the, you know, AI

for evidence work is is trying to help get toward. It's really, I think, incumbent on all of us to really kind of think about that tension. And it feels to me like those two elements are the

kind of musthaves before you get too far down the line. Thank you, Bridget. And I think uh Namya um is living through some of this in in her rocket uh uh experience, a rocket

learning experience and certainly in terms of how you have managed, tell us your secret. How have you managed to scale early childhood education, which is something that's very hard to scale

in a cost-effective way, but you've managed to do it. So, I think we'd like to know what is your secret source and what role has technology and AI played in this? And I don't know

if it's going to sound similar to what Rrookmini has said or if you've got a a new formula to share. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Uh no thank you for the question. Um so I think what you know Rokini said

so well is that the the basis for the scale has to be uh somebody wants what you're doing right like the the incentive cannot be built using technology. Um what we saw was that

early childhood education was so hard to scale because um you know people were trying to either get home visitors to visit homes uh week on week with the same level of enthusiasm and motivation

uh and supporting parents to do things right and every time you did that at small scale it worked beautifully. It worked for generations and every time you tried to scale that it was really

hard because finding that number of people was really hard. Um so what we found was that there are already people in young children's lives who have the incentive to help them learn right so

their parents their families have a very deep incentive because their financial futures are deeply linked to their kids learning and then there are angi workers who are 1.4 4 million strong workforce

in India um who are community workers. They're focused on nutrition but they really want to be teachers. So they really really want to have the respect that school teachers get in their

communities but everybody looks at them as the local oatmeal lady right. So if you can actually help them build in their classroom you know build a classroom instead of a center right that

can actually help them get that status in the community. So parents have an incentive to teach their kids. Angeny workers have an incentive to teach kids. What they don't have is maybe the right

materials that's curriculum linked that's sciencebacked uh that can reach them when they need it most right and that's where technology comes in. So we use WhatsApp which is the simplest

technology that you know 70% of parents have 100% of Angari workers and we send short bite-sized videos that they can use to teach their kids the next day. We see 75% of Hangeni workers are using

this on a weekly basis right and kids are actually learning. So um with the JALL RCT we found that 75% of kids in our program are reaching school readiness compared to a 50% national

average. So this can be a really impactful way and it's really cost-ffective. Right? So it it costs us um a dollar and a half per child per year uh which is you know heaps slower

than any other intervention that we've seen. Um, and that the reason for it is a, you know, you're using technology, but you're building on incentives and motivations that people already have and

you're leveraging resources and infrastructure that exists in communities. &gt;&gt; Wow. All right. Thank you. And while we've been talking, we've gotten a lot

of questions from the audience. And I have to say these are quite um challenging questions. If this was an exam, I think I'd be struggling. Um, but I'm going to throw a few of them at our

panelists because um there's a lot of of um of um thoughtful questions here. Okay, I'm actually going to start with one for Bridget. Uh this question is uh about um

bias in AI models. AI models are trained on existing data. How are we auditing these systems to ensure they don't reinforce cultural, racial or gender biases um in terms of the customized

advice they give students? So I think that we've spent a lot of time I know hopefully over the last couple of days and we'll keep talking more about the importance of local

context and local cultural and language relevancy for models and I think we have made a lot of progress in this as a you know as a tech community and as a society and we still have a lot of room

to go. We have some big gaps to fill. So you know obviously we want to make sure that a model is performing as well for any individual and community as it would for any other. And so you know certainly

we have in our models and and our you know robust safety teams really checking for that kind of bias and a you know on the extremes and you know even in small ways that it might show up um as we

think about kind of the results that are being shown for folks. But the gaps that still exist are, you know, in in language. They're in getting things exactly right. They're in sort of the

phrasing of the answers that are given just based on the text that we have available, the language data that we have available to train. And so I think it's a big gap that we're trying to

fill. So we've we've got a number of efforts underway as do many others. I think this is a big place where actually civil society and and government and and tech companies working together is

really critical. um working with um in here in India with uh the government and uh project vani uh also with Karia to really build out especially speech and um voice language data sets which are

really critical for especially last mile reach. Uh the goal is to try to do that in um languages that are representative of the entire 773 districts across India. Um we have globally a thousand

language moonshot that we're trying to fill. Um and we've just announced some new data sets in subsaharan Africa and East Africa in partnership with um with universities there. These are open data

sets. So they mean that this should be open data that then hopefully improves all models. Um that said, I think this is an area also of important research like we are still doing research to

really understand what is a culturally relevant model look like. Um and so the more I think that we have kind of dialogue and folks informing that I think the better outcome that we're

going to get for everyone. Great. Thank you. And now I have a question for Anamia especially for for you. Um how are you using AI within WhatsApp uh for personalized learning?

Are parents able to use it effectively or do they need training? &gt;&gt; Yeah. So I didn't actually talk about AI in my previous answer at all. Uh but um so we work now in 450,000 with uh Angari

educators. So in one in four villages there's um an Awari worker using rocket learning content and kids are learning. Um but you know 75% of kids are reaching school readiness. What about the other

25%. And what we saw as you know Rokini diagnosed as well is that you have a multi-age multi-grade classroom and it's quite hard for an NGeni worker to know um you know who's doing well and if

someone is not doing well what to do to actually support them. So um we're using AI to build um shik sha sadhadi that means learning buddy for anari worker one of the big pain points in their life

is uh d enter entry entering data into an app uh they hate doing that and so for us it was like can we make entering data um less ownorous can we even make it fun uh right so we've made a system

in which the angi worker can speak into the phone about the kids in her classroom and say okay uh you know Bridget is doing really great in verbal but she struggled today in maths or in

numbers right and the next time there's a number activity it can remind you that okay pay attention to Bridget today right so there's actually ways that you know you can ask an angi worker to uh be

able to personalize her classroom better without having to do more data entry um on the parent side what we're trying to actually do is understand kids learning levels so the first thing we did when we

were working with AI and we've done work with google.org is to build a learning ladder, right? And that was deeply technical work that took our team three months to do, which

was actually, you know, look at a set of maybe 10 learning outcomes and bring them into more than a 100 learning competencies that all build on each other, right? So for a parent, uh, but

but we need to be able to diagnose where a child is. Parents have done actually a pretty good job of being able to ask the child questions. Um we have uh APU which is a little elephant that talks to kids

uh and it can talk to them and understand where they are in that learning process. Uh so that we can you know tell both the parent what is the next thing you need to do with your

child but also tell the angi worker right so create a continuum of learning in the classroom and at home. We've not seen that kid parents need training. This is you know it's not rocket science

even though we're rocket learning. Uh it's it's early childhood education. It's fairly simple stuff. Very, thank you. Okay, I'm going to give the last question for this portion to Rook Mini

and um would you like one that's more or less philosophical? [laughter] &gt;&gt; Here, I'll give you a challenge. Okay. Um because Rick Mini is I'm sure you're

well abled for this. Okay. In an age where AI can do so much, a paraphrase, uh, what should humans prepare themselves to do in the future? What should be the goal of learning?

Over to you, Rakmani. I I I think this is the question that is being talked about in every forum. Um, interestingly I think everybody will agree that from the morning the words

that have come up the most have been human and trust and perhaps if we put it against what the word or whatever the letters A and I is probably lower than that. So to me it looks like I can't

answer this big cosmic philosophical question. But I do think in the field that I know a little bit about is teaching and learning. I think our roles are going to get even deeper. the roles

of human beings. Um this whole process of really trying to figure out whether it is how uh a teacher is thinking about planning her day uh for the next day for the group of students that she has or

for a parent who is trying to think about where do I want my kid to go. I think the thinking of this will still reside to a large extent with the you know the human beings and then it is up

to us really to chart the best possible course through the many many opportunities that are there. So I I do feel that in uh in at least now this today I've heard a lot of uh education

and AI combinations and not a single one of the presentations has come back with saying leave it all to AI. Um what are we going to teach our children to do in future and that's a much bigger

question. I think there are big questions which have you know more to do with where are we headed and how will we get there and then the question will come is how will AI help us but uh I I

don't think I think people have to go home we don't want to start you know the big question of you know what will kids need to know uh I mean actually I'm going to pose this here I don't know who

asked the question but surely a panelist can ask the audience questions um I've always been puzzled by the fact that uh while we quite I think as a country as a maybe even globally have some sense of

what to do in early childhood education and what to do with foundational learning. I feel the world beyond age 10 is very very open. Uh we are still using curriculum frameworks and examinations

and scores and stuff like that which is a just you're hanging on to your sort of comfort blanket. I think we have to blow it all open and see that where do we want to be? um little bits of work that

we've done. Uh I think Bridget referred to it in in a different session. Uh we really need to use the nonlinear capabilities of what where technology can take us. Um we've been working with

anthropic on something called anytime testing machine ATM it's called. uh and I'm going to discuss this with the letter people because right now it's looking at writing but the name was

coined by I mean the name exists ATM everybody knows uh by our founder Madav [clears throat] Chavan to say that all this technology has to take us to a completely different place than these

very structured you know tightly framed education systems have bound us in so one is how do you excel in the constraints that you have but I think you have to break out of those

constraints what if you let children alone don't worry about what exam results they'll get and see which child goes how far with themselves with their friends with their books with their

teachers and with AI. I mean we might reach a very different place and if we don't start doing some of these break the box and get out we'll not reach where at least as India we want to reach

in 2047. [applause] I I mean I think it's hard to top that. So I I'm wondering if we should just stop here or or

looking at the organizers. Is there time to ask Bridget the last question or should we? Yes. Okay. Yes. Yes. Okay. All right. Okay. So now switching back a little bit. Okay. So this is the final

question. Um and it's for Bridget. So in this session and earlier we've been talking a lot about the research on AI but turning that around we should also think about how can we use AI in

research or to support research. So Bridget could you share with us how Google.org or is thinking about the use of AI tools to support the research process. What's ahead? Thank you.

&gt;&gt; I feel like I'm distracting from Rickini's call to action for all of us. So, I'm just going to quickly underline it um to say that I think there's a tremendous opportunity in front of us to

try new things. And one of the things maybe I'll [clears throat] bridge with this which is one of the things that you know we're starting to see some interest in

actually is what could AI teach us about learning. AI tools are inherently a learning tool. We call them neural networks. They're meant to be modeled after the brain. The

sort of pattern recognition, the putting together of concepts, we might in in doing this work actually learn something about the way that learning happens that could then inform what we do for the

work. So um we spent a lot of time today and JPAL itself is a research institution and this is partially uh happening because uh in catching up with I was so excited

about all of the ways that AI is transforming research and so I uh offered to share some of that with you all today. Um, so for those who might be kind of paying attention to some of the

headlines, I think we're starting to see a number of these breakthroughs and kind of hard science research problems that are really being unlocked by AI tools. So this is things like mathematical

theorems being solved that had previously seemed unsolvable or discovering of new materials, new scientific principles that could hopefully, you know, solve some of the

more important problems that we that we have on our planet. Um, drug discovery, things like that. But I think an interesting question is to think about kind of across the spectrum of the of

the scientific method, of the scientific process. what are all the ways in which we are already seeing and may see AI tools play a role and for those of you who are doing research or embarking on

research I think this is a really interesting space to watch as we as we move forward so in the sort of space of kind of just broad research and hypothesis generation we're starting to

see tools emerge you know you can already do this through obviously things like a robust literature review that maybe pulls from domains that are adjacent or maybe even far-fetched from

your space and your knowledge area but that may be more relev relevant to the sort of hypotheses that you're looking at. We have specifically been working on a tool called AI coscientist that does

this. It sort of builds knowledge trees through the the scientific literature and helps scientists generate hypothesis areas that can then be explored through experimentation. Um we've also recently

just updated our deep think model. Um it's proving to be very helpful at hypothesis generation but also in kind of this starting to bridge into the early solution exploration. So thinking

about, you know, okay, if we can narrow down to this space, it's actually pretty probable that there's something here and let me, by the way, branch off to two different things so that you might point

your human attention at those and go run and really be efficient about the experiments that you're able to take on. Um, and then increasingly, um, there's a lot more agentic work happening in this

space too. So agents being obviously tools that can act kind of on their own and particularly for what, um, you know, we think of as quote scorable problems. So places where you can really kind of

get to an optimization function, you can sort of set off now a combination of a well sort of architected research method combined with coding agents who can go and actually go test a bunch of those

hypotheses in parallel. I think a lot of this is being piloted in hard science for very good reason. we have a lot of data many more scorable problems but I think there's a there's starting to be I

think some applications also in social science in economics and really interested to sort of see what I think more folks can do with these researcher with these research tools in space even

you know you talked a little bit about some of the pattern recognition data interpretility interpability we have a lot of qualitative data finding some of those uncommon patterns um with these

tools is going to I think unlock new insights so just wanted to give us a note on some of that. And I think this space is probably one of those that I feel most excited about when I think

about the opportunity of AI for scientific discovery, for discovery of new solutions, and for us really pointing our human attention and its scarcity at the right questions at the

right time. So, thanks for giving a minute to share about that. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much, Bridget. And now over to the organizers. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you to our speakers for a

wonderful conversation. We wish we had more time to hear more of your thoughts. Um, so we're closing out soon, but I would request the audience to please stay seated for another 10 minutes and

um, introduce our final session to you. Our final session today is on evaluating AI for impact from idea to execution. Please join me in welcoming Shobini Mukharji to the stage. Shobini is the

executive director of JPAL South Asia, [music] where she leads evidence-driven research and partnerships to help governments design and scale effective social programs. Through her work, she

advances the use of data and rigorous evidence to strengthen policym and public program delivery. A passionate advocate for evidence-based decisionmaking, but an even more

passionate burer, Shobini is on her 105th lifer in bird language. Thank you, Astra. Another fun fact, I mean we talking about fun facts and it's been interesting to see how the day has

been. Uh, another fun fact about me is that Rrookmani was my first boss and I also did a teaching on the right level with Patam of some sorts as a very lost shredded one-year-old and who would have

thought that 20 years later many more young people will have access to something as transformative as the letter tool for instance. Thiago, congratulations on your success. was

very exciting presentation and I I'm a do I'm a mother of a 12-year-old so I keep thinking you know maybe those that tool will come in handy later on. Okay. So as we close for the last

session of the day, I want to briefly reflect on what we've heard today and what it signals where the space is headed and where how the ecosystem will shape up

from the opening session on building AI that works for people to deep dives that we've all heard today. fantastic presentations by all our researchers and all the panelists who've given very very

insightful comments in very interesting u examples and insights. We've heard presentations across health, governance, labor, climate, education. And one message that I felt has been

consistent uh throughout is that AI is moving from promise to practice and there is a potential to impact many more lives and there's a lot of enthusiasm around the opportunities that exist in

and of itself. But we also recognize that practice without evidence is risky. So across every panel a few key themes stood out and I'll just briefly reflect upon those. First of course evaluation

must move alongside innovation. Outcomes can take time to change and methods will follow these but measurement using digitized data and quicker insights on interim outcomes will help provide

proxies of long-term impact. So yes, RCDs do take time but there are many ways to work around that and with AI with technology with digital data the path is much faster to impact. Second AI

is fast-paced and robust impact measurements using RCTs and documentation can help iterate adopt and match the pace. Third and importantly ethics must intentionally be built in.

It's not an afterthought and transparency and replicability is not optional in public systems. It bol bolsters trust and we heard in the governance panel and I thought to myself

when I was hearing that if a government algorithm makes a decision and no one can explain it is it public policy or public mystery and fourth last pile access determines

whether AI reduces inequality or deepens it. So the most exciting shifts in the AI for impact space right now is the convergence that we see today.

technologists, policy makers, funders, and researchers. All future builders sitting at the same table. And we've had many of them in this room today asking not only what can we build, but what

works for whom, at what cost, and with what risks. All good questions. And our time-t tested model of embedded innovation and evaluation labs within governments that JPAL globally and in

South Asia is spearheading provides a convening platform for committed partners to work on this shared vision together. And this is exactly what we need in AI for social good. AI that

augments frontline health workers. AI that strengthens teachers. AI that supports civil servants. AI that reaches the last mile, especially the unreached who may also be the most vulnerable.

whether it's in a remote village in Bihar or a floodpone uh household on a river bank. So when done right with evidence with ethics, transparency and humility, AI can make systems more

responsive and more inclusive and that's the work ahead. Now if you'll indulge me, I want to end with an analogy one that Ibal reminded me that I I have to confess. He reminded me about. So thanks

to Astra, you know that one of my greatest joys outside of JPAL is bird watching. So for decades birding has required deep expertise. You needed field guides, years of training, the

ability to distinguish between subtle variations in calls, bird calls and plumage. And today AI is transforming that experience making it more democratic widely accessible. So with

tools like Merlin and other bio acoustic models trained on on millions of recordings open access you can stand in a remote mangro forest in the sundurbuns and identify the sound of a mangrove pa.

You can be in Nagaland in very dense forests and where visibility is low and AI can surface species that you might otherwise miss. And in the Andes in Ecuador, thousands of kilometers from

home, I could identify unfamiliar calls within seconds. So just as it allows more people to experience the richness of bird song, AI in public systems can help more people access better health,

healthcare, learning, livelihoods, protection, and much more. The technology is powerful, but impact that works requires partnership. So as we leave today, my invitation to all of you

in the room is simple. Let's innovate with imagination. Let's evaluate rigorously and let's scale responsibly. So thank you for being a part of this journey and for spending the whole day

with us. There was one burning question I had. I don't know if I should mention it which was and I mean I did mention it and someone said don't say this but forecasting is great but did anyone

randomize where lunch would be set up today? So before I end and before I hand it over to the MC's I and because I want to say one thing

before I end because we are not very good at thanking ourselves before the MC's take over for to close for the day I want to give a huge thanks to every single member of JPAL who has made this

happen today from imagining planning refining coordinating cancelling and whatnot to set us up for today to the MC's who've been throughout out stellar pillars for

the day to the jal team. On site today we had about 40 people on site from the jal team today bringing people in, ushering them in, showing them where to go, when to leave, where from, left,

right, exit, uh where to get food from, coffee, you know, running mentees, setting up our live demos and whatnot. So, you've all been stupendous. Thank you very much. And thank you for

bringing this together. Thank you Shobini for sharing your thoughts with us. Before we close, I would like to request the India and Global AI Summit planning teams to come

on stage for a group photograph. We need we need someone to take. &gt;&gt; We need someone to take. Satishi, can you please come on stage? We need you on stage for the AI group

picture. AI team group picture. Anyone? Come, come. Group picture. All All JPAL on ground. &gt;&gt; All JPAL on ground please come up

quickly. Quickly. We have to run. All JPAL staff on ground please come up. All jal. All jal on ground please come up. This is the same.

Yeah, as we are in the bar. As we are in the baraka, this is the what we has been done and we are this has been the work we has been so far has been done. Now you see the for the

social good impacts and that will be the honor of the day and it will be closing ceremony and I am hosting Yeah. I'm on &gt;&gt; [applause]

&gt;&gt; I finally got to Happy photography. Oh my god. Duf, please come up on stage. We want a photo with you guys. Where is Vishal?

We will never forget you. Angelina, thank you.
