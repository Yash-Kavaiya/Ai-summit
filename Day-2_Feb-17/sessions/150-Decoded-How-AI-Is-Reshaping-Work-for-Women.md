## 📝 Transcript

A young data worker logs into her workstation every [music] morning, working close to her home, earning with dignity, aiming for her first promotion. In Uttar [music] Pradesh, a digital

journalist edits local stories on her phone, pushing past restrictive norms [music] to make new voices heard. Across rural India, frontline workers pick up their phones to enable lastmile public

services, tracking nutrition, delivering rations, delivering advice that saves lives in the [music] new landscape of women's work in India's booming digital economy

enabled by a strong [music] DPI infrastructure enabling policy environment, platformization of work and the AI boom. The digital economy is not one job or equal to gig work alone.

It's a spectrum of opportunity from digitally enabled [music] frontline roles to digitally engaged infrastructure and tech roles to digitally embedded [music] careers in AI

content and data ecosystems. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Yet this work is often unrecognized, unprotected, and [music] underpaid. And women are still clustered in entry-level

roles where work is precarious, digital layer is invisible and [music] career progression is unclear. As [music] AI platforms and DPI reshape work, the story is being rewritten. Join

us in shaping a chapter powered by women. This moment calls for bold collaboration. [music] Government, industry, and communities can step up to accelerate women's participation in

[music] the future of work. Women are already meeting the moment. It's time [music] the ecosystem levels up. discover how we can accelerate women's participation, engagement and

progression at scale. &gt;&gt; Fantastic. So, thank you for that. Um, it gives me great pleasure to introduce our panelists today. Um, we have Dr. Sharon BH, executive director lead at

Tria University moderating this discussion. Uh, we have Atkal Satija, founder and CEO of the Nudge Institute who has joined us today as well. Uh we also welcome Maiti Romesh co-founder and

managing director next 12th along with Yona Reshi who's uh serving as the assistant director global strategy at digital green. Uh shortly we'll also be joined by Dr. Madan Moantraati who is

the director general for the national institute of electronics and IT NLET. Uh so before we delve into the discussion I'd request if all the panelists can just stand up for a quick photo and I'd

really um like to welcome um our session officers for this section uh for this session to also please join um Dr. Kapil uh Aruna Saliser if you can just please come up. Yeah.

&gt;&gt; Photoshop. Fantastic. Thank you. So Sharon, with this over to you and I hope you all enjoy this discussion today. &gt;&gt; Oh. Oh, now it's working. Uh, thanks a

lot. Uh, I think I think it's a panel at the end of the day, but it's wonderful because people are full of ideas and things like that. So hopefully you'll have some insights from this one. So um

as you saw in this video, this um actually panel is based on some of the fundamental work we've done on the ground up. Some of people we've actually interviewed as well as part of the

process to able to devise sort of like the future of work for women in AI. I think the main question here is not whether um AI will impact women, it's how what

systems we need to in place, how to integrate them, how to make sure they're part of the of of the process and not just as a result of it. So um I'm going to start with Atul. Uh Atul is sort of

like an ecosystem builder and usually it's always the person at the end. How do you bring the people together? I would love to start with you first. How do you view with your experience in the

work that we're doing with you with Samati? I think you've done digital no. So what at an ecosystem level the levels that are required to help integrate women in AI in a way that is purposeful

in a way that gives them dignity in a work in a way that elevates them and that they think grow with them given their particular constraints as well. Yeah.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; That's a heavy load question. Please take it as you want to. [laughter] Yeah. &gt;&gt; No, thank you so much for that and uh thank you so much for joining us. Uh uh

before we actually dive into it uh I think it'll really help the panelists if you're able to have a sense of the audience in the room. Uh can we have a quick show of hands to see how many of

you are part of the civil society organizations nonprofits academics? Oh wow majority. How many of them are how many of you are from the industry

for-profit companies killing setup providers stuff like that? Anybody from government here? Thank you. Okay. Uh &gt;&gt; that is why we have the ecosystem

builder talk first. You'll tell us how what is the ecosystem. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm going to be preaching to the choir because everybody here is from the civil society and I represent that more

than I represent the industry or the government here. Uh I think let me start by saying that uh uh I think the larger question under which uh the future of women in digital ecosystem falls is uh

the work itself and I don't think over the last two years in all my conversations with people not just in India but globally if I ask where is the work going to be I don't think anybody

has the answer. Most people are able to answer it by saying that uh AI will take work away a large volume of that and there isn't going to be enough work for anyone

uh whether it's men or women and uh and that's a big problem. People do argue saying that everybody's productivity will go up so small holder farmer can do more with AI. Everybody is arguing that

uh a last mile health worker, education worker, extension workers in agri uh uh rural carter worker all of them will be slightly more productive. So I think that's the value AI will bring. But I

don't think people have an answer to uh do we have net new jobs or a huge number of uh jobs taken away. I don't think that's the topic of conversation right now. So we'll pin that question but

unless we answer this everything else is a cute corner in which we are trying to find our efficiency answers but the biggest sort of uh uh swad dangling on us is that will we have enough work for

everyone uh pinning that aside I think what's happening in the ecosystem in general from the work we have seen around as well as what we have done uh uh uh

through some of our uh initiatives is that there's a lot of silos out there. If you look at uh on the government side, we have 22 plus schemes out there that are actually providing digital

skills to women uh which is quite a lot from rural development to social justice to uh ministries uh touching technology to ministries touching specific uh uh

communities in various uh inclusion ex exclusion audience. The challenge is that all those skilling initiatives are creating skilled workforce but they are not in work. None

of them actually have the last mile connection to the job. So you see a huge amount of skilling not leading to better employment any employment or employment at all and people are wondering what are

they doing skilling for and the whole skilling ecosystem hence is a little bit of self-s serving in the sense that we have skilled people. It works when when there is a child like

you invest in a child thinking at some point the child will have better life outcomes in education but in skilling you don't have that patience. you're skilling an adult who's looking for a

job outcome or a livelihood outcome in 3 6 months from where they are. So a lot of skilling is happening without that. I think on the nonprofit side the nonprofit ecosystem is probably closer

to the markets because they care about after scaling what happens. But even there when you go and look at it they are actually creating a large amount of scaling closer to where people are not

closer to where jobs are. So most of India skilling is supply side skilling not demand side skilling. You take people where they are at the source of origin of people not closer to the

markets and people don't migrate after they are skilled to actually where the jobs are and you see a lot of uh mobility challenges massively enhance when it comes to women. Men are way more

mobile uh time flexibility rich than women and that becomes another huge barrier for women when they're accessing jobs. Industry is trying to do skilling but

that's not creating net new jobs. That's not even creating net new productivity. It is required for a cafe chain to train their people how to make a cappuccino right. Uh that's not really scaling.

That's like an employer investing in L &amp; D for their workforce to be able to do what they're supposed to do. So huge amount of siloed efforts happening across the country which are

not necessarily leading to the outcomes that you want to see for women uh specifically on higher incomes, more labor force participation or better life outcomes in general at the end of that

skilling. Now uh when you look at it that's sort of one huge gap. Everything is operating in silos in terms of one of the things that we need to be seeing in this

ecosystem. Hence is who are the people who understand the jobs and the demand side best and how can they be the entry point of where women can actually get connected to jobs

given the safety concerns, mobility concerns, home care, parental responsibilities etc. Women have lot less mobility, a lot less time richness and time flexibility

richness to be able to participate. If we have to solve for this, we have to take work where women are. And the challenge is that that work is so uh disagregated across the country that you

don't see any intermediaries from where the jobs are and where women are actually. And I think unless we really invest in demand side aggregator platforms, we

won't be able to save this all. We saw it in micro finance. If you don't have lastmile providers of finance, you are not able to give access to finance to women. If you don't have lastmile

aggregators of work, you won't be able to take work where women are. So, if I was to have one recommendation, I think the most important is who are the intermediaries that will actually

aggregate work and take markets to where women are. And I see there's a lot of good work happening in pockets. Obviously, your work is very inspiring and we'd love to learn more about it.

There is KA one of the organizations a part of our portfolio who takes work from AI first companies and is able to actually take that work to women across the country. Uh and they have close to

100 thou 100,000 workers right now in just 3 years across the country who are participating in labor markets by working on data content moderation annotation etc.

So we need a lot more of that and I think investments in that are almost negligible very minuscule compared to the size of the need that we have. Excellent starting point which brings me

again to Mitila Romesh. I think this is a brilliant um sort of like way to segue to this which I think next Wells has been one of the stellar jewels to your human in the loop models where they able

to really challenge this idea of AI replaces people and said they create jobs. No. So um and you have a lot of experience even before AI. I think you have and I talked it would be great if

you a explain a bit about next and the history and how you came about as well that model community based integrated structure where you do integrate women in the process. So it is something very

local but also globally efficient as well. So you have that challenge as well. So lovely to hear your insights on that. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Uh good afternoon everybody. I hope uh

people at the back can hear and see as well. Um very nice to be here. I'm going to break your question into multiple parts. I think uh Atul has covered a lot of the

background. Uh the first part that Sharon was talking about is the human in the loop part. Just a quick context setting on the human in the loop and next wealth. Next wealth is an

organization which is uh into um it's a social entrepreneurship or organization. We do work which is human in the loop work in the AI development to deployment life cycle and our purpose is to

generate jobs for graduates in small towns with specific focus on women. So we have about 60% women um in our organization we are across 11 centers and about 5,000 people and have provided

jobs to about 20,000 people. We do work in the areas of AI development to deployment life cycle which includes data annotation. It includes uh RLHF uh prompt fine-tuning human eval and so on.

So that's a little bit of context about next. Second point that you mentioned is about uh automation and Atulu was also touching upon it in terms of automation taking away jobs which is a real fear

which is there in the minds of a lot of people today. Um while in the short term it is probably going to automate a lot of the work that is done today especially from the BO industry I think

in the long term the volumes are really going to go up and uh why is that it is because let's say you have 100 people doing work and it because of automation it reduces to 40 but because of the fact

that today AI and AI agents agentic AI has opened up a whole lot of possibil ities there are going to be a lot of use cases and newer areas that are going to come up and therefore the volumes are

actually going to go up. So we believe that the next 100 million jobs are going to be generated in this space and it's like if out of 100 60 gets automated and reduces to 40 the 100 itself is going to

go up. Uh you know 20 years back we talked about mobile phone usage and UPI usage about 10 15 years back it was predicted it will grow to 1 million transactions. We are actually many

billions transactions. I think that is an inflection point today that we are in and the next 100 million jobs is going to be generated in this area because of the volumes of AI work that is going to

happen and I just read I think uh yesterday or day before yesterday in Infosys uh investor uh uh no write up and they have actually said 92 million jobs are going to get automated but 170

million jobs are going to get created. So that's again an order of about 100 million and 300 to400 billion dollar worth of new service areas are going to be generated. Of course you know these

are all numbers one can guess it can be plus or minus but that is a scale of what we are talking about. So volumes are going to go up because of this. volumes are also going to go up because

as more and more of these AI applications come in. I think there is an inherent um problem of bias or hallucination which happens because the lot of the AI work that is happening is

at at a higher uh for the economy economically forward sort of organizations except what Yona was and she'll talk a lot more about it but because of that the chances of bias and

hallucination is much much higher so how do you make um and you know I want to just bring up the fact of difference between automation and AI. I'm sure all of you know it already but automation is

deterministic and therefore for the same input you get the same output. Uh AI is probabilistic and can never be 100% perfect. So you'll always need the human in the loop to make it do the quality

check, do the validation, to do the testing. It can automate maybe 50 60% and we've seen with all of many of our clients that even if it automates 50 60% that has to be validated against bias

and hallucination and the 40% anyway the human in the loop has to do the work. So the volumes will go up because of the fact many more AI applications are coming in and number two because you

have to make it because of the bias that is inheritant inherent and the fact that it is probabilistic. It requires human in the loop to do the validation testing make it more um trustworthy, reliable,

more responsible and explainable. I think that becomes very very critical as the volume and all of us are very familiar with deep fake videos. We see audios, we see videos, we see articles.

You don't know the authenticity and the genuiness of these of these articles or videos. That's where this whole thing of making AI responsible, trustworthy and reliable comes into play. So that's the

second point in terms of volumes going up. Third point that you mentioned is in terms of globally competitive and locally inclusive. So to be globally competitive, one has to build the

capability in these uh newer skill areas. One has to be very fast. The speed with which things are happening is um you know what [clears throat] used to take uh weeks or months is taking days.

Today you can build a website in under an hour today. So the speed with which we operate as the second most important thing. Third is positioning as a reliability layer uh becomes very

important especially for the human in the loop. And last of course is the price part. The moment moment it becomes affordable then you will have that much more uh applications and usage that

actually increases. So that is the glo making it globally competitive. These four things become very important and locally inclusive is you know Atul touched about touched on it locally

inclusive becomes important because a lot of especially in industries like financial services retail marketplaces um fashion where women have a role to play. You can't have human in the loop

and training of AI algorithms which is biased uh towards let's say a higher economy or men. It has to be locally inclusive to especially in these industries and that will make the AI

models far more robust than what it is today and therefore I think it is a business imperative and not just about inclusiveness. It is a business imperative to have women doing this

human in the work um as far as these industries are concerned. The fourth point that you mentioned was in terms of barriers. So I think the biggest barrier from the um uh supply side is actually

having access to organizations who need this type of work and from the demand side is to say that there are women and people from small towns who can actually do this work and this sort of work that

is that requires volumes. So the way we have addressed in our own organization is to have uh AI based task killing. We've had uh we have an all women's center where we um medical coding is

done by the women there. So AI does a lot of the medical coding and assigning the ICD codes. Um the AI does it but the exceptions come to us and you know exceptions it's very very difficult to

do medical coding because it runs to pages and you have to assign the right code and the target therefore is 97%. This all women center is actually doing it at 99%. They're just hitting it out

of the park. So um lot of this work is uh you know I wanted to address this part in terms of repeating just summarizing whatever I said right now it's in terms of the human in the loop

part and the sort of work that is being done the volumes that are going to go up and therefore the uh global competitiveness and local uh inclusivity becomes very important and not only from

the inclusivity part of it but also from the fact that you would need this sort of We need women to be able to do this human in the loop work to make AI models far more robust.

&gt;&gt; Thanks. Actually that's very fascinating actually made me realize I should go spook to you in your office in in directly. I I think my natural progression I think I'll go to uh Dr.

Mohan actually because it's about I think it's a natural link. So Dr. Mohan just to summarize we had atul here from an ecosystem perspective and Mitila here giving more of a private sector how they

build the ground up. I think um you're a very natural transition and I remember when my colleague and I met you in office you had this aspiration to say how can I create a big gig economy on

digital skilling and how can we empower the rural economy uh with that I I think nillet also I think it's always the silent powerhouse behind the India emission when India emission says we

will scale India it's actually nillet who will scale India my understanding so um tell us a little bit on your perspective and I I just came from a round with meta which they had a very

good insight and they were talking about inclusive AI but we should actually talk about participate AI so it's not only having women include in the economy but how can they participate in the economy

a great way with that is skilling how do they skilling appropriately uh for that and make sure like atul mentioned he made a good point what you miss is how do you make sure that we just don't

skill the country without the jobs there and I you can great to hear your insights on that yeah &gt;&gt; yeah thank you and first I'm sorry for being delayed because my flight got

delayed from Jaipur. Uh so I NILT is a government institution under Ministry of Electronics and IT and it's uh called National Institute of Institute of Electronics and Information Technology.

It is basically into digital skilling. Uh one of the biggest ecosystem of escaling in the country. We have presence in every state. 56 centers spread across the country. Out of 56 22

are in the northeast. &gt;&gt; Wow. And we are everywhere Shinagar, Lelay, Cargill, Jammu, Kashmir anywhere we go uh in the remotest part of the country and in islands also. So that is

our physical presence and uh we skill 10 lakh people every year 1 million every year and actually 40% of that are women. So

by design NYET is a very inclusive institution because our spread is everywhere entire two tire three cities in the rural part of the country. So we cater to the needs of those uh

people who are disadvantaged sections. Also we don't charge any fees from the students. So it's free

and these qualifications are of very good quality. Uh they are acceptable for employment in many countries like Japan, Taiwan, Korea and Singapore.

Interesting thing is that what NEP has implemented today we never had any entry barrier in our IT programs. So any student from humanities and commerce and any background can do the IT courses. So

and uh I'll just tell one example u quesanana CTO of Microsoft he's our student of nlet a label so all those positions which a btee student gets from a very structured system these nonformal

degrees are also providing such kind of employment to uh the students I there is a long list like Denar Gupta who is the CTO of KPMG in Switzerland and in and the global foundaries and you take the

name of any industry you'll find these students are there who are coming from a non-farmal segment but there is a flexibility in built you can do this course number of years number of

attempts you can take uh so I mean these these things are already there in the nate and giving lot of people uh to the country to industry and now recently we started a dist platform we call it

nillet Digital University platform to again bridge the divide because we realized that how to take the industry level skilling to the remotest part of the country

and then they get a employment and not only get employment they are skilled in such a way that lot of entrepreneurs come up in the rural part of the country. So the localization which madam

was telling that how can we create the local businesses local employment with global standards. So the solution was in escaling in a proper way. So this platform we have created in the four

month only we have got 45,000 registration. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; And every minute five students are resting on this platform.

So we have registered 10,000 in AI just latest number and 3,000 in semiconductor design. So uh this is just few numbers which I remember through this platform. This is a very one of the best example

of AI in education very intensive uh platform with uh all the personalized learning. It has a recommener system it has a credit paper system. It's a interview simulator uh program for job

and all. Uh with the AI for all program also it is absolutely free to anyone who can do it. Uh most of our programs are compulsory for government jobs in India. Many of the programs also I will do the

quality. So any student in the remotest part doing our programs can get a government employment. They will be employed. And I am telling you if you go to the north northeast in any state

anybody who is having any IT knowledge he is graduated from nate. So that kind of intervention nlet has made and women are very part of it but very focused program on the women. Now we are

thinking and we are doing also like recently we are working on a project with you uh for the women who have actually due to you know their family pressure

uh they have stopped working for 4 five years they taken a break from the employment and how to bring them again through scaling in the mainstream especially AI so that one program we are

launching very soon uh uh which is very muchentric we have done many programs in cyber security especially for women and they have got employment also uh in AI also

and this platform also integrated with industrial and 160 industries are on boarded on it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And they keep posting their job roles and students get employment

through online uh virtual interview uh uh system and you tell the name of any infinian Germany or Intel or Nvidia or Microsoft or IBM everybody is working with us and they're giving their

programs on this this platform. So this platform is having all the industry grade programs directly from the industry. uh it's a very practiceoriented program.

That is what's important thing. Uh because if you do skilling and only theoretical without hands-on it will not actually create jobs and neither you'll be able to create your

own startup and other things. So if you go on this platform and see.igital it's a hands-on platform where all the labs are virtual for semiconductors for AI for cyber security for cyber 4 and six

all the technology you see for industry 4.0 zero and it's a very good hands-on platform. It is as good as you are doing in a physical environment and even that can be used for the prototyping. So

students are doing and uh I I remember in students from any institution include IIT and NIT they are now registered on this platform. &gt;&gt; Oh wow. So I mean it is that as good as

and this is available to a student in the remoteest part of the country also right in the next phase we are going to create 100 studios across the country where experts from industry will come

and directly take classes for the students. So this is the some of the you know initiatives we are taking to make uh uh scaling very inclusive and taking the best scaling uh to the different

part of the country and we have seen lot of good out outcome of it. We have created few months back 28 AI data lab in 28 location in the country. You you can see in mighty pavarian there are two

products come out of these labs. One is in Indian sign language it's very good product you you upload any video or any audio it will automatically convert into Indian sign language so that has come

from remote agartala from agertala it has come you know one team infal is developing audio to audio translation so these you can see in the mighty pavlian also it is there I mean these are the

intervention I'm talking about our skilling has created 25 startups in the northeast so certain interventions I would like to just uh say here the student of nit in

shinagar uh created a you know model for a very pecular problem which in Delhi we cannot think there is a taleim the khalen worker they know only talim they know any they don't know any

language &gt;&gt; dr can one minute left because I'm finished &gt;&gt; so it runs into 50 pages it takes months to design one design now they can design

and tal is automatically generated. So such kind of interventions which through skilling we have made it is all inclusive womens are part of it and the digital platform also I have s seen that

40% women are registered here so that is a certain initiative you have taken thank you &gt;&gt; okay thank thanks a lot uh Dr. So uh now I want to get to Yuna. So you work in a

wonderful space where people talk about um job through AI but augmented AI and facilitate already in structures that are there to solve problems have a huge impact on productivity income for women.

Can you talk talk about your experience at digital green? Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Um so pleasure to be here. I'll talk a little bit about digital green and I'll focus on agriculture something

that um my panelist co-panelist also started talking about. So there are 500 small holder farmers around the world and their work matters so much because the food that each of us depends on uh

relies on them. But they have to solve problems around pest around climate change volatile market prices all without often support of any advice. Sometimes there's no sensors, there's no

scientists, there are no satellites that are reaching these small holder farmers. So if the advice comes too late or if it doesn't come at all, what ends up happening is that crops get sick,

animals get sick, families and communities lose their income and go hungry. This is the problem that Digital Green has been working on for over 18 years. We've been trying to get better

advice, innovation to small holder farmers a lot more quickly. We used to do that with videos and then AI came around a few years ago and we decided what an amazing opportunity to do a tool

and put a tool in the hands of smaller farmers that can actually give them advice 24/7. Now, there are some extension agents or frontline workers that try to reach

farmers, but the ratio is 1 to 1,000. And when it comes to women, women are even more neglected by these networks of of frontline workers. And when advice does reach women,

it actually doesn't often work for the situations that they're in. So when we decided to build farmer chat our AI advisor we thought how can we do this in a way that's not just good for

agriculture advisory but it's good for women farmers as well. So where are we today? We have actually as of last week reached 1 million farmers uh with uh farmer chat about 60% of those farmers

are in India and then we also deploy in Kenya, Nigeria, Ethiopia and Africa and also Brazil. Farmer chat is available in 14 unique languages and part and I'll tell you some stories about how are we

making this work particularly for women and for small holder farmers. One of the challenges is that reading agriculture advice imagine somebody telling you like how to

prune a tree. It's not easy to follow that advice. We realized that we really had to make it what farmers want to do is they want to show you and they want to tell you and that means that texting

or using a text first keyboard type of chatbot isn't going to work that much. So farmer chat is very multimodal. This means that um farmers can take a picture of a yellow leaf or something that's

happening in their crop or they can use their voice and tell us a story of what's happening and AI will respond and they can listen to the advisory. They can do this in local language. This has

been a gamecher. About 40% of the 8 million queries that we have on our app are multimodal and that means that if somebody is struggling with digital literacy, there is a way to leapfrog

that and and provide advice in a way that matters to them. Um another thing that we know that particularly women farmers struggle with is um is uh having smartphones and then

having data on those phones. It is not so much an issue in India but data is so expensive in Ethiopia and in Kenya. So buying a data bundle and then using it to get advisory was a big barrier to

access. So we decided to go to SafariCom which is a telco and we decided to make the app free zero rated for all of the users in Africa and what we saw is that people started using it a lot more

because that barrier to access was lowered um and then um the other so I'll mention one more barrier the other barrier is that for a lot of these farmers they

have never used a digital tool before and there's this idea of a capability overhang. It's an imagination bottleneck. What question should I ask? How far can this app help

me? And what we realized is that a lot of people are intimidated to look at a blank screen and figure out what questions to ask. So the two things we did is that we created some starter

questions. These are things that people can just enter and see examples of questions they can ask. But then if they ask a question, our AI automatically gives three follow-up questions to help

the conversation keep going, to help them dig deeper. So these are things that we're doing to make the design easier. Um, but I'll tell you a story. It's not just about making this app

accessible. It's also about making the advice really personalized and really localized for women with this fine-tuning. Um, I'll tell you a story. when I was in Bihar and I was speaking

to a woman and I asked her how's it going do you like the app and she said uh not so much and I said tell me more you know what what happened how have you used it and she said well I really

wanted to start a chicken business I bought these baby chicklet very very early turns out they're really cheap when you buy them very very young but they're also very hard to keep alive so

she asked the app and this was early in the day and she said, "My chicks are getting sick. They're dying. What can I do?" And I said, "Okay, great question. What advice did Farmer Chad give you?"

And she said, Farmer Chad said, "Go vaccinate them." She said, "Of course, I know that you can pay to vaccinate chickens, but I'm a poor woman farmer. I want to make money with this business. I

don't have enough money right now to vaccinate the chickens." So what we realized is that you have to give options for people that have different labor capabilities, different income

capabilities. And so we've been doing a lot to actually fine-tune and get local annotators to look at the answers and localize them and say, do they work for everybody? And how can we make them work

for everybody? So I told you a lot of stories about the design really getting it's hard. I'm not going to say that it's easy. You know, we feel very proud that we reached a million farmers. About

a third of them are women. Our goal for next year is 45. Now, I'm going to tell you uh a little bit more about is it working right? And so, we've done some surveys and seven out of 10 farmers say

that they're adopting um the advice on farmer chat within 30 days of getting it, which for us is is amazing cuz we've been working in this space for a long time. Um but what's interesting is that

women are saying that they feel more secure and more capable in terms of um the the type of innovations that they can do in their farm. And this was actually surprising and the hidden thing

is it seems like we're building agency and what women are confiding is that they're saying that um it feels like a safe space to ask questions. I don't feel judged. I don't feel dismissed. I

can actually ask questions that I wouldn't feel comfortable going to other people around. So, there's a lot there. It's an ongoing process. We have so much to learn about the questions that women

asking, what kind of responses that they value, and how we can really lower those barriers to access. But, um, we're I think we're we're excited to be playing and active in this space. And the last

thing I'll say is that we really care about income increase and productivity increase. So we have three randomized control trials that are one that has started in Kenya, one that is starting

in India and one in Ethiopia that's really going to tell us is this matter and is this actually changing livelihoods in the long term. So thanks a lot. You know that's wonderful. I'd

love to talk more. I think before taking questions to the crowd, one very quick one sentence from each cuz I don't have time for a second round. What is one concrete thing you would do to improve

the lot of women in AI from your perspective very quickly? Yeah. &gt;&gt; One sentence please. So uh one sentence uh the one thing is the policy change is important because if you keep know same

rule for men and women many times it may be difficult like that 40 hours of the work or 7 days a week you should work so it will be difficult I think industry should change some policy also and then

skilling will be more important for &gt;&gt; great I would say to come together around building local languages and doing those really really well there's so many gaps

when they're actually in deployment in the field and this is not one thing that one organization can do alone. So I think if we can really unlock local language and do that well it's going to

do amazing things for women in AI. &gt;&gt; Thanks. &gt;&gt; I think for me uh we are seeing government of India put tens of thousands of crores by initiative in

R&amp;Ds uh AI deep tech etc etc. If you want intentional uh gender outcomes, uh we need to create a very specific fund of funds for women inclusion in digital and AI and uh it

will be great to see a lot more digital brains and next wealths come out of initiatives like that. &gt;&gt; Fantastic. Mia I think uh I would articulate a vision first to say can we

create uh India as a AI factory for the world and uh in a hub and spoke model where the hubs are the cities and the AI development happens there and the small towns are the ones where the human in

the loop work happens. So if you define that as a vision then I would say creating skill ladder training the women on the specifics in a structured manner online

and creating the equivalent of now cre for women in AI. Fantastic. Great. Thanks. So we have time uh this was speed paneling I guess we have time for maybe a few questions six minutes. So

maybe we can take one or two questions for the for for the for the panel. Yeah. Any questions? Are you stretching or you have a question? Yeah. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Yeah.

Any uh interesting um queries? Yeah. &gt;&gt; Thanks. I'm I'm Dhiraj Dolwani from B2R which is doing rural BO in the next 12th model for the last 17 years in Uttarkand. He also happened to be a

dudge a n d n d n d n d n d n d n d n d n d n d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d dital nree cohort member of DNC Najins cohort member also I was actually listening to both of you and I

couldn't resonate more my question is more towards my three you mentioned a lot about task based skilling and the example you gave of medical coding is exactly what I saw doing wonderfully

there it is the uh the investments in contextual skilling which we believe that could actually be the answer to what you've talked out in that could you give some more thoughts I mean how is

that really going to be the big game changer and what are I mean I can hear a lot about nlet right now Dr. Moan what you said I looked up some of the courses they are very good for somebody who

doesn't know anything about anything but the kind of contextual learning that we are grappling with in this segment of a particular task needed to be done with a lot of context we do accounting work

when a person who doesn't have any background of commerce or accounting is doing that work now a lot of the context background and learning has to be encapsulated in that contextual learning

how can AI help us in that is I'm keen to know any thoughts on &gt;&gt; no absolutely I think contextbased scaling is very important especially with AI agents and agentic AI coming in

a lot of the standard work is going to get automated so therefore for example we do work in the retail space so we have people in Salem and Chitur actually deciding on the next fashion accessories

or the next generation of fashion which is going to be released all over the world so they cannot do that unless they have the local context unless they understand where the client what is the

customer looking for uh when he's giving this work to us. So I think the first part is in terms of um skilling in terms of the actual task. So let's assume it is data annotation or product tagging

and things like that. So actual work. Second is assuming a lot of this work would get automated going to the next level of skill which actually looks at saying it's just not the task but where

is the what is the context and the higher level of skill that would be required which would be fine-tuning or human eval or um uh you know that sort of work that needs to better prompting

right that sort of um training that needs to be given so I think we are still some way from there uh we are assuming that you know the whole world is now moving is already moved towards

AI. It is moving and it is moving very fast. But I think first level is task based scaling. Second level is going to contextual contextualizing it and third level is doing a better job of the

prompting and fine-tuning. &gt;&gt; Thank you. We have time for one more question. Anybody question? Yeah.

Uh sir my question is that the the real challenge about the uh reshaping work for women is the adoption of women in the scaling courses and all. So how are you tackling that in as you said that

there is so much penetration of women because if we don't know that then we will not be able to capitalize a infrastructure and all for anything to be penetrated to the women sector of the

society that is true that is a real problem uh because uh if you just see there are lot of entrepreneur in the rural part of India woman entrepreneur I met a lady in Madipur she is having

18,000 workers working for the and they're making uh uh lot of you know bags and other things with that but when you talk about the tech entrepreneurship uh they don't have that much confidence

in themselves they can't do it so that's a mindset issue with which I mean we all have to tackle that and give more confidence to them through a very targeted skill programs and we are

working right now on that also that they get a confidence that they can also do some tech kind of entrepreneurship when I say we have created 25 startups none of them are women

so I mean that's kind of mindset are coming and I mean that's a old generation who is coming and thinking like that we have to train new generation to think very very

differently so that's a thing where we have to work through a skilling only so that they get more confidence They develop things, develop products for them and you know women especially are

very good in product management they're very good in empathy I mean so such kind of things which you know future skills there uh we can use them so we are working on that but it takes

time you know yeah &gt;&gt; great um can I &gt;&gt; one more question it's not the bill the bell is not ringing yet one more question yeah

&gt;&gt; please keep your questions short Great. &gt;&gt; Hi, I'm Abi Manu. I'm engineer turned lawyer. So when we spoke about agricultural field particularly, you

spoke about the problem being solved in a particular uh problem equation say why the chicks fell ill and using AI to solve that. So but in India predominantly the uh informal sector and

agricultural sector it had it there's a feminization of workforce and is there a way that you guys see that AI can help bridge the uh wage inequality which is there in particularly in these fields.

&gt;&gt; Yeah. So I think the way that we've been thinking about it is we know that there is um income gap having the same land under management women that land will underperform

if a woman farmer has it versus a man for various reasons. And so what we want to do is with a tool like farmer chat we can see if we can actually bridge that income gap. Can we decrease it? Can we

get advice that works for women in the local context? But the AI models that are available now are not yet good enough to provide that both localized advice in the local language and that's

also personalized to the context of that female farmer and their motiv her motivations, preferences etc. So a lot of the journey that we are doing is one is to make the user interface and access

very good but the other is can we fine-tune and localize these models so then that that advisory can be fit um to provide advice that advice is not enough. you have to connect the women to

market to income and this one partnerships come come forward but um it's it's putting those pieces together in the ecosystem to lift up uh th those livelihoods.

&gt;&gt; Great. Thanks. I think we're a zero on the dot. So thank you so much. Thanks for the panel. It's wonderful uh wonderful work and thanks for the audience. Thanks Yashita for putting

this together and u thanks for the whole team as well. uh there's a whole bunch of powerful ladies that uh prepared this panel actually. Thanks a lot. &gt;&gt; Uh so I just request Dr. Kapil Khan

Sharma to please come on board and present a small momento to all the panelists and I really thank everyone for joining us today. Um so with this we'll wrap up the session for today.

[applause] I'm going to present to the panelist first. Okay. Thank you.

&gt;&gt; I was and we're such a big fan of &gt;&gt; one. Thanks for coming.
