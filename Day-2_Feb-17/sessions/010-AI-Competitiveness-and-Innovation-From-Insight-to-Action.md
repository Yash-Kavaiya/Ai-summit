## 📝 Transcript

who comprise 25%. &gt;&gt; We use that as a vantage point to pressure test what actually drives competitiveness in the real &gt;&gt; in parallel. We're also developing an AI

innovation playbook. The aim is practical distilling what works across government talent and the then scale the framework so that countries can adapt faster and build

with &gt;&gt; today we're joined by leaders from civil society &gt;&gt; and they'll help us understand the best practices to promote AI competitiveness

and innovation joined by Dr. uh excuse me Dr. Thomas Zakaria who's a senior vice president for strategic technology partnerships and public policy at AMD. He's also a

commissioner on the geotech commission. We're also joined by Ria Straer Galves who is an international policy special projects lead at anthropic and we're also joined uh by Pablo Chavez who is an

adjunk fellow at the technology and national security programs. So our job today is simple. Moving insight to action, right? Identifying a few moves that will actually unlock

competitiveness. Identify the early signals that we should track over the next year so that we understand that we're on the right path. Welcome panelists and thank you for joining us

today. &gt;&gt; I'd like to start with Thomas. Thomas, you are commissioner on the Geotech Commission. From where you sit, what are two or three non-negotiables for AI

competitive &gt;&gt; in systems especially around power compute and supply chains? &gt;&gt; Well, first of all, thank you and it's a pleasure to be here and uh I must

say I'm I'm sort of uh amazed at the interest and the turnout uh here. uh a colleague of mine reached out and said, "So, how is the AI summit going?" I said, "It almost feels like with those

of you who can appreciate it, it almost feels like tailgating at a at a football a football event." So, the enthusiasm and and interest in AI is really powerful. So, I'm delighted

to be here. In terms of uh the specific question about scale, I think the real question is that How do you I would reframe that question by saying that how do you how do you

translate compute to capability? How do you deliver on the promise of AI? It's very clear uh for those of us who've been in this long time that AI is probably one of the most transformative

technology that we are actually having to to deal with. And I personally would put it in the same sort of category as the impact in terms of connecting connectivity

people in terms of smart. So you know at the at the you know and and I would also say that having gone through my career the intersection of energy and compute the the linkages uh

is very very clear energy and compute are intertwined and if I look at in the leading up to the AI summit the number of announcements of data center investments here in the in India clearly

uh uh the future on that metric alone appear to be bright in in the sense that you have to translate the several gigawatts of promised infrastructure. But it's also important for us not to

lose sight of the fact that AI, you know, compute does not directly translate into AI enablement without actually going to the full stack. and and I having been uh perhaps spent most

of my career in in a public sector enterprise I I I I am personally biased to a much more of an open enterprise because that allows us to scale. I I think that when if you want to bet you

want to bet on the bright talented people particular in India 1.4 for a billion people and so open open enterprise open stack interoperable and to me I think it's you know today if you

were to open up your laptop or your PC maybe some of you uh go and specifically buy a model based on whether it's an Intel CPU or an AMD CPU but most of us just want to to run our software and get

our work done. I think that is where we are headed uh without a doubt whether it is five years from now or 10 years from now. So really open composable interoperable

uh enterprise and that is something that AMD and part of the reason why I joined AMD is because of that commitment to create an open sack and open infrastructure but that's not enough

right you want to make sure that the talent is there now it's not just the raw talent but talent with access to compute to access to models access to the relevant problems that's important I

also think that if you think about the if you look at where all The AI infrastructure model companies are there is a I could I would argue that there is a reason why countries like US, China,

Japan, Europe are leading because they have invested several you know at least multiple decades of building the fundamental research infrastructure. the talent

pipeline, the research infrastructure and therefore seeding the startups and eventually the enterprise. So that is sort of the the the the progression and I think uh I am really optimistic given

all the turnout that I'm seeing here today the excitement that India is at the in the one hand at the at the early stages but also there is nothing preventing I mean in a field that is

transforming very fast you there is no I I don't fear that India is late to the party it really means that every every generation you reinventing what can be done and I think you are in a great

place uh to to achieve the potential. So uh I will stop there and let the other panelists &gt;&gt; conversation &gt;&gt; um and you're you're entirely right in

the sense that there are a lot of announcables from countries uh essentially trying to claim some quick wins but really a lot of what we're trying to disentangle is what is

exciting versus what is what is dependable in this process what what we could actually be doing. Uh Ria, I want to ask you from the frontier side model, what is what's the risk of getting scale

wrong and what guardrails help without slowing progress? &gt;&gt; Yes, thank you so much for inviting us all here today. It's great to be here talking to you. Um I live in San

Francisco and I work for Anthropic and this is the year when Anthropic is really going international. Up until this year, all of Anthropic's compute and focus has really been on the US

market. So, it's a really exciting time for me as someone who cares about international policy. And so, this is something that we're thinking about very deeply right now um in terms of scaling

for the model and how is it going to be tied to the values that we care about and ensure that it's safe internationally and domestically. And one of the ways that anthropic at least

has addressed this is by creating uh constitutional AI. We have essentially have a constitution internally we call it claude soul. We have guidelines values-wise by what uh decisions will be

made, how things will be calculated. And that's extremely important to us as we scale. We think that as things get more complicated, as we introduce agents into how we're using models every single day,

and if you use cloud co-work, you're using agents, this becomes just even more complex. Um and so it's a very interesting thing for us to look internationally where we want to to

scale even beyond our models just to compute because that's what was mentioned earlier. We look at of course all the the kind of basics that was mentioned energy human capital but

there's also I think another overlay that's important to bring up and that is shared values and respect for things like data access um good regulatory environment that allows us to work there

like copyright um and when we talk about shared values I think it's important to call out that uh there are democratic values that we share with countries and that really is something that helps us

decide where we're going to scale Yeah. No, that's great. So, we have the building blocks right now. I'd like to move on to the builder, the government, and the incentives behind this. Um, so I

I'd like to [clears throat] ask you when you look at AI competitiveness through public lens, public interest lens, where is the biggest gap right now between ambition and execution? And what kind of

investment or institution building closes closes it fast? And this is for Pablo. Great. Thanks so much for the invite and it's great to see everybody. It's like

uh it's like being at a like at a concert. There's like standing room only. Um so it's it's it's wonderful that you're here. Um let me tell you a little bit about some of the the

research that that I've been doing um about um the the development of AI um around the world. And and let me frame it this way. Um about four years ago perhaps uh there was a sense that um

that AI would be a twoplayer uh game right uh two person race uh effectively between China and the United States. Um this was a diatic comp competition where uh as Kyu Lee who's uh

one of the major early people at Google China, Microsoft China as well um suggested that you know that we would be living in a world where we would have two AI states and every other country

would be a vassal state to one of those AI states. Um essentially providing data in exchange for uh financial support. What we have seen in particular in uh in the wake of chat GPT since November of

2022 is actually a tremendous buildout by uh many countries um around the world of their own AI infrastructure. um perhaps to avoid um that that future. But more importantly, I think for this

conversation and in response to the question, um I want to give you a little bit of a map of of what the AI world um looks like from a particular perspective. So I've been very focused

on sovereign AI deployments. Um, and the way that I define these are uh explicitly AI uh projects explicitly funded by governments and explicitly um uh characterized as driven by sovereign

interests. So to maintain uh strategic independence for a country to promote a country's language and culture um and so forth and I focused on three parts of the AI stack. The first is data, second

models, third um infrastructure and with a particular focus on on kind of GPU clusters. And what I found is that um in 2024 there were 30 countries that were deploying 40 of these projects pretty

much worldwide. um according at least according to this definition by January of this year that number had grown to 50 plus countries with 140 projects um worldwide and and I think that that

demon and these are all projects that are not in China they're not in the United States they are in places like India and I'll tell you that India is one of the leading countries in in this

effort you know we call it the sovereign AI effort um there are only four countries in the world that are heavily investing from a government perspective in all three of these um parts of the

stack. Um, India is is one of it as you know there is funding for models, there is funding for common compute, there's funding for data resources as well. South Korea is another example at a

smaller scale, Sweden and and Taiwan and that's it. So to your point about where India is, India is is leading and it's moving very very fast in in this world and um and so you know from a think tank

perspective like what what we're seeing is that is the development of kind of this multipolar AI world um where power is now concentrated in two actors where it's actually in increasingly diffuse

and distributed among many actors. I'll say one last thing. there's still a need for international partnership. There is still work with, for example, American AI companies and

European entities and so forth. So, this is not a closedoff world, but it is a a multi-polar world and and hopefully a cooperative world as we move forward. Thank you. So, it's a much more layered

issue here really. It's not a technological issue. It's a it's a it's all of the supporting uh nodes that go go into it. um in terms of uh that being the builder's view right let's let's

pressure test this uh through enabling conditions from industry so Ria when governments move fast or faster what is the most important guardrails that preserves trust and safety without

showing useful adoption &gt;&gt; yeah I think um it's really important for governments to show that they are embracing enabling environments because there are many options of of countries

that are investing in compute where you know we look at where we want to expand and they're essentially like pitching to us that that we should go there but it it really is much more layered than that

um uh embracing of using AI within the government itself is a really big indicator that's part of the reason why India is such an exciting country if we look at India it's actually the number

two user of claude internationally which I think is just an amazing statistic um but there's kind of nuance to that because the way that we see folks using claude in India is at a very high level

they're doing complicated engineering tasks they're doing coding um and so we see kind of like the highest level of use and I think there's a lot of work that can be done with companies and

governments specifically to better diffuse that use into more of everyday more of just the general office worker and having programs where the the government does skilling where the

government has goals for percentage usage of AI and really embracing that the way you do your office job every day will be changing is a key part um to making your country competitive and

attractive for further investment in this area. &gt;&gt; Yeah, entirely it's a critical factor in terms of how quickly you'll be able to develop use cases as well, right? like

not understanding uh or fully understanding what the bespoke model needs for for whatever industry the industry needs to be involved. &gt;&gt; Right. Right. And whatever the like

specific uh requirements are for that country if there are needs for data processing for you know private data that's something that you can work out and explore when you're doing these case

studies with the government which is exactly what we're doing in India. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Um, Thomas, I want to bring you in on the same question. So, if there's one place where government can

make it easier for responsible AI to scale, where would you focus first? &gt;&gt; Well, so I'm going to pick up on what uh Ria started saying and and even when she touched on Agentic AI,

uh, you know, Agentic AI was sort of the uh was the latest sort of framing for 2025. And I'm I'm going to be maybe a little bit controversial and say for 2026 it

could be governance and governance not in the context of regulatory framework which of course there could you know there is room for that but but the reality is that uh in order in order for

scale in order for impact you really want agentic framing agentic AI and so the way at least we think about it AMD is that you can think of it as both an inner loop and an outer loop where the

inner loop where the agents are functioning at the speed at which agents can function. They're developing hypothesis. They are uh continuing to to mod you know accelerate the pace at

which discoveries whether it is enterprise or whether it is science or any other aspect of it. Now where governance comes in is that you really don't want fundamental changes to

uh to any outcome uh without a human in the loop. So for for those of you who are who are you know in in your early career maybe going through undergraduate or graduate school the way I mentally

think about it is that if you are a you know say professor at a university and you have this large group of graduate students they're all doing amazing fundamental research but they don't get

to publish their work without first a professor going through and checking it and making sure that this actually accurate worthy of publishing and then you have a peerreview process and so

there is that intrinsic governance outer loop that is necessary before you allow the agent to go and you know deliver an outcome or update data and I'll give you um so so that's one aspect of the other

thing that where government can do and this is probably based on my experience like not only in the US but other places where there's real advances in AI occurring is the ability to to bring uh

public sector private sector and academia on fairly significant national scale problems and there's no reason why India cannot do that. You certainly have the raw talent. There is academic

infrastructure if you think about you know you said you're in Silicon Valley you cannot go to any company without having a lot of Indian talent and all you know from technical all the way to

the leadership position. So, so the raw talent, the academic framework is here. So, now the question is that how do you get people to work together? So, I'll give you an example which is current,

right? So, uh if you look at uh investment in R&amp;D in the United States, it's roughly a trillion dollars a year. Okay? And all of that it's only about uh 20% of that trillion dollars is

government investment and 80% say that maybe one third two-thirds is uh uh public sector the rest is private sector the private sector is the predominant uh funer of research maybe probably big

D small R big D and and so the the president of the United States issued an executive order it's called the genesis mission the idea is to bring private sector academia and public sector

together. And the goal is very simple. If you look at the the the investment in in R&amp;D funds is linearly increasing year-over-year. But if you look at the outcomes, it's sort of

flatlined, right? And the reason is because it's really complicated. You know, all the many of the simple problems have been tackled. And that's one where AI has a unique advantage. And

this is distributed. So you need federated infrastructure, you need curated data, you need uh interaction and collaboration among priv sector and private sector. And the goal here is to

double the productivity in 10 years without increasing the investment. And I think for a country like India, that would be a a a problem. It doesn't have to be the same thing, but a problem

like that, a a construct like that with at least in the US they call a lighthouse set of problems. 20 problems. Doesn't have to be 20. It could be five or six that is very relevant to India. I

mean healthcare, education, food, agriculture, these are all government's role in society. So I think that is given the talent given the infrastructure given the ambitions I

think a construct of bringing the private sector the public sector and academia in order to accelerate the pace of innovation which is going to drive development not only in the sort of the

the narrow definition of AI space but you have collateral impact broadly in really relevant areas and that's something that I would definitely advocate.

So you've talked about well collectively you've all talked about capital you've talked about industry you've talked about delivery and how they are aligning towards a common goal. However as you've

touched upon it talent and and workforce and the knowhow is something that is lagging behind and something that needs to catch up. Um my next question is for you again actually. You've been thinking

about this obviously in your professional life but also as a commissioner of the geotech commission um in the most practical way to expand and diversify the AI workforce quickly

while still building deep capability what works in training in education and institutional capacity and I know that's a very very big question &gt;&gt; without a doubt and look that at the end

of the day you have to take this from theory to practice and you know just a couple of days ago So AMD you know for the India summit had a hackathon right. Um we we thought we will have few

hundred there were like thousand registrations right and it was the last night at dinner people were saying that the the talent the quality of the problems the quality of solutions were

simply amazing. it is on par with with the best that you can see anywhere. So one of the things that we took away from that interaction is that there is really a der of ease of access of to to the

computer infrastructure and making that available and and incentivizing the talent the students to to really take their ideas and test it out and and practice that. We were having a

conversation earlier. The reality is that um not every problem requires trillion parameter models. There are a number of really important things that you can do. But just by downloading a

pre-trained model with weights and then you can fine-tune to your problem. And today the AI PCs uh that you can buy that is very very competitive will allow you to do certain things. So there are a

number of ways there's no one particular way but but also having certificate programs. So rather than going through a you have to have training at the pace and scale of AI. So you don't want

somebody to go for a four-year uh you know AI training program. So giving access to compute having structured programs and also creating an environment where people can thrive I

think is very very important. &gt;&gt; Yeah. and putting it in people's hands, right? Because at the end of the day, you don't need to be a computer scientist to be able to engage with this

technology and you shouldn't necessarily be a computer scientist because it's a very narrow field in in what we're trying to expand. Um, &gt;&gt; I could add on that just that was

Anthropic's experience. Uh, Anthropic released Cloud Code uh over a year ago, of course, aimed at engineers trying to make their work easier. And so if you're an engineer using cloud code, it does

make coding so much more accessible. But actually we noticed that people were using cloud code for a lot more than just engineering and software questions. They were using it for their everyday

research, for doing work on their computer that went way beyond just this one area. And so it's actually incredible in just 10 days uh anthropic put together cla

you know kind of just expands that capability to do agentic work essentially have a whole team that's working for you at the exact same time to help do any of the regular analysis

that folks do in their in their normal dayto-day and I think that is just increasing this accessibility because at first okay you didn't have to be a coder to be able to code but now it's even

taking that further You could just use audio. You could talk into Claude Co-work and in just a few minutes you could have something that you would need a whole team to have been researching

for a week. And it's just I think the the the entry is going to continue to go down and down as we find ways to make this even more useful, even just more almost seamless. um suggesting what you

should be doing a after seeing how you've worked for a day or so and really, you know, making it easier for folks to use it. Maybe not even having any technical skills at all, maybe not

even having that much literacy, just being able to talk into your your phone. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, it's a loop back mech or a loop back mechanism where you'd be surprised what you learn from the from

the people who are using your your um applications. Um, I want to move on to to what governance, what good governance looks like. And this is for you, uh, Ria. Uh, what does rightsize governance

look like when you're So, please don't put down your, uh, your microphone. What does rightize governance look like when your goal is is trust and speed? And how do you avoid both avoid both regulatory

gaps and accidental constraints? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Um, Anthropic is a member of a lot of uh, self-regulatory agreements and I think that is really great. Um, especially the ones where you see

industry coming together to commit to things like doing more multilingual training. Uh, that's a great example and I think that's something that we're all working towards that makes our models

more appropriate for the places where we want to grow and that helps with our ability to do testing and ensure that our models are safe in many different languages. Um, so there's a lot of work

that just within industry is happening and moving so much faster than quite frankly you could come to an agreement with the government on. Um, just at Munich Security Conference, Anthropic

signed an agreement that also Microsoft uh was on about a trusted tech stack and I think that's a really great example of something that can help move governance forward um but was agreed to by by

industry. &gt;&gt; Can I ask you just do you think that's a I mean is that a a trend that you're seeing? So, um, I guess what I would say about all this is that that, you know, a

couple of years ago, we were having this debate and discussion about the European AI act, right? And and the question about whether the Europeans were overregulating too early, um, you know,

um, to the negative effect on, you know, kind of like their own, uh, technology sector broadly and their their their AI efforts um, specifically. Um and so you know from kind of a public policy and

political perspective it seemed that perhaps the the governance discussion um you know was kind of going down in in you know in the list of priorities um and that what was going up was building

up national capacity and and so forth. But but perhaps really kind of like what we're seeing is is more kind of experimentation um within companies and also you know um alliances among

companies to kind of figure out like what should be kind of like you know what a trusted stack should look like and then governments as well on their own as they are kind of building out

their own infrastructure to kind of think about you know what that governance stack should look like right so I think that that's kind of what I'm seeing and I'm wondering if you you all

see the same thing &gt;&gt; yeah I totally agree I think Europe has realized that they unintentionally were kind of hampering growth that they actually wanted to enable and so they've

really pulled back and even even put a pause on some of the the most restrictive regulations that we saw there. Um, but yeah, the the collaboration between the labs is really

incredible and really creative because I I know at Anthropic and many other labs, we're extremely seriously concerned about the potential risks in the future and right now that already exist. And

quite frankly, I think sometimes we're trying to convince governments to be as concerned as we are. So we're yeah, we're taking it quite seriously. I mean I um you know I I I think that

the there is a fine balance between uh regulation that's why I use the word governance intentionally we don't know enough yet to regulate so so there is clearly a role for regulation and I

think understanding the opportunities and challenges and that that really comes through these kinds of part of the reason why we are here in this forum is to really focus on some of these issues

and and hopefully inform ourselves and and policy makers about the the striking the right balance for some of these things. I I also want to say that you know there is a um as an infrastructure

you know as a company that provides the fundamental infrastructure for uh AI you know the there are the motivations for hyperscalers model companies sovereign AI clouds

public investments they are both aligned but al but also different and so it's really important to to really understand the role each played and make sure that progress is made through through

intentional alignment. Now you know there's a lot of overindexing in terms of compute infrastructure simply because it turns out that it is the easiest thing for people to grasp and you know

ha for having lived in the public sector it's always easy to go talk to a congressman talk about infrastructure people get it but models regulation these are all complicated complicated

things but I would say uh since since we are here and uh Um to me what is fascinating is that um having been part of driving the infrastructure and particularly AI from

from the lab side working initially with Nvidia and then AMD and so on in fact sort of have a ringside view of how things have evolved it still is u kind of impressive that's a understatement

for me to say that you know it took us 10 years to to lay out a goal for delivering an exoscale system for 20 megawatt. People said it couldn't be done etc. Right? Why that's important?

Because as we've built this out, we want to make sure that we have to be as efficient as possible. But today there's a single rack of Helios sitting in the in the show floor that gives you one

single rack, 2.9 exoflops in a single rack. and and so the compute capability will be will there will be there yes we have to to plan we have to work you know on

that but I think compute you know you shouldn't believe that somehow things are going to stop in if there is anything it's accelerating so what is really interesting is I mean we didn't

touch on we really stayed in the model domain but but if you think about it it's an exciting space for AI is physical AI right it's really out at the edge and imagine the if you have the

same kind of compute capability that today is in this one rack that is available in a in a just in a couple of years out in the edge there are amazing things that can be done uh particularly

in a in a vast country like uh India. So I will just uh end my my comment by saying that much of India is in rural India and AI can be a great enabler of rural India in

tackling problems and and so that is both an opportunity from a policy point of view but it's also a great opportunity for creative ideas startups new businesses which then can be

developed in India from India for the rest of the And so I think this is an exciting time for India and we certainly as AMD are really looking forward to be part of the journey. Thank you. I want

to circle back to Pablo on this question actually because since you brought it up um if we're serious about um about uh competition uh we need to take into into consideration AI or allied alignment in

in the AI stack. um what does that look like in terms of leverage points? Um and what is the where should we be starting there? I I mean I think that this is it's such

a good question because it is one of the the critical things that I think all of us are going to be facing is um you know as AI systems are are built um around the world. So um you know when you talk

about allied countries I mean I think about you know both traditional allies partner countries. I think about for example the US India relationship um and and I think that one of the the points

there's a there's a couple of points of both potential alignment and potential friction um so the ind the Indian government and Indian government officials have long been concerned about

the idea of um both AI and other tech services cloud services and so forth um being cut off um so if you have a foreign cloud provider uh that you know perhaps because of

foreign government pressure those services would no longer be available in India and that's one of the things that that drives um you know kind of like the sovereign movement again it's not the

only thing that this is not a monocausal you know situation but um but but that is a a a driver interestingly on the other side you see a government like the United States starting to embrace um uh

sovereignty explicitly um the White House has been talking about this for for months And uh and so I think that there is this question and opportunity to find what sovereignty means among

partners and allies and is it sovereignty or is it a sense of solidarity? Is it partnership? Um I don't think that it is exclusive. Um but I do think that there are points of

sensitivity. So for example um uh intelligence data right or intelligence applications um military data military applications where you know perhaps that does need to be um uh you know uh

protected uh more carefully and not subject to um uh the second thing is that if India reaches its promise of uh of AI development through Sarbon and uh Barach

and all these other models that are being developed and all the you know uh cloud infrastructure that that's being developed eventually maybe sooner than later India will become an exporter of

AI if it becomes an exporter of AI how does that happen is it going to be uh in the same way that DPI has started to be exported will there be AI DPI um digital public infrastructure and how would that

interact act or will it interact with uh for example the American AI export program which is about exporting the American stack um that is often proprietary. Um so these are I think the

opportunities and the challenges for friend uh you know among government friends among government partners to really look at this trend and start to figure out what this world is going to

look like again as power and capacity is not concentrated in just two actors as it's as it becomes uh you know something that's more of of the world. &gt;&gt; So what I'm hearing is that competition

is delivery at the end. delivery across a bunch of different domains. Um I want to bring an additional voice into the room. Uh so we have here um Abashek hearing from uh so if you can grab a mic

Abashek um Abashek when you look at adoption at massive scale what is the single best biggest bottleneck to getting AI enabled services to millions of people?

&gt;&gt; Hi thank you uh glad to be here. I think look from India's uh context uh I think Thomas touched upon it slightly uh is the penetration of the AI services at the ground level in the tier 2 tier

three tier four cities where even today basic understanding of AI its risks and its harm is absolutely misunderstood or not clearly understood and a lot of awareness work is going around that. So

I think if somebody has to really scale uh the the regulatory frameworks are are in place and government has made it very clear that the baby has to walk itself. We will only pitch in when there are

issues around defects, misinformation. So one uh keep reinforcing and keep pushing the ecosystem to invest more in upping their in uh commitments towards promoting awareness at the tier 2 and

tier three levels. And I feel strongly that uh scaling of AI is not the issue. It is only when the governance frameworks which are embedded in the day-to-day thought process of the

boardroom leaders I think that's what has to evolve in parallel along with the regulation. So overall I would say uh the push for the DPI and integration of API which we are still trying to

visualize how it's going to pan out but the building blocks are already in place. It's more about the absorption the penetration because there are use cases for small businesses which stands

to be unlocked. there are thin files which needs to be addressed and the way the government is visioning here the inclusivity of the AI it will only percolate when the clear understanding

is there at the ground level that's what the success should ideally look like uh for a country like India yeah &gt;&gt; thank you we've covered a lot today uh we've also cracked open quite a lot of

really large topics that we didn't get uh a whole lot of time to discuss but thank you all for for engaging on this I want to open it up to to the audience because I know that we have a lot of

questions. Um, so please raise your hand if you have a question. Um, hi there. Hello, my name is Shri Agarwal and um, great panel here, right? And one of my

questions was that we spoke about how AI needs to be scaled across a nation with a huge population, right? And like he rightly mentioned the problem is education of AI people don't know how

can they use it or how it would be misused for them right now when it comes to roles of people for example business analysts right now these people aren't really doing the hard coding or the

technical major stuff they're the ones who are translating right making the business stakeholders aware of what action can they do so how what is the future for that kind of sector of

personnel and not just in like corporate but those are the people who really make the impact right create that transformation how does the future in AI look for look like um for you know when

companies are coming investing in India and for Indian startups to scale so um yeah if my question got through that's what I want to &gt;&gt; [laughter]

&gt;&gt; I could answer a bit of that actually taking from my experience at my prior role. I was working at JP Morgan Chase as executive director for AI policy there. And really the focus was how do

you get all the folks who work at JP Morgan Chase doing a whole range of things but generally not doing so much engineering to use AI and to embrace it. And it was a struggle even within a US

company. But what I saw that was extremely important was support from the very very top. the CEO talking constantly about how important it was to learn AI. And then we actually had kind

of internal uh programs to get people excited and to think that AI was their job even if they work in HR. Why would they take a a afternoon to go learn about some technology? Well, because

their boss was actually going to think that this was a positive thing. And I think it's a huge just change of mindset of what does your job entail? You should constantly be learning in small bursts.

And I think that is the big change that we all have to embrace that learning is now for the rest of your life learning is something that your employer should support and it's something that you need

to do to enable to become more competitive. And I think one of the great kind of like stereotypical phrases that we've heard is that you know AI isn't coming for your job. Someone who

knows AI better than you is coming for your job. &gt;&gt; Definitely. So um let me u probably ask answer by asking a question not expecting an

answer but uh when I think about India I actually have a slightly different point of view than than uh say coming from the US because you are a very young country right so people are much more

comfortable with technology and and to some extent uh if you think about you know much maligned often used word of AI factory etc. The reality is that you can you can deliver these capabilities much

more easily to tier 2 three and four cities than than building you know big brick and mortar kind of infrastructure. So you have a a young population much more um you know attuned to technology

from from uh from what I can tell and the the ability to deliver. So I think I think these are all the question is really an opportunity to reframe that as a policy action to say what can India do

in order to sort of diffuse this capability much more broadly given your demographics and given the opportunity. Yeah, you're entirely right in terms of there's an apprehension in the US

towards or distrust towards certain technologies, especially if people feel like it's going to displace them in their job and they're not going to have a a a fall back. Um that is something I

don't see here um as much where it it might be a generational thing. You're entirely right. Um and there's a and the fact that you have a lot of um a lot of digitized services as a result in

relative to the United States. So you are engaging on a day-to-day basis with a digital world and digital services coming from the government. So there's there's a bit more of a of a trusting

environment and therefore a willingness to engage in in a way that um in the US we have to get over that hump a bit. We we are finding that there's a lot of competition as far as these I mean for

example anthropic is coming up and GP is coming up with their own versions every 6 months every 3 months. So do you think that there will be a erosion of I mean what you call goodwill reputation as

such because it will become lot more about you know what you call who is who's running fastest rather than who serving with the best optimized way for power sector for education.

Yes, it is absolutely a breathtaking race that is happening right now amongst all of the leading labs. I don't see that changing at all in the future. In in fact, the race might speed up. Uh

models are being released all the time and also new applications of how to use the models. So, I'll give you an example that might get to get to your question. uh Claude for finance and claude for

healthcare are two recent product releases that that we've done and they specialize the the way you're using the tool if you work in finance for example so you have access to proprietary data

you're able to do Excel calculations in a way that you need to for your job and I think that will be the future along with increasing rounds of new releases I don't see that changing anytime soon and

the the competition is is really defined by this exponential growth that we've seen to be actually extremely consistent in terms of compute capabilities, metadata where we're we're going in the

the increases we've seen due to other aspects like reinforcement learning. Um so this is this is how we're going to experience technology just an everinccreasing pace of releases and

then an increasing personalization for the exact use you need for the industry you're in. Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Uh I appreciate your uh

statement that Hello. Hello. Yeah. appreciate your statement that uh there is a young population in India who are contributing uh too much here but our major issues we

are tier two tier three cities our major issue is that uh we don't get these uh high performance computing uh solutions from AMD I mean I I don't see AMD is not aggressive

in uh India in providing uh say u uh processor like u uh this uh uh thread rippers with Nvidia cards, multiple Nvidia cards where we want to use the systems with uh I mean uh power

optimized uh workstations with the eight eight processors, eight GPUs plus uh two thread rippers or uh new generation uh uh processor. I I mean I'm not getting uh the uh quote

from uh uh OEMs. &gt;&gt; Uh listen, we should we should talk after this. We'll be [laughter] &gt;&gt; Yeah. So So I think I I I'll just say that uh we are motivated to make sure

that you have access to our best uh you know GPUs and we'll continue to work at that and we will we will follow up with you. &gt;&gt; Stick around. Yeah, thank you. You know,

but we all understand. Yes. So, you know, the we talk about AI literacy, AI access and of course the impact, but how do you really measure that? You know, ultimately the theme is

welfare for all all, happiness of all. So far, you know, there are metrics and this is not enterprise value of a company. It's not GDP of a country. It's beyond that. So how do you begin to

measure some of this so that you know we know the progress from vision to impact but how do you quantify that? I'll let them jump in a second, but so I I've had quite a few roles in government, both in

the US government and in the Australian government. And um and that is perpetually the hardest questions to answer for any government is how are you um how are you quantifying impact for

for citizenry, right, on any services that you are providing for them. So given that we're very very early stages in what the like the potentiality of this technology or the how much it can

transform people's lives I don't think that that the metrics are quite there yet because people are trying to figure out how they can they can enable this technology how they can use it in

sectors to to accelerate people's um the benefit toward towards their citizenry. Um, but I'll say that from like my former uh US government and former Australian government hat.

&gt;&gt; Would you like to add to that? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah, we're done. Okay. So, so sorry everyone and uh thank you for the eagerness for the questions. I'm happy

to to stay back and have a couple of conversations. Um but thank you to the panelists and thank you Abashak for your intervention. Uh and thank you all for for joining us today.

[applause] here. My sir, &gt;&gt; thank you. &gt;&gt; My question is from panel is how AI will

disrupt the stock market, money market and how AI will emerge in finance sector. &gt;&gt; Hello. Uh I'm so sorry. Just one second. We'll take in a picture. We'll go in

outside and then you can have your conversion. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay. What are we doing? I don't know. I'm open. &gt;&gt; Okay.

Nice meeting you. &gt;&gt; This is what I find. &gt;&gt; Sorry. One more. One more. question.

&gt;&gt; Oh, thank you very much.
