## 📝 Transcript

All are aware that AI is transforming across all the sectors be it healthcare or biotechnology or agriculture uh education, finance, even national security.

I should say that uh India is it very unique and uh promising as well as at a very powerful moment and uh we are not just the consumers of technology. We now Indians are also creators, the

problem solvers and the global innovators and contributors. But if we have to truly lead this AI mission, we all have to build up that strong and inclusive AI pipeline

which connects the ideas to implementation which uh connects the industry with the research as well as the talent with the opportunities and today's audience

reflects that vision. Dear students, I'm very thrilled to have with us you today the aspiring change makers as well as very passionate startup founders are here and you are

going to build up the future and provide the solutions not only to India but to the world as well. So dear students, dear audience, this discussion is not about technology.

This discussion is about the impact, the possibilities and the responsibility that we as Indians need to take up. So with this uh I once again welcome you to this enriching session that we are going

to have uh very shortly and uh I take this pleasure in introducing myself as a host for today from Titankar Mahavir University. I'm professor Mangula Jen, Dean of academic affairs of the

university also taking care of uh the incubation and the innovation center. Uh I take uh and foster the u innovation, entrepreneurship and the global as well as the industry connects in order to

nurture the young talent and provide them some uh vision towards how they can be more creative in their academic careers. So with this uh I take this opportunity to introduce my very very

So um as we begin this session dear audience you all should take at least one idea one connection and one action once you leave this hall. So with this uh we take

this pride privilege again to welcome our eminent panelist and with their permission I would like to start with the session and a very very exciting question that is coming on the way is

what is one thing that the campuses must earn learn in order to stay relevant in today's fastchanging AI and innovation landscape and this question goes to all my eminent

panelists madam with you. I would like to have just oneliners or two liners here. &gt;&gt; Um stop I it's such a repetition but uh stop working in silos.

Know your stakeholders extremely well. You know don't miss out on any stakeholder. She said only one line. So &gt;&gt; so um I can give you an example from IIT Delhi. We have close to 30 departments

and not all professors know each other. So there must be 800 professors. That's a challenge of having a large population uh too many students and uh people don't know each other's job. Uh sometime

people think that the AI is done only by computer science department or school of AI but they forget the AI is also important for medical sciences or for automotive or even for policym for

everything AI is important. So I think I agree with Dr. Kavita. She said stop working in silos. We have to intersect interconnect that mechanism. We have to do it physically. Then only we can think

of digitally. &gt;&gt; That's great. &gt;&gt; Hello everyone again. Wonderful to be here. Um I would add that uh over reliance on machines harm us in many

ways. Um the power of humans is in the end our creativity and our tendency to rely on efficiency and automation is is potential threat to what we want to be in academia. So critical thinking has to

be key of whatever we do. &gt;&gt; There are some drawbacks of coming speaking last. Most of your points are gone. uh one thing that I want all of us including us in

campuses to focus on unlearn is the urge to go to AI platform the moment we have a problem in hand and it's very important for us to put our thinking first on what could be the potential

solutions or maybe empathize with the people for whom we are solving then straight away go to straight away go to any of these uh new age platforms that we have because the moment you do that

your own thinking gets bounded and it gets a boundary um for which you cannot think beyond that. So the unlearning factor here is to kill the urge not to use technology as the first and the

foremost help that you have. It should be your second option. First option should always be thinking and speaking with your stakeholders. That's that's so nice and I think all my audience and all

the stakeholders who have to actually implement it should be taking this um as a constructive suggestion. So um I'm moving on to uh Dr. Nikil. Sir you work closely with um the

academia industry and uh the research and uh you might be facing very many such cases where the students you know uh they build very impressive ideas and uh they showcase that also at the

campuses but uh you know uh sometimes it happens that the journey takes the toll and uh they are not able to uh translate that into a deployable idea. So um what are two or three most critical

interventions that the campuses need to make early so that the students make them some as the real world impact ideas. So the first thing that any student who

is thinking of doing entrepreneurship they should first of all try do it don't think much about it that's the first thing don't think how what will happen when it will happen uh how much it cost

once you start doing resources will come but the mistake I think what uh uh Dr. Jen has asked me the mistake is that the prototype is not commercially deployable idea.

The idea that you have developed in a lab or a small contraption that you have built maybe using a 3D printer maybe using your lab is not something which can be deployed for a large scale

population. So what you have to start thinking in the beginning itself whatever technology you are building whatever prototype you are building whatever product you are building can

you replicate this by 100,000 1 lakh 10 lakh 20 lakh 20 cr India is a large country or maybe 200 cr why not only India but also to neighboring countries or to also to Africa also to Latin

America or you know so that kind of idea if you have if you are able to think beyond your comfort zone of just a lab and prototype you can go much further. Second is also about the uh burnout and

cash burn the cost the cost of doing something. So I uh I can tell you many startup fail because they run out of cash initially. So let's say if you have five lakh 10 lakh rupees you have to

start working on idea some of you come together and then after a year there is not any money to available to go further then you run around and you are not focused on your product side but more on

a uh revenue generation side at that time your startup fail because the product is not ready to go to the market and you don't have any money. So start thinking on all those aspects in the

beginning itself before you go forward. That's one of the reason that student startup are the most failed. They are the most started and at most failed. Uh so student if you want to do and there

are also great examples there are student startup have become unicorns. So start thinking on these two three ideas. Uh first of all cost control. Second is uh prototype. Whatever prototype you're

building it has to go to a commercial level sometime in the future. So are you ready for it? What things you need to do? So you if you have those answers investors will run after you rather than

you running after the investors. &gt;&gt; Thank you sir. Uh so I would uh say that uh AI is not just about the algorithms of the data that the students work upon. It's about uh the people purpose or the

problems that they choose to solve and they need to deploy more of their energy on that rather than working only on the AIEL uh ideas. So that's great sir and my uh next question goes to Kavita

ma'am. So um Kavita ma'am you have seen innovations going from labs to uh you know national scale uh particularly in healthcare and public health. So uh ma'am I would like to know that what

separates innovation uh that create real social or the economic impact and that remains technically strong but unadopted

and uh uh even with the involvement of the AI we are not able to adopt it. So what's that missing uh middle between the campus proof of concept and the market deployment?

Okay. Um, thank you for the question. I'll try to answer. Now, again, I'll some a disclaimer. I come from life sciences background. I don't come from the u, you know, hardcore AI

understanding. uh and most of my life has been working for patients uh which who really are the far like especially the last four years I worked on neglected disease and and I'm giving

this background because example I'm going to pick up is which whose principle can be applied across you know the way you work till your product is uh you know really addressing the need of

the audience or the people for whom you have made the product it would never be adopted never ever I can assure you this and I'll give you a couple of examples Okay. uh one I'll give you that there is

a disease which doctors you'll understand it's called you know postcalazar dermal lishmanasis you have post you get these white spots and uh it's not a problem it doesn't cause

itching it doesn't but it's just cosmetically bad and the drug which is being developed and so people will never come to you right people will not come to you because uh why should they get

treated and it happens in states of Bihar it happens in eastern UP happens in parts of uh west Bengal But till you you know get a drug which will get the color of the skin back you

you don't accept the patients to start taking it but you want the patient to take it because in their skin patch is a pathogen which spreads the disease. So as a public health when you're sitting

in the you know as a public health expert in your state you want people to take the drug because otherwise they'll spread the disease to more it gets spread by a sandfly but the people will

not take it because it's not getting the color back. So you're not you might be taking a public health route but because their cosmetic issue is not getting resolved it will never be adopted. I'll

give you another example. Remember DNA vaccine COVID vaccine was made you know government spent more than 100 200 crores. The company invested 200 crores but not a single patient or not a single

subject or not a single Indian ever got immunized with it because somewhere was the fear that you know this technology this DNA could get integrated into your genome and cause lifetime you know

long-term events. So addressing the need of the uh your audience or your user is a very critical understanding to do uh before you you know invest your life your time and your money on it. Very

very crisp ma'am that is the missing middle and we all need to understand need is the necessity that is actually the mother of all inventions. So need and necessity should come first. Thank

you ma'am. Um Utkar uh you have led uh innovation inside large enterprises and uh you know exactly what uh industry really needs. So um when the industry evaluates the

campus startups and uh or the studentled AI startups so what excites you? Okay. Uh so this is relevant for campuses. This is also relevant outside campuses when we meet different startups

or when we meet different problem solvers in any shape and size. Uh I would say largely there are three Ps uh instead of four Ps of marketing there are three Ps of uh this one is what

problem you are solving. So it's very critical for us to understand what's and as Nikl was talking about the size of the problem is one angle to it but what's the uh vastness other than that

what's the seriousness of problem whe what's the impact that this problem solution is going to create in the society and larger ecosystem so that's one P which is what problem you are

solving &gt;&gt; second P is what product you are building to solve that problem so it's very critical and that we have different roots to solve the same problem. For

example, uh if there is a if there is let's say predictive healthcare solution to be built or predictive I I'll talk from a mobility lens predictive maintenance solution to

be built whether you are doing it from a hardware lens or you are building a OTA software to solve that sort of problem. So that's the second uh very important aspect. What is the product that they

are building around it? And the third is people. What what's what's the team which is building this? Who are the founders? What what their thought processes? How they are taking this as a

challenge? Because entrepreneurship is not easy. I mean at the end of day uh we are world's uh second largest in terms of uh population. We we are still the third largest when it second largest

when it comes to u having startups across the world. There is a wide gap that is there. So entrepreneurship is not easy and when whenever we look at solution uh in my previous roles

whenever I have looked at solutions whether as part of SI or part of different engagements it's always from the lens of what impact it is going to create for whom and in the end who are

the people building this because rest everything falls in place. You don't have money, you will get money. You don't have uh resources, you will get resources, you'll get support. Uh

ecosystem will come together to help you scale it up. But the first resilience for first few months or years will come from these three factors whether you have belief in your product uh and the

problem you are solving and as a team uh how strong you are. So these three I think is what at least &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you. That's exciting. But you'll be ready with the next

question that would be uh what still creates the hesitation at market deployment at a larger scale. These are the things that excites you but I'll come later to you. Um Maya uh you uh

bring uh very uh valuable global perspectives with yourself and you observe a innovation ecosystem globally also particularly Israel's renowned university uh system where you you know

you have uh led that startup pipeline also in Israel. So um in strong global uh innovation ecosystems uh like Israel the universities they play an active role in applied uh

research and startup creation. So uh I would like to know that what are two or three practical lessons that you would suggest Indian campuses to adopt so that uh without blindly copying the models

they especially uh come with the AI innovation in tier 2 cities. So first got my question. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it was a very multifaceted one but no no but thank you for this. I I'll

firstly start by saying that um I think that many countries so they do look upon the education ecosystem in India the way that India was able to integrate AI and curriculum. So I think it's again Israel

of course again very strong nation known as a startup nation but I think that the air transformation that the educational ecosystem in India is something that many countries are currently looking to

and I think this summit is a proof to that. um not all countries are giving so many I would say asset and so much nuances into how AI should be modified in academia. I

think that India is bringing this into the global arena. What I would say is working properly for us um is the fact that again as a smaller country uh we are able to engage our ecosystem very

fast. We have fast uh reaction cycles. So when we're speaking about academia, we know how to engage properly our government stakeholders. The I would say the connection into the industry is

quite fast for uh university startups and I think perhaps that's something that you know I had a lot of discussions about it with different Indian colleagues over the years that for us

startups are sacred. If you meet an Israeli on the street, uh maybe like one in five of them, two probably either established a startup, uh either are planning to do one or are involved with

it. And for us, sometimes actually being involved in startups is considered to be even more high ranking than being in a big big company. And I think that's something that characterized us. Not

sure if it's right or wrong, but for Israel and the way that we've been able to establish our ecosystem, and it's true from education, educational cycles going onwards, um this startup DNA that

we have, it's something that has enabled us to break uh many challenges to overcome a lot of the different uh chains we've seen over history. And it it's part of education system, meaning

um we are cultivating startups from a younger age. It's part of our educational system. uh different courses academic uh parties are engaged. This is one and I also say that um another very

strong feature that we're having it's the very strong industry connect meaning we're able to create this strong linkages from the early stages of the university

uh going afterwards it's also connected in many ways to the fact that we get our professional training quite earlier in the military service. So it is quite helpful especially for the technological

domain but that I would say characterizes Israel as a country and I think that you know looking upon the work that has been happening in India. Um the level of academic investments in

curriculum I feel that in this time point countries are also learning from each other and also creating different models that can work for their own demographic uh features. Um but again

the startup nation the I would say the the very strong urgent push into startup creation from a younger age in university has been very helpful for us and this is something that we're also

working on currently when it comes to AI integration in academia uh using again different the ministry of education combined with work with Microsoft and a lot of the other big tech companies uh

so yeah that's been for our case &gt;&gt; thank you so much the key words that I could get is size does matters then uh the demographic features and DNA is uh the most important thing so I think that

is the catch-up line and we all need to have that DNA and how that you are going to tell us so uh Dr. technical um you know that faculty uh wants to support these

studentled startups but due to some constraints relating to their time or the recognition or whatsoever maybe their busyiness so they are not able to focus more on these creative ideas of

the students and they are more uh occupied with their academic uh requirements or so. So uh this is my question to you that how and what are two to three specific ways that my

faculty can provide that kind of guidance without uh uh lessening down the academic rigor and the curriculum requirement and helping the students to lead startups.

&gt;&gt; So uh so first of all I want to uh put your 30 second attention to this particular logo. I'm sure everybody has seen this logo multiple times the last few days.

AI impact Summit Bharat 2026 India. But I think what is written below is more important when you are thinking of building a student startup or as a faculty you are trying to help them out.

It says or I think that's the moto of AI that's the moto of technology. If you are building a solution which is welfare for all and

happiness to all that means your solution is bound to succeed. That is something your faculty members are also looking at. Faculty members particularly like in IIT Delhi what we

have done is we have created a faculty entrepreneurship policy. uh it's a it's by in fact it was a sin for faculty member to start a company or think of any commercial activity prior

as like if you look at the entire Indian history particularly education history uh professors it was like that you know everybody else can make money but the professor should

not make money but why this is so the professors can also make money we have seen examples of Stanford professor MIT professor Oxford and Cambridge professor they are multi-millionaires but they

still teach they still come back and teach you know that those two things are different so we created a policy in fact for the first time IIIT Kpur IIT Delhi few other IITs took the lead and we

created a faculty entrepreneurship policy now you'll be surprised 185 faculty members out of 750 are involved in startups directly or indirectly some of mentors some of them are

co-founders some of them are helping them out uh and 50 faculty members are now having their own startup when I put an ad like recently we had some money we had 2 three crores we uh

we ran a competition among the faculty members we called faculty investment fund we have gone out and said any faculty member of IIT Delhi wants to do a startup we will from my department

from my own kitty I'll put 50 lakh rupees as Yeah. Uh and we thought that not many ideas will come. We had money to put in food to four and five. 37 people applied and

then they start fighting with each other. That is a good news. The faculty members fighting people. Then we evaluated each and every idea. 37 ideas we evaluated. Professors

of different departments came and presented this idea and they were so passionate that my research is this and I want to create a company and I have I have a full like the model I have

explained whether it can be commercially viable, whether it can be it can generate money, whether you can get team. So they were more passionate than the students.

Now this is a great combination when the faculty members are enthusiastic of participation in the student startup. Students are equally enthusiastic in creating something new. The faculty

members come with a great knowledge, the lab support, the background and they have they they know the science of it. The students have the idea of uh scaling it up and they have a new energy. They

can go out and raise the money. They can talk to people. they can sell this product to the world. If these two forces combine, they will actually make it big. The

reason we are not we don't have a Stanford here in India because the academic institution have not decided to allow faculty members to do their startup. In fact, whoever is the

academic institution including yours ma'am, I will suggest that think of doing a faculty entrepreneurship policy. We are even going forward. We are starting a staff entrepreneurship

policy. We are saying why only faculty member should make money staff can also make money and not only is money is money that they make is the contribution that brings in because if you are

building a commercial product chances of that research going forward is much higher than the research which die in the lab. The idea is not just to produce a research paper but also build a

commercially viable product. That's a key difference between Israel in India, India and US or India or anywhere else. But I think the we have started we are like a bad white elephant once we we

start a little late on we start we we destroy everything in [laughter] that's great that's great sir so an open um question to all the eminent panelist coming continuing with the same thing

should campuses reward the real problem solving and the real world exper experimentation the same way as the reward about the grades and the publications.

&gt;&gt; Yes, absolutely. &gt;&gt; You can take an example of how do you &gt;&gt; Yeah. Uh some insights from Israel. I would like to have Maya. &gt;&gt; I tell you what. So for us for instance

and you would see that um we are much less rewarding of course the publications and the awards but the thing is yes we are integrating a lot of practicums

um and especially when it comes to entrepreneurship studies so of course um I think that that that's been a lot of the way that we are perceiving academia for us academia has to be practical has

to be connected to industry I can also give the caveat to it because I think that in many ways that's been you know we've seen some obligations actually about the fact that we have less

students in humanities and I think it should be addressed as someone who comes from humanities actually I think that sometimes we do need to this balance but I would say that our strongest

universities today are very much industrydriven the way that we're evaluating students are based on practicums internships connection into industry it's something that is being

built within the curriculum um like and but the thing is I do see this transition in India as well. So I mean I'm saying this it's true that again I I lived in India. There is a reason why I

like the ecosystem here. But I think that this is an evolution of academia as a whole. AI has a strong part in it. I feel that today because everyone has to be digitized so fast. We need AI is

becoming an advantage. um almost any jobs yes we are missing the nuance badly and especially in academia we I think we we feel perhaps the the threat of AI rather than the advantage but still um

data has become key uh we need this faster connect to industry academia is evolving fast um for us uh I would say that the way that we've been able to promote entrepreneurship and startup as

part of the curriculum is almost I guess in some cases um reward board and people perhaps much much less on on grades and publications. In the same time, what we are currently also working on is to see

how we are also letting the ones who are interested in theoretical side to also be part of academia. And that's something perhaps on on the different side of the scope. Um because the ones

who are interested in the academic side should also have a part in the table and not just the ones that again are going into startups and industry right away. So I think that academia needs to find

this balance uh despite the fact that again um today it's it's it looks again more promising to get the fastest jobs to go quickly into the industry. So I think that's something that we've been

working on. Um and especially with the AI integration I think that it it's it we need to think properly on what are the new parameters because it's it's easy to say let's push away the

publications. We are not assessing right students today. Examination needs to change. Uh the way we used to give assignments, written assignment and we have constant discussions about it in

the ministry of education. We are doing different hackathons of faculty members just to understand how assessment is supposed to look like. So I think it's it's a bit beyond the aspect of

publications. We need to see how we're assessing people over time. For us, a lot of our contexts are becoming much more um contact related. For instance, we're having simulation in classes, much

less time of lecturers just giving data one to another. So the I think that's the way to go forward to try and see how we're changing a bit assessment that's a discussion that we are having back in

the country. Um but I think you know I do see similar insights and alignment also from the Indian ecosystem when it comes to this. But I'll be glad to hear from my

&gt;&gt; I tell you one quick example I'll give you what we are doing at IT Delhi is is we have created a uh student credit system. So reward is one is of course you can give money. So there is uh one

possibility is that you can create a small corpus of let's say 50 lakh rupees 1 cr rupees whichever student is working whichever student team is working on something you can give them access to

the lab and let's say two rupees for the building of the product that's one but also we give we award reward them in terms of credit transfer uh uh for example the student wants to take a 6

months off or one year off to build the startup so can they come back to the class or the can and they continue their classes in a different fashion. So that's something where the institution

has to agree. Third thing which we have done as a policy is that we give up to 2 years post graduation. For example, the BTE students who have graduated this year, they don't want to sit for

placements. We allow them to go off the placement and do their startup for two years. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; But two years sometime the startup may

work, sometimes startup may not work. Sometime they even sell the company to someone and they want to come back to the campus and say hey we want to sit in the placement we allow them.

&gt;&gt; So the student does not lose the opportunity of sitting in the placement otherwise there's a pressure on the student pressure from the family. No we have to take a job because a lot of

people a lot of students are coming from a uh uh middle-ass backgrounds. So they need job they need financial security immediately before they do the startup. So those kind of rewards that can be

built in the academia. &gt;&gt; Thank you for the insightful perspectives that you bring and the depth that has been given to the subject. Sir and Maya, thank you. Uh one

very quick question just wanted one point. You know there's lot of responsibility on institutional systems because there's a statement I am very fond of. It says systems shape behavior.

So a facilitator system will in which you know allow both the faculty the students uh to very well &gt;&gt; grow very well. Thank you so much. Thank you ma'am. Uh very quick question to

Utkar. Um Utkash uh just let me know that uh what is that one thing which the early stage campus startups need to have very specific and whether that is mentorship or that is time to reiterate

or what and then um how do the organizations or the institutions prioritize those needs with limited resources. So

in my opinion the the best help that any early stage startup can get is early feedbacks on the product that they are building. &gt;&gt; Yeah.

&gt;&gt; And institutions in India I think while there are a lot of challenges we are blessed with one thing and that is uh the magnitude of people resources that we have. So for product feedbacks for to

understand a bit more about customers these customer clinics um are so rare. I rarely find these customer clinics being organized in educational institutes. For example, if someone is building an AI

model which is an application layer uh and they want why they want to test it now they can only test it on data but even to a certain point it's extremely important for them to go and meet their

customers and take their early feedbacks take a small pool of 10 15 uh people um do a dipstick with them and for doing this you literally need zero rupees you don't need any journey all you need is

to identify a right set of customers early adopters of those technologies uh bring them under one roof and I'm sure all the all of these campuses including yours has amazing facility to do that uh

bring them under one roof put uh them under and to do this the skill that is required is focused discussion or a proper focused um deep dive with those set of people and once you hear them

multiple times ask different questions do understand what your product is solving, why it is solving, all those five W's that we speak. Then they get to know

whether they are on the right track or not and eventually uh this has to be done at MVP stage or at a proto stage before your product uh goes out in market because failure at market is

always a bigger risk than failing at a product stage. You don't have a room to fail at market. You still have a room to fail and probably I should not use the word fail. you don't have a room while

there is always a room to learn from market and market is as we say it's ruthless there is always a chance to learn in campus and uh the example I'll take is a lot of uh I was recently at

one of the IMs and they they were doing this dipstick study for uh the startups which were in agreech so they were sending their startups to all tier three cities of India uh for a 7-day stay

program uh for a very focused understanding of how stubble burning is impacting the climate uh change and those startups were solving for climate tech. Uh the results were phenomenal. A

couple of them have pivoted what they were building in terms of not the entire solution but their hypothesis. So that's what I feel and any early stage startups can get from campus is access to the

feedback mechanism entire end to end feedback mechanism on the product that they are building. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Um lot of questions uh are in the queue and uh discussion is going on

a very fascinating note but there are certain time constraints. So uh a very quick uh question to all the panelists. What is that one mindset or the capability whether technical or

non-technical you would like to suggest to all the students and the faculty as well as the stakeholders to develop in order to have the uh sustainable AI solutions to work in the most

sustainable manner. One capability or the mindset. &gt;&gt; Okay. last. &gt;&gt; Oh yes, I was the last last. So this this is this time I'm the first one. Uh

one capability I will say that there's no right time to start and you have to understand uh when it comes to I take an example of electricity in it got invented in 1879 for early 40 years the

adoption was uh less than 3% to roughly about 50%. Uh that is the theory of between times. Today we are in between times for AI and that's the uh hype cycle for any technology. So don't fear

that we have missed the bus. The bus is still here. All we need to do is just get on it and enjoy the ride. So one uh capability is just to start wherever you are in whichever shape and size you are

but start today. Don't wait for tomorrow. &gt;&gt; That's encouraging Maya. Um I would say critical thinking uh AI is good advancing fast but we're still

seeing a lot of issues with it. Uh it's not high quality enough. We're seeing biases. We're seeing hallucinations. We want again and we are still humans. We do have this capability to think

better to to have certain data and interpret it differently. That's what make us better than the machine and it should be forever the case. So always think on what can go wrong and how you

can think outside of the box. uh especially in AI times when everything is automated. &gt;&gt; So out of the box thinking is the key uh note by Maya sir.

&gt;&gt; So my advice think of solution not valuation. Those who think of valuation definitely close down their shop. I can give you examples after examples. Baiju

uh then Zelingo and then uh Blue Smart so many of company BO mechanic they were just building valuations without any solutions companies who build solid solution they go further they go further

much further open AAI is still building solution they are not worried about the valuation Nvidia despite of being a $5 trillion company still building solutions ions Microsoft I we closely

work with Microsoft despite being $4.5 trillion company they are talking about solutions even the small companies like from India server AI cover so many of them they're all thinking of solutions

focus on solution don't worry about valuation valuation will come later once you have a solid solution &gt;&gt; that's great sir ma'am okay my point would be again because I've burnt my

fingers with biotech like uh be very aware of the regulatory scenarios you know you can't build a product and say oh sorry I wasn't aware my regulatory and governance country's governance

doesn't allow this uh you know it's a lack of knowledge is not a bypass of mechanism and sometimes it is possible that the govern because you know the way tech and governance is uh you are

fighting with each other who comes first if there's a governance which you see as a strong impediment to your product development please you know have the uh

responsibility and the guts to go and talk about it at the right forum. You know we I remember there was this huge ask make five batches of your vaccine before you can do a human trial and I

kept because nobody will give you money to make five batches of a product you know it takes months to make one batch so kept went and fought and got it down to three batches those also just one GMP

batch so sometimes you'll have to even have the voice because you are a you know you are the product developer and you would also be an ecosystem uh facilitator so don't shy away from that

role as would be my message. Thank you so much ma'am answers and I think uh that these are the mantras that we all need to incorporate and success is bound to come. Uh with your due permission my

um fashion starter founders are here. There are three starter founders and I'm just giving them 30 seconds 30 seconds to elevate your pitch here and then uh our eminent panelist would be giving you

some insights on that. &gt;&gt; 30 seconds please mind. Namaste Singh founder University AI.

solutions butind family. Thank you everyone. Thank you. Well done. Next one please.

Please. &gt;&gt; Uh, good evening. My name is Reik, founder of Mommy Care. Mommy digital platform service.

Thank you. Very good. [applause] The next one. Next one. &gt;&gt; Yeah, please. You are left away with only 20 seconds. In emergency situations, timely help can mean the

difference between life and death. Good evening everyone. My name is Kanagan. I'm a dental student and I'm developing a platform which will help the senior citizens to give rapid assistance and

help. We are also integrating AI and we have also got the grant from MITI which is ministry of electronics and innovative informative technology and I hope that my platform will help the

elderly people. Thank you. So these are few of the startups that we wanted to showcase here and uh the floor is ready for our audience for any queries if you have just quick three to

four if anyone would like to put up any query before our eminent panelist you have already got the platform to speak all those uh who are eager to now interact

&gt;&gt; there's a question at the back &gt;&gt; yeah please at the back &gt;&gt; very quick question &gt;&gt; actually my question There is a famous English

&gt;&gt; actually my question is there is a famous English and French saying that two east cannot be on the same page one is education and another is entrepreneurship so what can be done to

bring them on the same page &gt;&gt; I think &gt;&gt; okay uh see I don't have a perfect answer for this so and that's where we say we as country we are learning

entrepreneurship and education has to come together right now they are not and that's where a lot of platforms a lot of government uh push is there the only way these two can come together is by

applying what you have learned so for example in if you are in engineering maybe uh the the winter internship or what you call the six month internship that you do it's high time that we take

those uh as entrepreneurial real ventures instead of going u and doing some web development uh project take that as a as one of that maybe you want to add I'm just saying

okay there's another one &gt;&gt; Dr. Raj &gt;&gt; so thank you for the insightful ideas and I have a question to ma'am and Dr. Nikl so how to stimulate the professors

specifically related to the medical academia so that they start creating something and be the role models so I will add what Dr. Nicholas said the professors should not only be a part of

earning but they should be a role model as well. So when they are into startups they will become role models. But how to stimulate them? So that's my query so that the institutions can actually

stimulate all medical colleges to be uh in creative uh domain for AI in healthcare. &gt;&gt; So uh I wish we had an you know perfect answer for this. Uh I also come from you

know my my own spouse is a professor at all India institute and uh being the tertiary research I mean okay forget clinical being a tertiary research care uh institute of the country uh we still

face the same problem you know we still see it so uh and it is very uh you know sad that I is just 1 kilometer away and they have such a facilitatory policy uh which doesn't exist for doctors so that

constant fear in the mind of national medical council that if you make it available for doctors because the clinical care quality will decrease. So you know there have been standard asks

give research time, give them incentive, uh make it easier for them to participate. Uh one of course thing which we have still not started doing is teaching our MBBS students. You know we

have not yet targeted that population where your mind is becoming uh customized to what is my future looking like. I was never taught clinic I was never taught how to do a firstand man

when I was doing MBBS. Now I have to go to the industry to learn what is a first in human trial, what is translational research, what are my end points. So that training if we can introduce much

earlier uh both for nursing and for medical it could be a very thing with us and I hope you know the ICMR or the national medical council learns from the IITs how they have encouraged their uh

faculty but I'll give it to Nik. &gt;&gt; I think I agree with Dr. is saying that you know you need to have a solution-led uh teaching because the teaching is very

theoretical even now. So I think there is a change which is happening the new NQM framework which has been introduced that there's a practical training which practicality has to be introduced into

the whole curriculum. The curriculum is not about like only cramming and gaining the grades. It's also about the application of that curriculum or learning to the real world. If we are

able to do that then it is possible. Second your question is that how the professor should be motivated. So it's a onus on the uh on the institution to create that environment so that

professors are encouraged to do it. So there is also a sort of a revenue generation opportunity for uh institutions because professors are there for a longerterm institution than

the student student. Plus if you are building a company within from the institution the institution can have have a equity. The institution can become an investment

vehicle. The equity can also generate money. IIT nowadays are selling uh hundreds of crores of or I would say dozens of crores of equity uh which eventually go back to the research is it

does not use it. So some professor ask us I need a equipment of 1 cr. Somebody ask us we need some investment. And I just gave an example of 50 lakh rupees every investment in a company. So that

kind if you don't have that money, how do you invest in that money? So it's a cyclic process. Institutional responsibility is bigger than the professional professor responsibility

and so first institution then the professor then the student. &gt;&gt; Yes. Please &gt;&gt; uh I'm really thankful to be the part of

this event and my question is that my engineering students they are creating um some prototypes and the prototype is working fine but how they can bridge the gap to uh bring that prototype to a

commercially viable product for the market because they do not have those primary core areas of management that used to that they must learn. So how can they bridge that gap because prototype

is working fine but uh how they can move ahead because many times the product or the idea just end up uh in the curriculum years itself. So uh that is my question. So best is to involve your

alumni because you are now a older institution you have alumni which is working in the industry bring them as a mentors and these mentors can support this idea and not only they can support

the idea but also take them to their own companies or to somewhere else. So alumni connection to the institution is also quite important. Alumni also wants to because see again I was saying the

professors are there to stay student leave alumni then the alumni will also start contributing uh you know their knowledge the money the CSR grant lot of things

alumni can bring into the table. Thank you sir. Thank you. So uh I think questions would be unending and uh it's time now to uh offer the vote of thanks to my eminent panelist and dear

audience. Um first of all I would like to place on record my heartfelt gratitude and a huge thank you to Dr. Nikl, Dr. Kavita, Miss Maya, Mr. Ruth Kash for sharing your insightful

perspectives on various aspects and practical lessons uh from academia from industry research and global perspectives. So uh I think this session reflects TMU's commitment towards

bridging uh the gap between the uh campuses readiness as well as the real world impact and the experimentation that we need to bring in order to strengthen the uh AI innovation pipeline

that we all want to build up. So with this uh I think you all must be having now one idea or one uh you know connection as we had uh already made this plea that we all need to go with

this one action which our eminent panelists have suggested. So with this, thank you so much for uh being here giving us your kind consent and making our audience uh come with some kind of

constructive suggestions that they would definitely execute in order to make impactful AI innovation pipeline of India. Thank you so much. [applause] &gt;&gt; Thank you all to join us today. Your

exit will be on back side right hand you can go straight to the entrance area and uh there you have a sufficient space for discussion with this

&gt;&gt; yeah I have So they immediately show the kitchen before the start. Thank you so much. yourself.

Special thanks to my team members Prashant, Praep and all the faculty members, students. You had been a great audience and the managers. Come on. Come on.
