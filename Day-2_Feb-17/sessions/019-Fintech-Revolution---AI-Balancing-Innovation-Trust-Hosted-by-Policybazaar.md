## 📝 Summary

AI is rapidly reshaping fintech — from credit underwriting and fraud detection to customer experience, compliance, and personalized financial products. But as AI-led systems take on greater decision-making roles, the need for transparency, fairness, security, and regulatory trust becomes equally critical.

This session explores how fintech innovators and institutions are using AI to drive speed and scale while building safeguards around data, risk, and customer trust. The discussion will highlight practical approaches to responsible AI deployment, model governance, and trust-by-design frameworks that enable innovation without compromising credibility or compliance.
