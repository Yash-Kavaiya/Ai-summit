## 📝 Transcript

hospitals become more efficient. They are able to see more patients and private hospitals their cost of rendering health care also goes down. So that is an area where I think uh AI is

really going to play a massive role in the coming years. And uh already uh we have uh the uh medical device companies they are introducing more and more AI tools to make their uh devices more

efficient. So already Philips I was uh speaking to the CEO. So uh they have introduced AI in their imaging devices and uh with lesser number of uh uh scans less exposure to radiation if you're

thinking of a CT or an X-ray. So with lesser number of scan you actually are able to uh uh get the right diagnosis as to what is the issue like with that particular patient. So you are able to

uh use the machines more efficiently and uh if in a particular day you're using a certain uh scanning machine for say 20 25 patients you can maybe enhance it to 50. So that automatically reduces the

cost of uh rendering these diagnostic services. So this is an area where I think uh lot of work is already happening and in the coming uh uh few months and years uh software as a

medical device is really going to gain prominence already we are having number of startups in the country who are working in this area and uh I I think it the floodgates are just about to open.

So uh this is how I think uh we see the usage of AI to basically reduce the cost of healthcare in the country. So that that is the ultimate takeaway for the government in this area. Thank you very

much. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you. I think um this is a nice segue to ask Nikico a question about the use of AI in healthcare particularly in the

Netherlands. How what are the key system enablers that you have seen that has enabled this to happen in a successful manner? &gt;&gt; Thank you very much for the question.

First of all, let me thank Phillips for hosting this this event. As you can imagine at the Netherlands embassy, we have a very special relationship with Phillips and therefore we extremely

happy to have the global CEO of Philips Roy Jacobs here in in India. uh is for very various reasons just very shortly Barat if you allow me a very special week for us because as the Netherlands

upon the invitation of the Indian uh government we have been co-chairing the work group on uh AI for economic growth and social good over the past three months uh I think uh so this week is a

very special week that a lot comes together in this week I said co-chairing that means that there was an other co-chair that's correct the other co-chair is Indonesia. And I think this

really shows very clearly how we can create alliances like in this case between the Netherlands and Indonesia coming together in in this particular week. Now let me get to your to your

question. Uh uh obviously uh maybe just getting a little bit uh back uh when uh back in 2019 in the Netherlands we had a national program called Valuable AI in healthcare. There we stimulated as a

government ministry of health that I represent here a lot of pilots on AI in healthcare and also helping our medical institutions with uh ethical guidelines in AI. That probably explains why

exactly one year ago the WH decided to designate our digital ethics center at the technical university in Delft in the Netherlands as the first WH collaborating center on AI health

governance. This is obviously worldwide applicable. If time permits, I'm happy to say more about what this WHO governance is going to do and how it can help the entire community in the world

uh to deal with the questions that Dr. Paul rightly set out uh from from the start. Now with this experience on our on our national program valuable AI in healthcare, our minister of health uh

sent a document, a policy note, a new strategy uh to our parliament in October 2025. So that's still very very recent and that's called realization of AI in healthcare. Exactly what Dr. Paul was

also stressing the importance to get to realization. So with this new program we are shifting our focus from experimenting uh with AI to implementation and scaling up of AI in

healthcare. How are we doing that? By a two-track approach. First of all stimulating innovation uh with AI by addressing one labor shortages two medical needs. The second track is

guaranteeing public values and we do that through uh legislation and in particular EU legislation. Very briefly on the EU because that's very important for us of course as the Netherlands

being one of the founding members of the European Union is first of all the EU AI act. That's the worldwide the first legal framework for AI in uh or for AI uh systems. It's a risk based uh

approach uh uh which is which is clear subdividing in unacceptable risks, high risks, limited uh risks or minimal risks and that gives you clear guidelines for companies for knowledge institutes for

governmental organizations what kind of measures do you need to take. So it's not purely bureaucracy. It really helps you to get this level playing field and in order to make sure that we implement

AI in a responsible uh way. Now this goes in parallel with the EU apply AI strategy when 1 billion euros have been reserved to do exactly what Dr. Paul was mentioning speeding up the adoption uh

of AI and also integration of AI in the core processes uh of different uh sectors focusing on scaling up so removing the obstacles and also allowing very muchmemes

uh to apply AI in their processes specifically on health bar and I will end with that is that this allows to streamline market access of medical devices with AI without compromising on

patient safety. I will stop here and maybe if there are questions later I can go further in detail. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you Nikico. I think quite clearcut right that you

see actually works when you implement it with the right boundaries and the right guidelines. Um that leads me to a very interesting perspective that I hope to get from Dr. Panigra. AI depends on the

clinicians believing in AI as much as patients wanting to use it. In your diverse experience and you've seen many trends over the course of your career, how do you place AI in terms of

welcoming AI by clinicians? What are the concerns? How do you see that scale up in the clinician context? &gt;&gt; Yeah, first would like to say thank you to Phillips for organizing this and I'll

go back to the ficky hill which happened a couple of months back. I think Dr. Paul very rightly mentioned that healthcare has to adopt AI. There's no stepping back now. So I think so whether

it's the public sector, private sector, I think so everyone has to start looking at it. And from perspective now what we have started doing is that uh we have created a complete innovation cell

headed by a senior do doctor who is administrator to see that how do we sort of adopt uh AI to make the patients journey comfortable. So in other words I mean to say that when the patient enters

the hospital they know that they have come to the right place right hospital the right doctors so that that journey is important. So these things are now being built up by a chatbot by a lot of

digital uh formatting that's happening with the QR codes and all that. So I think so just coming back to Philillips I think so I was there in Singapore last week and one uh they have adopted a

hospital which is uh a smart hospital in the sense that lot of talking that happens when actually most important person in the hospital is the nursing nursing care takes about 70% of the

healthare needs but if you look at across the globe and more so in India if I can put it the nurses are called for a lot of mundane work which is they takes away time from their healthcare uh work

that they be doing the so this what they have done is that I saw it there that that the the healthcare the lot of things that are not nursing related you can access it and these have been bought

made there and these are the things that we're not implementing in our place also so that that helps the patient in the journey they we can spare out time bring in efficiency at the bedside level care

so that's there and uh the other part is that Even now with the insurance things increasing, AI is a good tool to sort of screen through the insurance uh adoption.

So essentially these are the ones that we have done and in the I don't want to take steal Dr. Hush Majan's thunder in radology also a lot of things that he has done we have started implementing

it. So it gives us access to preemptive in care in the sense that we pick up things much earlier than what what was there earlier for simple things like get getting all excess digitized you are

able to pick up uh early lung cancers much earlier than what we were doing earlier. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Um I think this is very encouraging to hear declaration's

perspective and adoption. Um honorable ministers here. Thank you ma'am for joining us today. We just have a couple more questions. We'll wrap up before we hear from the leaders. Uh just five more

minutes. Uh so maybe I'll turn it over to Dr. Mahajan. Um you are very connected to the ecosystem of startups that are working on healthcare and AI. Can you give us a perspective of you

know what do you see? How excited are you about the future of AI in healthcare? &gt;&gt; Thank you very much at the outset. Thank you Phillips for having me here and let

me give you practical examples of what India has done in the last 10 years for AI in healthcare. It may surprise many to know that the first paper ever written in the Lancet

on EI came from India in 2018 which means it was for critical findings on head CT scan in the of the brain which means work was going on in 15 16 17 to be able to you know have a product

which could be used to detect automatically brain hemorrhage midline shift in the brain. So it is great focus that the government is giving now but in some part that focus

both by the government and startups and academia in this country had started when deep learning started in 2016. Two, if we look at government programs, then the TB program in this country

since over two and a half years with handheld X-rays and AI in a laptop, millions of people have been scanned,

X-rays done. And with AI, what is done? you find out whether the X-ray is normal or abnormal. The abnormal ones are then taken up for the next level of uh examination. So that asymptomatic people

at a population level and remember we have 1.4 billion but this work is on district to district, village to village, town to town this is happening. Another initiative again breast cancer

is rampant all across the world also in this country. What has been developed by one of the labs down south is a bra which has thermal detectors within it which is able to pick up again at a

population level. We have to think population level and Dr. Paul very rightly mentioned that uh this takes 10 minutes. The lady wears the bra. The signal coming from it goes to a computer

which uses AI inside and this was about four five years ago. Of course it's still to be implemented at the practical level because like it was said validation

has to be done at a large scale and you don't want to miss cancers. But this is the initial level where those who have suspicion of breast cancer can be segregated from the thousands that are

scanned and then sent for mamography and whatever else may be needed. This is what is happening in this country. What I feel and I make this statement

very responsibly that if used ethically, if used properly, AI in healthcare can only be beneficial especially if used under supervision of health care professionals and not by lay

public at large where they feed their data into chat GPT or whatever and and try to figure out what's happening. So that's very important. Then as has already been said but you know already

uh our CT MRI ultrasound equipments have AI inside dose reduction of radiation on CT scans faster higher quality scans on MRI and ultrasound and actually automatic

recognition of lesions and uh going forward we have like Dr. Paul said we work in silos pathology, microbiology, radiology, nuclear medicine, genomics, proteomics, metabolomics.

It is only AI of the future which will be able to break these silos so that we are able to give pre-digested if I may use that word diagnosis to a person to a doctor sitting in his clinic to be able

to treat. So I think the future is bright and the youngsters of this country I'm sure will will do what Dr. Paul wants from them. Thank you very &gt;&gt; Thank you Dr. Mahajaj. Um and to wrap up

the panel question to Nidaj my good friend. So in a resource constraint environment like you've seen many times happen AI can be a force multiplier. How what is your perspective on that? How

can AI help in a resource constraint environment? &gt;&gt; Uh thanks a lot bro. Thank you. Thanks for having me, respected minister. Uh Dr. Paul, of course, I always listen to

you very carefully, sir. Every time I get inspired when I listen to you. You know, an ex- boss of mine once said that it's not about AI and digital, it's about health. And I think uh that

reminds me every day that let's focus on health and look at AI as a means to get there. And there's a lot of AI out there. In fact, uh the noise is getting a little too loud I feel uh especially

in under this roof at the moment. But I think uh really, you know, if you think about the public health system and if you think about health equity, we are seeing a lot of bright shiny

objects out there. There are a lot of innovators doing some great work, but are they actually getting to what Dr. Paul actually referred to, are they actually talking to the health system?

Are they actually thinking about equity? And I think that's the direction we need to go. So a few things that we've actually found to be uh very important and you know I want to send that message

out. Firstly building an AI system is not going to help unless you are embedding it in the public health workflows and that's when we're going to see real impact. So how are they

actually fitting in? Can they actually even be rolled out? Are they cost effective? Can they be used as as triage tools? um not necessarily you know a lot of people walk in saying this is a

diagnostic but actually maybe they're just uh could be used as laws to follow up TB especially and Dr. Margin talked about that NCDS uh people u you know fall off the map so that would really

help the public health system. We need to build on digital public infrastructure. I think that's another big one and Aayish man digital mission has really shown us the way that's to me

the gold standard globally. We need to build on that. We need to have they've got open APIs any of us can connect onto it. So unless we do that data is not going to come together. the system's not

going to come together and I can see Barat is nervous so I'm going to go quick Barat I give you give me another 2 minutes all right we need to design for low resource settings this is not AI is

not only a tool for rich people wearing those great nice watches I still wear an old analog but you know those digital watches which are telling you every minute what's happening let's design for

low resource settings where resources are scarce including government resources all Right? We've got to prioritize. So let's try and design so that they're cost effective both in

terms of usage as well as in terms of the equipment itself. U finally the frontline worker who's going to use this let's not burden them and we are burdening them. all the technology that

that's going out there when we go out into the field we find that people are just layering technology after technology and I I mean I think you know NGOs's like us do that more than anybody

else so I think we're uh we are actually to some extent to blame but decision support systems have been very useful for the frontline worker if you've got a decision support system which is guiding

them and finally we have to have governance at the center of it we need to have validation we need to make sure that humans are in the loop group. So I'm going to stop there and hand back to

you Barat. I think it's time to walk off the stage and then &gt;&gt; No, I think so. First of all, appreciate the enriching discussion. We're going to hear more from everyone. Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. Uh thanks to all our panelists. Uh please stay back on stage. We do have a group photograph. But before that, I would like to invite Mr. Roy Jacobs, Chief Executive Officer

Royal Phillips on stage. And join me to welcome Shrimati Anupria Patel, honorable minister of state for health and family welfare and ministry of chemicals and fertilizers, government of

India. And ma'am, thank you so much for making time. We understand you're traveling after this &gt;&gt; I can't afford uh if we could request all the panelists

and everyone uh to gather here for a group photograph please &gt;&gt; along with Roy and ma'am please before the panelists go back to their seats Time for all cameras to be up,

photographs to be taken. Thank you so much. I would like to request uh Roy to be on stage and Shrimati Anup Priya Patel to also be on stage please and with that

&gt;&gt; over to Roy u Dr. Paul we would request you as well to join us on stage Good morning everyone. Thank you for being here today. A special welcome to Madame Anu Priya

Patel, honorary minister of state for health and welfare and ministry of chemicals and fertilizers government of India. It's an honor to join this community of

healthcare leaders, innovators, clinical leaders, and partners. The fact that we are all here reflects something really important because healthc care is at an inflection point.

And so given the responsible responsibility we all have and let me be very clear on this. I believe artificial intelligence will have its

greatest impact in healthcare and the shift has already begun. Healthcare systems globally and also in India are under unprecedented pressure. This rising demand,

growing complexity stretch workforces and that pressure is and will have to accelerate the adoption of data and AIdriven innovation

and with that we are moving towards an integrated AI enabled healthcare. That's a healthcare system where intelligent systems support clinicians and nurses to make faster, better

decisions across the ecosystem. I see the momentum building and the opportunity will only expand as data scales and AI evolves.

But AI alone can and will not transform health care and must be embedded in systems where data workflow and clinical expertise work seamlessly together.

And those systems ultimately must serve the people at the center of healthcare because healthcare is all about people. Just consider for a minute the pressure care teams are under.

If you ask clinicians what they need most, the answer is almost always the same, it's time, time to think, time to explain, time to

connect with patients. Yet too much of the day is consumed by documentation, fragmented systems at administrative complexity. And this is where I in particular is

making a difference. The first wave of impact may not be that flashy, but will be truly transformative. AI that automates repetitive steps. AI

that supports documentation in the background. AI that prioritizes urgent cases. This is not replacing clinicians. It's about augmenting them.

At Philips, we design AI to work inside the clinical workflow, always under human oversight. It's embedded, intuitive, freeing up time.

Because when we give time back to care, we will improve care. It's that simple. Let me make this a bit more tangible. The gold standard in diagnostic imaging is going to be autonomous MR.

Imagine this. A patient arrives for her MRI and checks in smoothly. Her clinical information is already available to the system. AI helps position her accurately and

selects the optimal scan protocol. It's tailored to her autonomy. As the scan runs, image quality is continuously monitored and adjusted automatically.

The result, clear, precise images delivered efficiently and consistently. The radiologist receives AIdriven insights and quantitative biomarkers. This is autonomous MR and Philips is

working to make this a reality. It means more patients diagnosed earlier, earlier detection of chronic and complex conditions, more personalized

highquality exams delivered at scale. It expands capacity. It reduces variability. It scales expertise. And over time, it helps reduce the overall cost of care.

At Philips, we have been laying the groundwork for this future through advanced automation, integrated MR workflows, and AI engines that make scans faster while enhancing quality.

And we are leader in helium free MR. These systems not only are more sustainable, they also allow MRS to be installed in locations outside of hospitals where it was previously not

feasible to do MR scans. That means more access, closer to patients, more resilience, and more patients served. Now, imagine a hospital room where data from monitors, devices, and systems flow

into one unified platform. AI continuously analyzes patterns to reduce false alarms and detect subtle deterioration quickly. Instead of reacting to crisis,

clinicians are alerted with context and predictive insight. That is the shift from reactive to predictive care. This is where AI can receive patterns,

reason within defined guards, and support action in real time, always under human oversight. We are making it happen together with partners.

Our innovation platforms connect hardware, software, data, AI, and human expertise. This is how we move from isolated innovation to system level

transformation and that is what we need in healthcare. We are ready to scale this across our install base globally and working across the globe with all our partners.

What is crucial to enable this? It's all about trust. Healthcare runs on trust. AI therefore must be transparent. It must be validated continuously.

It must protect patient data rigorously. It must operate within evolving regulatory frameworks. Responsible AI is foundational. Human oversight remains central

and governments and innovation must move together protecting trust, building confidence. Why is this so crucial? Because if trust erodess, adoption stops

and it's all about adoption. But if trust strengthens, transformation accelerates and that's what healthcare needs. Now I'm very happy to be back in India.

India represents a remarkable opportunity in this transformation. the scale, the digital infrastructure, the ambition. Initiatives such as the Aushman Barat

digital health mission are laying the groundwork for interoperable data and continuity of care at population scale. Exactly the kind of foundation AI needs to deliver meaningful impact.

For Phillips, India has been for almost 100 years not only a market but a global innovation engine. We have a big part of our innovation population based out of India to

innovate for the world also especially in AI through our innovation campus in Bengaluri and the healthcare innovation center in Pune. teams are here contributing to our global R&amp;D, AI

engineering, connected care platforms and clinical workflow solutions. Solutions built in India and deployed across the world and that matters because solutions are designed for scale

and for complexity and they tend to be resilient everywhere. India has a massive need for healthcare and therefore you think about how to scale healthcare in a different way.

If we look ahead 10 years from now, success will not be defined by how many algorithms we have deployed. It will be defined by the outcomes they generate, early detection of disease,

fewer avoidable complications, shorter wait times, greater access to care, more time for clinicians. And healthcare will move from preeactive to predictive,

from fragmented to connected, from episodic to continuous. That's the promise. And so finally, let me return where I started. AI will have its greatest

impact in healthcare. The systems we build today will shape the future of health of billions tomorrow. And at Phillips, we are committed to building that future

responsibly, at scale, and together with all of you. Thank you. [applause] [applause] Thank you Roy for sharing

your thoughts. Now everybody please put your hands together and join me to welcome Shrimati Priya Patel, honorable minister of state for health and family welfare and ministry of chemicals and

fertilizers government of India for a keynote address on health sector policy priorities for AI adoption. Welcome an &gt;&gt; thank you very much. Uh, I think I owe my apologies to Dr. Paul. He should be

speaking before me, but I'm running short of time, so allow me. &gt;&gt; It's always a pleasure to listen to him. I have missed out on the opportunity. Well, um,

Mr. Roy Jacobs, the chief executive officer of the Royal Phillips, Dr. VK Paul member Niti Aayog uh I have my joint secretary here Aman Sharmaji from the department of pharmaceuticals

and Mr. Niko who's the counselor of health welfare and sports embassy of the kingdom of Netherlands and few of our panelist I missed out on listening to the views also Mr. Bhat Shesh GI who's

the MD Phillips India Dr. Harsh Mahajan Gj Dr. Bishnu Panigrahi, Shri Nira Jen and all our um industry captains who are here today. All our distinguished members of the medical fraternity

um academia and friends a very good morning. To begin with, I would like to thank Phillips for having me here. And I would also like to welcome all the distinguished participants who are here

today for the India AI impact summit 2026. one of the flagship events of our government and a five-day event over which we will see lots of global minds, Indian talent and several

technical experts from all walks of life who will be assembling here at Bhat Mandapam and sharing their perspectives on artificial intelligence. Friends, AI for India as our honorable

Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi Gi believes is not artificial intelligence. It is all inclusive. That's our definition of AI. So when we speak of AI in healthcare, we just don't think in

terms of the sophisticated algorithms and the promise of precision. For those of us who sit in the government, the real measure of the power of AI lies in the extent to which it is able to touch

lives and the extent to which it is able to address the health inequities. That's the governance model we follow in which AI becomes an enabler and a force multiplier and it is able to take us

closer to the goals of inclusivity and health equities. Today India is marching ahead with a big vision of building a developed nation by 2047.

And when we envision a developed India, health becomes an extremely important pillar. And India has unique challenges. Our vast and diverse population, rural and

urban divide and also the dual burden of non-communicable as well as communicable diseases. So when we look at these unique challenges, it becomes extremely important that we make use of technology

and we have had a comprehensive technological integration in our national healthcare framework which we don't see as only adoption of technology but a strategic response to the unique

challenges that we have and today we have integrated AI in the entire health continuum. So from disease surveillance to prevention to diagnosis to treatment, it's everywhere

and it shows the power of AI in bringing about a transformation. I I have a couple of examples of the AI tools that we have used. So

firstly in media disease surveillance system that's one of the AI tools we have been using this is a tool which has helped us to monitor digital news in as many as 13 languages and then make

disease alerts and this helps us to generate realtime data alerts for the disease outbreaks and showcases the strength of AI the power of AI in augmenting our efforts

towards disease control and enhances our surveillance capacity in India. We also have one health mission. Now under this mission, the Indian Council of Medical Research has

also launched an AI tool which surveils the genomes and predicts the zunctic outbreaks before the transmission actually takes place from the animals to the humans.

And I heard one of our u experts panelists talk about the use of the adoption of AI supported handheld x-rays in our TV screening program. So we have brought this technology

closer to the community by deploying these AI enabled handheld x-rays in our intensive TB elimination efforts. And there are other solutions. There is

cough against TB which has generated an 16% additional case load and this includes the asyto asymptomatic cases which were till now out of the systems reach. Similarly, we have the prediction

of adverse TB outcomes. This tool has also contributed to a 27% decline in the negative treatment results. And today in India considering the fact that we are a very huge population and it's

it's a low resource setting. So we have to look at solutions which are scalable and which are frugal and which address the systemic gaps instead of focusing on solutions which could be more suitable

for the resourcerich health settings. So there are many examples of how we have used different AI tools for bringing about transformation and strengthening our efforts towards inclusivity in

healthcare and AI cannot be taken forward unless we have a supportive ecosystem. In India we have made efforts to build that supportive ecosystem as well. So

our premier institutes like the all-india institute of medical sciences in New Delhi and also the as Rishiesh PGI Chandigar and two other reputed uh institutes. These have been designated

as centers of excellence for AI in healthcare and we follow a collaborative framework under which several ministries of government of India along with the

research bodies like ICMR and the private sector. They come together and develop solutions which are not just clinically relevant but also validated to address the unique healthcare

challenges of our country. Friends, today we also hear that there is a great amount of debate going on about the use of AI and what impact it is going to

have on our clinicians. there are a significant number of doctors and clinicians who are convinced with the strength of AI. But then there are also fears that AI

might be a threat to doctors and clinicians. AI could replace and I feel that these fears are largely misplaced because AI is here to augment. AI is here to assist. AI cannot replace

the clinicians. At the most what it can do is and that will be in a positive way. It will reduce the burden of the doctors. The routine high volume tasks will be

carried out by AI and the doctors or our specialists can focus on the complex cases or clinical decision making and the non-speists they can also benefit benefit from AI because they

will also be elevated in their roles and they will also operate at the top of their expertise. So there are several benefits that AI brings to our medical fraternity and the fears

that the AI could ever replace clinicians that are not really true. We must never forget that medicine is not just a science. Medicine is also an art.

So when a treatment proceeds, health care thrives not just on algorithms. Healthcare thrives on human touch, on empathy, on compassion, on communication

between a clinician and a patient. And this is the this human touch can never be provided by AI. It is only a clinician, it is only a doctor who can communicate with this patient and

provide that compassion and empathy that is needed by a patient. So what the doctors need to worry about today is AI literacy. Now our future ready clinicians

need to be AI literate. It's a necessary skill which is now needed for all our doctors worldwide and especially the global south. So I urge all the members of the medical fraternity who are

present here today to spread this message that AI cannot compete with clinicians. It can only compensate for their absence and our doctors and our clinicians need to

be AI literate. And I'm very happy to mention that the National Board of Examination and Medical Sciences in India, it has very recently launched an online training program on AI in

healthcare for our doctors all over the country. It's a 20our special course through which they will be introduced to the fundamentals and the benefits of AI. What uh another aspect which is more

important is when we talk about a greater use of AI in healthcare is the ethical use, the responsible use and for that we need very strong regulatory frameworks.

In India we have created those robust regulatory frameworks so that AI is used ethically and responsively. We have the Indian Council of Medical Research which has come up with

guidelines on the ethical use of AI and also because AI can never be held responsible for its decisions but humans must be. So our national regulator Sedesco is now working on developing the

guidelines for the use of AI and software as a medical device and also software in medical device. During this uh AI India impact summit, we will also be launching

our strategy for AI in healthcare for India. This sahi or the strategy for AI in healthcare for India will be like a national guidance framework for all our states for all our regulators for all

our private programs and actors public programs rather than a prescribed centralized mandate and it is proposed to be released during this AI India summit on the 19th of February.

I'm also very happy to say that India because of its continued commitment to responsible and ethical use of AI has also recently joined the health AI global regulatory network as a pioneer

country and it is collaborating with the UK and the Singapore and contributing to the sharing of safety protocols and this ensures that the vast experience that India holds in digital health

innovations can now we can now contribute to establishing safer global standards for all. So all I wish to say is that innovation excites but what's important is endurance. It's

important that we not just innovate but we also incorporate it in our national policies, national programs and also in the everyday work habits, work culture of our clinicians. So our medical

fraternity has to be AI literate. It has to be updated with the newest AI based tools which are coming and they should be used very responsibly as well as very ethically. that is what and safely that

is the most important thing. So with this I would like to thank you all once again for having me here and I only wish to urge all the participants who would be present for the discussions that will
