## 📝 Transcript

Good afternoon everyone. India is beyond assertive that artificial intelligence will transform the economy. Multiple industry estimates that in the year 2025 to 2030

AI will nearly contribute 450 to 500 billion to India's GDP. The real opportunity before us is this. How do we build and how do we ensure that every child, every educator and every school

including those in rural and border districts participates in this herculan transformation. India has over 250 million schoolgoing children. Nearly 65% of our population lives in rural areas.

If AI literacy is concentrated only in metropolitan and clusters, we do not unlock a demographic dividend. We constrain it. But if we integrate rural and border districts into the AI

ecosystem, we unlock a scale that no other nation possesses. AI literacy is no longer enrichment. It is foundational economic infrastructure as critical as

electricity and broadband. Ethical AI is not a compliance layer anymore. It is what ensures trust, safety, and long-term societal stability as AI adoption accelerates. In this session

today, we have our expert panel that will discuss teacher capacity is not a peripheral variable. CSR is not merely a short-term goal to be achieved. And with over 9 million teachers across India,

educators are the single largest institutional labor for equitable AI adoption. We already have the policy architecture for NEP 2020 which prioritizes experiential learning and

computational thinking. Digital India has expanded connectivity to lacks of villages across our country. Government programs such as PM Shri and Samagrashiksha provide implementation

pathways. The next step is integration. As we equip students in border villages with AI literacy, critical thinking, data reasoning, ethical understanding, we are not just preparing them for jobs,

we are preparing them for leadership in the digital economy. Please welcome the um panelist which are with me. Um today we have Chola Devanji who's the um CSR lead for Apac BMC

software. I have with me um Minak Shif who's the director for deep pedagogics and we have uh Mr. Arun Dharji director of Pyramal Foundation. Okay, Minakshi, my first question is to

you. uh when we speak about democratizing access to rural belts and um we're talking about AI teacher capacity building um how do you think you would

align the content of AI or disruptive technologies to reach these rural borders of our country students and educators both. Thank you pile. First of all, I think

pile you set up beautiful context by saying there is a wide variation in the in the abilities capabilities uh or resources that are available across the country. So one sizefits all doesn't

work. Uh at deep pedagogics we work with three primary principles. One people first. We need to know who these teachers are, which the geographical region is, what are the uh resources

that are available to them. How can we approach or serve them the best in the sense that if I give you a simple example, when we meet teachers, we don't talk about what is AI or what is AI

curriculum. We need to get to know them better. We need to get to know their needs better. Therefore, we bring in the problem statements. What problem are we solving for is the first thing that we

want to know get to know and by and large what we hear are simple problems. They are not the big words that we read in NP2020 or NCF. What we hear from them is I want to engage my students better.

I want them to understand a complex topic in a very simple manner. So those are small problems they are solving. So from here we take them to purposriven learning. So what is it that you're

trying to do by using AI? Please find your purpose. In a room full of 100 teachers, we cannot just offload to say hey here's co-pilot let's start using it. What we need to do is understand why

they need that. Where in their own classrooms there for their own students for their own teaching learning for their own capacity building do they need that. So it's a purpose that we identify

next. And of course, no classroom has ever been successful without pedagogy. So it's a pedagogyled approach where the strengthening is required. Teachers are masters of the content. We know they

know what to teach, right? They are the subject matter experts and we must respect that. We can never ever say that, you know, we need to tell teachers how to teach. No. Uh what to teach. We

need to help them with how. probably they want to bring learning closer to the student. How is it going to happen? So if we take these three principles I think these are the three overarching

principles which we then tailor uh tailor make to be able to reach out to every audience to say once you know that you have a need for AI now let's talk about what's AI how can you realize or

how can you bring to cognition that I'm already using AI so if I use it for a personal purpose how about using it for a professional purpose so that's the road map that we lay out in front of

them and probably every story unfolds in a different manner in every room that we have spoken to because no two learners are aligned. Yeah. Thank you. and uh beautifully put about

the Microsoft co-pilot you know um and you know slowly slowly we are realizing that the teachers should be told that AI competitor AI

assessment lesson planning it will not take the teachers out robots and AI will not replace the jobs but it will only enhance it. Um so coming to my next question when we talk about

pedagogical adaption of AI into the government um schools be it in rural areas or semi- urban areas what would you say could be the top or a few um areas of development that um the

government schools or the stakeholders should engage in. Thank you. Um I think the first thing that I want to lay out here is uh building on what you just said using

copilot for a lesson plan would be a very baseline usage. Any room you enter and you ask uh have you ever used a generative AI for any purpose the first response that you get is lesson plan or

questions design. That's the most popular usage. But it's not limited to just that. Having said that uh with copilot what we are looking at is not just creating a lesson plan but with nap

on top we have I think learning outcomebased lesson plan that's the need of the R teachers in every part of the country have heard about it but that for that to become a

reality copilot has this beautiful piece that has been trained on education and has already uh you know preloaded NCERTT learning outcomes. So when the teachers get to actually define a learning

outcome to their chapter whether it's a chapter on photosynthesis rolling out of Gujarat or Telangana or Orisa or you know Assam it'll have a different flavor because it'll have a teacher's flavor in

it. It'll have the regional flavor. It'll have a cultural flavor. That's what they like. It's not just a lesson plan which is so generic that you just have to go and apply to your classroom.

No teacher ever has picked up a lesson plan to teach just like that. They have adapted it and that adaptation I believe is something that we need to bring out. And as far as pedagogy what you spoke

about I think about the pedagogy the most important thing is that we need to bring down the complex words of competency based learning inquiry based learning engage them in those and then

say hey you know what what you just did was inquiry based learning. I'll give you a very simple example. In our uh sessions, we engage teachers in a very simple prompt and we say everybody types

the same prompt which is it was a dark stormy night. Now that is an experience itself that it's an inquiry that you're giving to a generative AI to say where will it take me a science and we just

say dot dot dot if you want to enter something that is your subject related go ahead. math teacher will add something else, language teacher will add something else. They they customize

that prompt and they realize no two people got the same response. They were similar but not same. Number two, they could relate or connect it immediately to their subject. Number three, we start

talking about AI's role as a thinker. It's your co-inker. It's your buddy. It's your co-pilot. Who is the pilot here? Me. So there's no autopilot mode here. It's got to be the co-pilot

helping you to think and you think with co-pilot, not for co-pilot, I would say. Uh or you know, you don't just offload yourself to co-pilot to say, "Hey, make me this and

I'll take me take it to the classroom." It doesn't happen that way. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Thank you for putting it out there. I think it's so important for the NEP 2020

um being aligned with all that information which is out there. Um you know just last week uh we were one of in one of the government schools in a rural areas and I asked the teacher key um AI

use and she said I said GPI and I was like that's amazing because you know how everyone started by saying

that Xerox nobody said it's a photocopy they started using the name so it's amazing that you know um the teachers are already using it and co-pilot having a NEP 2020 prompt helps teachers

immensely because like I said there is so much information out there and if people like us are confused imagine the teachers who already have access to so much information now now there's this

online um you know bomb thrown at them as well um so yes thank thank you for that um moving on to um you gi uh I understand pyramal foundation works in the most critical hardest of geographic

demographics areas right and um it's fantastic how uh palpitably it is done um my question to you is when I ask you about your challenges of implementing AI STEM education disruptive technologies

robotics into these demographs which is equally important to you know like we say if we we need to be the next AI superpower we have to reach to the grassroot level rebels. Um so what would

be the top challenges that you have faced and if you could also tell us what are you doing to solve them so it also becomes a knowledge sharing for the audience offline and online. Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Uh thank you for the hello thank you for the question and uh I would uh first like to give an introduction as you know what Pyramal Foundation is really doing. Uh basically we work with government

schools at the remotest of uh locations especially if you have heard about aspirational districts. So where uh things are very very different from uh district which is not an aspirational.

So where the human index is at the lowest level. So working there is uh it makes a lot of uh uh experiences that I can share is that uh there is a lot of more that we have to do for these uh

locations and there are many of them in this uh country and these are the districts that are actually pulling down the India's India's development uh because the maximum resources maximum uh

capital is being invested there to bring it up and therefore if we can bring these districts up uh to a level of a uh uh from an aspirational to an inspirational district uh India will

change you know the the entire complexion of India's growth will be reflecting a much better case uh so coming back to the question here uh with that background uh it's a big challenge

uh and it's also a uh big hope for us to with AI as a technology to speed up this development in these aspirational districts. So these districts have schools which are far off. There are

basic challenges you know the basic infrastructure the basic uh when I say basic infrastructure the school infrastructure not the digital infrastructure the classroom the toilet

the water the uh you know absolute safety of the children the schools are not walled you know so I'm not getting into that so uh then comes the digital uh infrastructure so that's that's

something where I think AI can play a very big role in uh creating an atmosphere of positivity with the teachers there. Now imagine a teacher sitting in a remote block of Samastipur

in Bihar who is not being accessed by the district uh uh education officer also. Now this is one fantastic opportunity where not only that the district uh uh education

officer can have a chat with this uh teacher on a daily basis on a regular basis and the chat GPT and every government is uh in having their own digital command center the uh uh and

that is creating a lot of comfort among the teachers and uh the challenges are there that uh the first challenge that I see about from the basic infrastructure is the uh human capital you know uh

human capital and the maintenance. So government is investing on digital classes believe me most of the classes when I visited sero computer. So what about the maintenance? So

government has to is doing a lot and I think where it comes to now is getting the message from down bottom up to the last person who takes the decision AI will play a very important role. So

these are the challenges that I see more of not looking at uh the challenges what AI to implement AI but to create the foundation for AI to be uh you know

working out in these uh border borderland districts and the schools. So there are we talk about special specialized teachers there are these are 90% of these border schools are single

teacher schools now we he the teacher is the headmaster the teacher is a classroom uh thing what do you do there so I'm giving you the extremes you know well there are uh the uh not so much of

a challenge in many schools but when you talk about border schools these are the these are the challenges these teachers If they are given slight nudge, you extend the hand, they extend the hand,

they will happily grab you. They're ready to they're hungry to be, you know, fed with knowledge, informations. And I think these if we can tap it in a right way. I

think uh we'll see so much good happening in these schools, so much responsibility among the teachers and the willingness to learn is tremendous. They have done wonders once you uh

appreciated their work once you started communicating with them uh and making AI as a friend and assist assistance uh tool assisting tool rather than creating that fear of you know uh replacing them

or uh monitoring them. So I think these are the challenges that we have to be more of a mental challenges that we have to work on. True and like you said Podaraji I agree

that we have a long way to go. Um we are talking about challenges in implementing AI and STEM education or infrastructure. However uh what also prevails as a pretext to that is not digital infra but

actual infra. So there is a long way to go. Um you know coming to my next question um while we were speaking about infra how do you think uh we can achieve you know a cognitive and problem solving

uh goal oriented approach while keeping the digital infra not so heavy while keeping it um as a learning light kind of uh model. So I think going straight to the answer

is you know creating offline courses uh is very important and we already have a lot of uh uh you know apps which are meant for education are meant for teachers training and uh teacher

building up teachers capacity uh like the diksha app you know so let's not reinvent the wheel again because let's create the foundation with the apps and the software that is already available

which are offline uh which can be operating uh which has the uh beauty of uh uh addressing the language barriers uh which is very very important in these border states schools uh the uh you know

converting the language from English Hindi not everybody speaks English Hindi there there's a local dialect there how do you overcome that dialect and make it more uh meaningful for the students

there and the teacher there and I think uh uh these apps such as uh Diksha uh uh Savian ALT these apps to be you know basically make it popular at first level and then slowly giving them the feel of

the AI the technology and then introduce the new systems which are heavy on technology maybe by then we may get ready with the infra more uh uh you know and uh I think uh uh teachers to use

them as a coach and mentor is more important you know so teachers and I have my experience of 11 years uh these teachers when they are uh uh supported with you know uh content supported as

how to implement AI uh uh or even uh just building classroom transactions practices classroom practices we have seen them picking up so fast and uh so well uh that it really brings out

massive uh change and growth in the students learning outcome. So I think that matter has been proved that giving them a little support a nudge and uh being next to them uh the teachers

really flourish uh in there and they actually find find the purpose of their existence you know that I'm a teacher and every child is important and every child needs to be uh learning so that is

the feeling that they start getting once you start uh working along with them uh supporting them addressing their issues or daily bas daily issues And AI is one that can you know maximize

their entire uh operation daily operation in whether it is uh preparing their lesson plans whether making uh attendance and uh uh midday meal data uh you know not a paper filling exercise

but auto automated exercise. So I think this extends the leverage of the teacher to spend more quality time in the classroom and that's what they want to do. That's what they love to do and

therefore what they love to do is where the technology brings in and I think that's the connect that we need to build in. So I think I'll just add to what you've

just said uh from our experiences in the classroom when you go and meet these teachers what you see is that so that in itself is so encouraging to hear and one of our you know teachers I

still can't forget him the excitement that he had because he had a whole lesson plan with so many ideas and pedies possible. So that's the excitement that

we are seeing amongst teachers. &gt;&gt; True. True. And um you know I also feel that when we talk about the rural demographics I often feel that there is less noise

there. There are fewer distraction and the fire to do more stems from the issues or um you know the obstacles that they face in day-to-day life that does not prevail in the urban areas when we

talk about like we I just said uh in my opening remarks that we should talk about AI as electricity but then that basic electricity is also refrained for only a few hours and they have only that

stipulated time to make things happen. I think that's where the fire stems from. We've seen um you know actually um I think our honorable prime minister when he met the 30 40 you know top edtech AI

innovator uh you know startups or companies 95% of them came from tier three to tier 2 cities where the need actually comes from. So yes, moving on to our next

panelist. She's not only one of the you know uh sort of uh sought after CSR leaders. Um but like we say that a public private partnership always works. Uh we know

that the government is doing a lot of work when it comes to digital or infrastructure in education. However, it's so imperative to have a corporate social responsibility angle to it as

well. So coming to Chola, I understand that you know CSR slowly slowly like if I talk about 20 25 years ago, it was very equipment heavy in terms of you know let's distribute this to you know

the government schools, let's distribute this to government hospitals and from that it's come to the capacity and capability infrastructure. So my question to Chola is that when we look

at long-term institutional capacity of um you know a company like yours BMC software into AI or disruptive technologies what do you think your plan is and and we would love to hear what is

it that you guys are doing because you guys are doing some herculan work we've been associated for you with half a decade and you yourself are um you know one of the champions and leaders of uh

passion when it comes to u corporate social responsibilities. So yeah, &gt;&gt; thank you so much pile and I would love to start by saying uh truly powerful conversations going on here. Truly

privileged to be part of this but uh yes that said that really requires fundamental shift. I agree that CSR must evolve from short-term intervention tools to uh long-term capability

building instruments. Writing a check for an event is easy. What is harder is building a sustained ecosystem but that is far more meaningful. I will give you a few examples.

One of the partnerships that I would like to highlight here is our partnership with Robotex India and Robotex International. And we did not just approach it as one-time sponsorship

of let's say international competition that is happening. We took initiatives like girls who build robots and through such initiatives we encourage small girls to enter smell the STEM field and

uh when we say enter STEM field it is not just about building uh learning to assemble robots. It is far more than that. It is building technical confidence at that formative age. Also

taking an example of the STEM robotics labs. The labs that we have built in rural schools or zera parish schools. These are the goal was to ensure hands-on infrastructure.

When we build labs, we build continuity and we build when we build continuity. We build future engineers, coders, innovators. So that is the shift that is needed from

let's say eventbased visibility to ecosystem based transformation. Another prime example is our partnership with Pimpri Chinwad Municipal Corporation and Dyang Bhavan Foundation

wherein we have built a state-of-the-art inclusive library which is accessible to public and which houses all the smart tools and it is for years to use for the common public. So I think that is what

we uh aim it at and the question that we should be asking is are we building capability or are we just running a program and specifically in context of uh rural

areas uh the uh rural AI skilling I understand that it requires mapping a very specific mapping in terms of regional economic needs. Thank you for that and um like I said

earlier that you know you are the champion when it comes to being passionate about the u you know CSR programs and uh um it's amazing to see the amount of impact that you guys uh as

BMC software has created which is you know in in thousands um and in varied areas from medical education to empowering women. Uh my next question to you talks about a road map. What

according to you is a 5-year-old 5-year road map for rural AI development from an industry standpoint and um cuz we obviously have we have deep paragogics here which is a GTP with Microsoft

that's one of the you know hats that they wear. We have uh Podar gi from Pyramal Foundation working in the you know deep demographs of the country like aspirational blocks and then we have um

you as a CSR lead for you know BMC software. So from an industry standpoint is where this question stems. When we talk about um entrepreneurship, we talk about um economic uh standpoint, we talk

about um employability. What is a industry standpoint for a rural AI map according to you? &gt;&gt; Uh I think this is a great question and uh for me three priorities stand out.

First uh access must be foundational whether it is hardware connectivity or let's say teacher training these are essential there these are not optional these are essential second uh we very

rightly pointed out about the urban bias how do we avoid the urban bias in policies and curriculums that we build over the years and uh the sustainability part of it is how long-term the

partnerships are so uh we often measure success by some of the criterias. Uh let me give an example. Let's say how many students attended a program. But ethical AI would actually require us to ask

deeper questions. How many girl students continued in the STEM pathway? Another question that we can ask is how many teachers felt confident in

delivering the tech curriculum that we have built for them. And uh I think the third and very important question is did the participation increase from rural and underserved communities. So these

are three major questions. Of course, AI will shape the future economy and it will shape the next century of uh let's say future mobility, economic mobility. But the question is not whether the

rural communities will be affected by AI. They will. The real question is whether they'll participate in shaping it. So that's where we come. And I understand that rural communities if

they are part of the AI value chain uh the AI will definitely be a force for a social good. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you Chola. And I think I fully agree with you that uh you know

when you benefit the rural demographs of a country it helps in shaping it into possessing um you know the most worldly powers that we were unaware of. Um so moving on to um a common question for

all of you stemming from an objective of policy alignment, governance, funding and pedagoguy. That's you know the objective of this question and and anyone can go in whichever order. Um so

if India must prioritize one structural shift for ethical AI deployment in underdeserved regions teacher capacity building infrastructure governance frameworks or ecosystem partnerships

which would you choose and why? Uh I think uh you know that's a great question. I'm going to give a very simple and short answer. For me it is uh teacher capacity building. Educators are

the multiplier effects and when you know future AI will shape the future of work that's what we keep saying but when we understand that when educators understand AI not only how to use it but

how to question it how to critique it and let's say how to guide it responsibly the students are going to become creators and not only consumers of it so yes for me it is teacher

capacity Thank you. &gt;&gt; I think uh you you just uh added I'll add to what you've just said that was on my mind. There is no other way to make

it happen. It has to be capacity building respecting that the teachers are already experts. Not considering that they need to be taught. No, please let's just throw that out of the window.

They are already experts. they just need to have an idea about what else is possible and as far as ethical u you know considerations that you're talking about I've always said this and believed

in this ethics are not just taught for AI or technology ethics are a way of life and I think in every sphere uh we have to be ethical whether you're walking on a road sitting and eating

with someone or you know uh in a classroom or outside without me as well ethics are a way of life. So definitely they need to be a part of your uh you know capacity building program but we

don't need to pause to teach. I believe they should be ingrained as an overarching uh value that we have. &gt;&gt; So I don't defer defer from the ladies who just uh spoke about uh capacity of

uh teachers. uh I just like to add that it's just not capacity of teachers but capacity of teacher in also to include uh community participation. It's a very important thing for the teachers to lead

as a leader build as a work as a uh you know uh the community leader to make sure that they uh have community participation also. So just example a a live example I would like share some

data here is uh there are uh you know the social uh uh department the ministry uh have four big scholarship for girls you know uh and just the state of Bihar that we are

working on this particular area of scholarship is that uh when we started the work the baseline was 20 year 2022 23 it was minus it was zero scholarship dispersed

23 24 only for 30% scholarship was uh dispersed last year we closed 100% disbbursement of scholarship [applause] 48,000 primary school girls in special

category has been received their scholarship now it's why and how It's because of the leadership of the teachers. With the help of technology,

we could cut down 27 steps that were initially being taken through one single app where the child is recognized through the app. Face reading and entire data is transmitted and multiple uh face

reading or data sending is not required. Only other card linking which is again linked to the bank. It is a simple step but it took so many long years but the process has been done through technology

and what uh and 100% disbbursement in the premetric uh curriculum. Now we are taking it to the postmetric. How do we take this same thing to the

post metric so that so what is happening is the dropage out of school dropouts of girl students is become zero nearly zero because of this economical uh support. Okay. The Bihar government

was so happy that it was X they made it 2X because they when they saw the data that it 100% girls are coming to school 80% girl have now matured to the post metric and they're

continuing education. So the entire poverty multiffill poverty line has been taken care of with one scholarship that now there is the child marriage has dropped significantly. It has not come

to zero to be honest but it has significantly dropped because of one thing and who has done this the teacher. So teacher capacity not only into a classroom practices as a community

leader and including the community as a you know partner in the community participation of community is the way forward and I feel uh in short the headmaster or the teacher has to play a

much bigger role than a classroom as a classroom instructor and rather the community mobilizer. Thank you. I think what we hear and read about these kind of statistics um is what

gives us inspiration and motivation to do more um because working in the areas that we work in which is for societal good stems more from you know passion than actual uh you know work work talk

um and I think the uh questions answer is quite unanimous it's teacher capacity building and then everything else from ecosystem governance infrastructure pedagogy falls into place when we have

that one goal achieved. Um moving to the next common question that I have for all of you is that when we talk about policy or design, what is that one or two um pitfall that India should refrain from

while scaling AI across uh rural border districts and um I would sort of uh ask this question mainly from a educ education standpoint. So yeah, I think uh one of the biggest pitfalls

is uh we focus on technology deployment, infrastructure availability and in our experience what we have found at least in the recent times what we have done uh we've found that every teacher already

has a mobile phone. So if you can get me an app on that the infrastructural u um I think challenges come down. So our focus shifts from technology deployment to technology adoption. I think that's

one change that I would definitely look forward to. Yeah, I think uh you know uh technology is and AI particularly is such that you know a high fee private school in Delhi

a classroom experience in a high fee private school in Delhi the same experience can be taken to a remote district of Bihar Oris ora or Assam. So that's the beauty of AI and that means

that it is uh you know the technology can do those magic and uh create that inclusive culture in India. So you know uh breaking the barrier of language, breaking the barrier of uh uh what do

you call basic infrastructure or digital infrastructure I think it it just can create uh wonders uh with AI and therefore uh it is adoptive only when they see that they are experiencing that

beauty in it by you know making sure that they can do much more than what they were doing before. So I think that is the sweetness or that is the uh sweet pie that the teachers get out of when

they see that and to highest order level of order. So therefore lot of things like gamification is one way of uh improving creating curriculum and uh self

assessment uh where where students can do their own uh uh you know learning and correcting themsel we had launched uh post uh covid we had launched the google bolo app uh which later became read

along uh you believe me how children at the at the foundation level uh grab that opportunity to learn from a simple smartphone and uh technology anyway or a smartphone was anyway a big catch for

them and we made their parents to hand over the uh smartphone for an hour to them and 80% of re of every student uh you know 80% of the downloads that we had for read along uh had reached the

optimum level uh the levels it was level based learning 80% have reached that optimum level. So technology and the if love for technology for the the Indian kids are

huge. How do we optimize it to the best use because it can again go the other way. It can go to the wrong way also. But I think that that's the guidance and that's the governance that we need to

build up. I think I agree there is nothing more that I want to add here but some beautiful examples that I would like to share here is how fostering inclusive

technology or inclusive AI is so important that and of course you know one of the basic thing that we should start with is uh the metrics that we introduce you know what kind of matrices

that we should look at we should look at the equity metric we should look at the employability part of it and of course economic mobility. But uh that said, you know, there are certain students uh I

would like to quote their names here who are from government students uh government schools from Pune who never went out of the district. Their families never went out of the district. They

have reached Estonia and won the podium position in Estonia. So that is the beautiful example of what uh my fellow panelist just said. &gt;&gt; Thank you. And like I said that you know

the more stories we hear the more heartening it gets in terms of inspiration and motivation to do more. Um I think my last question for my dear panelists here today is that um one

decisive action that your institution will commit to or pledge in the next 12 months to advance rural AI access and what would that be? I've taken

&gt;&gt; uh for me uh again uh enabling the educators uh that is very important and enabling educators through rural AI ecosystem that is what we should focus on again

that said uh you know they being the multiplier effect and you know how digital accessibility is important digital uh intervention is important at this stage but yes enabling educators

and strengthening through the CSR infrastructure let's say funding the CSR projects like AI opensource labs in rural schools uh certification programs for the

teachers sponsoring those certification programs for the teachers that will play a good role here &gt;&gt; so Um well it's uh it's a pledge or you know the promise that we talk about. I

think at the pedagogics we are committed to uh helping teachers build capacity. We've partnered with Pyramal Foundation and Microsoft and as a part of the Microsoft Elevate program. We're

bringing access to Microsoft licenses so that teachers can work with confidence in a safe and secure environment. An environment where u they can build what they want to build in the direction that

they want to take it. So basically democratizing uh you know AI for them and building with them rather than for them is what we would want. Definitely a people first. I'm going to repeat myself

but people first. Um I think purpose uhdriven and pedagogyled approach is what we commit to. Thank you. So my take is again uh definitely uh capacity building of teachers who are

the uh sort of the torchbearsers of the of uh you know the change that we they need to bring in bring out but uh the most important part that we definitely uh conduct is the participation of the

government. uh the government buying is very important because the teacher after all is uh quite concerned about you know uh if I am been already given a task and I

better do that finish my syllabus uh rather than uh going into AI unless it is approved at the uh state or the district level. So I think that is a very important uh

procedure that we try to bring in and rope in the government to understand the strategy that we want to uh involve. So government participation is very important. their buying is very

important so that it is sustainable because uh 3 years and four years of huge uh inputs that foundation level non-forprofits and uh uh deep pedagogy and uh everybody CSR support is

happening they're not going to stay there for long if it is not systemized it is not a conversion into a systemized uh democ you know democratically systemized uh then it'll be of no use.

The sustainability will be at question. So government buyins along with capacity building uh along with tracking along with assessment uh is very very important. So this is uh my take here.

&gt;&gt; Great. Thank you. And um you know while we uh conclude the session of uh advancing rural AI access and ethical AI in governance um this was in collaboration with uh Microsoft India

and robotics India as a uh prelude to the uh two large upcoming projects u one being the 300,000 teacher training program uh for government schools in uh three states for AI and the second one

in collaboration with uh deep paragogics and pyramal foundation to build excellence centers in the aspirational blocks again in um you know three states of the country and while we conclude the

session I would like to reiterate that we have 250 million children that go to school in our country we have 9 million teachers in this country and while we accelerate towards um a GDP which is

anywhere between 450 to 500 billion in the next few years which is 2020 uh 2030 and ahead. Um today's panel uh uh discussion had very progressive and enlightening

real um when we talk about the real work thoughts and when we speak about teachers pedagoguy and AI in education the first thing that we say is experiential learning which is nothing

but learning by doing and all my panelists here are the champions of learning by doing because they work on ground. They work continuously uh in advancing not just AI but many other

inaccessible tools to the ones that need them the most from the Lost Strata community. So, thank you everybody. It's been an honor. Thank you panelists. Thank you for um you know your presence

and the enlightening thoughts. Um I'm happy to take a few questions um from the um audience. Hello sir, my name is Rahul. Uh my observation.

Um school infrastructure. Teachers mindset observation

experience. Government schools, primary level and middle schools evidence or school teacher

build transaction inclusive education. uh successful raha document.

So a place like a municipal school in Mumbai J capacity of the school was 400 students only 120 school was students were enrolled

teachers not only school learning ability 120% grow which which is an assessment by a third party. Today the school is

above capacity and there is a waiting list of a municipal school waiting list of 100 students. Yeah. Evidence definitely school teachers if they are nudged if they are you give

them a finger they'll catch your hand. They are ready to learn. They have the capacity to uh create wonders once they are supported, appreciated and made sure

that they are uh you know given the opportunity to uh try their innovation in the classroom. I 100% believe in this and it is happening. I hope it answers you.

We are running out of time but uh we can take one last question. Thank you. &gt;&gt; I'll just like to add one commenter mobile please.

Yes. Yes ma'am. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Um congratulations on an excellent discussion and I apologize I came in late. So my question is to uh Mr. Podar. I actually been following development I

write uh for the last 35 years and u very very glad to you know and I I also love this comment that ethics is not an add-on. It's part of it. I think that's completely I agree. So my question to

you Mr. for that. I did not understand you kept referring to border schools. So a and it's because I think I came in late. I did not understand what your references to was. And secondly, um you

know, you mentioned that um you talked about a remote uh village school in Samipur and they will have the same content as say somebody in Delhi or Mumbai. I just wanted to understand how

the mechanics works like AI. So um are we saying that the content let's say through chat GPT which you mentioned it'll be homogeneous or will it be because you know there are also India is

very diverse. So for instance say a child in Kashmir say a reference to snow may not be as resonant to a child in uh Bengal or Tamil Nadu. So I was just wondering how the homogeneity thing

works in because there is also the local reality which will resonate better. So I wanted to understand how does this chat GBT rural remote school AI um expanding of your mind how does this all kick in

together? Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; So I think uh that's many questions in not one question. uh one is that what I mean by border school is that schools that are in bordering

area geographical bordering area. One is in schools that are in axelite areas. Schools that are in areas which are 6 months flooded schools there which are 6 months under ice and snow. These are the

schools I'm talking about which I'm saying bordering school. Uh coming back to your next question is how do you how can it make it homogeneous? Of course it has to be. That's what I said language

barrier. The technology can convert Hindi English into the desired language of the child that is uh sitting in that particular zone or area so that there is a language he can convert that entire

program that entire learning in their own language adaptive language. That's one. Number two is it has to be customized. It is not one size fit all. It cannot be now. It has to be

customized to the need of that particular age level, class level, subject level basis, you know. So AI can do that customization and if we do not keep that in mind that it is it has to

be uh inclusively designed so that it is catered to all everybody in the society in the geography in the uh vicinity or in the universe. So you know if you can have that in mind technology is poss

technology can make that happen. So that's what I mean by that uh mean by creating customized program uh uh through the technology. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you Parj. And I think

in uh light of time and due respect to the next uh upcoming panel that is coming we would love to conclude this but uh you can add all of us on LinkedIn um send us your questions put it on the

YouTube chat. Uh we'll be very happy to answer those. Thank you everyone. Have a good evening. &gt;&gt; Thank you all to joining the session. Your exit will be in behind right side.

&gt;&gt; There's a wall. &gt;&gt; Uh the uh persons from Marauti Suzuki please hold on some time. What if people uh we have a discussion point on

entrance area please uh join their robotics India would like to request from Robotics India Limited please uh keep your discussion on entrance area
