## 📝 Transcript

and we create AI solutions for the societal problems and not only we create it the charter of the lab is that we should be able to scale it up and make it population scale and roll it out as

digital public good that's that's the goal that we have and um um without any further ado uh let me just set the context um few years back um I was actually uh busy in creating a very

population scale program for government of Karnataka for the frontline workers called Angarani workers who take care of children their nutrition etc you know and it was a it cut across three

ministries it you know we we trained about 65,000 we integrated the data and the processes which were all over the place but at the end of it no there was one big learning that I had and that has

been and it was quite a few years back when these were not even buzzwords that was training 70,000 officials and frontline workers was that the success? Was integrating processes the success?

Was cutting across the ministries and making everything work? No. No. Adoption does not happen because of these reasons. They are all important for the solution. Adoption happens when you are

able to get I know the previous session must have talked about it. when you can talk about the trust, when you can talk about the empowerment, when you talk about the enablement of the last mile

worker who is going to be the end user and uh morning I was privileged to be part of another session where I was able to speak briefly. It was a compendian launch of uh AI in various things and

there was a speaker for from UN women who who made a very poant point in the morning that when you are making I and she was talking about the gender uh divide which is very much relevant to

our topic. She said that if you are creating an AI solution which is focused on gender uh bridging the gender divide then two things are important. One is that AI should be intentional. It should

not be just that because there is a technology you're dropping it there and you don't create AI solutions for the people you build them with them and I think those are that was a very pogant

because this I not in so many words but this is for something that I had learned in my past and I think it made all the more sense know that we should dictate and that is the length you talk about

scaling people think about training scaling is not training it goes for the whole it's a continuum from the trust the solution solution design right up to the when you give some solution into

their hand for their daily use and it is that lens which we will use for our discussions today. We have got a very rich panel here and the point of this panel is that each one of us including

myself are practitioners. We are not uh uh solution creators in the lab. We are not we we what we do goes out into the field. So I'll quickly introduce my panel and it is a very good mix of

people who actually create solutions who are managing the field deployments right up to the last mile. We have people like that and we have people somebody who policy maker and who looks at the larger

administration uh part of it and that's that's what we will do today. We will keep it very high energy discussion but first I want to set the stage by inviting

Miss Tanushi Dev Burma. She is the head and the of the tech center for Aadhaar at UIDAI. So she heads the technology div and and she has done a many roles. I will give a brief introduction to her. I

want her to uh uh ground the discussion with some of her perspective because she has played various roles in various departments including women and child and other things. She right now serves

as a deputy director general at UIDI and is the head of technology center and data center for Aadhaar in Bangaluru. She works at the intersection of national scale digital identity

infrastructure and applied technology delivery. Her work focuses on strengthening the robustness, security and reliability of Aadhaar systems and services. Um she has done on various

technology solutions related to Adhar I not go through that but she has also served in various capacities in the state government of Tripura and Karnataka notably in the departments

like information technology, finance, revenue and tribal welfare departments. Um so before I go ahead and introduce the other panel members I would like you uh if you can come to the podium and set

the ground and give a contextual setting and then we'll take it forward from there. Welcome. &gt;&gt; Thanks Ashish. Uh so it's a privilege to be here. Um

so I think Ashish missed mentioning that um I was also uh director uh uh child protection in Karnataka and uh director basic education primary education in Tripura. Uh these were my earlier

younger days and much more energy and aspirational thoughts that you can change a lot of things. Uh what has changed from then and now? And there is a story about as officers become older

they become more cynical and you know you get beaten down by politician, finance, government of India and all those things come together and sort of bog you down from the initial you know

enthus which you start. Um but the fun part is that coming from a technology background you always knew that no matter how many external externalities can bog you down you can

come out of it use with the use of technology and that's the hope with which I have always worked and I would like to take you back and some of you can google it that there is a district

called kawaii inura which was in 2013 or 11. Uh the worst in terms of uh immunization, right? Why does that happen? Because the population is too spread. The health worker cannot cover

as much population tribal area. Uh so uh there is resistance to you know medical care not the same way as a Delhi uh Delhi would uh you know accept it. So urban rural divide on top of it

religious uh and uh you know uh different ethics and which which prevent the acceptance of immunization per se. From there within a year we took um an initiative which was called mission 100

where we wanted to cover the entire population of under one year uh age of children under the six doses of immunization right and how does that happen over one year because there is a

engineer sitting behind and can explain to the doctors that these are the numbers you have to chase Okay. And and that was my first learning experience on how numbers can create a pull. At the

same time, it has to be um converged with training, enablement and understanding of the overall goal. So of course like Ashish mentioned we did lot of training lot of you know

ground level understanding lot of DM inspections going to remote areas and you know trying to open all the registers that they had to maintain and at the bottom of my heart I felt so bad

that you know register maintain and all of it I mean even for me after so many years of education and it was difficult to understand let alone the worker and the Asha worker right and

they have different registers to be maintained which they have to match and then collate and make sure that the records are right. So with that kind of a challenge uh we worked and you know

Excel sheet after Excel sheets being explained at each level right down to the readymiz everything we had to do and within a year we reached like from 60 something%

to 90 something% and two years we reached 100% and after I left also almost after seven or eight years it's still maintained as the highest immunized district in all of Tupra right

so why and how these happen is because you set systems you have those MCTs so we explained we were the first district to adopt MCTS but from coming from that experience

today when I'm in UI the same things come across Right. We have 140 CR people with Aadhars. They are using u their biometrics 8 crores times a day. Right? We do 8 crore authentications per day.

We have to ensure that even the remotest area if they want to use their Aadhaar they can do it with as much simplicity as possible and for that we adopt AI and technology within UIDI ensuring that the

match rate of your finger when you present it on a biometric device is higher each day. You know we keep making our models better. The dduplication rate at which you trying to get your second

Aadhaar is better every day. False positives do not come. I can you uniquely identify you. And if somebody is trying to break the system, we can through fraud analytics understand it.

So these two things converge and what I wanted to get to was that it's very critical that you enable technology not for the sake of technology but to enable the people and give the benefit to the

people and that is the theme of today's summit also. It is an inclusive approach. It has to ensure that the intent of technology is met and for that if you have to do ways and means around

it to ensure that the technology reaches people we have to figure that out and that is where humans come in the human intelligent empathy understanding will come in and I got to speak to Kushi baby

as well as um Arman's work that is being done and they'll speak more about it but I I think today's people I mean today's administrators their job is so much simpler because of technology being

there and we have to make sure as responsible um you know uh government officials and uh civil society officials we have to take that technology to the people and make sure that the benefits

are reaped by the very last mile beneficiary. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you Tanushi. Uh let me right away without wasting time u invite and introduce the other two panelists. Uh on

my right side Amita Mahal, director of product and innovation at Arman and on my left is Hamemed Abdullah implementation lead at Kushi Baby. Okay. And both of them have been deeply

involved in the topic that we are going to discuss today. So why don't you why don't I start with Amitita and then with Hamemed. Um first introduce yourself and your organization. uh your solution

we'll talk enough about it later so but uh if you can set the context it'll be great. &gt;&gt; Yeah my name is Amriita Mahal I lead product and innovation at Arman. Arman

is a nonprofit focused on maternal and child health uh with uh with an emphasis on preventive care and we run two kinds of programs. Uh we run large scale tech plus touch programs. One category of

programs is focused on empowering pregnant women and mothers of infants with critical preventive care information to improve health seeeking behavior. And the second category of

programs is focused on health workers and health systems where we train and support health workers to provide better quality of care with the overall objective of reducing maternal and child

mortality and morbidity. And uh the product team at Arman follows a human- centered datadriven evidence-based approach to innovation and I look forward to talking more about some of

our AI work uh today. &gt;&gt; Hi. Hi everyone. My name is Hamid and I am from Kushi Baby. I'm working as an implementation lead and Kushibbi is also a nonprofit organization and uh uh the

work Koshi is doing is that we create solution for the community health worker and also for the health officials. So we have created a platform that we called it community health integrated platform.

It is an integrated platform which Asha ENM or other community health worker can use and it is integrated with the dashboard. So the health official can also see the uh uh activities which is

happening on the last mile by the community health worker and they can also take action on these activities whatever community health worker is doing and we have also created solution

like we have created sadney. Sambadi is a LLM model which uh is on the dashboard and if any health official want to use they can just put normal queries on the dashboard and get the insight of the

data. So yeah we have created these type of dash. Yeah, thanks Amita. Thanks Ahmed. I think now let's uh deep dive a little bit more into the question and start at

the at the at the first point I want to align with the topic that we have. We are talking about AI here. So let us first explore like where does even AI show up at the front line. Okay. So I

think I will start with um maybe you Amita and uh how are your uh solutions using AI today in the front line in the citizen phasing journey? You you touched on you touched upon a very interesting

concept called tech plus touch how that actually blends into with your solution. Can you just uh explain that? &gt;&gt; I'll talk about one of our AI solutions, the one that's uh in some ways the most

mature. Uh but first let me set some context about why we picked this particular uh solution to work on. A woman dies in childirth every 20 minutes in India and for every woman who dies 20

more suffer lifelong complications and only 20 to 30% of pregnancies fall into what could be considered the high-risisk category but they account for 70 to 80% of deaths. There are many reasons why

these deaths happen even though they are preventable. Many of them are preventable. But a key factor is that India's frontline health workers who are the first point of uh point of care for

pregnant women. Uh India's community health workers are overworked. They are undertrained and they lack access to support at the point of care. One of our uh uh larger programs called IHRPTM is

focused on training health workers to manage high-risisk pregnancy better. We've developed detailed protocols for what needs to be done at every level of the health system, community, primary,

secondary, tertiary. And uh uh these protocols are first imparted through classroom training. But what we quickly learned is that classroom training has limitations. It's uh infrequent. It's

one sizefits-all. And whatever health workers learn that knowledge degrades over time. Which is why we decided to invest in digital learning and support. And the solution I want to focus on in

today's conversation is a knowledge assistant an LLM powered knowledge assistant for uh health workers for ANMs in particular where they can use a WhatsApp based helpline to ask any

questions about high-risisk pregnancy or antiatal care in their own language either as a voice note or as text and they get instant uh uh you know protocol aligned answers in a in a format that's

user friendly and easily digestible. So it's multilingual, multimodal. It's currently deployed in three states and uh it's being used by about 6,000 A&amp;M. So that's uh close to I think 700

800,000 uh pregnant women. And there is a human in the loop for safety. So the AI doesn't work alone. There is a human in the loop. So for complex queries that the chatbot does not understand or where

the&amp;m is not satisfied with the response she's getting there's a medical trainer who steps in. So yeah it's a multilingual multimodal uh chatbot with a human in the loop that we've developed

over the last two years. Uh we did extensive user research. We did multiple rounds of expert evaluation before we deployed the solution. Even when we deployed it, we first started with a

small cohort of 20 users which went to 50, then 100, then 700. And uh the solution is live in five districts in UP. That's about 2,000M. And uh we've expanded to about 4,000ms

in Telangana, but the statewide scale up is ongoing. So by the end of March, we would I think we would cover almost 12,000ms. And there's it's live in Maharashtra as

well. That's the third state in a pilot setting. &gt;&gt; Uh Hammed, moving over to you. Uh AI, you also work on the LLM based chat bots &gt;&gt; but is how is it different from say what

Arman is doing? &gt;&gt; Before coming to this LLM chatbot, I just want to start from the ground reality. So if you see where Asha worker is is standing today with the community

in the village with the high-risisk pregnant men with a newborn child with the same children and they have to do almost 54 type of activities as Tanushi mentioned that they have to maintain

almost more than 10 register more now in the current situation more than five application and they have to maintain almost more than 20 programs and it is very hard to remember all the guidelines

all the rules and logic for every program. So the idea to creating that chatbot for the community health worker or specifically for the accreditiated social health activist came up that it

is very hard for a normal person to remember all all these things. what we can do for the Asha worker so that they can uh have the access of all these guideline easily. So we created this ALM

powered AI chatbot that works on WhatsApp because they are currently using lots of application and it is very hard to ask them to use another application. So first thing we did that

we created this on WhatsApp and the another thing is that we created the knowledge base of that uh chatbot on the basis of all the guidelines which they already aware and they already use under

all these programs and yeah it's also work in both the uh local language they can have the access whenever they want to use it and currently we have deployed it in Raj in five district of Rajasthan

and two district of Maharashtra And yeah I will talk more about how we have designed these chatboard for the community helper. &gt;&gt; Hamita I just take up on your thing you

were quoting uh and with your own experience that they have to maintain so many registers. The one of the basic design principles which I can also tell with my experience is that how to roll

out a solution that brings inclusion without increasing the burden because that is the killer. If you no matter how good and fancy your solution is, if it increases the burden of last mile

worker, he or she is not going to accept it. So how did you actually work around it? I was not very clear while I do understand that does your LLM chatbot still they have to fill the registers,

right? How do you actually facilitate that? So yeah if we see Asha worker so as I mentioned that currently they are using some register and at the same time they are also filling same information

in the application and if you see Asha worker is more actively using WhatsApp for their official work also and also for their some personal work. So what we did while creating this bot for the Asha

worker the first thing is that uh it will be in the in their local language. So if Asha from Rajasthan want to interact with the chatbot they can use it in Hindi and also if Maharashtra they

can use it Marati and the the another thing while we were designing it that because it is very hard for some of the Asha to write their queries and to ask the question. So instead of if they are

find it difficult to write the queries they can just ask their question in voice message and if it is hard for Asha worker to read the answer then they can also listen to it. So these are the

things which was in our mind when we were creating this board. Okay, thanks. Uh, Tashi, I will just jump to you extending the same thing because uh, now you have to put your Aadhaar hat on. Um,

that when Aadhaar came then there was a big risk that uh, it might become the gatekeeper for the you know last mile because for everything you that is a KYC. How do you see Aadhaar playing a

role at the last mile and how do you take into your design considerations that it should not become an excessive burden or extra process rather than facilitation. How

&gt;&gt; I I think more than technology though technology also plays a very important role um the ecosystem play that was brought in right that was very critical. So if we

wanted to become the authenticator for every scheme, Aadhaar would have never taken off. It was designed so that we become the repository of your identity details and it is you who will go to the

person who wants to verify you and be able to verify seamlessly and for that that entire technology play making sure that the AUA the authentication agency gets registered with us. It is a minimal

API exchange between them and us. Highly secure making sure that the lines that carry your biometrics are secured and the cryptography which makes sure that it it is securely getting transferred

and made sure not just data at rest but data in motion is being met. So the technology though very complicated even talking about 10 years 15 years back when it was envisaged

the principles were very basic to make sure that it is simple. You just have to put your Aadhaar number and put your thumb impression. You just have to put your Aadhaar number or show your iris.

Right? And that was it. Rest of it technology was taking care of it. It was not made complicated on purpose. Otherwise scaling would never be possible. Today we have 300 plus

entities who are our registered AUAs. And in addition what we have recently implemented is that even if you are not a registered AUA through verifiable credentials the digital signature

making of the credential you will be able to offline authenticate yourself with any entity which is not an agency with us as well. So democratizing the way Aadhaar is getting exchanged

verified was very critical. So earlier we did it through these means and now because technology enables it we are going to scale even more. So what I would like to say is that make it simple

understand what and how it will be used minimize data requirement minimize and the design should be so simple that even the first time user gets it as easily as possible. So these design principles go

a long way. &gt;&gt; Thanks makes sense. And what about you Amriita? You talked about ANMs your your solution is and in a high-risisk pregnancy case how and there's are

already loaded you know the last mile you know people how did you what did you factor in your design and we talking in the context of AI and the last mile women empowerment what what was that you

factored in your mindset that the burden does not come to them &gt;&gt; yeah that's a very good question as I mentioned that our overall approach to innovation and product design is human

centered. So before we'd written a single line of code, uh we spent time with&amp;M on the ground in Telangana and UP to understand how they currently access information. What are the uh sources of

information they turn to when they have a question at the point of care. uh we also learned uh again I mean of course this is something everybody is aware of of the extent of digital fatigue

among&amp;ms and uh&amp;m in both states that uh uh that we did our user research in use between six and 13 different apps portals etc right some of it is seasonal so we were

very clear as Hammed also pointed out we did not want to add the burden of one more app right another learning that we got very quickly was that a lot of um especially older&amp;Ms are not comfortable

typing long messages. Uh so like I said before we did a single before we wrote a single line of code we conducted Wizard of Oz experiments where we simulated a chatbot. There was actually a human at

the other end who was responding using a script but the&amp;M thought they were interacting with a uh automated system and they would break up the message into multiple messages or they would not add

enough detail but as soon as we told them that they could use voice notes the questions automatically became richer. There was more context. So it was easier to provide a useful answer when the

question itself was more meaningful was more detailed. Uh, another thing we learned and this was very interesting was around the tonality of the answers. It's very obvious but&amp;M's did not want a

chatbot that's very chatty, right? They wanted crisp answers, actionable answers, bullet point format. Another surprising thing was they didn't want the answer to be purely in the local

language. They wanted it to be multilingual. So they wanted the body of the answer in the local language but medical terms such as anemia uh hypertension uh as well as numbers in

English right so this was these were some of the learnings that we uh that we built into our design process &gt;&gt; thanks I think um let's move to another crucial

and it's an overused words but let's talk about trust okay especially in the context of last mile health workers and women especially And it in my opinion it it is not just

about trust alone. It is dignity and the empowerment that it brings to the last mile barker. Uh Hamemed I'll start with you. Uh in terms of you see know making it convenient is one thing but getting a

uh a role Asha workers are so oppressed with the kind of work. No it's not just about registers but you know so many other uh work is already loaded onto them. How do you get the trust of them

to convince them that they it is in their own interest that they should start using your solution? &gt;&gt; Yeah. So if you see the nature of uh Asha workers work so they most of the

time interactive with the beneficiary on the field and if they find any beneficiary in the high-risk condition they have only one solution that they have to refer the beneficiary to the

primary health center. But now because they have these guidelines in their hand. So what is happening in the field like for example if a pregnant woman is severely anemic they will refer the

beneficiary to the primary health center. But before that with these guideline they can also see the uh guidelines and can also suggest that these are the things which you need to

do which these are the food which you need to take. And one more thing so if they need any information they have they are heavily dependent on their uh auxiliary nurse midwife their supervisor

and it is not necessarily whenever Asha worker is in the field interacting with the beneficiary and want to talk to the ENM or their supervisor they are available on the call. So every time

whenever they have they do not have any answer of the beneficiary required they have to reach out to them. But now uh they can see all these information. So the confidence of Asha worker is also

building that if beneficiary will ask us hard question we have the solution and we can see the answer and we can provide the information to the benefici. This is how we are building trust uh with these

information with these digital tool right. Okay. Uh Tashi on see when we talk about trust and what Hamemed was just explaining key how it takes time to for them to realize that actually it is

benefit. I mean I also recall the early days of Aadhaar okay there was so much mistrust from privacy to your you know data being misused and you know people were also very cautious about know what

will happen if they give their Aadhaar to some place but how have you over realized that what was important to gain the trust of the end users whether it was or ordinary citizen or the um last

mile worker who works with them how how was it that achieved &gt;&gt; so it was a very long drawn process from day one um I'm told the initial inception or the brainchildren the the

the the initial founders of Aadhaar when they were talking about how much data should be collected somebody wanted to collect cast somebody wanted to collect uh you

know religion and other details because life simple but they insisted that we will only collect this minimal data. Right? What do you collect today? You collect the

biometrics so that we can uniquely identify you. You try and get a second Aadhaar. No matter what name you will put, we will be able to identify that you have another Aadhaar with this face,

this biometric and this iris. Right? And similarly, we will not use even for a different name. um I will allow you to get I will not allow you to get another Aadhaar no matter what you change in

your demographics because we can uniquely identify you because of the biometrics. So biometrics was the trump card. Um in addition only name, date of birth, address so that we can make sure

that your Aadhaar reaches where you stay. Right? That's the only information that is collected to start with that it was critical. If you look at the Aadhaar Act back in 2016

when it was uh made etc. It was ensured that the u uh the way government can use that data it is only limited and for minimal use. Aadhaar was agnostic of the use. I will not know where as UIDI we

don't know where you have used your Aadhaar. We are not required to know that information. It is only between you and your verifying entity. for example your ration shop dealer and your ration

shop ministry the food and civil supplies who will know that yes somebody has taken ration UI does not need to know. So the basic principles of data collection and data uh maintenance and

the technology of being agnostic about the usage were critical to ensure there is trust in UID. Otherwise the surveillance uh mindset of um uh you know the uh the the skeptics would take

over and they would think that right. So that was one critical thing but in addition the ways in which we let you use your Aadhaar. You can lock your biometrics. You can lock your Aadhaar.

How many of you know that you can actually go to the Aadhaar app and lock your biometrics so that nobody else can game it? So I don't see many people but yes

please download your Aadhaar app and we've given the power to the user to ensure that when you lock your biometrics nobody can use it. When you lock your Aadhaar none of the features

of Aadhaar can work. It's like you having a password to your bank account and therefore nobody else can use it. So all these features that we have enabled to give the power of the usage of

Aadhaar to the resident ensured that you know the the person can trust that the government is keeping the data in a repository which is trustworthy and is going to keep it safe.

&gt;&gt; Thanks. I think one big message I take it and um I think everybody would agree that this feeling of surveillance is one big uh you know back of the mind constraint that have because even if it

is in their in their interest they will feel that no some matrix is being collected how many times you are asking why don't you didn't you know the answer yourself I think it is very important

that know the person last mile person who in whose hands these tools are being given should know it is only for her benefit. It is not going to be used for any other purpose and that is very

important part of it. Would you agree uh from your side? &gt;&gt; Yeah, completely. And uh you know speaking of trust uh we also wanted to understand first what are the other

sources of information that health workers currently leverage and we saw that health workers themselves have a framework in their mind where each u information source has a certain

accessibility score and a certain trust score. So the medical officer supervisor for example is not very accessible but high trust right trust is really high but they don't want to bother the

supervisor for the smallest of doubts it's a little embarrassing right and then the same same thing comes up maybe the supervisor will think I don't know my responsibilities well enough I wasn't

paying attention in the classroom so accessibility low trust high a fellowm for example is much more accessible but she may not have the same level of confidence in appear online sources.

Most most we've spoken to understand that even though it's accessible, it's not necessarily always trustworthy. So our chatbot is positioned in a very interesting space where it is seen as

trustworthy because it pulls from government protocols. So it's familiar to them. This is something they've studied in the classroom setting. Uh uh it's introduced to them by Arman's

program managers. There's a tech plus touch approach, right? So the touch part is a very important driver of trust. It is accessible because they can uh uh you know it's a judgmentfree safe space

where they can ask uh questions any time of the day or night. Having said that in our early research we saw that there were some who did feel pressured to uh ask questions every day. It's a very

small number of but we saw some patterns where uh uh you know&amp;Ms were copy pasting the same answer and they were cycling through a set of 10 to 20 questions. Sometimes they changed a word

or two but it was the same 10 20 questions. So it was very obvious that she wasn't it's not like she was forgetting what she'd already asked. Uh there was some implied implicit pressure

that she felt. Uh so even in our onboarding we do make it a point to now emphasize that this is a tool for uh for their convenience for their learning. It's not a surveillance tool. This is

something they need to be reminded of from time to time and trust as I as you mentioned is not a given. Uh you have to design an experience that builds trust and you have to keep uh you know keep

building that relationship over time. Thank you very much. I think so we have covered the issue of design empowerment okay and uh the trust as well. I think what I want to touch last is because in

any when we talk about the last mile health workforce okay and always the government support has to be needed. You have to go hand inhand with the government otherwise it never scales up.

So the question is about scaling and um how and and working with the government is easier than what it always sounds. Okay. It has both sides to it. So Amed I wanted to understand from you. You have

worked extensively in government partnership in your things. How do you make it work? And because you have scaled to two states now so how did you make it work working alongside the

government what works? What doesn't work? &gt;&gt; Yeah. So it is very necessary. So whenever we are creating any solution for the community health worker with the

government. So what is happening on the field in this AI or digital world that we are creating solution for the community health worker not with the community health worker. So our approach

is a little bit different. So when we created this digital platform Android application with the community health or we almost spent more than two lakh hours with the community health work uh in a

state with some in some district and then we approached to the state to expand it to the uh in all the district and same thing is happening with the Asha board this LLM chat board. So we

are testing it trying it with the community health worker in the limited geography with the district officials and when we find it useful for the community health worker then we approach

to the government to scale it. So this is our approach how we are involving or taking support of the government to scale these type of product for the community health work. All right. I

think just a follow-up question to both you to um and then I will come to Tanushi for something related is that um when you talk about health kind of chat bots okay and we hear all kind of wrong

things in the news whether it's hallucination or whether it's a answer gone completely wrong and that is a make or break solution as well that is also closely related to the trust. How do you

handle it? Can you just first start and then I'll ask Hamemed the same. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So there are a few uh different things we do to minimize hallucinations. One obviously cannot eliminate

hallucinations entirely. This is a probabilistic system not a deterministic system. You can minimize it. Uh one we make sure that answers are grounded in in the protocols. Uh and we took all of

our protocols which were very visual converted it to markdown to make it more machine readable. We periodically expand the knowledge base as questions come in. If they get escalated to the human in

the loop once we have the answer that gets added to the knowledge base. Uh so that's one part. The second part is extensive evaluations. Before we rolled out the chatbot, we did

u evaluations with a panel of three gynecologists. Uh we had standard evaluation data sets prepared. uh the chatbot had to answer different questions covering all the protocols and

uh our expert evaluators rated each answer on a multi-dimensional rubric. So we looked at whether the answer was medically accurate and free of errors, whether it was complete, whether it was

concise and clear and whether it was satisfactory on the whole. So we wanted to make sure that we had zero harmful medical errors uh but 95% medical accuracy not 100% but we wanted to

eliminate any errors that uh led to harm if if implemented and 80 to 85% uh satisfactory rates. Uh this is pre-eployment. Post deployment for the first 500 questions we evaluated every

single question. Now we evaluate about 5 to 10% of questions every month because we get 3 to 5,000 messages a month. So 5 to 10% are evaluated and uh we also collect user feedback. So these are

metrics that we watch very closely. We are at 98% positive user feedback. The remaining 2% get escalated to the human in the loop and uh in the periodic medical evaluations we are at 97%

uh satisfactory rates. &gt;&gt; Thanks Anita. I think uh in a sense what you are saying there's no shortcut to extensive evaluation before you actually roll it out. Hammed what is your uh

view? &gt;&gt; So as I mentioned that we created this bot on the guidelines of the asha worker which is government of India guidelines and state guidelines and this bot or the

knowledge base is not there to take uh medical decision on the basis of Asha worker. So it is there to help Asha worker if they have any queries. So the bot is not helping Asha worker to make

uh clinical decision and we have also before deploying it to the real user we have also tested it with some of the asha worker in limited geography and we check the accuracy of it and uh before

deploying the bot the accuracy of the bot was more than 85% and we have continuous this process so we are our team member is checking all those answer which ashaw is getting from the bottom

And one more thing we did with the bot is that we also uh did expert in the loop. So all these query we are sending to uh ENMS and CHO also and if they find anything wrong any answer is wrong they

are informing Ashawa worker and we are improving our knowledge base on the basis of all these feedback. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. I think uh as a followup Tanoshi uh from your government vantage point

when you involve the private players as part of your ecosystem like in this case government has a asha ecosystem but both Arman and Kushib baby are working. What is the expectations that you have from

them that uh they should fulfill before they should become officially part of the ecosystem which you will support? So anytime um so it's very important for government to work with uh civil society

in general and private sector also I mean beautiful examples while I work with government of Karnataka and also in Tripura and um uh I think what is the responsibility of the evaluator as

secretary or as director to the ministry or department would be is the solution that is coming across solving what is the pain point of the beneficiary and at the same time there

is a costbenefit analysis also has to be done we generally take up a P first especially if it's a new technology and it's a new method of solving the problem and in the P we have to put adequate

metrics of success what is the definition of success and once you evaluate it through the proper mechanism. It is after that is when you would like to scale uh the the solution

overall. There are financial implications and there's social implication. There's often an optics part of it given the political considerations that are there. So as an

officer you have to balance out all the three aspects. Value for money beneficiary getting what we want him to or her to get. at the same time does the miracle for your political goals for

your minister as well because these are all win-wins in a way the the more effectively I spend government money the more money I have to spend on more initiatives so so if we balance out all

the three things together I think we generally get a good outcome &gt;&gt; I think so I think we covered good ground today right from how the solution should be designed it not just about

convenience, it's about dignity, it's about burden, it's non-serveillance, so many things that we talked about, it's about safety. So I think we covered that in terms of reimagining the whole how AI

can be used for community health workforce instead of just talking about skilling unless all these things fall into their slot very well there is no scaling because it will not be adopted

that trust at the end of it is important which is the mixture of all these three things I think. Thanks to the audience but I think don't get up because we have some time for some questions from the

audience and I would really appreciate Yes. &gt;&gt; Hiology. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I think this works. Um hi, my name is Abinit. I'm a technology and policy

researcher um working with a nonprofit. Um we've done a bunch of work around you know digital health and health AI and uh including talking to Asha workers. So a couple of questions I think one is a

technological question. You've mentioned a couple of times that the answers that the bot gives are protocol driven right and you've also talked about that the clinical decision-m element of it is a

little limited. So I think my first question is why an LLM and why not another um technology like rules-based systems or small or [clears throat] small language systems that are not that

compute intensive do not require that amount of data especially if you're working with a closed set of government documents and you know government protocols um a linked question to this

is if the if it is an LLM um is it a proprietary LLM that you folks use sorry or is it an open source LLM um that you use the second question I can also say right now um it's a little about the the

uh the trust aspect only but I'm trying to rephrase it from the point of view of patients. So a bunch of Asha workers we've talked to have told us how you know um when they do provide a solution

that they've gotten on the chatbot and it has not worked for the patient it affects their trust inside the community and not as much as the chat bots like their trust with the chatbot. So I think

my question a little is that the entire idea of Asha workers was to localize intelligence, localize medical intelligence, make sure that the person who provides the medical decisions is

contextualized with the same environment. But LLMs essentially do the other way around. You provide them an input and the the model in the back end which is more or less a black box gives

them an answer which they can like you said go through a feedback loop. I think my question is a little about how that intelligence can be brought back to the ground and how are you contextualizing

your models through to local realities. Sorry. &gt;&gt; Uh I am a moderator. I should not be answering questions. But in the interest of time, I thought I'll do that. So your

first question was about why not rulebased? Why LLM? See LLM is the necessary layer which makes this whole transaction conversational. Rulebased one of the major drawbacks of the

rulebased that if then else kind of thing is there. Okay, that does not give any comfort. That was good for some time when it was the only technology available. So that is the power of

conversation that LLMs do it. It can converse with you. It can ask you can ask follow-up questions all that stuff. The second one is you talked about the pro proprietary and I'm talking in

general. I don't know exactly how they do but I broadly know is that there is a technology called rag retrieval augmented generation. You must have heard of it. So LLM is only the front

end conversational layer. The actual knowledge base is it's being accessed through rag. So it does not matter whether it's proprietary or it is because we are using it for very

specific kind of purpose. That is the that is the way LLM is being used. So here proprietary LLM knowledge base is not or the model is not being exploited to

answer the question directly. &gt;&gt; I think we'll give it the chance to somebody else. &gt;&gt; We can chat after the session. 10 seconds left.

Hi, I'm Lakshmi and I'm currently researching in fem. Uh I have a question about a lot of the products that come up when it comes to specifically women's health. A lot of them sometimes work

just as AI rapper products because everybody wants to just ride the wave, right? But uh okay, that's interesting. Uh but you basically uh like my question is essentially around when you're trying

to not reinvent the wheel because a lot of these functional and successful products actually just scale through tech and allow you to do better. How do you also not just make like oh we are

working for women as the only mode to survive in the ecosystem and do products like that actually have a scope to work with the government or to actually be scaled in the market

&gt;&gt; I I didn't fully understand your question sorry times up we can chat afterwards giant &gt;&gt; you can discuss outside

&gt;&gt; yeah sorry for running out of time but thanks a lot. I think we can continue this chat outside. Thanks a lot for your patience. Yeah. And thanks the panelists. Thank you.

Scientists I don't know. I didn't make sure we can see each other. What I did?

Let me hear you. Requesting all the speakers and the table facilitators to come uh on the front for a quick picture and then we can start the session.

What are you doing? minute. Okay, good afternoon everyone.

Thank you so much for joining us this afternoon. I promise that this is going to be a very interesting session. But before I start, as is always true in anything related to education, I I get

to ask a question. So my question to you is when you see the phrase 1 billion futures, what occurs to you? What comes to your mind quickly?

&gt;&gt; 1.2 going to
