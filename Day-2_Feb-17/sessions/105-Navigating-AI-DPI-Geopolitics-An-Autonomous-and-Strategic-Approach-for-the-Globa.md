## 📝 Transcript

principal at APT Institute. Um further to my left um Dr. Snen um senior adviser to the UN security general's um special envoy for digital and emerging technologies and

member of the UN office um for digital and emerging technologies. And then last but not least on the end um Surv Daz who's chief of staff of investments at Code Develop. Um but before we hear from

these excellent speakers um I'm going to briefly sketch out the landscape as I see it. Um which for the most part is two quite distinct technology communities that are colliding and

scaling together. Um so the first is DPI digital public infrastructure. Um and you know for decades now countries across the global majority led actually initially by our host country India um

have built open interoperable systems um like your digital ids um digital payment systems and data exchange um with the guiding principles of transparency public ownership openness

um and ultimately citizen benefit right um it's designed to improve education healthare and so on while reding and improving access and inclusion for citizens. And then on the other hand, I

see AI AI innovation, the reason we're all here today, um which in many ways operates very differently, right? It's largely proprietary. It has huge levels of investments. Um it's

often foreignowned, dominated by the two sort of superpowers, um the US and Chinese tech giants who are ultimately racing to export these systems. um globally to the global south as well. Um

and the features here are very different. Um competitive advantage often closed architectures and commercial return. Um so from hardware to compute cloud the whole the whole AI

stack is in to some extent locked down. Um and as I see it very different to the principles of DPI which has pushed for greater openness. Um but these two efforts now uh we're seeing colliding in

government services um in chat bots building uh new citizen queries um in every algorithm now detecting fraud um and translation services something that the Indian

government is is rolling out successfully now um so AI is seeking integration into society but DPI is seeking greater efficiencies so in many ways they should be sort of the perfect

partners, partners in crime, right? But they do operate very differently, right, with very different rules and principles. Um, so for me, the question isn't whether we integrate AI and DPI. I

think it's very clear that's already happening. Um the question is on whose terms with what governance mechanisms, what safeguards um and what cost could this have to

sovereignty? Um new dependencies um autonomy and I suppose ultimately what cost could this have to the public interest principles that DPI was initially founded upon. Um so over the

next I think we've got around 50 minutes or so um yeah we're going to be exploring these questions um and ultimately trying to seek to understand if these two worlds can be reconciled in

some way and actually if they can actually if they can ultimately be used to enhance one another. Right? That's that's the world that I personally would like to see. Um and yes towards the end

we'll try and open the floor for 10 minutes or so of Q&amp;A. So please um start thinking of potential questions. Um so yeah without further ado um if I could start with you Dr. Medi um

what would a successful vision of AIDP integration in the global south look like to you? &gt;&gt; Thanks so much um for the question and uh for the nice introduction. Um DPI um

as you said is is a different way of operating than the AI. We have different life cycle. Um if you look at DPI, it's kind of a framework that we have put on the top of the digital transformation in

particular for public services essentially build built open three main building blocks ID uh financial transactions data exchange and then DPI is not being built for the sake of DPI.

DPI should bring some concrete use cases of usage of these three main uh building blocks. On the top of these three blocks, we can add trade, we can add health data exchange, we can accelerate

deployment of vaccine campaign, access to the social cont uh uh benefits uh and also control the population. We have to to keep to keep that in mind. AI on the on the opposite side is much more uh

operating in a different life cycle starting from data and that's the main building block and then there is this refining of the models and ending up with either foundational models or

businessoriented model which is driven by use cases which is not the case of GPI. So AI for AI is these competition foundational models, large language models and all these uh new building

technical blocks that we have today. But infiny the role of AI is to accelerate healthcare is to uh accelerate delivery of public services is to uh accelerate education access and perform better at

education access uh in crisis management. So AI is being driven by use cases despite the fact that we can see that most of the existing product today in AI are not use

cases driven and mostly on large language model and foundational model. But this is the competition that you underlined between the two giants which is how to access that level of

sophistication in building the best uh foundational model. But um the real implementation of the AI when it comes to the citizens and population is uh driven by different use cases and that's

where we I think where we have the matching points. The DPI is not being built for the DPI but to find these use cases. AI is being driven by use cases. So we can see that we have

convergence of ultimate convergence of the final goals of AI and DPI is literally about use cases. These are technologies. These are Not these are tools. These are not the solutions. And

then when we bring that in mind, the main point is the human being and the user needs. Human being, human rights, safeguards, inclusivity, all these elements that are essential to maintain

the technology as a sustainable technology. Uh human pres right preserving technology fully inclusive for the population. That's the point. But the second point is about user needs

driven. What are population looking for from AI and DPI? Are we talking in the cloud about AI and DPI like very uh philosophical discussion or is it something that is userdriven? That's

where we need to go back to the reality and that we need a bottom up approach bringing the user needs user requirements and then see where is the matching is it on DPI is it on AI how

these two can come together. Final point is just to say DPI and AI should start together. There is there is no AI after DPI or DPI after AI. Both should start together giving that they both

articulating around data which is the essential elements composing DPI and AI and both serving the final goal which is the user needs or citizens rights or citizen needs.

&gt;&gt; Can I just have quick follow-up question then? So what for you are the major bottlenecks to this user centered approach? the competition first of all because I

mean the industrial and the economic um targets and goals are not well aligned with user needs often they are much more aligned with economic perspective uh so that's bringing that we are talking more

about LLMs and foundational models than the real uh implementation of AI on the ground how it can be used and how it can improve the public services uh health um and um um

the well-being of the citizens. So that's the the biggest issue. And then the second issue is that we do not master the entire value chain that I've been talking about the life cycle. When

it comes to the AI or DPI, we are often lacking some and have some gaps into the value chain and these bring some in the decision- making process and also in the vision of building an entire

vision integrated, cohesive and holistic for the integration of these two. So it's both at the policy side where we have no entire vision. We keep talking about sovereignity without really

redefining the notion of sovereignity in the AI of DPI where we for sure it's no longer the same sovereignity that we know for decades because you can't master the entire value chain and at the

uh implementation side where the it's more the economy than the needs that are driving the the the development of the AI and then we can see it with members Open AI uh is I mean is it they there

are some estimation that it can get bankrupted if they keep spending on LLM without real implementation and it seems that everyone is pushing for that without even caring for the competition

without even caring about user needs and real implementation on the ground. So they don't have a real model for to be implemented on the ground they are missing that point. Yeah, 100%. Yeah,

such Yeah, it's great to sort of center this conversation in the user. Yeah. What are actually the user benefits here? Um and putting that first. Um so yeah, we've both sort of ted a little

bit on competition, but Jane, if I can come to you now um to dig deeper into that. So India, for example, has has pushed for this third pathway, right? Um that's

often the language that's used. Do you think that that's feasible in in the case of AI being further integrated into DPI or do you think that a divergence from US and China technology stack is

simply unrealistic. &gt;&gt; Uh good afternoon. Thank you Rowan and thank you Dr. for that very good intervention the opening um but before I go to your answer just to say

that um I'm Jane Monga and I I'm at the Africa program I want to to say that because most of the work and the research I do is answered from a lens from Africa and the but I think a lot of

the answers here is uh I you can easily equip them to most of the developing countries um so a third way I I don't know I I want almost to to reframe uh that question uh because is that what we

want is that what the the global south needs is are we do we want a third way or should we start more defining what kind of applications that we are talking about that's needs and I think when we

talk about a third way it's almost like we're trying to dis to disentangle almost come out of the current uh technology offerings that are there and there's there's some aspects of that

that could not that may not be uh well suited for for Africa or for developing countries but it doesn't mean that we need to create an autocy system whereby we are now building our own systems, our

own I think it's a question of how do we bring back the value so agency around it and how do we ensure that we're able to build solutions that work uh for the continent or for uh for for the regions

that we represent. Um one of the things I just want to double click on is is what Dr. Medi said that when we talk about building AI and DPI it's about for the developing countries there's there's

some similarities and it's about applications. It's about how do you ensure that we are building solutions that help soio economic development provide jobs uh move applications for

education health um and you can see that with the narrative of DPI uh especially that was driven um by by India so how do you ensure that is what we're driving as opposed to coming out of a third way or

saying we have new technologies but then what kind of agency can can we build about that and lastly but not least I think uh I I want to highlight and almost put a shameless plug of paper

myself and actually was back there. We just did um uh at Carnegie and we talk about how uh maybe what now would call a third way is how countries in the developing regions can come together

through cooperation um and start developing these solutions together. The first thing we identify is already work with what's existing because when you talk about India there's the India AI

mission when you go to other regions there's latam GPT so there's a lot of solutions already coming out of these regions so how do we get better linkages I hope that's something that comes out

of this India AI summit the second thing we identify is how do we get more governments uh investing a lot of some of these conversations have been driven by donors nothing wrong with donors but

I think it's important that national budgets are being dedicated so there's agency in a country driving its own agenda. And the third thing that we we really really talk about is third

spaces. If we can leave the India AI summit with third spaces where if you're innovator in India and you're interested in something happening in Brazil, what are those linkages that we can form for

those spaces to be uh processed so that we move on having solutions that have been driven by um the the needs of the developing south. So that would be my I guess my my third way.

&gt;&gt; Great. Can I can I just ask a follow up on the international corporation piece that you've been doing? Um, you know, Mark Carney delivered a a very popular in many circles a very popular speech at

the World Economic Forum just a few weeks back where he he described a global rupture um in in our in our geopolitical landscape. So given that we are seeing this rupture, what kind of

new forums for cooperation do you see or potentially states that you're talking to discussing as as maybe a more viable way than previous alliances? &gt;&gt; U

first and foremost I'm not endorsing but but I think we all understand the frust I think I would call it the frustrations of what's happening in the ecosystem right now. there there is a

very strong pull and tagged by two very strong powers to drive that and I think this is where the international cooperation that can come in is that countries that truly understand this our

priorities can just come out and sign collaboration agreements and cooperation we may have I mean it's always better to do it through bodies so if there's a Asian uh body or there's an African body

it would be easier to do that but I think at the at the onset even if two countries I'm from Kenya that's the origin country of mine if Kenya can come to the table and sit with India and say

we live in this place. How are we going to ensure skills? India is very good with skilling talent. Um on the other hand, countries like Kenya want to really skill their talent. How do we get

research institutions working together to skill that when it comes to um AI centers and so forth, how what what are some of those collaborations that we can come out of? So for me, I would say it's

a it's almost like a democratized way of of international cooperation where countries come together and maybe at the end they can have their own I don't want to call it but their own [laughter]

their own way of of connecting through their similar desired challenges and where they want to go with AI and &gt;&gt; thank you. Um I mean we've sort of skirted around the edges of um

sovereignty right this this this word that is very difficult to define and some and seems kind of in many ways unrealistic for a lot of states. Um so Kunow if I can come to you quickly on

how how do you balance sovereignty this this kind of goal that people are trying to achieve or at least some level of greater autonomy I think is maybe more pragmatic um with the the drive of of

interoperability the principle of oper interoperability um in DPI are the two kind of is there an inherent tension between them? Yeah, I would say so. Um, thanks for questions

before me. Essentially, yeah, there is a it's a contradictory statement sometimes, especially when you look at it from a very definitional place. You see sovereignty as sort of creating your

own power, control, agency around models, data, scale, and so on so forth. But we're also approaching world order where collaboration is critical. So, we can't actually do a lot of these things

in isolation. Um, There is a existing friction tension between the words between interoperability and sovereign and I think a lot of the times it gets confused as in order for this to happen

the specialized goods products services need to come in and then the retention of that stays within the power and confine of the country that sort of import but I think what we're realizing

slowly is that while at a very first principle of value level the of digital sovereignty remain similarish. Um I think the deep down granular places are where the differentiating factors come

about. So it is very tough to actually come to the table and say that this is exactly what we want and you know how do we provide this but what we're trying to actually understand now um I mean

globally as well as the organization itself we're trying to actually understand what those mean does data sovereignty answer a certain question around does um does governance as a pred

predecessor to model building does that work as an implementable model within both structures Um, so there is a there is a need to I think create that knowledge platform and to create almost

this I like to think of it as a third wave between other countries and organizations to build that bridging factor. Um, but at the end of the day if we're going to continue sort of thinking

about it as a lot of countries have the similar definitional part of it. I don't think we can get there and this is I hope not too contentious point but there has to be nuance embedded

and just at the level of digital sovereignty but even deeper into data or whichever route. Um I know that countries globally have differing needs. So that conversation is I think a bit

more critical than this attempt that we have of finding similarities in the larger definition. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Yeah. I mean I from where I'm sitting, governments I'm talking to,

some that are lower resourced, you have to be critical about this because ultimately this all costs money and and money that is hard to come by for for some. Um so on the point of kind of

funding um surv like co-develop um for those that don't know is a um philanthropic organization um that seeks to build partnerships around DPI. um where are you seeing the role of um

banks in this the role of funders in this and how are different funding efforts trying to support a more kind of autonomous approach to AI and DPI &gt;&gt; thanks Roan uh before I go into that

question I will slightly disagree with Kunal on like the tension I don't necessarily think it's completely in tension between sovereignity and uh interoperability because I'm just coming

from a digital ID conference where Sovereignty was a big discussion and the thing there is like you know if you dissect what sovereignty means for each country it it it differs like uh at a

level of for instance for most countries it just means the autonomy in decision- making and let's say avoiding vendor locking for that matter and in that case interoperability is actually the right

principle to have uh which actually preserves sovereignity rather than but if you look at a regional lens for instance like interoperability is also like you know

&gt;&gt; a way to collaborate But it might affect sovereignity. So if you look at the different layers of the stack at a compute level, yeah, there is a tension there, but may be not at the data layer.

That's maybe slightly a nuance on the funding side. And I think we have all been part of this discussion for a long time. Um we are a philanthropic funding and if

you look at some narrative around like you know DPI, a lot of the DPI momentum is also driven by like you know donor funding in many countries. But I think more and more we are seeing that you

know countries themselves are starting to figure out how to fund uh DPI and digitalization and now with AI and for many countries which have the capacity they're starting to think about how do

we fund DPI across uh sectors and across functions as a infrastructure layer because one of the problems with funding is traditionally funding in government in any kind of institution is very

siloed in terms of the line ministries in terms of the functions that have budgets to fund something. So an agriculture ministry will want to protect its budget uh rather than

building something that's interoperable and in an infrastructure layer. Uh but at the same time there are institutions like the multilateral development banks which provide a lot of loan funding to

countries to build digital systems. There is a problem within that as well like you know we were just discussing this before like one is the time it takes like an MDB will take two years to

approve a particular loan by the time AI will have jumped to models digital tech will have like you know uh evolved like many years uh at the same time MDBs also fund a very projectbased digitization

paradigm which means that there's a lot of capital expenditure that is allowed for but there's not a lot of operational expenditure which countries need to maintain the technology build capac

capacity in the long term to be able to actually sovereign with sovereignty manage those systems. We have seen some countries tackle these problems in their own ways. But I think on the funding

landscape a lot has to change in how countries procure technology. What is the market ecosystem that is responding to this demand and that's when actually things will change for the better in my

opinion. &gt;&gt; You just said there that a lot of countries are are do are doing this. Can you provide some concrete examples of of good use cases? Uh I would say one of

the better examples of this that I have seen is uh in Ethiopia for instance. Um Ethiopia is building like a digital ID which is based on open source platform called MOSP. Uh but like one of the

things about adopting DPGs and open sources also it's not as simple as saying I'll download code from GitHub and like just put it place. You need developers who understand that

technology. They need to be like you know wellversed with like whatever script it's written in. They need to know how to customize it to their country's context. In many countries,

they work with market vendors like system integrators which is another layer of like you know issue like what if we are logged into this particular system integrator. What Ethiopia did

from the very beginning was &gt;&gt; they did not rely on any private sector system integrator. What they did was their government had like some capacity of developers who took MOSEP,

broke it down, started building it from scratch for themselves and now their they have a government body which is kind of a system integrator themselves and is completely wellversed with like

MOSIP as a digital ID platform. So today FIA ID which is a digital ID and they are layering a lot of AI use cases on top of that. It's completely managed by uh the Ethiopian U ministry. Now I mean

the good part is that they had capacity they had like the knowledge not all countries have that but I that's where a lot of investments need to go because otherwise we risk going down the same

path of like you know being locked into some particular tech so I would say Ethiopia is a great example but I think the importance there is you need to have the right institutions to be agile you

need to be able to pay developers like because otherwise open Google will come and pay like you know &gt;&gt; ton of salaries so like yeah that's like different problems there

&gt;&gt; yeah interesting and I echo yeah that to for those that aren't aware to look into MOSIP and the work that they're doing. Um so let's bring it back to kind of global governance and actually kind of

more policy question. Um, Medi the the UN, how does it plan to ensure coherence I suppose between the different um the different forms of international governance that it's that

it's rolling out whether that's on AI or on DPI. So for example, you have um the global digital compact which covers a lot of the kind of innovation points of DPI and yet we're seeing new mechanisms

um for global governance around AI safety safety. How how do you square that circle? Do you see them in tension with one another? Do you see alignment between them?

&gt;&gt; Okay. Uh thanks. Um just quick question uh quick um comments on the previous discussion regarding sovereignity and funding. &gt;&gt; Um me I've seen that happening in

particular on the African continent that uh if you are talking about sovereignity uh funding is a principal piece of sovereignity. So uh running after multilateral banks and fenders is no

longer the main subjects when it comes to deal with the sovereignity understanding and uh Ethiopia is the the best case. They declined a a grant from the word bank to develop their own

vision of the digital ID. So that's a notion of strong sovereignity signal. We don't mean we we would like to to be free on the decision making process. Um getting back to the governance meaning

let me quickly detail whe the UN is doing right now. We just announced the scientific panel uh composed from 40 scientists to deliver two reports a year on AI risks

and opportunities. uh that's uh very close to the mechanism like IPCC and the uh climate change panel um that will deliver these reports to the global dialogue that is also a new mechanism

within the UN the first session of the global dialogue where uh it will convene different multistakeholder global uh approach to the uh to the discussion not only member states but civil society uh

tech operators and uh all people who are involved in the decision- making process of the governance. Uh that will happen in July in Geneva for the first time and the second round will be during the

general assembly in September 2027. And um these are um mechanism that are being institutionalized by the global digital impact that was decided last year by all member states as a group

first global framework on digital cooperation which aligned with your first question on digital cooperation. It's meaning um we have a lot of cooperation agreements that are managed

at the level of the UN but that was the first digital agreement till we meaning we've been waiting till 2024 to get the first diesel agreement to understand how we can exchange and cooperate together

around the digital while the diesel was an essential component economic component social component political component in our uh daily life. So that's the the GDC and then uh there is

there's also some work uh led by member states to develop uh a global network on capacity development on AI because it's better governed if you can understand what you are talking about or if you

know exactly what is the uh consequence of all the governance um um rules and constraints and policy that you are defining on your own development of the AI. Now uh at the global level it will

be very hard to re enforce these governance mechanisms and then to make accountable uh systems and frameworks to be implemented within that uh that governance mechanism. There is a shift

in the thinking which is rather than going on the global governance huge frameworks is about thinking of what is the minimum standards what is the minimum governance set that we should

agree open what is the uh the irreducible set of policy rules and governance mechanism that should be put in place and then you can build open that that

would be much easier to define but also to bring all people all member states around that uh rather than building these very complex global governance mechanisms that will be um in danger for

the your own sovereignity decision- making process if it goes against your vision of sovereignity and vision of AI development. So getting back to the essential what are the minimum set and

then with that uh building around it uh a common understanding I think the common understanding of the needs of every every country and different country and the contextualization of the

governance mechanism that should be implemented around that is an essential element to enable the AI at the global majority and in particular at the global south. We are not at all at the same

level when it comes to the AI developments. Uh there was no government mechanism 10 years ago around AI when we started building AI and then there is no reason

to put very restrictive rules today for countries who would like to start their AI journey too because that may uh be a disabler for their AI journey. So this is how how we see it or how I see it

probably and um the area is really to reduce the complexity and to reduce the granularity to the minimum level in order to get quickly to a government agreement among the different member

states and that uh a strong and that can be stewarded across the AI journey and the development of the AI. It's a very experimental technology. We don't know what is coming after the AI. Probably

robotics and neuromorphic and neuroscience and all these things will converge together to a new thing. So with these standards mostly entered into human rights, I think that we will find

a way to sort out the problem of uh multi-layered um governance that is not often interoperable. &gt;&gt; Thank you. And yeah, important to go back to what the minimal standards are

because I think what is shock shocking and I mean a major challenge is that I don't think states have really adequate find what risk is actually acceptable for them yet and starting at that base

base level um is is kind of crucial to then build on broader governance mechanisms that people can actually adhere to. Um, and you talked briefly, I mean, we talked about risk and and sort

of the geopolitical environment there. Um, if a geo Jane, I'm going to come to you on this. Um, if a say we see a geopolitical crisis, right, the world is we're seeing this rupture, things are

fragmenting, um, there's increasing tensions. Um if if a kind of crisis leads to restrictions, leads to sanctions um in this increasingly globalized technology

stack, how can what kind of contingency plans can states have in place to ensure that their technology can still meet citizens needs? Are people thinking about that layer of risk? I mean, for

example, in in in the context you're looking at most in African states, do they have contingency frameworks for for potential disruptions in global order. &gt;&gt; It's a very interesting question. Um and

I I will go back uh into the realities of uh some of the African countries especially the ones that we study is that even before we start looking at a disruption the reality is how do you

connect Africans? How do you connect? When you look at the continent right now about 40% are using the internet. Um so now you're adding another layer of of uh fragmentation for policy makers. I have

to say the priorities that we see in the documents that are coming now that's a big part of the research that we do has has maybe not yet matured to where we are thinking about fragmentation. But

it's it's about building agency and ensuring that as they build their internet that they're building systems that can have also that can also break economic procarity. So there's long-term

sustainability around that. Now maybe that's where we can start answering your question if there's a fragmentation. Then how do we start building because at the end of the day for a country to be

able to come out of um its social economic issues it has to start building long-term economic security around its digital technologies. So there has been conversations of then how do we ensure

that even the technology that is being used especially the data systems first does it speak um are we collecting data that is very inherent for the populations that you serve. Uh and so we

are beginning to see groups like Masak the African voice these are coalitions that are beginning to build large data sets um to to to serve at least the African people. Another thing is even

within this fragmentation if if it happens uh at at the end of the day um there's already technology that has been deployed within these countries. So u a

lot of countries the global south have not developed. So there will be some kind of technology in place. The question is is how will they be able to begin within the system. So if uh if one

side switches off, you better be at least be on the other side. Anyway, I'm not I don't want to push that narrative because I think there are bigger problems in some of these uh areas of

the world uh that thinking about fragmentation. Let's first just get can we get the basics connectivity can we get energy there and and I think that's why for this for this conversation

coming to India is we also have to handle this conversation in layers. Yes, there are these ex existential risks but we still have the very reality risks of the continent the global south and can

we can we start looking at at that from a very fragmented level as much as we want to drive this but also what does it matter &gt;&gt; uh because at the end of the day we want

employment we want to make sure Africa is is has the highest youth bulge a lot of people don't have jobs how can we make sure that AI and DPI is providing economic solution jobs innovators are

being built and they are build into scale. So for me that's that's I guess trying to bring back that conversation to that angle even as we talk about the bigger issues of sovereignity and so

forth and back to the question that was discussed here. I really do want to jump into it because I I I have very strong views on that and I think there's also an opportunity for the UN maybe to

unpack that these scientific answers exactly how do you define sovereignity when it comes to digital layers? uh because when we think about sovereignity as a a country sovereign uh right to

determine itself it may not be possible in digital but it's still a very important question when you when we go into these technologies but anyway that was not the question but I just

thank you Jane yeah there's some I mean real pressing challenges for people today that need to be dealt with first. I I I hear that point. Um so Kuna, India is somewhat pitching itself as

I've heard the term like southwestern partner um on like AI AIDP partnerships as an as an alternative I suppose to the to the US and China. What do you think India's USP is in in perhaps dealing

with some of the problems that Jane's just addressed? &gt;&gt; I mean I think uh Part of it is how do we how have we been through the life cycle of it. Um I know that we had some

similar questions a few years ago and a lot of the ground research that we do I think comes out similarly in the lived experiences of it. So um for example I think we were worried about yeah let's

get employment sorted first and then we can worry about data consent and data safety and principles and rights and so on. So I think there's a lived experience part of it where there's a

huge amount of experience and um expertise I they say um that can be shared. I think a big part of it is obviously of course the the the sort of varied multimodal approaches that we

have. So we have a lot of proprietary we have a lot of open source. So I think that becomes a big play. Um I I sometimes sort of shudder to think um how many different options we should

create as as a sort of way to kind of create adoption globally. Um but there are a lot of available approaches and pathways that exist. Um I think the next part of it is the integration component

is that how have we thought about VPI? There has been a lot of interoperability. We've seen the rise of public private partnerships like never before. Um something that whether you

want to call it um a paradigm shift our partnership model or if it's just a signal of the times it's happening. &gt;&gt; So how do we contest with that? How do we make sure that that is done in a way

that represents not just the global economic economic agenda but how do you make sure that it has a component of the user and humanity.

So that's that's a big part of it. Um this might be fairly controversial, but I think the the point that we're trying to make is that it's a good thought process. It's a great way to start

thinking about it. Um the values and principles might differ, but there might be some things that we can also help highlight as risk. &gt;&gt; So the risk identification part of it

could also be something highlight from here. And then of course the scales I I hope I'm not sort of elaborate on the larger marketplace solutions that India might have.

&gt;&gt; Um but some of the softer angles is is something that we're trying to also figure out as a form of &gt;&gt; Thank you. Sar, can I come to you with the same question? I'm sorry I'm leaning

into the fact that you both are Indian nationals on the panel. Um how would you kind of describe India's USP in all of this? &gt;&gt; Uh in the DPI space our USP is Bangalore

visits which no other country has. But on a a serious note I think uh there's been a lot of different sorts of innovation. I think u the how parts of what India has done is not actually well

documented well packaged and well evangelized yet in my opinion because I think when people like we hear a lot of countries say that oh we want to do something like Aadhaar for instance but

Aadhaar didn't just happen like you know in one year two years it took 15 years of lot of back and forth lot of challenges lot of like you know technical choices and I think a lot of

that is kind of in the heads of a lot of people or in government documentation in my understanding it's not out there. So there's a lot that can be learned like obviously people know about the

technological aspects of how we did things how we built UPI what is the principles of UPI but I think that's one of the things I think would be important like for instance even to me it's a lot

of surprise sometimes that you know one of the things that countries have a problem with in terms of when building digital ID uh is like lock in at the level of uh the biometric uh ABS system

essentially but what India did was they had three vendors s at the same time uh providing the AB services so that no one vendor will ever have monopoly over uh providing services for Aadhaar or any

kind of stuff. So those are the kind of things that are not out there and I feel like India can do a better job of like you know having that out there and not just India I feel like you know it can

come from like Brazil and Estonia or any other country that's doing it. On the AI side of things I also think there's a lot of new thinking uh new ways of doing things that are coming up that need to

be more out there. For instance, I think like Dr. Dr. Mandi Jane had mentioned like you know ultimately the idea is like you know what what is the problem we are solving for and what is the value

we are creating for the citizen and I think a lot of the principles that we have built technology over the last two decades is also being applied to AI like for instance public benefit is at the

center of how a lot of AI application is happening and how do you make sure that public benefit is like a central concept of how you support technology uh do you have like an open source first

principles in government those are the kind of thinks that India can kind of make a u like you know take it out and like you know have other countries adopt it. Uh I think yeah I it's it's a lot

about like the how part of things rather than the what because each country wants to do the what their way. So &gt;&gt; thank you. Yeah big thumbs up on um public benefit and open source

solutions. Um I'm now going to turn to the audience. Um we've got about 10 15 minutes for questions and I'll turn to you first Dr. because I know you have to leave a bit early. If you have

to leave now as well, then please feel free. But we'll just take three at first and see how we go. Um, yes, over here. Do we have &gt;&gt; namaste?

Namaste. Good afternoon to respected authorities from United Nations Organization and respected members in the panel and respected members in the audience. My question is relating to

what is the need and capability of the sustainable and echofriendly safely, healthy, securely and emotionally, sentimentally, knowingly, unknowingly, intentionally

in A2 perspective, the need and capability of sustainable trustworthy relationship between United Nations organization and member countries and member countries and United Nations

organizations in vice versa relating to artificial intelligence development implementation and making a echofriendly healthy safely securely sorry sustainable environment. We're

going to need a little bit of a tighter question than that otherwise I think there'll be too much for the the panel to dive into. If we can go to you sir as well and then um the woman yes you at

the back. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So my question is uh with respect to how international collaboration is playing out uh with AI and DPI in excess. So can countries collaborate in creation of uh

joint uh regulatory sandboxes across sector wherein uh you're not just solving the problems of your country but it's a co-creation co-identification of a problem so four or five countries can

come together and the best case can be scaled up and I think that is in continuation to how use cases have been released as part of this summit so how do you see regulatory sandboxes being

the pathway of uh enabling AIDP and access &gt;&gt; thank you great question and yes and you uh good afternoon everyone um my question is that uh we were talking

about sovereignity and how difficult it is to actually define it. Uh we are seeing India as being a bearer of how in global south it will lead further in AI development and u sharing it with

different countries. Um my question is there is an inherent difference when it comes to development and defining of AI sovereignity between global south and global north. So how do we see uh the

convergence a convergence between both the uh you know blocks and um out institution or a framework where we can collaborate on the definitions or um you know working out in different layers and

stack of AI. So how do we see that and work on it? &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Okay. Thank you. Yeah Dr. Millie feel free to take take any any of those.

Hello. Yeah. Uh, sorry. I'm I probably will mix all the answer the answers in in in one. Um, this is not meaning let's be very be very realistic. there is a big competition because there's a big

economic um um value but also the power of the these technologies where positioning of the power that the power that could bring these technologies to the member states. So um and that's life

that's real life and that's the real geopolitics context. It's a it's a competition. So making countries collaborating together be beyond the UN vision meaning is is very hard. um in

particular those who are leading on the competition and um and then without those pe those countries that are leading on the competition we are missing piece of the stack of the

development of the AI or the DPI meaning it can be it can go from rare earth to uh GPUs to ships to um energy to data to models so that's it can be a various uh part of the the stack that are missing

and then that's not the goal of uh building the corporation then now with the GDC and the cooperation vision there are no rules there are pathways of cooperation and then we cannot define

rules and rule and then pathways are often impacted by the reality of on the ground of the geopolitics tension crisis and um and the competition again and um so it's not up to the UN I think to um

to define it's mostly the UN that is bringing the convening, the forum, the place to discuss, but it's back again within the hands of the member states in the country to decide if they want to

cooperate or not and how they would like to cooperate. And we have no words to say on that. This is a sovereign decision-making process coming from member states impacting their own vision

of the technology and their sovereignity and how they would like to compete. either India, China, the US, South Africa, uh or France. All these countries got to decide on how they

would like to cooperate with each other. And then we can see that there are some global north around the Mediterranean cooperation uh literally about the energy exchange, data exchange,

south to south uh cooperation when it comes to the DPI and AI trying to get some clusters uh based on user requirement and their vision of DPI and trying to build some common solutions to

that. But this is something that is purely driven by the politics and by by the policy makers of member states and not at all by the U at the UN level where it's more a forum of discussion

where we can bring these pathways but never anything else than a recommendation. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; I just wanted to answer the regulatory

sandbox question off of I think what Dr. M said, right? Um innovative governance Sorry. &gt;&gt; Okay. Um yeah, I think this works. Um just to double in I think and use him

use his response as a framework. Regulatory sandboxes are particularly hard. Um we're trying to build one out in Karnataka in some capacity. The interdep departmental liazisoning is

insane. Um, innovative governance models that approach and use this to create collaborative standard setting and all of that that is the right way. How is something that's being kind of figured

out at the moment. I do see a vision or I do see a goal in which simultaneous testing regulatory as well as sort of technological and governance all of it can be thought about collectively but

the amount of leazisoning that is required between or to do all of that like he mentioned it is very specific it is very agenda it is very um and I'm not I'm not saying this in a negative way

the the way in which risks are identified between different departments countries etc are crit critical. You cannot let go of certain jurisdictional things because you want to align to a

larger goal. Um, and the agendas need to vary. So, it is a mass effect effort, but I don't think it we're not sure if it's that's the way to approach it at the moment.

&gt;&gt; All right. Should we take another round of three questions? Um, yes, the gentleman in the blue suit. Um, the woman there with the glasses. Um, and then maybe one from over this side of

the room as well. You sir? AI. Um &gt;&gt; yeah uh I'm not sure I I I'm not sure in what I'm not technical enough to answer

your question in terms of how you mean AI under the DPG definition but I work very closely with a lot of DPGs in the DPI space. It solves for some issues. It doesn't solve for everything. For

instance, one of the issues that we see particularly right now is uh yes DPGs are open source. They meet a certain level of standards. uh but it's a very technical like you know thing like you

know it's easy to solve the technology has been solved for in the DPI space but the problem governments are now facing is even opensource is to some something that to manage to govern it's not easy

uh uh governments don't have the framework to work with like you know something like a DPG how do you procure it how do you govern it it's not that easy to just say that you know AI

becoming like a DPG becoming like an AI standard will solve that and the second question is like you know sustainability like you know uh DPGs are maintained by a lot of philanthropic funding uh that

is shrinking in like increasingly in this world. Uh there are very few funders who fund DPGs for like the tech itself. So I I don't think that will solve it. Yes, it is a good idea in

terms of having some technical standards on AI but maybe not the full solution in my opinion. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Thank you so much.
