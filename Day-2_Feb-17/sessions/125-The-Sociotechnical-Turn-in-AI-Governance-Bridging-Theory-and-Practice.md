## 📝 Transcript

uh you know supply chain value chains. Now with AI uh moving from automation to more autonomous execution the real question is not really if if it is going to disrupt uh you know the

sector. Uh not sure if all of you heard Venod Kosla earlier today he made a remark at AI summit that in the next uh four to five years BPO and IT services is going to just disappear.

So the question really is how India is going to leverage this tech wave to its advantage in creating additional new jobs uh you know near revenue streams from AI and of course strengthen its

position uh in the global market global services economy. So before we jump into you know Q&amp;A uh I would like the panelists to quickly you know briefly introduce themselves. So Soft let's

start with you. Hi everyone, thank you for joining us today. Uh my name is Swapnel Vetnagar. U I'm a partner with Aasand. I lead the overall research practice here at

Aasand. Um been an industry analyst for more than a decade and have been a part of several uh service provider organizations on the strategy side prior to that. Uh so extremely interested in

how this sector is going to transform uh with this new upcoming wave. Thank you. Thank you the Aasan team for having me here. Uh Jagdish Mitra um incidentally

um have spent most of my life on the side that you're talking about Chandria. I was the chief strategy and growth officer till 2024 April of Tech Pahendra and I was responsible for a company that

we acquired called Satya and therefore their P&amp;L. So and since then I have uh started an agentic AI company which is on the other side of the discussion about how to drive it with products. I'm

very excited to have this conversation. Uh not qualified enough to make predictions to say whether five years it'll last or two. I think that's a meaningless debate. Um I'm also on the

board of something very important to India which is the NSDC the National Skill Development Corporation and I think that has a critical role to play as we go forward. Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you everyone. Uh thanks Chandika for having me. My name is Somna Chari. I used to be a partner in Mckenzie for many years. Served a lot of tech services companies and saw this

opportunity to create a vertical AI company focus on tech services. We call ourselves prism force. It's like a prism on workforce. uh nearly 30 uh leading tech services companies in India and

abroad use our platform for talent management, skills and resource management in particular. Very excit excited to speak and I do think that it's a net new opportunity for most

Indian companies and not so much of a threat. &gt;&gt; Hi everyone. Uh my name is Akshana. Thanks for uh joining us today. I'm a managing partner at Avisant. Um uh we

are a global consulting firm and it is really our pleasure to host this session today on what's the future uh and what's the imperative for tech enabled services. Um in terms of my role, I've

spent over two decades uh in this industry both like Jagish said on the service provider side being a uh provider of services to global clients and then for the last u uh 15 16 years

plus as an adviser to global uh organizations who are looking to either outsource their services to uh uh large tech services companies or even set up their own centers here in India. So that

gives us a unique perspective on what and how clients are looking to consume these tech services. Um and then also on the other side we work and interact quite a bit with uh tech services

companies, BO companies. So hopefully through this uh uh would look forward to sharing some of the perspectives that we've had and and what it means for um India as a country and then you know the

growth opportunities that lie ahead. So &gt;&gt; right. So let me just start with you ashair. So u India has built its uh IT dominance on labor arbitrage right and with now AI you know compressing the

time required to do the job uh do you see that it's going to erode our uh you know fundamentally erode our advantage or is it going to transform it into something new?

So I think uh you shared some numbers in the beginning right today this industry um is is very very fundamental to Indian economy with about 6 million people directly employed and many many more

indirectly employed. It's been a big employment generation generator in the last uh two decades plus. U it's also close to about $280 billion worth of revenue that this this industry

generates. But it was not always this case, right? So now we take labor as a given. But if you go back 25 years ago when Y2K, which was the big pivotal moment for this industry, uh this

industry had less than three 300,000 people employed. Uh it had u less than I think four to five billion dollars worth of revenue in this industry. So we've had a massive growth in the last 25

years. Uh almost a 55x growth uh when it comes to revenue. So of course I think cost has been a big aspect for clients in the US Europe geographies where they're looking at cost and labor

arbitrage is a big given. But what has I think what we've built as an industry is not just a a very highly scaled up you know talent pool. Um clearly about six million people they have expertise in

different technologies, different industries all of that. Um so that's a big uh advantage but along these five 30 plus years we've also built a lot of process expertise right so these

individuals these six million plus people have a lot of process and domain expertise uh when when it comes to their clients uh and then also they have a lot of information and intelligence on how

these um workflows and these organizations inherently work right so to say that I think labor is the only advantage we have is I don't think fundamentally do we do have a lot of

other advantages when it comes to you know the process the domain the the organizational you know nuances and all of that so so those are on the advantages but now what do we do with it

is is I think from here to the next 5 years to 10 years and so on so uh I think there is a lot of opportunity I don't think this just goes away because an agent replaces a human that is

working today because at the end of it when we are dealing with large global organizations the like the city banks and the JPMC's of the the world or Walmarts of the world. I think there's a

lot of um process knowledge, organizational knowledge that's required. There's a lot of integration that's still required to their legacy systems. I don't think they're going

away still. So, I think the opportunity is to capitalize on these expertise and this um uh experience that we've built uh collectively, but to build upon that and then kind of build this kind of

agentic layer and and AI enablement through it. &gt;&gt; Right. So Asha's POV is you know we are shifting from general uh you know uh labor force to a more specialized you

know uh labor. So with your uh would love to get your comments also on the same question and how do you see the skilling impact uh with AI also coming into the

&gt;&gt; Sure I do think that over the last 25 years one of the biggest drivers of the movement of market share to Indian players has been on the back of better delivery competitiveness but that's not

the only one. Having said that, I think it will require significant reimagination. The good thing is that India is still a mini attacker in the space, right? India has hardly 20 25%

market share. It's a very large space. It's like a $1.8 trillion give or take, right? And if you add the full potential of R&amp;D outsourcing, BPM outsourcing, it will be running into a few more

trillions, right? So, we are still scratching the surface. There are like areas like analytics, there areas like RCM which is growing at 20% plus. While there would be some areas now the battle

will happen at the service line level there will be some areas like the usual traditional application support application maintenance which the lower-end work will get taken away by AI

and it's not something new uh it has been shipping away since the age of RPA since the age of automation but this is very fundamentally different to the extent that the biggest advantage was

people and here it's people plus agents which will do the work I think nature of work will shift into more of orchestration of work rather than doing the work or the coding uh themselves

which I think is a big shift. Uh I do believe that probably the pecking order might change. It's not like just because someone has been very successful over the last many years uh that gives you

the right to be equally successful going forward. So just like any other disruption tech disruption in particular right it will be advantage of an attacker it will be the advantage of

people who will move more faster more nimler probably the smaller players who are able to pivot faster because it does require a fair bit of change management on the provider side and as a also said

like enterprises are very large organizations it's not just about coding it's not just about systems it's a trust many of these players have built over a period of time they've been accountable

to certain business outcomes even if the contracting model was TNM But actually they were delivering some outcomes through technology that is not going to shift away and all said and done AI is

still a very much a point solution. you need someone to just orchestrate some of these solutions to have business impact and that's where you can harness the kind of skills that uh Indian ID

companies particularly have possessed over the many years just that they may not have fully harnessed that much of the work is still very resource based but I think this could be the pivotal

moment for us to reimagine and probably grab even more market share &gt;&gt; right so with this whole wave of agent AI uh Jadesh uh I think it's fair to say that India is no longer the cost uh you

know uh center of the world Right. And uh so just you know reflecting on your previous role at uh Tech Mahendra would love to you know get your inputs what service providers or you know IT firms

need to do to stay uh indispensable and uh what are those two or three uh structural shifts that you expect from Indian firms to take in the next uh you know two to three years to stay

competitive? &gt;&gt; Sure Chandria. Um firstly I think uh this whole labor arbitrage cost advantage thing is overstressed because um this is a market now open to all. You

see GCC's coming here. You see not just Indian um you know system integrators who started from here like the likes that I represented earlier but enough

international ones having bigger volume of people here. So the competitive landscape for us in the market is not driven by only Indian guys but it's also driven by a large number of people

taking advantage of the talent pool that's here. The question to ask is is this talent pool relevant for future. I think to me I think that's the big question and I'll be a little sort of

controversial here though I think um I I as I said I can't comment whether it'll you know there's been enough comments from anthropic CEO there's been a comment from the Microsoft CTO a few

days back um and there's been a comment from uh sorry &gt;&gt; IBM also or or all of these guys you know everyone said four years three years

five years I don't know how they do the math but it's difficult for me to predict whether it will be a number of years but it's really going to the whole model is going to turn upside down for

sure. Uh so businesses have to be ready to address it now without having a crystal ball which says it will happen in two years or 3 years but it will happen for sure and obviously like

anything else in business in automation like you know we talked about RPA etc. The lowest hanging fruits are the ones in the bottom of the pyramid which is in our IT services model. The large number

of labor force, the large number of people we hire from graduate engineering colleges and therefore we created so many engineering colleges in India. Those things are going to go through a

complete toss and I think it'll probably that model is not going to exist. I don't know when but definitely not too far away. Now the question to ask ourselves is that how do we prepare

ourselves to be still ready and be able to reate that's where I think you need to dig down a little deeper and say what was the core competency of a system integrator what did they bring to the

table like Aka said they brought in a lot of process and domain knowledge not just as process consultants but how one system talks to the other what does the financial system do what does a bank's

core banking system do what's a telecom company's billing system do and how does it work with each other is the core knowledge that we created. Yes, we needed programmers. So we are by the

millions of it that piece will definitely go away. I mean one of the things that in my company that we are doing is also trying to take away the fact that it'll not about taking people

out. It's about delivering the best value from the product and it'll automatically take the vagaries of human variability out of the discussion. So from my perspective, it'll be important

for two structural changes that to your question that uh IT companies need to do is to really open arm adopt the innovation culture of bringing in products inside their company. They

haven't got to be made by them. That's a big mind block for any technology company especially the Indian ones who think that why can't I do and that's where the biggest block is. I think

there is some structural change at the leadership that needs to be done. Again, from my vantage point at TechM, what happens is if you bring in someone with a group which is building products or

platform, this old management adage adise, does he get a seat on the center table? If he doesn't get a seat on the center table, then he's one lab experiment. that lab experiment will

remain a lab experiment will always be compared as how much revenue, how many billing hours, how much utilization and that's such a wrong metric for the new world. So that's the first structural

change. Second structural change is very clearly tell the market very clearly that we're going to redefine this business and the redefinition of the business is three years four years

journey. You can't suddenly take a 200,000 people company, 300,000 people company and say okay next year I'll be 100,000 but I'll deliver the revenue. So that telling the market very boldly that

you're going to transform and it is a time frame to do it and you'll put your money where your mouth is is the second structural change. &gt;&gt; I agree with your point of doing away

with you know traditional ways of benchmarking performance. What are those two three recommendations? Yeah, I think agree with all the points but uh the angle that I would want to take on this

and this is something that the services companies really need to accelerate. I think we've been talking about uh you know outcome based pricing and those kind of things taking responsibility for

business metrics of the clients. I think a lot of that has just been talk so far. I think at the fundamental level at the end of it we kind of uh revert back to the way we know this industry works we

you know we see that almost you know in every contract that we help clients with right uh we start off day one the client is extremely and the service provider is very clear that okay I'm going to try to

get some outcome based pricing but by the time it reaches the procurement cycle the service provider himself or itself does not push for it and reverts back to some existing models

This has been going on. The cycle has been going on for many years now. This is the point where that cycle needs to break because if it doesn't break, it'll have a fundamental impact on the entire

service provider industry at this point of time. So I think the big structural shift is taking more responsibility of business outcomes. It's always been a challenge in defining

outcomes. That's where it's typically stalls, right? How do you define an outcome? How do you agree between a service provider and the client on what is an outcome? What should be the value?

Now I think those problems need to be solved and that's the big structural shift. I think the second one kind of associated I think Jagdesh mentioned product based you know we've seen

situations where products are built by the service providers and only those products are taken to market and then under the pressure from the enterprises you don't charge for it you subsume it

under the services umbrella that's no longer the case I think you can't do it and to your point Jagish I think it's not just you have to be more secular about It it doesn't need to be your own

product that you've created. It can be the other products which are already making a mark in the market. Um and I think those are the big two structural changes that I think service providers

will have to push for. I don't know if it's 2 years, 3 years, but uh they will have to do it. &gt;&gt; So just changing the gears a bit you know speaking of workforce

transformation. Um so uh maybe a uh help me answer this that India's IT you know services sector they have banked a lot on the pyramid model which means large base hiring at the

bottom right now if with the help of AI co-pilots or digital agents you know a lot of that work is going to get subsumed you know by the software uh what does this new model look like now

uh and also Um I think IBM just uh everybody was using agentic AI. I think IBM started was the first one one of the first ones in the industry who said I'm going to reduce

the workforce by you know x%. And I think just 3 4 days ago uh they made a statement that they're going to hire more at the bottom of the pyramid the the gen z's they're going to increase it

by uh one/ird in the US. So uh is the industry coming back to its senses or what's going on? &gt;&gt; So I I think um as everybody said we we are in a time of profound change. It is

a what I would call a at least from an Indian IT perspective because it's been a big employment generator for us right from campuses. We've had an entire generation of uh engineering graduates.

It didn't matter whether they were civil engineers, mechanical engineers, they were all going into tech. So, so we've been we built this again huge 6 million plus workforce. Uh, so in some ways this

is a do or die moment for the Indian IT industry you know because um as again I think there's a couple of different vantage points I want to take. One is from a India as a country we obviously

need we have you know the highest population of youth going to colleges uh their skilling is a different you know question altogether but but they need jobs when they come

out of these engineering colleges and and other colleges and so on. So if the hiring starts to slow down, which it has, I think if you look at the tech services industry, we've not hired as

many people as we used to in in the recent years. Uh but we've continued to grow on the revenue side. So at least there is some decoupling happening, but it puts pressure on where will these

youth find, you know, employment opportunities and that has to uh be figured out whether it's in software, whether it's in manufacturing, whether it's in semiconductors. So I think

that's a whole different issue that we do need to solve. As far as I think the tech services companies themselves are concerned, uh you're right. I think it has been a pyramid model. So a big part

has to has been on how do we hire some of these entry- levelvel graduates, entry to mid-level graduates. uh train them these we've built a great training infrastructure across different

organizations and then deploy them deploy them on these projects and by by as a result of that keep also the costs uh pretty much in check we we do ongoing pyramid refresh redeployment move from

project to project and all of that uh clearly the entry-level tasks as we all see in our own day-to-day life you know you can do away with a lot of entry- level task by putting it into cloud chat

GPT or cloud work or or whatever. So there is that pressure which means that the mid-level managers or or seniors are able to get done a lot of I mean they're able to do a lot of work using these

platforms right so I was speaking to another founder at um uh of a SAS company uh about 50 to 60% of their uh code is now written through AI right so you don't need as many entry- level

engineers so it is to your point turning the pyramid model upside down it will create uh maybe a diamond shaped model but then very quickly I think what organizations who have started lowering

the the hiring at the entry of I mean the the base of the pyramid is also that when you have too many highly paid or moderately to highly paid mid-level managers that's also a pressure uh on

the cost point there and they will need to manage that also quite a bit so I think to that IBM there is I think some um maybe there is some coming back to census because they're they're feeling

that they can empower the the the lower to mid quite a bit and um and then I think the challenge will become because at India in India definitely we have a lot of this mid-level managers how do we

enable them to have that knowledge of enterprise and then leverage that to build agentic workflows or build you know um agentic software so that I think it's jury is still out again we're not

predicting any I think that's the consensus we're not predicting but there is a lot of pressure &gt;&gt; definely on that. &gt;&gt; So irrespective you know uh whether the

talent structure is a diamond you know or a pyramid uh that's you know for sure that the roles are going to get redefined right. So, so in your experience I mean uh what's your vision

for the next gen reskilling uh you know of the workforce what are those new jobs that could land in the market we already seeing the rise of you know agent take AI officers chief AI officers and so on

but that's you know at the top level but at the bottom level also we have geni consultants agent tech AI ethics engineers and so on so what's your take on that

&gt;&gt; no clearly I think uh because uh agent is not the full solution you need agent plus humans uh what will become more and more important would be like some of those

back to basic skills like problem solving, creativity, asking the right questions but for that matter like coding is probably only 20% of the work which Indian IT companies for that

matter any IT company does a lot of the work goes into actually understanding the requirement understanding the the like what will it take to create that impact in the context of the business of

course uh it's a collaboration between the client and and the provider it's not one way or the other uh but some of those skills will probably become more and more important domain skills for

that matter right So probably the value will get created at the intersection of domain and technology. uh now the challenge is the domain knowledge might be more for people who have been there

done that seen the B2B landscape the intricacies of the other systems because systems are not in isolation whereas many of the genes for example might be much better in wipe coding because

that's the only thing that they have learned while in the third year fourth year and that's it's just a very new thing and for someone who is in the mid-level right like for him or her they

will have to unlearn a lot of what they have learned earlier having said that even VIP coding requires a fair bit of like code review you require a fair bit of supervision because you can't just

let that go to production even if that code goes to production once things fail and things do fail in IT services there are lots of bugs then you'll not be able to find out like what really went wrong

right so I think uh the team structures would change uh there'll be I'm seeing across clients some clients are going after retraining at scale rethinking uh like uh scaling in a big way one of our

clients are putting like not just the carrots but stick like you'll have 40 to 50% % weightage on performance management based on how well you have done on on on capability building. Why?

Because uh if you don't do it right like my cost structures will keep going up and there's only so much hiring we could do because those skills don't exist. you have to build those skills internally

and uh the best thing to do that is to like reskill talent at scale but I would agree that it's a it's a bit of a variable out there right like not everyone is as aggressively pushing this

agenda as it is right there are some companies like Accenture they have even talked about reinvention of services they've reorg complete structure they're thinking about the roles of the future

uh I I'm seeing across companies people are rethinking on the future of services the future of delivery given that delivery will be a lot more probably platformled and there's only pockets of

work which you'll do more around orchestration system thinking design and so on. Uh so it remains to be seen but uh if I were a Gen Z it's not like I'll be overtly worried there's still demand

it's not like uh many of them might end up starting up and they could beat some of these incumbents because the startups do have an advantage because they don't have a legacy to fall back on. there's

like a whole uh host of you know newer technologies coming into the market neuro techch quantum technology space tech robotics and so on so I think there's going to be place for uh

everyone I guess um so I have some stats for you uh Jatish so um roughly 58 to 60 million workers in India digitally skilled yet the country needs to train an additional 30 million in advanced

technologies by you know the end of 2026 so we are quite behind uh and at the same time you know we spoke about the AI disruption uh the disruption cycles are I think 3 to 5x much faster than

previous uh tech shifts. So given this scale and speed uh can India actually rescale the architecture uh to keep pace with AI disruption and uh how would you recommend India to go about it? So

firstly I want to take on the first point. You talked about the IBM comment because it's been floating around. Um um but I can just draw some two two sort of very different shades. And the second

one that I'm going to talk about is a real life example of a classmate of mine who's been one of the top first 30 guys in uh Facebook or now Meta. And I was chatting with him about what they're

doing about AI as uh boring computer science people do nothing else to talk about. Um so he was saying that the guideline in meta for their teams is to do what they did in something that they

took 6 months to do it in six weeks and that's not where it stops with half the people and some teams are delivering it. So that's for real. It's happening. So we need to worry about the fact that if

this is the speed at which technology is changing will these skills be relevant at all. So to the point about your reskilling problem is way bigger than the numbers itself because some people

have sort of in bravado said that uh we did it during Y2K. That's a very different ballgame. The thing changing in AI is at a speed which is not quant quantifiable by some of us have been

here. I know Lata and others who've been here during Y2K know what does a Y2K do and it was very very basic. It's really pardon my French but it's lower than BO work. So the the that's the work that we

did. So that skilling has got nothing to do with the need of the skilling for AI and that skilling was helped because we had volume. Here the skilling will need to change drastically because we will

need to train people more on how to leverage these new tools. So to the answer that I think uh you were making about the skilling of the people, it's very important for us to pick up those

engineers who are very conversant with using these tools rather than the fresh ones. So the Z Gen Z ones that have not equipped themselves with all the coding tools and the ability to do VIP coding

or whatever else that they coming across the new technologies are the ones that will succeed. the ones that are still following the old methodology will fail. So for us as India the biggest challenge

and the biggest probably and therefore the solution is that we've got to convert our academic institutions from very kind of now outdated models of training people and educating people to

actual co-op programs and programs in which they are delivering projects. jobs will not be created by large companies but by companies creating small startups and individuals that will create it. But

two things I think we can look at uh positively that like you said x million 30 million digitally trained people and how do we take them to tier 2 tier three and below to the districts and convert

that into language based training which is available in those markets using platforms like bhashini or something like that will help us drive a larger pace of skilling still the skilling

seems to be remembered in tier one and tier two that's the problem that we need to So um want to take a maybe slightly different

view on this right I think uh whose responsibility is it to train someone right that responsibility increasingly cannot be outsourced to academic institutions and all of that at

this point of time u I don't think we'll ever be now the speed at which technologies are emerging Unless the individuals themselves are driven as S also mentioned right the skills this is

not a skilling of technology anymore it is a skilling of can you quickly learn the new technology apply it move forward on that right so the responsibility of that skilling kind of moves to the

individual a little bit more than it was I think in the past 20 years it's sort of become you know Infosys is a big mysore campus where you know I will not go in with any kind of pre-work but they

will train me enough so that I'm ready for the market. I don't think that's going to fly anymore. Right? So that's why I I don't want to externalize the problem that this is the government's

problem or the uh or the academic institutions problem. Yes, I agree the challenge is that industry, academia and government need to come together and create some skilling programs. Yes, they

will have to continue to do that. But here it is more about uh the horse will have to go to the well to try to dig the drink the water from it. And it has to become you know we have to identify

those horses faster and in more effective manner than the kind of entrance tests and all of those environments that we currently do. So hackathons you know multiple other kind

of uh environments are they going to become more important I believe as the structural foundations of the training mechanism rather than in school in college in in classroom kind of a

training environment and that's a completely different mindset there is one technology that we have which can help with that and that's AI so basically the AI is the villain here as

well and potentially the uh the hero as well, right? So, we have to figure out those mechanisms of choosing the right people, then giving them the the weapons, the inputs, the AI tools to

help them accelerate that journey for themselves and then be tested on those rather than old school metrics. So, I think that's my view only. So um now just you know again jumping

back to a different theme sovereign AI which uh has and is going to be discussed a lot during this summit. So just want to get you know everyone's perspective. Uh maybe a uh so US is

primarily focusing a lot on private capital. Uh they're trying to lead uh the race for frontier you know uh LLMs. China is uh fine-tuning those AI models uh to comply with state policy,

industrial policy and so on. Uh Europe is more focused on the regulatory side, right? India has taken a stand on multilingual AI more on the inclusion uh digital public you know infrastructure

uh side of things. So u are we in the race? Are we winning the race? Is this a more differentiated approach that India has taken or are we going to get left behind where you know AI is more

dominated by private capital and geopolitical influence? &gt;&gt; So I think so I think there is u there's no option. I think we have to be in the race.

Thank you. So I think there's no no two options about it. I mean we have to be in the race. We have to be I think honorable minister also said it. I think a few weeks ago uh that along with the

US and China who are already the two front leaders in AI and then also in quantum and some of the other emerging tech India has to be the third alternative right and and I think a big

part of this is this AI impact summit where a lot of participants from global south and so on are there um we have to play to your point on our strengths um we've not uh just poured a lot of money

down which may not be anyways the effective strategy on creating some of these frontier LLMs and and so on with the large GPU clusters and so on. So what's our strength? Our strength is

like you said I think you also mentioned is the the the multilingual aspect of it. I mean the amount of lingu uh linguistic diversity that we have in this country. We do need to we do need

AI to solve some of those challenges from a inclusion standpoint from a uh bringing everybody online perspective. Um we have a fairly large population. US does not have that that issue. China of

course has a big large population. So I think um India definitely has to continue to up the investment to to be a formidable force when it comes to AI at at kind of all the multiple layers of AI

whether it's on the application layer whether it's on the services whether it's on chips and all of that. Um and and I I think I'm going to dubtail back to Jagish's point and Swap's point. A

lot of it goes back to taking the risk takingaking mindset that needs to happen both at the organizational level private sector organizations as well as the individual level right you have to take

control of your own destiny in terms of you know taking something your example of if I'm a college student going student today I do need to take charge of what I want to do and what I want to

learn because as a lot of people are saying and I I do agree that you know the the day is not far where a five 10 people is a billion dollar in revenue or multi multi-billion dollar in in in

revenue in valuation. So I think a lot of risk takingaking both at an individual level as well as a private sector organization level. I think government is doing its part in terms of

uh allocating some funds from a deep tech perspective uh R&amp;D credits and all of that perspective but we do need to um have that mindset to create and invest into products and products not just for

India but from India for the world as well. Um I I do think it's a little bit of a winner take all market when it comes to the large language models because the

kind of capex which is required they may not even pay for through revenue. So probably that may be out of bounds for us to a great extent but I think the value will get created at the

intersection of domain and technology and probably for specific problems right for example even in our company in prism force we have built uh a small language model primly for skills and we can beat

any of the GPTs out there because they are very generic. So we have to pick our battles right there could be a like an portfolio of small language models which we built where we probably have the data

the expertise intent and then we try and monetize that because ultimately money will get made uh on the back of B2B workflows on the back of B2B uh like uh solutions and that's where organizations

will pay money and therefore you would see a lot of the open AIs and anthropics of the world are now trying to get into this FDLE model of consulting or quote unquote services so that they can

actually create some impact at the B2 B2B company level because consumer will only pay so much right so ultimately it's the B2Bs who will be paying it right uh having said that like I do

think that uh the the the match is still open right you would see the Chinese players without a lot of investments have been able to create uh like models even today

the most used open source models are the Chinese models not the not the US models for that matter right so with more progress of science right who knows right maybe someone from India uh can

build the next most used models right without a lot of capex. &gt;&gt; Surfum for instance &gt;&gt; surfum is already doing that in in the multilingual case they are doing some

scale pilots with banks and so on at a much cheaper cost than what the other uh 11 labs of the world are doing. &gt;&gt; So JK more stats for you. India has seeded over 20 billion in AI

commitments uh by late 2025 uh and it spans over you know the sovereign compute uh application layer foundational models uh talent data pipelines and so on. So with this scale

of investment what measurable outcome would define success for us by 2030 and uh I mean is it contribution to GDP number of foundation models like how do we actually put you know an a KPI around

it. See the most fundamental one u which is again going back to this friend of mine. Uh the question to him was when he was debating this about impact of AI is how is AI changing the outcomes in your

company? Is it helping you increase your profitability and what has changed over a number of quarters and how is it helped you drive revenue forward for you using AI? Same has to be for a sovereign

investment as well. So we have to look at it and say has it actually changed the overall GDP volume. I don't know there's some number being floeded about contribution from AI to be about 1.7

trillion um coming from all the AI work that happens in India. That's got to be the best and this absolutely the right measure first of all. Second discussion that we should probably have is what did

it do in terms of creating us to be making more globally competitive companies whether it's in manufacturing whether it's in retail whether it's in banking because this is our biggest

chance um you know we don't need big infrastructure investments in terms of physical infrastructure we don't need big brand deployment investments that other brands have done when they have

created global brands in the space of manufacturing or retail scale or whatever else. Now, if you leverage AI to its hold, whether it's 3D manufacturing or whether it's analytics

to be done well and digital marketing to be done well, you could leapfrog. And so, what we should measure is how many global brands did we create and how do you measure global brands? I think it

should hold good for I have a very big view on this whole celebration about startups which is great in India and I think we've done a brilliant job but you know no disrespect to the zumatoss and

the swiggies of the world but uh they are only creating revenue in India I we need to look at companies which are creating what thankfully I know lot of comma and your question started from it

labor arbitrage and stuff like that for IT services but the IT services companies brought brought in humongous amount of foreign exchange inside the company. I think the challenge for us

will be to allow those deep tech companies to be created in India whose 50% of the business comes from outside India. Look at Google's look at the Microsofts of the world. Look at IBM's

of the world. They generate more than 50% of their revenue outside America. How do we create? That should be a very critical measure of our deep tech startup mission. saying how many such

companies did we create of India that are relevant globally everything seems to have been covered here but I think I'm agree with everything

you've said and and I think the idea about uh global companies starting from India I think that's that's a great measure I think uh for success but I do want to look at the other side of it

right Um and I know I spoke in the previous response about responsibility going to the people and all of that but then um we do have the largest young population in the country which needs to

be channelized properly. I don't have a metric at this point of time but any new technology at least in our perspective that comes in needs to have some way of impacting this pool of uh young energy

that is there in the country which could very easily take the entire nation in either of those two directions you know positive or negative. So while all of the uh profitability, the revenue, the

import of uh foreign exchange, all of those are great metrics, we will have to have some element or some metric that also looks at how we're engaging or creating opportunities for at at scale.

Unfortunately, we do need to build some of these things at scale as well like the IT companies did in the last couple of decades. Uh yes, this technology is going to most likely shrink some of

those workforces but what are the alternate work forces or opportunities that are going to emerge in the next 5 10 years. I think that is very important as a nation for us. Um so that would be

but again I agree with everything the panel has said so far. &gt;&gt; If I could just in to that point and to Jagish your point we do need u globally comparative

globally relevant you know spaces. um advanced tech broadly has to be one of those because of just not just from a employment export perspective but just from a sovereignity perspective and

geopolitical issues that briefly we talked about. So um I think the um one of the areas I think the green shoots that at least we have is kind of this entire space tech

program that we've had in India. It is one of the globally competitive ones. you you see private satellite operators you know whether they're in Europe or in the US they're leveraging ISRO and other

facilities here to to do these u uh you know satellite launches so the lowest cost player is not SpaceX but it is in India right so there is something to be done said about the frugal engineering

part of it but then also it is globally relevant and it is you know one of those globally competitive industries &gt;&gt; so uh one closing question you know to all of

uh I mean India's growth story has uh you know often hinged on timing. we did so well when it came to IT services and so on and we also know the cost of not jumping at the right time uh in a

technology like we're making up for quantum and you know uh other things now so uh so as we ride on this AI wave what is that one capability or a technology that

India needs to double down on uh in your opinion I I'll quick one I think just to build on what I said earlier. I think the entire advanced tech deep tech space u

from a entire deep tech advanced tech space for India I think is super important. So whether it's building from tech to tech products to engineering services to areas like uh I mean broader

more broadly in AI uh space quantum robotics I think we've not even touched about you know the entire robotics &gt;&gt; you have to pick one &gt;&gt; I mean I I would put it under uh the

entire uh advanced tech bucket &gt;&gt; I actually believe in doubling down on strength it should be I based applications because that's where the money will come from and I am very very

uh bullish that we will capture this market. &gt;&gt; Any specific types? I see a lot of focus on agriculture in today's events. Uh any specific

&gt;&gt; but that's like hardly 5% of the global GDP. It has to be on like all the big sectors out there whether it's BFSI, healthcare and so on like it should mirror the IT services. uh if you look

at the tech services sector composition it's all the large sectors but just that now it'll be more around rearchitecting old system because remember like we have spent like probably one and a half$2

trillion dollars every year for the last 20 years so there's a huge tech debt out there who will create the AI versions of that right it's up to us &gt;&gt; yeah I I think uh for us it will be

important to focus primarily on our ability to be able to create that skill base which converts these business processes and applies AI to them using the tools because we started the

conversation from there. We have a huge understanding of the business process. If we create that domain skill within this faster that how do we transform these businesses to the world of AI is

where the capability lies with us and that's what we need to build &gt;&gt; but I think skill development is not the biggest problem. skill retention is how do we you know work upon that

&gt;&gt; from our perspective I think uh if you create all the three parts of what we talk about in the summit in the sense uh creating the infrastructure creating the relevant um guard rails and the large

language models that we said the sovereign AI will do you don't have to worry about um talent going out because talent will come to where the quality of work is and the quality of work will be

here if you build those things together. &gt;&gt; I'd like to differ. There's a lot of uh because of you know bureaucracy uh low pay grade. I've seen a lot of folks in quantum migrating to China and

elsewhere. I mean firsthand I've heard it from you know uh people building quantum computers the professors and so on. So but maybe that could be just a very text specific uh aspect.

&gt;&gt; Yeah. So um so to me I mean if you look at it AI requ and again we've discussed a little bit about how capital intensive AI is at this point of time. So for me amongst the technologies that you listed

down or the areas that you listed down quantum computing has the is the key to actually reduce the capex requirements for AI significantly on the compute side and things like so maybe that's one area

that could give us that leaprogging uh you know it's a it's a foundational element for AI it's a foundational element for a lot of space tech so I think if we can leaprog on that and you

know the example that you took of people moving to another country. It's obviously not a good one for us. But to me, I think something that can be an accelerator across the board across AI,

space tech, and all the other deep tech areas that we're looking at, I think it's going to be quantum. Hopefully, we'll start seeing some uh real world applications outside of cyber security

pretty soon. &gt;&gt; So, basically nextgen computing, quantum, and &gt;&gt; that's right, &gt;&gt; neuromorphic computing and so on. Yeah.

Okay. Uh so, I hope you had uh you know good uh insights across uh you know we touched a lot on workforce development, software development, what in AI beyond AI. So uh I hope you found this

conversation meaningful. Thank you everyone. &gt;&gt; Uh can we take do we have time? We have five minutes. Uh we can take a question. &gt;&gt; Uh so we talked about a lot of things

but uh generally like when we talk about A in general like cost is one of the important factors right like uh I was reading an article today morning that cursor had done like a vague statement

that uh build a browser for me and the model ran for a week and it was able to build a browser for us. Now for building that browser it took around a million sorry trillion tokens and the overall

cost of that particular project itself is around like $14 million at least in terms of opening token cost. Now uh let's assume people start using all these models again the cost factor

will come into play like when you talk from uh workforce management point of view when you talk from business point of view uh if cla or open starts to charge us more obviously

all the cost for developing a single project will kind of grow a lot right so how do we think of all those things like how do like what is the right kind of investment that we have to make in order

balance the profits and uh like uh balance the usage of the right technology. Uh maybe I can I can start it's a very relevant point we are living through it

to be honest like unlike SAS right where the marginal cost is very low relatively low gross margins can be as high as 70 80%. If you just use AI just because of the token cost the gross margins can be

even negative right the way pricing is happening right now having and and the other angle is if you if you start to build something in agentic AI the first model that we'll use which is very cheap

right uh but that will not give the right answer there'll be a lot of alphabet errors and and you'll have to just go for the improved model they're like 40 50 times costlier than the other

model but everyone is betting that uh with more and more usage there'll be scale and that will lead to reduction in cost right so that's the big hope there's still hope. Having said that, we

saw that in cloud as well and you can add right like with two three only players which are the dominant players they started increasing cost so you have to also not just be completely dependent

on agent KI or for that matter using LLMs because once there's a like there's a concentration of market share with three four players getting to 90%. there is a good chance because they have to

recover the investments even today the kind of investments which is going in there's no line of sight to even 10% IRR so there's a matter of time before those cost goes up so you have to use uh like

it very judiciously and I think if I could just add so if I can just add to it um clearly see there was even two three years ago u AI was the cure to everything right so

you start burning through the tokens the cost goes through the roof Right? What this tells you is a few things. One, just burning tokens is not the solution to every single problem that exists. So

you have to be very clear on where that dollar investment needs to go in and what the ROI is to S's point, right? Because that ROI will not be there in everything as of today. One bet is that

the cost of these tokens and compute and inference and all of that will start to go down, right? And there's a few different layers to it. One is of course from the entire investment that's going

into the GPUs and so on and starts to pay off. The second which we briefly touched upon is uh a lot of focus on the open source models right I think that's where also a lot of opportunity for

India is and China is putting out a lot of open source models and does that start to lower your cost of you know models and and using the tokens and so on so forth so I think there is there is

that opportunity from an India perspective that can we be you know even more frugal and kind of mindful on what the cost part of it Good evening panel. My name is Vinnie

and uh as we have seen here sir has mentioned that uh in meta there uh the expectation of building something which usually used to take 6 months has been reduced to 6 weeks. So we are building

artificial timelines and we are building artificial rays. So the two questions that I want to ask is that first of all the placeholders which were initially or traditionally used to be occupied by

humans or people will be completely replaced by AI. The second question is that are we heading towards a systems of system collapse. So because there are so many systems that are developing we are

also building a system that will be integrated that will integrate all of it and work with each other. So are we heading towards that? Thank you. So I think um as far as timelines and

the jobs that our humans used to do and um agents will pick up um that's definitely a trend that's a reality but 100% like we said is not going to be there because there's a certain amount

of design element and there's a certain amount of process knowledge that automatically comes from the uh from the human side of experience. So yeah, so even to the point about the coders not

getting hired, I think Aki made the point that slowly and slowly the question is to be asked saying who will they replace. We had automatically thought that the lowest of the pyramid

will go but it's not maybe the case. The lowest of the pyramid could be smarter by using a set of tools and be more smarter than the middle level. So some disruption is bound to happen but it

shouldn't be taken for granted that the entry level ones will go. That's your first question. For the second one, it's you know, I think system of systems or not, the book of records concept will go

away. the whole store of records and book of records to be the farthest and the base of doing everything will probably go away because you'll be so dynamic and the agents will be able to

pick up that information from different stores and depending on what you're trying to drive in a CRM application or anything of that nature understand your customer that whole store concept of

keeping that records will probably go away. &gt;&gt; Thank you everyone. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you.
