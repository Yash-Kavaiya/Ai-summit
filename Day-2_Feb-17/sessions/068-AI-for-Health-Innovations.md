## 📝 Transcript

attention. You can expand number of human beings by expanding space. Space is one. You can expand uh life of each human which is health which is very important. And you can expand the

attention span of each human which is AI. You can replicate yourself and have it. So these are the three frontiers of progress beyond what we live every day. Space, health and AI. And this session

is about uh two of those three frontiers. So it will be very exciting. Let me start by uh inviting SEP to give us a deep background on BFI and the the mission BFI is on and then we'll start

with the session. &gt;&gt; Uh yes, looks like this is working. Um so uh hi everyone I'm uh SEP I am uh the uh generally known to be the founder of uh Polygon which is the um the one of

the one of the bigger uh deep tech uh you know companies from India uh globally um it is generally considered one of the top five uh blockchains across the globe and uh in 2021

I uh during the COVID uh delta wave I uh launched this uh you know fund to help uh India during the COVID wave and uh I just simply tweeted uh you know that I'm going to um you know raise some funds

for this um and contribute my own to help India. Uh and at that time that that fund became uh really really big. it eventually became uh around uh I think $500 million which is like 5,000

crores. So it became really really big and we did a lot of uh activities like a lot of like you know emergency relief uh activity in India at that point in time um you know a lot of people know that uh

when the when India finally started the vaccine campaign uh we had the vaccines but we we did not have the syringes. So we uh this is one of the many many many projects we undertook. So we worked with

uh UNICEF uh to procure around uh around 16 cr syringes for Indians. So you can imagine that at that time in the first uh two waves if India vaccinated around uh 30 35 crores individuals in India uh

one in every three individuals was actually vaccinated using the syringes donated by us. So that uh was what the you know the scale of uh uh BFI became uh but then we moved uh BFI uh we

realized that we are doing a lot of this you know short-term emergency relief but once the COVID waved uh wave subsided we decided that we want to uh focus the BFI funds um on the long-term impact on

India on the ground especially in the healthcare and that's where We uh started pushing our efforts towards the uh you know the upstream research which which uh we call like you know the

things where uh where the researchers can build new products indigenous products and uh indigenous uh you know kind of innovations in India which can actually have a long-standing impact uh

for for public health in India. And so right now we are working with uh literally every large u healthcare institute whether it's as or like multitude of hospitals ICMR government

bodies everybody like even the PMO uh and ANRF we we work uh now and uh we work closely with now and and we basically has we have a very uh you know uh long pipeline which includes which we

you know recent uh Yesterday only we actually unveiled in IIT Delhi which is the program that we called innovation full stack right and uh that basically includes for the healthcare and medtech

startups because they have to unlike the software startups you build a software and it's live and then people are using it for healthcare startups it takes it takes a long journey from

technical uh TRL like technical readiness levels one to you know eight which is like a two to three year journey from clinical trials as to you know for building prototypes and

whatnot. So we build like a whole pipeline of uh of helping bodies in this include you know by uh getting help from ICMRs and IITs and all these large institutions. So literally for a medtech

startup from going uh you know non-software startups I'm talking about from going uh from actually thinking about the product to actually delivering the product uh you know the in in the

entire journey there are like five or six touch points where BFI is actively helping and our goal is and me being from a software journey like yesterday I was talking with Dr. Goro who's the CEO

of BFI that you know why is in India there are like so many large foundations and government puts in so much money and and all that why nobody is thinking from this angle and I think like that uh

comes from the fact that you know me and like some of the other team members you know we come from a very heavy startup background and we have seen firsthand whether it's in the Silicon Valley or in

India also that what kind of impact startups can deliver actually like you know I strongly now believe uh after doing a lot of philanthropic activities that uh you know at the end if you are

choosing if you are chasing from the impact only versus you are chasing for some commercial outcome and then deliver the impact I think that actually works much better 99% of the times so I

encourage startups to pursue their commercial dreams and when they win big then give it back to the back to the society and in healthcare if they win big they the But the impact is

automatically coming on the on the ground. So that is where we are doing and uh that is what we are doing and we have like till now we have around I think 45 50 top tier researchers all

across India from these large you know like the top tier institutes from IITs as uh who are funded. Uh then we have around 55 startups. Right now we have we are funded uh in in various stages they

are these startups are and uh um and and and now we are actually building for the healthcare startups where they lack very heavily which is the sales and distribution pipeline where like you

know kind of advisory that how they they should go and uh put these products to the market that is also we building. These are some of the high level uh you know activities of uh BFI and uh we will

continue to do that and you know out of the 54 startups that we have around I think 15 16 are uh AI startups also. So we will continuously be uh doing a lot of funding in the startup space also uh

as well as like you know working with large institutions in India to bring this innovation actually on the ground like not only the patents but patents to the actual product in the market uh and

we'll keep doing that and AI is obviously going to be a very uh deep focus on that. So you know I hope the panel uh you know touches some of these uh point of views today.

&gt;&gt; Okay. So thank I think you can keep sitting. Looks like there's a screen. Uh so let's get started with the panel. The goal is to uh this very interesting set of panelists and I would request them to

introduce themselves when they start. Uh the goal of this panel is to discuss broadly the impact of AI in health. Sounds like a boring topic but I am uh I'm very sure with the panelists around

this topic will become interesting. So let me start with uh Karthik sir. So let's start by thinking about this big disruption is happening right now. It has deep socio technical implications.

So you as a policy maker for health and broadly what do you think what are the steps that you are looking at? How how should we as policy makers rethink our health design and and sort of how health

is delivered to our citizens and how research is done in it. &gt;&gt; Uh thank you. Thank you so much for having me. Uh I'll probably get up just because I have colleagues sitting back.

&gt;&gt; Sorry you should introduce yourself first. Yes, I will. I will. Uh, so my name is Karthik. I I'm the regional adviser for digital health and AI at the World Health Organization. Uh, because

you wanted me to introduce and because a very exciting panel here. So I started off as a medical doctor trained in India. Uh, then worked for the IAS. I was I belong to the Punjab Carter. did

more public health and more governance work in Punjab and then went to the US to get trained in computer science where I did my PhD in health informatics trying to build AI systems that are safe

uh that improve outcomes in treatment planning systems in radiation oncology. I continue to be a faculty at the Yale School of Medicine and the University of North Carolina and just recently joined

as faculty at Oxford and then came back to India and in Punjab as secretary health and secretary IT uh did the first ever large-scale population level deployment of an AI machine learning

tool to to screen for breast cancer at the entire state level which is essentially a nature published study. So not only do I do research based in the US and UK but I do large scale

implementations in in India and now in my current role as as in who as a regional adviser I essentially do what is more of policy and building advocacy on how do we use AI at scale for India.

So one of the key things that we've done and I'm very grateful that we have Mr. SEP and BFI which is essentially supporting this effort is when you want to construct a house the first thing

that you focus is building the foundations. So if you want to use AI in in health the again the focus has to be foundations and very often when we want to build tools we always get very

excited about those shiny beautiful glamorous tools and not really focus on those foundational guardrails and the foundations that are needed for AI and health. Now what Mr. SEP talked about

and what we see ac across academic institutions in India and more importantly for startups is if you want to do anything in AI the fuel is data right now data the biggest problem in

India is you have so much of data but large parts of this data is not even usable for AI machine learning models so the first thing therefore is AI for AI in health the the most important thing

is data so the data and digital systems that you have in India are one fragment mented and then frugal. So for example a country like the UK which has a bio bank of about 700,000 patients has given

about seven Nobel prizes over one biioank and seeing the UK biio bank the US has built a bio bank which is a large bio bank Japan South Korea of all built bio banks but if you look into entire

Southeast Asia not just India alone our bio banks are extremely fragmented they're so frugal and therefore when you want to look into data that is both genomic data, environmental data, health

data and EHR systems, you really don't have longitudinal electronic records. So the good thing that we've done essentially in the government is through Aayish Manbara digital mission today,

we've laid the foundation that you need to ensure that we can build the longitudinal electronic records. So you have the DPI, the digital public goods in terms of Aadhaar which is now ABA as

a health ID. You also have the digital public infrastructure that is specific to healthcare like the UHIs that have been built. We have the national health claims exchange. Now while these

foundations are essential, they're not enough for us to see healthcare and more AI in health. So very often what happens is for a startup ecosystem to thrive in health the first thing is going to be

data and for that globally we have standards like OMOP standards like fire which will ensure that data is truly interoperable data is available across the ecosystem. So as what we do is we

kind of promote these standards to be adopted and India is is essentially taken over about 48 standards. The second thing that we do is if we really want AI and health to grow the

government needs to have a strategy for AI and health and this is essentially going to be launched. So India is going to be the first country in the global south to have a strategy on AI and

health and across entire of global south. It's only US, France and UK and two other European countries which today have a sector specific AI strategy in health. But over the past six months

with the government, the World Health Organization is now launching the strategy for AI and health. So right here in the conference today at 4:30 in auditorium 1, the Union Health Ministry

is essentially going to launch the strategy. So what is going to be therefore important is if you want AI in health to thrive, if you want to do pilots, if you want to do blue sky

research projects, we now we need data. We also need the governance guardrails essentially for both regulating tools as well as to ensure that every tool that is used for patients is one safe for

every user. So I would want to be very sure that every AI tool that goes to the clinic and is used on us is one safe. It is ethically developed. It is equitable as well. So we have those governing

principles as a part of the policy document. And more importantly, if we really want to do research, what we need is the strengthening of the institutional review boards. And we need

to be able to generate a lot of evidence from every research that we do. And very often what we've seen both in digital health and now in AI is this problem of pilotitis. There's so many pilots that

happen, but essentially everything that is that works well in research does not well work well in the in a clinical environment. and it works in the clinical environment. How do you really

deploy them at scale at the population level? So the science of scaling from the research from the lab to the bedside and from bedside to the population level is an evolving science and that is where

I think who and and the government is essentially keen and so we have the policy guardrails to help a startup ecosystem right from getting access to data have adequate governance guardrails

so that every tool is safe to the user and then we generate evidence through these network of collaborating centers, research institutions, generate that evidence and then scale them at purpose,

scale them at the population level. So we now can be proud that India is going to have a strategy document but which will give all these important guard rails that we'll need right from data to

scale but what is now going to be important is to implement the strategy and that is what the government is inclined in and so as policy makers our essential role is to ensure that we

create an ecosystem that will allow researchers startup ecosystem government and more importantly people who derive benefit from this eosystem system development. So one of the key pillars

that we have in the strategy is to ensure that we have made in India models, made in India applications and built for scale and for purpose to reach health for all goals for the country. So

I would also use this opportunity to invite you for the launch at 4:30 and more importantly participate in ensuring that the strategy also gets implemented eventually. So thank you so much for

that opportunity. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Great. Right. So, so basically from policymaker side a great strategy document data and then tools and guard rails and to enable

and ensure safe development. That's what I'll just summarize that in one go. Uh three of the five panelists here have been uh medical doctors then researchers and then managers in sense of either

CEOs or or uh or startup guys or uh policy makers and all kind of capability. So which tells you what the life of a doctor of a future would look like. These are doctors from futures

that we have here sitting in present and on that note I would like to bring in AJ to talk about first please introduce yourself. Uh and then talk about how do you see doctors adopting AI in hospitals

for diagnosis. Uh personally I have found doctors being very reluctant when you give them any external source of authority when my experience in doctors have been like that including from

Google search days. But now I don't only have Google search. I have a doctor sitting with me when I go to a doctor which is chat GPT. I'm sure it is irritating the hell out of everybody. I

want to know your perspective on how how you see doctors adopting that going forward. &gt;&gt; Sure. So can you is it audible? Yeah. Thank you. So uh uh as an introduction I

trained as a neurosurgeon few decades ago. Uh and uh then I I was a neuroscientist doing stem cell research in the US for a few years. uh then veered into management. I was a Mckenzie

uh consultant in the US and Middle East for five six years and then I came back to India and was you know fortunate to run three large hospital chains. I was a CEO of Max uh between 2011 and 14 and

then Manipal Hospitals and a small stint with IH hospitals in India as well. Uh but my passion has always been technology. So for the last six years to your point Himmanu I've been a that

doctor who dabbling in technology. So I've been building AI companies for the last uh since 2019 actually. Uh it's been a while. Uh so I have observed to answer come to your question. I've

observed this space over the last 30 years evolving quite dramatically and uh one of the myths that is propagated is that doctors don't like technology. I used to be told this when I was a CEO

that oh doctors don't like technology. But the reality is the doctors are perfectly comfortable with a you know $20 million radiation equipment. They are perfectly comfortable with very

high-tech MRIs and interpreting what a proton spin looks like and what it means for their patients. But when it comes to it uh the problem is it has never solved any doctor's problem ever. Uh so so

there's a lot of skepticism in the doctor's mind in India and in the US where also I worked all over the world that you guys build things and then you ask us to use them and they don't give

us any benefits. So so there's a lot of skepticism. &gt;&gt; Well played. Well played. But now uh we are seeing a very interesting uh trend that is uh I'm observing in doctors

especially in the US who are very highly regulated who are very worried about medical legal risks of using AI and what they are seeing is that their patients are walking into the room very well

informed probably more so than themselves. So in fact one of the and and one thing is very clear that doctors using AI for diagnosis or treatment is going to be a very long journey because

the you will have a very high burden of proving safety and efficacy. There is no way of getting around it and USFDA has a nice framework to sort of prove that your AI algorithm is safe and effective

but it costs just like a pharma drug it cost a lot of money and you need to take over a lot of risk. Uh what people like uh open AI and claude etc have done is they have just made their general models

also very smart on healthcare information. So they are not subject to the same risk that a doctor would be if he was to or or a AI company like mine would be if we were to say oh I can

diagnose tuberculosis better for you I can diagnose uh cancer better for you. Now don't get me wrong there are companies that are doing that and there there is a large uh body of innovation

happening in faster diagnostics better therapeutics but to my mind that's at least 3 to 5 years out before it becomes full-time adopted. So uh to come back to your question of what doctors are doing

today is that &gt;&gt; context of the AI. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So they are using it informally. Uh they are informing themselves better that okay if this is I'm a neurosurgeon

I've not seen an eye injury for a long time. I can ask Chad Gibb and it'll give me a pretty good answer right and then I can call my opthalmology colleague and do whatever is needed for the patient in

a in a much better way. So the productivity of the doctor does go up. However, I think if we are only thinking about AI as a chat GPT or a chat bot, we are making a big mistake because what

has happened in the last two months, I think those of you who are in the AI space are watching a person like And Karpathi saying that he's gone from writing 80% of code in first week of

December to now writing 10% of the code in the last week of January. there's a dramatic shift because of the rise of the agents if we may call that in a in a in a positive way. Now what that does is

uh I I'll give you a real illustration. A non-coding person like me uh can create an personalized app for an autistic child. one of my friend's daughter he just gave me all her reports

and I could feed that to cloud code and work with clot code to create a personalized app for her using her hyper lexicality and her hyper musicicality and her weakness with mathematics. So

I'm using that an illustration to say that very soon it is possible to have uh 7 billion agents who are taking care of your health for you for the cost of a couple of hundred for uh in a time span

of 5 to 7 days. This was not possible. I mean if if I was to build an app for myself 6 months ago, it will cost a few tens of thousand dollars and it won't be good at all because it'll be a static uh

machine, right? So imagine a world where you have a a 70-year-old with diabetes with early kidney disease with probably some disability of walking because of knee problems. That gentleman can now be

well guided by a personalized swarm of agents taking care of his own records. That to me is a revolution that is going to happen in the next 12 to 18 months which will bring personalized

medicine true personalized medicine not the genomics while personalized medicine which actually never uh delivered the result that it was supposed to. So so I think watch out for that space in the

next 12 to 18 months where you will have your own friendly AI agent telling you how to live longer and have more attention for benefit of economy. Okay. So as I said doctor from the

future is how many agents are right now working for you while you sit here. &gt;&gt; So I have only agents working for me. I don't have humans working for me anymore.

&gt;&gt; Okay. So so great is the I have follow-up questions but I think in interest of time we'll come back later. For instance I'm very interested in grounding part of it as you are building

these medical agent what's what's the source of truth? How do you verify? Uh but moving on so from doctors and their relationship with IT and AI and how it's improving as AJ pointed out doctors have

always been technology first uh robotic surgery has been around for already a while some I have a surgeon friend and unfortunately I saw a video sometime of knee surgery and it's but it's just the

robots working on your knee. It's this crazy thing how that looks. Uh so talking about technologies from the future which medical science uses. I would like to uh bring in Bleep uh who

is again one of those medical doctors who is also a rocket scientist building technology to talk to introduce himself and talk about the future. How how is this multimodel AI? When we talk about

AI, we probably here still think of LLM. But you are from the vision side, you are from the eyes side, right? Like in the sense of the AI that can see. How do you see AI affecting medical science and

uh what are the things that excite you? &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; It's working. All right. Thanks. Very august panel here. Thanks for having me on. So just quick in the way of

introduction, I'm Dip. I'm a medical doctor. I did my initial training in a government medical college in Kerala. uh and then moved on to do internal medicine, pulmonology and critical care

in the US. I was at the Cleveland Clinic for a few years. Similar story to some of the guys here moved back. Um I'm one of the two co-founders of Cloud Physician. Cloud Physician is a company

that delivers health care primarily in the inpatient setting. So if there's a bed, an ICU bed, ER bed, neonatal ICU, dialysis units, these are the uh settings that we support. And our story

is sort of a two-part story. So phase one was when we wanted to create a accessible distributive care model. So we actually are now in about 120 cities or so in India covering around 200

hospitals and we deliver 24/7 ICU, ER, NICU and diialysis care to uh about 80% of our hospitals are tier 2, tier three. So lot of impact we've seen about 200,000 patients now in our journey. So

sorry can I just inter maybe go ahead from for illiterate people like myself about this area. You should tell what does it look like? What are you setting up?

&gt;&gt; Yes, I'll get there. So, we've seen about 200,000 patients all in the ICU setting. And how we do that is we get to an ICU. Uh we digitize the whole ICU. So, we have our own own lighter version

of an EMR like you were talking about compliant with fire, snowmed and so on. And that's our sort of data layer for our structured data. So, and we've used a mobile first approach. uh those of you

who want to volunteer a guess which is the largest EMR company in India &gt;&gt; it's a joke it's WhatsApp right so uh you get all your data on WhatsApp and we need to fix that so that was a clue that

if you go mobile first you'll probably get more data a little bit better and so that's the initial transition we made but that data is not enough right so being a virtual doctor for a long time

uh I would always gravitate to the video stream because that at least without even touching ing the patient at least I can get an idea of what the patient is looking like are they in distress or not

so phase one was about digitizing the ICU from a data standpoint but also having eyes in the ICU so we've got about 800 cameras or so across the entire network I'm from Bangalore uh

Bangalore traffic police has about 650 700 cameras in Bangalore so similarly we have 800 across these ICUs and the visual data plus the bedside EMR data is what gives us that 360°

So we've been doing that for about 8 years or so now and with the backs of the data and the 24/7 on feed we're able to deliver care. So I'm not on the bench side on the uh biomics side for example

we are more on the care delivery side and so the first phase of what we were doing was actually sharpening this delivery angle. So some of the hospitals and ICUs that we work with we were able

to show up to a 40% reduction in mortality simply because they didn't have access to an ICU doctor. And so these numbers are published numbers. We can talk about them. But what was really

interesting was that as we were sort of delivering this service, the AI momentum was picking up. And so importantly, like like you were saying, we're not in the LLM space. We obviously use LLM to force

multiply our doctors and nurses. It's a 24/7 service. But what we realized was that the visual aspect was the sensory aspect, right? So we're not a hardware camera manufacturer. We would use any

camera, take the video stream and do analytics on that. And these are non LLM systems. They're non-generative in nature. And we're now able to pick up stuff that are very visual in Q. So for

example, the world's first model for respiratory distress in an inpatient. Uh we've built that. We have a patent for it, an Indian patent for it for example, and deploying it now in a hospital in

the US. So that AI for the masses, accessible AI for the masses from a computer vision side is the focus area that we have and to your question and and um you know push on robotics. I

think what we are building is actually getting a very exact spatial view of what the patient room looks like. And I'm of the belief that the patient room itself needs to be a participant in the

patient's care. In fact, supporting the patient's care, not just the doctors and the nurses. The patient needs to be inside an autonomous drone. And getting to autonomous care is a high bar, right?

Safety, responsible AI, explainable AI, all of that. And that comes on the back of data. And so we are now streaming about 1 TBTE of highdeaf ICU and ER video a day that is then being annotated

by experts in our care center in Bangalore who are doctors and nurses. So it's a two-layer doctor and nurse annotation. And what that does is it actually gives you a fertile data set to

in fact build that robot brain of the future. Right? So the LLM guys will come up with the language kind of structure that's required for a robot brain. We hopefully will provide what the spatial

uh knowledge a robot needs to have for autonomous care and then brick brick by brick you're able to build this entire autonomous sort of an ecosystem starting with an ambient system then an agentic

system and then hopefully autopilot for you. So that finally a doctor has time to talk to you. Yeah. Some so this the story of cloud physician is actually a extremely

fascinating story. You guys are on an a very good path. Uh the reason this is very fascinating for me is that there has been this thought process on what advantages do Indian companies have? Of

course you can flex the muscle, lift more weight and outpace the Chinese and the Americans. We can do that. But what inherent advantages do Indian companies have? And one thing was data. It has

already been said that data is an advantage which Indian companies have. Our data is what built Google mail, Gmail and our data is what will build the next generation of uh healthcare and

cloud physician is an example of such a company. I have you guys need to build a foundation model for vision soon man. So this speaking of rocket science and sort of foundation model so we have on the

panel a good friend of mine sep and one thing I like about sep and this is why I want to pass on to you this last part then we'll come to others. Good thing about Sundep is that suddenly the world

has become extremely innovation oriented. The startups are proving math theorems and physics theorems. So this is like some bizarre time we are staying in and these startups are not raising a

million dollar to prove a math theorem. They're raising $100 million to prove math theorems. That's the annual budget of Indian science roughly $100 million. That's the amount of raise that two or

three startups have had. And this is because this is because some some something has been unlocked. Uh it's new for most of the world but for some people like separ

also. Sep has always been this kind of person who thinks a little bit more disruptive. That's that's the starting of sentient also. When I first met him I said what the hell is this guy talking

about? And and so sep you should come in from this side that you yourself are a lot into longevity and longevity and sort of uh health hacks at a personal level. You're I I see that you're

intrigued about it and on on the other hand you are into startups which are disruptive. You are seeing all these kids they are kids now. We were kids few years back but now looks like 20 year

olds are uh ruling the world who are coming up with this grand ideas about uh what what healthcare companies should do. We we'll continue we we'll just get back

to you. So uh given that what are you looking up to? How do you see this world of health in the next 10 years? What will it look like from uh innovative startups, crazy things that we change

how we live moving beyond this hoops that we are wearing to something else that we are wearing and continuous monitoring and continuous diagnosis and continuous feedback.

&gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean I mean we we have uh you know doctors in the panel so I will not talk a lot about uh health but one thing that you know I recently have started thinking is that uh in the health space

overall like you see like whether it's AI robotics or whatever in the health sector for a human being's uh well-being we are winning on most of the fronts like for example any big uh

you know kind of disease you pick whether it's cancer whether it's like you know any any big disease name it and you will see that you know we are getting better and better and better uh

in in in in curing those diseases preventing those diseases but one thing where we are failing very heavily is is the is the diseases uh you know related to the brain the mental diseases and you

know like when the AI and the age of abundance finally comes in They're going to realize that you know human beings are going to have a lot of time on their hand like everything is available in

plenty like you know kind of reduces or or or kind of removes a large part of the basic struggle that keeps human beings occupied. So you know like people are always worried about the AI dystopia

right like where AI takes over the world and they control and kill all human beings and all that. I'm not worried about the AI dystopia. I am worried about AI utopia where you know

everything is great. Now what what is the meaning of human life and all that? So for me specifically in AI, I am starting to get deeper and deeper into how AI will AI can help human beings to

you know more mentally fit, more happy, more fulfilled uh in their lives and I have because you know I I went through like this crazy startup journey in the last you know last five seven 10 years

and I myself started developing like this you know anxiety and you know whatever like all these kind of uh you know problematic things. So I feel very deeply for that and uh you know I I I I

really um you know expect obviously like initially a lot of AI will be implemented on the on solving the bodily problems of uh related to health but I think like for me you know the the last

frontier is going to be the mental health and uh this is where like I'm putting some of my efforts there. &gt;&gt; Okay. Yeah that's an interesting point. I not thought about it. I was thinking

that this zen and mindfulness that we talk about if you outsource everything to AI then all that is left is mindfulness and zen I guess but but that's a joke. Uh so just to recap for

you ma'am thank you for joining us. So we started with uh we covered various aspect aspects of how AI is affecting health and healthcare. We started with policy how policy makers are thinking.

And uh we spoke about how doctors are adopting uh this AI technology which is categorized by AJ as IT technology subset. Uh and then then we spoke about how we are going beyond just language

models into vision and other more frontier part of technology which will be implication of AI like robotics. But I skipped a topic in the middle which was the question I had for you and maybe

we can come back to it which is AI for scientific discovery. I did mention that there are these hundreds of millions of dollars of math proving startups. What I did not mention is that there are

billions of dollars of uh medical discovery startup including entropic after software which will die in 5 years. What will these companies do? They will discover new health solution.

That's the big promise of this trillions of dollars of capital that is coming in and sort of the valuations that are coming in. So I want to know from your side what are you seeing in drug

discovery scientific discovery relevant to healthcare and uh you know that's a different thing from diagnosis and than these kind of things a long scientific research for healthcare how is affecting

it. &gt;&gt; Thank you for asking that question and I must assure you that ICMR is completely focused on &gt;&gt; can you introduce yourself sorry I

forgot to say &gt;&gt; okay I'm Dr. Tuna and I'm heading the division of development research at Indian council of medical research which is the epics body in the country akin to

US national institutes of health in India and we have 27 institutions of our own which are focused on various diseases and uh we have ranging from malaria and you must have heard national

institute of viology in Pune because they were the ones who actually uh discovered the co virus and then gave gave it to Bhat Biotech and developed the COVID vaccine. So this is the

institution part but there is another big part or bigger part of ICMR which is called extra mural research where we are supporting more than 350 medical institutions of the country for

developing met innovations and not only developing discovering as well and descriptive research also. So we have four wings, four divisions in ICMR extra mural which starts from descriptive

research where we try to understand what a disease is all about. What is the population that is getting affected? What is the incidence or prevalence of that disease in our country? So that is

descriptive research and of course the big data analysis when you do the OMIX you try to understand more about the disease pathogenesis. The second component is the discovery which the

question is focused on. And the third part is development which I am heading at ICMR. And the fourth part is delivery which is the most important thing. Why product which is developed and is

acceptable to the regulator for marketing is still not deployable? Why it is not being adopted by the country. So that part also we take care of. So in the discovery part as he asked me. So in

the discovery we really are relying on the speed with which AI will deliver us the solutions. We are still in that conventional approach where we are doing uh omix. We are trying to understand the

differentially expressed genes, differentially expressed proteins. We are isolating exoomes circulating uh organ specific exosomes from the blood and we are mapping them and seeing what

is there which is actually leading to the cause of the disease. We are using them as biomarkers. We are using those genes as targets for our therapeutic agents. So that is where the this OMIX

data evaluation is the part that AI is going to help us with and AI is going to help us with the target that we need to identify. So there are at this moment we have libraries uh thousands of molecules

that we screen again these genes and proteins that we are having differential expression in a particular disease process. This identification takes months together because we are doing

everything in the lab. So we have moved to the next step where we are doing all these interactions in silicico in the computers but still it is all manual and it is taking a toll. We still are taking

years to complete this task. Now what we want is months and weeks and that is where the AI is going to enable us because we will understand how this whole program happens and we will

develop an AI tool which will predict that this is the potential target go and work on this in the lab and in the animal model. So within a week, within a month, we will be ready with the

pre-clinical studies and your drug journey and your vaccine journey is going to be shortened. And that's how when pandemic, next pandemic comes, you don't have to wait for a year to have

the medicine. You don't have to wait for a year for the vaccine. We will give it to you in months. Thank you. &gt;&gt; This is such an intriguing conversation. I'll have a quick followup although we

are running out of time. Just a quick followup is that from the alpha fold story uh what we learned is that these discoveries happen in some kind of a play mode where the AI is playing with

itself in an environment to discover it like a game. So my understanding is for that the requirement is to convert the data that you have into that game environment which we call RL

environments. Is this an effort which is underway right now? Is this what we should is this how data is feeding medical research? Absolutely right on the spot. So the first step is to have

the data then only the AI tool can be developed. So that data repository so ICMR has created a national data repository as well as in the institutions we have data repositories.

We have already developed an annotated curated data set of X-ray images more than 10,000 of the affected TB individuals as in different stages of the disease as well as the control

individuals on our uh Chennai uh institution for TB research. So you can visit that and you can use that data. So that is yes it is publicly you just have to write to the director and you get the

permission to use that data for development and already one NGO in Gujarat has developed the tool for TB diagnosis you can develop better tools AI tools will never stop at one you will

have better better versions more effective more safer versions coming for the public so this data set is available not only this we have developed along with Indian Institute of Science gold

standard data sets for the cancer So we have breast cancer as well as glyoma. Both these data sets have already been onboarded on mighty MIT portal which is called AI kosha. So AI kosha is having

these two data sets and you just have to write to mighty and this data set will be accessible to you to develop the AI prediction tools for both these ailments. So this is what was the first

step. Along with that we have center for excellence which is in six IT. We have center for advanced research in various medical uh institutions and bigger hospitals of the country. So we have

more than 30 center for advanced research which are evaluating the devices and the diagnostic tools that are being developed at IITs uh in the hospitals and then we have a full

network Indian clinical trial uh and education network which is having 84 sites across the country. So this is for clinical evaluation and after this field feasibility because this evaluation is

being done in the hospitals. What about the field when the your tool goes out and is being handed over to a primary healthcare uh professional and they have to use it. So we have to see that field

feasibility and after that field feasibility we have more than 170 medical colleges and rural health research centers for doing this field feasibility and beyond that we need to

have health technology assessment the tool that you have developed whether it is actually deployable whether it is cost effective whether it is going to be safe for the human uh uh

race and whether it is going to be safe for Indian population So we do a health technology assessment at department of health research and this is a key because this will give to the government

that this tool is very useful. It is with a with when you compare it with the standard of care. So you compare your tool with the standard of care which is manual predictions by the clinicians.

The diagnosis that is being made by the clinicians is compared with the diagnosis made by clinicians with the help of an AI tool and then you compare the cost. You compare the time spent on

it. You compare the accuracy of the diagnosis. All that goes into that cost effectiveness uh ratio that we call it as incremental cost effective ratio. So that ratio is given to the government

along with the cost of your tool which is affordable and then government will take up your tool for deployment to the masses. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Okay. So uh I think we're roughly out of

time but unless we thrown out I'll ask one very quick question to everyone. This this is an amazing panel. I could have done one-on-one interview for 55 minutes with each one of the panelists

here. Uh I could also have done a 55minut monologue. So the the last uh last question for everybody. What excites you and scares the cliche question. What rapid fire one minute.

What excites you and scares you about AI? I'll start with the answer. What excites me is the possibility to learn anything. I I hated biology in school. sorry to say to all the doctors on the

panel and I love it now uh because you know because I am a more math oriented person and physics oriented person so I want to know the key problem before I know a topic and bio key problems are

very hard to understand for a schoolgoing kid uh now I can do it with AI what scares me is that I feel all my secret strength skills which I built over years will become uh so generic in

the next five years that everybody will have have it and people who don't deserve it will also have it and that scares me. Uh but Dip, we'll start from that side. What excites you and what

scares you? &gt;&gt; Well, um I can't think about anything that scares me. I guess guess it's um yeah, there are so many &gt;&gt; You have to say one.

&gt;&gt; I have to say one. &gt;&gt; What scares me? &gt;&gt; I I would say I'm most uh most concerned, let me put it that way, about how the next generation is going to take

on this new tool that we have not yet learned to deal with or evolve with. just like maybe television or social media once it starts we have no idea what it's going to do. So I think rather

than scare since I'm a dad that's the concern right now that I don't know how the next generation with these new tools how are they going to perform in school how are they going to make friends I

don't know the answer to that and that is a concern um but the upside is dramatic hope I think for the this is the best time to be alive that's how I look at it uh so many tools so many

things to do uh it's just exciting so I think the um undying hope that comes with this is is really empowering So for me for me I think what's what's going to be very exciting so thank you

what's going to be very exciting is the possibilities that we have in terms of what think about the human mind in terms of the huge amounts of data which we really can't analyze and which AI can

right so I think the possibilities of what were some very difficult problems that we could solve we could probably solve them much quicker now that's that's something very exciting what I'm

concerned is How do we do this without adequate guardrails with the technology going at a pace which is so rapid whereas the regulatory guardrails not really going at that pacing gap that

exists across the around the world right so and this gap is actually increasing so for example if you look into the randomiz control trials today on AI there isn't a single randomized control

trial in entire of Southeast Asia almost all the clinical evidence that's coming from standard RCTs is 66% is just from the US and China. Right? So going forward, think about the huge gaps that

would exist between the world. So I think that's what is a concern for me. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Um what excites me is the is the ability to probably finally eradicate the hunger and uh you know poverty from

the world uh you know for good and especially like the as they say in US that everybody you know a large number of US population is actually like one health care scare away from bankruptcy

right because if you if you like you know somebody in your family gets like a very big like a health problem it can bankrupt your entire family and you know growing growing up very poor in India. I

actually experienced uh you know some of the family members who had to be you know who had to accept the death like you know old age nanis and all that like you know because we didn't have the

money to get the cancer cure for them. So hopefully that uh will be finally eradicated and there will be equal opportunity for all the all the kids uh and human beings. Uh so that's the

exciting part and the scary part I told you is like you know eventually we are going into a utopia and when what's the meaning of life like when AI is doing everything for you what is the meaning

of life &gt;&gt; so very quickly I think what excites me is that now uh the purpose of life if it is to live your to your full potential is going to be available to 8 billion

people. uh that's a very dramatic uh shift that will happen in front of our lives. Uh and that's wonderful on one front but I am also aware that there are at least 3 4 5% people who are actually

malicious and they'll also have that superpower to influence others cognitive warfare mental hijacking. We already see that through Tik Tok and Instagram in some way. uh so while 95% of people may

well-meaning and living to their full potential we need to have a way to deal with the remaining 5% as well. Okay, M. &gt;&gt; Thank you. So I will be rather quicker. So the speed at which AI is going to

give us the healthare solutions is one thing which we are all very excited about. And the second thing is uh you asked about the scare. The scare is patient safety because there would be

variety of tools that are coming out and would be uh you know cleared by the regulator because they are ticking all the boxes but still patient safety remains a big concern for us and we are

putting the guidelines for that you will see the s see sooner the revised guidelines coming for thank you so &gt;&gt; yeah let's Take it on the
