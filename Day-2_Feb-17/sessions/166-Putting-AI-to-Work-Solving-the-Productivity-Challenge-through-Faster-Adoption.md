## 📝 Transcript

Is anybody out there with you? Good morning. Are you sure? Thank Uh, good afternoon everyone. Welcome.

It's great to see so many people, both new faces and familiar faces in the room. My name is Kevin Allison. I'm the president of Manurva Technology Futures. We're a geopolitical and policy firm uh

based in Washington DC focused on artificial intelligence and the AI technology stack. I'm really delighted that at the program we've developed for you at the end of what's been a very

busy day. Um, I'd encourage you all to make yourselves comfortable. We are still waiting uh for Minister Nion, the UK AI minister to arrive. He is on the campus and is on his way. So, please

make yourselves comfortable. While you wait, uh, we'd like to play a short video for you on the topic of AI adoption and why we and others that we've been talking to around the world

uh, about this topic consider it to be so important. So, while we wait, um, please enjoy the video and we'll come back uh, a few minutes after the video plays to open the formal program. So,

thank you very much for coming and enjoy. What makes AI special as a general purpose technology is its potential boost to economic productivity. Hi, my

name is Jeff Ding. [music] I'm an assistant professor of political science at George Washington University. I recently published the book technology and the rise of great powers which

explores the role of diffusion in how some countries were able to better capitalize on past technological revolutions. And in these past industrial

revolutions, the crucial technological advances were generalpurpose technologies or GPTs. And so the classic GPTs are the steam engine, electricity, and

the computer. Because of their pervasiveness, they have the potential to usher in huge waves of productivity growth and transform the fates of national

economies. The promise of AI is many scholars and practitioners see it as the next GPT. Maybe one aspect that makes AI even more exciting is the pace of change. Uh GPTs, we know from history,

usually take multiple decades to spread and diffuse across the economy. We're seeing AI take off and spread at a very quick rate. And so I think that's what's driving so much attention towards AI as

a generalpurpose technology, [music] a generalpurpose engine of growth. the countries that were able to cultivate the GPT skill infrastructure to diffuse and adopt general purpose technologies

at scale ended up becoming the winners of these past industrial revolutions. And so success was not about uh which country produced the latest and greatest new to the world innovations.

Instead, success was about which country could win the diffusion marathon. Uh the race, the competition was about which country could adopt and spread GPTs at scale throughout their entire economy.

And that rested on developing the education and training institutions that could broaden the base of engineering skills [music] linked to a GPT. I think the AI adoption initiative is essential

because it puts the spotlight onto uh this humble often neglected undertaking of diffusion. In these past industrial revolutions, we saw it was applied mechanic skills that were

crucial to diffuse advances in iron making in the first industrial revolution. It was mechanical engineering skills in engineering schools and land grant universities that

were crucial to spread standardized parts manufacturing and interchangeable parts manufacturing throughout the entire economy. It was software engineering skills in the third

industrial revolution that was crucial for the uh the US to adopt computerization at scale. And so that's why my research points to the need to focus on this this diffusion phase. For

example, uh India has a future skills initiative that tries to raise the overall digital skills of its engineering population. The AI adoption initiative's working paper sites

Singapore [music] which has a going digital initiative that connects uh small mediumsiz enterprises with a chief technology officer through a virtual connection and they are able to

liaz with that CTO to get advice on what types of [music] AI technologies they could integrate to improve their workflows. The role that governments can play is to

build infrastructure. And this infrastructure can come in various forms. Whether that's skill infrastructure, whether that's cloud computing infrastructure, whether that's

common data sets, uh whether that's technical standards uh that allow uh interoperability and harmonization of different protocols. And so a a large language model agent from one company

can connect with the data source that's maintained by a different company. That's [music] why governments build roads and bridges. And in the same way uh governments should be in in [music]

conversations with all these different stakeholders. They should be trying to identify what are the roads and bridges we can build in the digital AI ecosystem.

That's perfect. Okay. Um, while we wait for our other panelists to arrive, we're waiting for the UK minister and for a representative from Meti here in India. I wanted to

kick off the discussion. Uh I'm very pleased to welcome uh David Sapolski, the chief global affairs officer and legal officer from Amazon and Shui Agarwal the co-founder and COO of

LocoBuzz which is a company based in Mumbai which is working on using AI to power customer experiences for companies. uh once we have the ministers in place uh we'll

include their perspectives on the panels as well. But to open I just wanted to make some scene setting remarks um to to really set the frame for our discussion today. I I think that Professor Ding in

this video did a really good job of encapsulating uh what we've been calling the AI adoption imperative. Just for your context, uh Jeff published

his book in October of 2024. And that month, uh we convened a workshop in New York City with about 75 global experts to discuss the question of if AI adoption really is the

important thing in uh technology revolutions. you want to diffuse the technology. The countries that diffuse new technologies across their economies the fastest uh and the broadest, they

tend to benefit the most from major technology transitions. If you buy that argument, then what is the role that public policy and governments can play in helping to

accelerate adoption? One of the absolutely important data points that professor Deng covers in his book is that technology revolutions take a long time to unfold.

uh in an example that he uses in technology in the rise of great powers of electrification. Although the technology for electrification, the electric dynamo

motor was invented in the late 1800s, it took 30 or 40 years for that electrification revolution to become widespread in the United States, which was the the country that he was looking

at as his example. Why is that? Well, no matter how advanced your technology might be, diffusing it through an economy takes time. It takes time because

uh companies that might be investing in electric motors for their factory floors needed to become comfortable with the idea of moving away from steam power factory floors where you had a steam

engine that was powering machines around the factory. one centralized engine powering many belts that were turning all kinds of widgets and gadgets to make the factory operate. Electrically

electrified factories can operate completely different. Every single machine on the factory floor has its own engine and you plug it into the into the grid. Uh it was an organizational

adaptation that needed to be made not by one company but by many companies across many sectors for electrification to really take off. So we had become fascinated by this policy problem by

this policy question. If you think that AI is the next general purpose technology revolution then what are the roles that governments can play to mean that it won't take 40 years for

societies to unlock productivity benefits across their economies? What meaningful steps can governments take to speed up this process? What's been fascinating about taking

this idea not just in New York but we've also been on I think the last count was 10 cities on five continents convening discussions and workshops and panels to talk about AI adoption is that this is

very much an area where the global south countries or global majority countries have an opportunity to uh really be leading and innovating out front on this. That's because if you're thinking

about widespread adoption, it's really adoption across the whole breadth of an economy, not only across sectors, but across different types of firms from the very biggest to to the very smallest.

And what's interesting about convening here in India is just the the breadth of different types of use cases of AI and the different types of firms. Everything from the most globally uh oriented large

manufacturers and industrial companies and technology companies all the way to small businesses. There is really a huge concentration of interesting uh use cases and interesting customer needs

here in India that I think we we can get to on the panel. I'm really looking forward to what Shubi has to say on that. Um, and with David's representing one of the biggest technology companies

that not only is developing and deploying AI, uh, and and helping others de develop and deploy AI, but also running the infrastructure. I think we can get into a lot of those questions

today. When the ministers arrive, there's another set of topics that we want to cover about how are governments thinking about this problem? what governments around the world are engaged

in really innovative thinking about this. Uh in the video, Professor Ding gave a few examples about India and its its skills programs and also about Singapore with its uh CTO fractional CTO

for hire program. But I'm sure there are other examples that we can talk about. And then finally, we want to move the discussion to very specific policy areas. So we want to talk about skills.

I think that's the one very obvious area where there is a general consensus that governments have an important role to play in skilling their populations to be able to use AI. But I think there's an

important additional correlary to that which is that the way that AI itself is evolving means that those skills are evolving the the different skills that might be required to use AI effectively

are also changing. It was the CEO of Coher, which is a Canadian startup, who made the point to me once who said, "One of the things that generative AI is doing, it is giving us computers that

people can talk to in their natural language and it's allowing those computers also to talk to us. So, it's not only a very interesting technology change, you can also think about it as a

very interesting user interface change in the way that people interact with technology systems. And when you're talking about widespread adoption across the economy, many different sectors,

many different sizes of companies, but also many different levels of sophistication of users within companies who need to be taught how to use these tools. It means it's a very exciting

moment in the history of this this brand new technology. So, we are going to launch into our panel discussion. Uh once the ministers come in, they're going to come straight on stage and

we're going to put their feet to the fire and ask them for their perspectives. We are at the end of a very long day. Uh it is a very busy conference and I appreciate so many

people turning out for this event near the end of the day's program. We are going to try our best to keep it interactive and lively for you. Um I did want to make a programming two

programming notes. However, first this discussion is taking place under Chattam House rule, which means that you are free to use the information you hear during this session, but you must not

quote any particular participant or attribute a quote to a particular person or a view to a particular person. So feel free to use and be informed by what we say today. Uh but but please respect

the Chattam House rule. I believe there might be some members of the press. We ask you to respect the Chattam House rule as well. And just so that our speakers are prepared, just noting that

for the record. The other programming note is we are not going to run a traditional Q&amp;A session. In the spirit of making this event very interactive um for guests who who registered with us

ahead of time, at the end of our discussion, we will be reconvening at the Meridian Hotel. Uh we have arranged a coach bus which is going to operate on a first come firsts served basis. Um,

I'm not sure exactly what the capacity of that bus is, but I think if everyone wants to go, we're going to have a little bit of trouble. So, you might be wanting to think about taking an Uber or

some other kind of ride. But, we are going to reconvene at the Meridian Hotel for an extended reflection and conversation on what we talk about here today, but also what we've learned

through the first couple days of the formal program of of this event, this summit. So, very much looking forward to that. We are going to keep that very relaxed. There's going to be lounges.

There are going to be chairs and sofas to sit on tables. There will be a big focus on gathering together this expert community that really cares about AI adoption as a policy topic to have good

conversations. We will have a short formal part of the program when we reconvene at the meridian where pe we will invite people to speak and contribute their perspectives to to this

discussion and talk about AI adoption. So that's the opener. I'm going to sit down. we're going to start the panel and we'll see where we get to. So, thanks again for coming and looking forward to

a really interesting discussion. [applause] &gt;&gt; All right. So, we're going to get a chance to hear from representatives of the Indian government and from the UK

government. David, I wanted to start with you. Um from your perspective at Amazon uh again really interesting business you're building infrastructure in many countries you're developing and

deploying your own models you're enabling many other companies to develop and deploy their own AI. How do you see the AI adoption challenge? Do you have examples of where policy makers have

been getting this right? And can you kind of tell us a little bit about that and some of your reactions to what Jeff Ding was saying on the video? &gt;&gt; Sure. And if you haven't read the book,

I recommend it. It it's very I'm I'm a history buff and so I I enjoyed um kind of reading his take on prior technological revolutions. Um and and I think you know there was a misimpression

when chat GPT went viral that uh AI was going to magically take over everything and it would everybody would be using it whether they had a choice or not. And I think you know two three years later we

know better. you know, all of the fears and the the uncertainty and doubt that that engendered from governments, from civil society, and from uh you know, from all quarters, I was a little

overhyped uh to say the least. And so we realize now that this is not magic. It's going to take time. It's going to take innovation to find ways to adopt and apply this technology in ways that are

actually going to solve real problems, real problems for real people. So increasing increasing productivity, making things more efficient, letting us do things that we couldn't dream of

doing by ourselves, uh using AI and AI agents. So that's still very much in development, which is a long way of saying there's work to be done. The adoption isn't going to happen on its

own, and there's opportunity for different different countries to do that work and spread that technology. So I would just say listening to you and reflecting on the video uh in terms of

what governments can do, you know, the first thing I would say is unlike some of the prior uh uh technological revolutions, you have uh an incredibly vibrant private ecosystem of large and

small companies and medium-sized companies who are eager to do this. And so the first thing governments can do is not stop them. don't do harm. Right? We all agree and Amazon has long uh

advocated for responsible, careful deployment and development of AI technology and and Amazon has also been uh an advocate for careful responsible principled and use riskbased regulation

where appropriate and we've supported that. But in the rush to address fears, you see some parts of the world, including in the United States, uh regulating away and essentially making

it much more difficult and expensive uh to adopt this technology. And I think that's that is the wrong way to go. And I think when you look around the world now, you see some buyers regret. You see

Europe, um you see Colorado, they're all sort of saying, "Wait a minute, maybe we don't want to go that fast. maybe we want to slow down and delay and see how this plays out because now that we're

living with this technology and we're seeing some of the use cases that are very exciting, maybe we don't want that to stop. So that's number one and the other is is education which I think was

a part of the video. Um it's you need to be able to uh have the institutions in place to train the next generation of users, adopters, developers, innovative innovators. India has been way ahead of

the curve as has Singapore uh in and they they've gotten 50% more of that education out there than anywhere else in the world. Um Amazon has announced a commitment not just to u uh skill people

all around the world with our our general um uh cloud and AI education programs but in India we're going to try to reach four million uh public school children exposing them to AI

bringing them along that adoption curve. Um and so India I think is taking some of the right steps. They have been cautious in principles and risk based in their regulation. They have invited

investment so that private companies can come here and build the architecture and infrastructure that's going to be required to use adopt and diffuse this technology. And um you know I think

that's promising but but this is still early days. It's a wide open frontier and as as you look around this the hall here and uh talk to people uh I hope everybody's eyes as you know are getting

open as are mine in some of the new and interesting use cases that this technology can accomplish. &gt;&gt; David thank you. Um Shuby I want to get your perspective as a startup founder

and how you're using AI but also how you are seeing the adoption issue unfold. But before I do that, could I do a quick temperature check in the audience? Who we're all here because we're working on

AI in some professional capacity. Like it matters that we talk about AI for our jobs, but who's actually using it on a daily basis to do your job? Okay. who who is using the kind of

retail chat window like chatgpt or claude versus who's actively using claude code or Amazon bedrock. [laughter]

Okay, that's interesting. I I think that itself is just a change since we started convening discussions on AI adoption in late 2024. uh where many people were experimenting

with the kind of chat bot window. Uh but just looking at how the different the tools have evolved and again back to this point that the user interface is evolving in ways that let people who are

not at all computer science PhDs use these tools in very interesting ways on specific concrete problems. So Shubby maybe that's a way to pivot to you from your perspective running a startup here

in India. How do you look at the AI adoption issue? And I'm I'm I'm interested maybe for you to tell people in a in a maybe a couple of of words what LocalBuzz does. But but then where

do you see opportunities for government, like David said, to to not get in the way, but actually to help adoption go faster or to help you do your business faster?

&gt;&gt; Hi everybody. First of all, thank you so much for being here. It's 6 o'clock. I don't know about you but yeah I must be tired because it's a long long day. Um uh before I start into the second part

of the question I just want to take a few minutes to tell you what logo does. Uh we are a startup and uh have been working in the space of uh AI powered customer experience which basically

brings about uh social listening response management insights and analytics into one single platform. Uh it is being used both by enterprises as well as the governments and policy

makers to find out what it is that people are talking about their brands/ policies or or practices and then use this insight to then make decisions whether it is for enterprises marketing

and business decisions for policy makers to find out the impact of what it has done uh for people. So real time temperature check or a feedback loop kind of a thing which empowers a lot of

uh practices. So we pra work with uh um organizations uh like IRCTC. So if say for example somebody writes about you know having a medical situation while on the train and

help is needed immediately um that is something which can be pivot can be immediately actioned by the department by using our platform. So this is just one of the use cases but uh there are

multiple things which are do happening. Um when it comes to AI I think the uh it's still very very new. It's still very very exciting. A little bit scary as well cuz uh everybody like including

some of the people in my team they're like okay so what will I do now because uh if everything is going to happen by AI what is the point of me doing an engineering. Yes I think we need to all

rethink of what our children will be doing and what they will be doing. Definitely not engineering will not be one of the uh most coveted professions I as I feel in the in the future because

English to engineering has become very very possible at at this point in time. However, uh when we look at the enterprises that we work with or the organizations that we work with, the

common uh obstacles which I find in the way of AI adoption is um a not entire like if we go ahead and create a a complete plan which is lot more sophisticated that will definitely

not work. So it's creating and breaking it down into simple mo uh use cases into simple models which can be easily uh incorporated in the business models which are already existing which talk to

the tech stack which is already present in within the organization. Then it creates a little bit of comfort with what we are bringing to the table. Once that is done um none of the CMOs or

anybody of uh a seale exeutor will be interested in knowing okay my accuracy of my AI model is 90% or 99% for that matter. So then we have to go ahead and kind of translate that into business um

midrices or ROIs which can be then uh measured because um that is what they understand. So it's not about creating a new ecosystem, creating a new parameters of learning. It is what I already know

but I need to know all of those parameters using this technology and how it is actually helping measure that sooner, faster and more efficient. Um then once all of this is done it um we

typically look at it in a way that adoption will not happen very very drastically. it is a small trans uh transformation where it starts from an AI uh powered or AI assisted and

actually then becomes AI powered. So it's a journey and uh some of those some of the enterprises that we are working with have already taken that with us but and we are encouraging but it's it's

going to be uh it's going to be a a bit of time before you know clear embrace of AI happens at that level. Um David maybe to come back to you and and kind of riffing on what Shuy was

saying. Um it seems like there a piece of it is kind of if you think again about what is the useful role for public policy for government policies in encouraging faster adoption. There is

kind of an information problem that especially small companies face. Like maybe again to ask the audience, anybody here wish that they had a kind of register of really good use cases for

using AI in your particular work? Like anybody feel a little bit time squeezed and not quite able to keep on top of all of that, right? Um but but I wanted to ask you like what are some other maybe

hidden barriers to to faster adoption that from your position in one of the the big companies again working across the whole stack. What are some hidden areas where governments

might not be thinking about bottlenecks and problems with speeding up adoption and getting diffusion right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, I I uh I'm mindful of that we may actually have uh more panelists.

So um I'll I'll keep this short. I think first of all um we've talked about uh uh how are you uh we've we've talked about uh education which is a is a big part of it um at at every level um I think

making this technology making the infrastructure available to small and medium-sized enterprises as we saw that Singapore is doing on a government level um helping to uh provide access to

models to the to the to the to the tech stack that allows experimentation um you know there's uh public investment in AI um so modeling the types of things that can happen and and really India is at

the forefront of using of leveraging its digital digital infrastructure digital public infrastructure um which provides cloud-based services to citizens all over the country to incorporate AI into

that that's a that's a huge needle mover um uh and then obviously we've talked a little bit about the policy uh uh policy environment creating a policy environment that that doesn't inhibit

innovation and that's compatible with other countries that that where uh you're not creating sort of a backwater a policy backwater that makes it impossible for companies to um to to uh

to to migrate their technology across borders. Um, so those are those are some and one one more thing just to follow up I think and this may not be as much of a government thing but it's partly you

know there's a cultural shift that has to change at Amazon even within the legal and public policy groups you know we had to intentionally change our culture from we're doing what we're

doing this is cool stuff I'm not going to look at it right now to no actually turn take the time to understand what tools are available and give some thought to how you can do your jobs

better because once you do that you start seeing transformation you start seeing improved productivity and I think honestly walk walking through these grounds and just the gesture of of what

the Indian government has done by hosting and throwing open the doors to uh to an event like this helps move the culture to one that is more uh uh not only accepting but uh thirsty for um use

cases and and ways of adopting this technology to improve lives. &gt;&gt; Excellent. Um uh Kishka Nayan uh welcome. So just just by way of introduction, Mr. Nion is the

Minister for AI uh for the UK government. Um very pleased to have you joining us on stage. We've been talking about AI adoption as a distinct policy issue asking the question if you believe

that the widespread adoption of AI of economically uh useful AI applications is important for your country. Um if if that is should be a strategic goal that a country should have then what is the

role for public policy? What is the role for government that private companies and market forces either will take a longer time that so government can speed things up or there's some kind of market

failure where they might not get there at all. So that is the the overarching theme of what we're talking about today trying to highlight specific policies that governments that are doing this

right are getting right and trying to highlight some barriers and bottlenecks. So I just wanted to just turn the floor to you for your high level thoughts on that question and I think we're we're

specifically interested in what you are most excited about what the UK government is doing on the adoption issue. &gt;&gt; Great. Thanks very much uh from having

me here and apologies for the uh for the delay but I I I expect everyone has empathy for the traffic context at the moment. Can [snorts] I can I start by firstly saying uh to your hypothetical

of if you believe adoption is the big driver of productivity in the UK we believe that adoption is the biggest driver of productivity and so let me let me uh get the caveat out of the way and

say this is very much the central question for British AI public policy today and I think there are four things that that are really top of mind people proof place and at the heart of it uh PR

uh and and I'll go through each of them and what we're doing so on people um both at the very outset that you find the technological diffusion and adoption happens best uh when before the evidence

is present. You hear it in the whispers, murmurss and word of mouth recommendations of pioneers of adoption. And so uh what we have been focused on in government is both championing in the

kind of leadership context and departments the adoption of AI but really critically at the kind of economy and society level finding AI ambassadors uh and sector champions who are out and

about banging the drum for what they have done and where they have found most value. So the sort of part of it at the starting point is the people aspect of course long-term that effectively

converges to a skills policy question. The second part alongside people is ultimately to make it not just systemic not just heroic change at the outset but systemic change long term. You need

proof. You need to show people that this isn't just something that is uh the current fad but ultimately there is time to value return on investment both in the public context the private context

uh there. And so what we're trying to do is effectively scale up where we were in terms of pilots and now evaluate them as robustly as possible in the public context of deployment but also encourage

more and more of that in the private context so that we build systematic foundations for adoption. Uh so people and proof uh of impact are two big things. The third thing is that um when

you really focus on the central mission for us which is not just to adopt AI but to adopt it to bring the entire country into this wave of prosperity then you have to make it true in a particular

place. Uh very often we talk about sort of adoption and technology in a very abstracted way. What we're trying to do is to say um if we just al light on one place. So in our case for example we've

picked uh the town of Barnsley and we've said in Barnsley we're going to make it our tech adoption exemplar and we're doing a bunch of stuff. The hospital in Barnsley is using AI to be able to

accelerate uh the waiting experience for patients. Schools are using AI in Barnsley to be able to close the educational gap between those who have and those who don't. uh we're looking at

how uh small and mediumsized companies in Barnsley can be right at the forefront of deploying AI as well. So what we're doing is saying take a place and make adoption real for people as

well. And so once you have people, you have proof of impact, you converge on a particular place, I think the thing you then have to do is exactly what David was talking about, which is uh that

ultimately content and culture are the most scalable intervention in government. And so you have to get the PR right. You have to be able to talk it up. uh talk about yes a nuanced sense of

the downside risks in some of this stuff but at the heart of it what the specific opportunities are and I think all of those four things are really critical aspects that government can uh can uh

can contribute very materally on &gt;&gt; and so go going from those kind of four broad points of or four areas of emphasis um what in addition to the Barnsley example well can can you tell

us where Barnsley is [laughter] &gt;&gt; Barnesley's near Manchester &gt;&gt; near Manchester so So middle of the country um how are you one one of the things about AI is it tends at least in

the research and development part of AI and the frontier of the technology itself it tends to be a superstar business where uh the the cutting edge is really driven by a handful of of

researchers in the adoption context you can imagine a city like London just kind of eating up all the gains of AI potentially just because it's the hub where everything's happening h how can

you in a structured way so not just the one example of Barnsley. How how can policy in the UK help push that adoption wave out so that Barnsley and whatever the equivalent town in Wales or Scotland

might be to what specific policies are you doing to kind of do that diffusion part of it geographically? &gt;&gt; This is a great question, one very close to my heart. I represent a Welsh

constituency, grew up in Cardiff and so I believe that the opportunity of technology and AI uh can be made the most of across every part of the United Kingdom without compromising the overall

effect. Um and so to your precise question of how do you do that? Well, one of the big things about AI unlike the last wave of SAS and software is that some of the fundamental bottlenecks

are the material reality of land, of water, of energy. uh those things are much more diffuse than just the concentrated benefits of people around the water cooler in London or Silicon

Valley talking about code. Uh and so when uh it's not just about the concentration of code but instead the diffusion of physics the material reality of the world that we're in. I

think the opportunity to spread the benefits are clearer still and so we're focused through a program called the AI growth zone program. We are building uh large scale compute capacity right

across the country. We have announced uh 10 billion of investment in South Wales with 5,000 jobs. 10 billion of investment in North Wales with 5,000 jobs. 8 billion in Lannshire and

Scotland with uh 3 and a half thousand jobs. We've got about 10 to 15 billion in the northeast. So we're spreading compute investment across the country because we think it's actually the

optimal thing for the country, not just because we want to spread that opportunity. And when you do that, you have that level of capital investment in uh spread right across the country. I

think the way you build durable consensus in those communities is to then say this isn't just a blackbox data center in your community. But part of that compute capacity will be reserved

for students in those schools to be able to do experiments that ultimately change their sense of what is possible in their future. For public service deployments that mean the local hospital can benefit

from that as well. And at the heart of it, if we can build some startup ecosystems in each of those clusters, South Wales has a great history of both semiconductors and energy generation.

North Wales is where we're putting SMRs. So, companies using compute to be able to do energy innovation in that uh particular context. Uh in the northeast, we have our largest listed tech firm,

Sage, located on the site that we're building a lot a lot of the compute as well. And so, financial services innovation uh using that compute. In each of these places, you start by

saying we can spread this because that's the right thing to do in terms of the optimal thing for compute location. But when you're doing that, you then press home the point that if you can layer

onto that compute uh a bunch of the intangibles that make places deeply innovative and spread opportunity as well, you capture a lot more of the excitement and the value right across

the country. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Um compute came up a couple of times in that conversation and David, I was wondering if I could turn back to you maybe going back down the row. Um we

have a few minutes left. Um it felt like compute was really the the a huge discussion 2024 2025 and heading into 2026. Um there was a another big discussion emerging around what some

governments call digital sovereignty. And I wanted to kind of see if I can pull you in here to say again from your perspective, do you see um governments that are

looking at digital sovereignty, do you see that as being in tension with adoption? How here at the summit or in some other conversations that you've been having, how is that sovereignty

issue, how are you responding to to governments that are saying we want sovereign AI, whether it's for local languages or whether it's for security reasons. How do you respond to that

trend? And how do you connect it to the adoption challenge? &gt;&gt; It's a big question, so I'll try to be short. I mean, first of all, I do think that it is that that the sort of urge

towards sovereignty, cutting off um uh digital borders, restricting free flow of information is always going to inhibit innovation. I mean I I think every if you think about every one of

Amazon's business models the stores you know movies culture uh cloud like it all depends on open open borders uh free flow of goods free flow of information and and so any barrier to that sort of

breaks our business models and I think is generally bad for the world that said you know I think over over the course of time you look at the countries where you know companies like Amazon have invested

and you know regardless of the geopolitical moment of the Hey, you know, these are the the the investments that these companies are making, including Amazon, are generational.

They're going to far outlast uh my career and uh the careers of most of uh our our government leaders and and and they reflect an optimism and confidence that that over the course of time, we'll

continue to be partners technologically and and geopolitical allies. And that's certainly why we're investing, you know, we've invested $40 billion here in India. We're one of the largest

investors uh here. We we've committed to invest 35 billion more in the next several years. So so so when you when you define sovereignty and everybody has their own definition. It's important to

start out with what do you need? What does a customer really need in order to guarantee their data is safe, their usage is safe, that they can control where their data goes and that they

control who who who uh who has access to it. It's not defined by what's the nationality of the parent company that may own the the the uh that built the facility in this country. Um if you can

get the basics right, the customer experience right, then you can you can control sovereignty and AWS cloud has been built uh with a so with with our data digital sovereignty pledge from the

ground up. So you can't you can control where your data goes and customers can control where it's stored. If you want it stored here, great. If you want resilience and you want you want a copy

stored in a different region, great. That's your choice. If you want to encrypt the data at rest at movement, you can do that. You have the tools to do that. If you want to control who can

possibly have access to the encryption key, we we provide those those uh means as well. So even if uh uh even if uh the operator of the cloud service wanted or was supposedly legally compelled to look

at that data, they wouldn't be able to because only you have the encryption key. So those tools are available. We can build sovereign clouds the the tools that customers require to get the

security and safety that they need. And and um you know I think I don't just speak for Amazon. I think most of the companies thinking deeply about this are looking for ways to provide that

assurance to customers who are who have these concerns. &gt;&gt; There's a something you mentioned a theme that comes up again and again in some of these discussions we've been

having about the the need for um for companies to feel confident that they can quickly embrace AI. um that that that kind of speaks to a little bit the the idea that um you can sit down and

say hey I can put my company's data through this model and and get this output and to feel to feel good about that uh is really really important. Um having that that confidence backstopping

uh and it's interesting to see governments taking different approaches to this. Um the the last two questions I want to go to Shubi and then I want to come back to you. Um Shubi you mentioned

something really interesting about skills and education. Um, one of the challenges that I see starting to emerge is how are companies thinking about making sure that their workers um, have

the skills they need to do work to develop the discernment and the knowledge and experience to know if what AI is telling them is right. Um, this seems like a big challenge that's only

just starting to kind of come up in in some of the discussions. When I was a kid, everyone dreamed of having a machine that would do your homework at school. And [laughter]

it's kind of funny to think about, but we basically have that now. Um, how do you, whether it's a student or whether it's someone in the early stage of their career who will be able to ask an AI

model very complicated questions and get pretty good answers. What should governments be thinking about that in skills? And then I wanted to to maybe ask you to respond to the

same question, but to to Shuby first. &gt;&gt; The short answer will be yes. uh because yes we need to start early uh the education system itself needs to now change and evolve and deploy these AI

skills as a part of that entire comfort which students feel that okay I'm going to work with this and I'm going to do more with what I have because the whole world of knowledge is actually now

available to me in this machine which we had now I can actually talk to it and get answers which are making me more uh efficient ent and productive. So uh yes it has to happen but after that the next

responsibility of educating the young adults and the young employees also lies with companies like ours. Uh typically what happens is when we hire people it takes about um 3 to 6 months before you

know people uh get skilled uh even if they come with the right kind of background to understand what the business is doing to understand what is required to be done and that gap can be

changed and that can be reduced if they already are conversing with the technologies like AI which they are kind of uh using now. um for now. I remember the instance when we first put cloud

code in the uh office and then we asked the engineers to start using that there was so much reluctance and uh and it's not like okay it's like your boss is telling to use this just use it and try

it out and see what happens but it it's like there's a comfort in working in a certain way and that comfort needs to be um handled because that's that's the human way of reacting to a change. It

needs comfort. You need that you need that assurance that okay if I'm using this and if I make a mistake I'm still okay. So mistakes will be kind of um tolerated.

So uh right now I think we are at a place where um uh we at Locus are giving an environment to our engineering community and other business community as well like the engineering and the

non-engineering employees to work with AI and make mistakes cuz it will happen but um uh I think it it it is a it is a it is a journey like I said in my previous response as well it's a journey

and it's it has to be taken together. So all of us will evolve on the other side of the tunnel more much smarter and more evolved and just like other revolutions that we have gone through I think as

human beings we will survive the AI revolution as well and come out much stronger for sure. Yeah, I mean the the skills question is a really central question because if you

step back and you say what is the primary political framing for AI policy, it is uh whether we end up extending human agency with AI and technology or whether we end up uh subverting human

agency with uh technology. And at the heart of that is the skills and capability and agency of people both young people coming into the jobs market and people who are already in jobs to be

able to exercise agency over AI. And so what does that mean in practice? um in the early stage of life cycle. So in schools for example, the the central question we're focused on now is um as

AI erodess the sort of some of the foundational bits of work that we each have to do in our painful bits of homework. uh how do you uh get young people to build uh the sort of

foundational cognitive understanding of good information and bad information of chain of thought logic so that they can really see through uh the rungs of the ladder that you have to walk up to be

able to get to an answer. Uh and so we've started to make some changes but I think we've got a lot more to do on on that particular question on the question of uh skills in the workplace. You know,

the broad framing that I talked about of extending human agency effectively means how do we most quickly enable people to become the most proficient managers of AI. uh to be able to understand enough

to be able to uh oversee AI tell when it's uh agentic workflows are delivering bad outcomes uh or good outcomes to be able to understand again the logic of uh the specific uh chain of thought that

delivers particular uh particular work outcomes as well and that is really the central question of when you don't have graduate intakes of the same scale as you might have had historically how do

you get graduates to most quickly become kind of managers of uh lots of AI agents in the workplace. That's the sort of skills focus that uh that that that I think uh we're we're keen on developing

more and more of. &gt;&gt; Great. Um we're nearing the end of time and we do have one more final roundroin question that I wanted to ask to all of the panelists and invite them to answer

in in a minute or less. Uh but before I do that, I wanted to kind of draw together some of the threads that we've been talking about. Um predictably, the time has flown by. At least it has for

me. I hope it has for you as well. Uh at the end of of what we said at the beginning had been a a long and eventful day. Um I think the the main thing um beyond the the overarching point of the

need for specific thinking around adoption policy as its own distinct policy issue is all the different levels that this needs to happen for it to really work and to work quickly to pull

forward some of the productivity gains that I'd say people who are most excited about the potential of AI uh have been talking about. Um it needs uh individual adaptation pe individual people

themselves need to maybe uh become comfortable and fluent with the technology. It requires organizational innovations where I think a lot of the adoption discussion has focused. Uh but

it also requires institutional cultural and bureaucratic innovations. And I think that the challenge is the technology evolves extremely fast. Um people can also individual people can

can pick up these tools and use them increasingly fast but organizational and bureaucratic change happens slower speeds. Uh it happens at institutional speed or political speed. Um, and I just

from the experience we've had over the past year and a half of AI adoption initiative discussions, uh, and and talking to people like the experts on this panel, uh, it's pretty clear that

although there isn't one solution, one silver bullet for this, at least the conversation is happening. So, so that's very heartening. For the final roundrobin question, a big part of the

summit uh in India here this year has been uh the idea of creating a global AI commons. India is focused not only on its own domestic AI ecosystem but finding opportunities for some of the

ideas and thinking and applications that develop here in India to to serve other countries in the global south. Uh I was just curious do what do you as a a person who looks at this and we'll just

go down the row. What do you see as the biggest opportunity for global south countries in AI adoption? Is there one particular thing that stands out as as uh an attainable uh uh accessible way

that they can speed up adoption and and pull forward some of the gains of this technology for themselves? Yeah, I think you know the starting point is that in the UK we are very

focused on this question of how do we make AI as the summit name suggests impactful for people in their day-to-day lives right across not just the United Kingdom but across the world and so

through our particular program the AI for development program we're very focused on extending the capacity and capability of people across the world uh starting uh at Bletchley with a focus in

particular in Africa and and subsequently throughout Asia as well. The specific thing that I think is uh really promising uh that I'm seeing a lot of in India for example is this

focus not just on the [snorts] huge upside and capability that you get from scaling large language models but instead uh partnering on building small language models uh building very

efficient deployments that work around the realities of people's existing lives workflows and day-to-day experiences uh and as a result are able to drive much faster pace of adoption and diffusion uh

in those uh places. That's what we're very excited about in uh some of the contexts that we're seeing deployment in as well. And in that context, I think becoming uh in Britain the home of open

source talent, making sure that some of the initiatives we have in government through the incubator for AI as well as the AI security institute, building open source infrastructure to be able to then

share that across uh globally uh as well is is a really important part of our toolkit. &gt;&gt; Thank you, David. Well, since uh since it's part of my job, I'll put my policy

hat on. And I will just say every time you have a a a significant technological disruption like this, it provides an opportunity to sort of reset the field. And so in parts of the world, you know,

mobile phones allowed allowed countries to to their their citizens to leapfrog PCs and leaprog the sort of early internet uh into into an an advanced state that they they they can get to

quicker more quickly than it took uh you know other parts of the world even though those technologies may have originally been uh developed there. And I think AI is one of these one of these

opportunities to leapfrog current state and and bring your country into par and if if not leading as as I think India's you know doing uh with using this new technology and so as you see some

countries try to export their regulatory regimes uh that may or may not be ready for for for real use. I think countries uh that are looking at that choice would do well to think about the potential

think about the opportunity to um to use these technologies to really vault forward uh in their their own development journey. &gt;&gt; Okay, Shuby to close us out.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. Um I think the country uh the global south countries the currency is people here a lot of us and uh the youth it's uh young population ready to disrupt ready to learn ready to adapt

with the right kind of infrastructure and skills at scale which we all talked about. Um I think uh I think a lot of companies like Locus can come in the forefront and then that will actually

change the entire um you know picture when it comes to representing AI first technologies in the global platform because we already working with a number of global clients at this point in time

which are uh using our AI capabilities and and we see like at that level they are quite open to trying out new stuff because like I said we are easing them into the use cases. rather than force

fitting certain use cases in the overall scheme of things. So I think it's slow and steady which gets done u we have to get things right which is skills at scale and infrastructure which I think

we take both. So it's just a matter of time. &gt;&gt; Great. We are at time that is a great note to end on. So please join me in thanking our panel and thank you for

your interest and attention. Let's see. No problem. Sorry.
