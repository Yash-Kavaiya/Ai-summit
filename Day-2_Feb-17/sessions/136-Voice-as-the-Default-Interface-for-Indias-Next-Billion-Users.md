## 📝 Summary

India's next billion digital users require voice-first interfaces to overcome literacy, language, and digital literacy barriers that exclude 100s of millions from existing text-based systems. This panel examines how multilingual, emotion-aware voice AI can enable transactions, from banking to healthcare, in native languages on low-end devices. Discussions cover technical requirements for handling code-switching and noisy environments, orchestration with backend systems, enterprise cost reduction, and policy frameworks needed to build inclusive voice-first digital infrastructure at scale.
