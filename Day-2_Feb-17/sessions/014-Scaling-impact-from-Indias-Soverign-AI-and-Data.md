## 📝 Summary

India and many nations are advancing indigenous generative AI to meet local linguistic, cultural, and governance needs while strengthening technology sovereignty. However, models alone cannot deliver national-scale value. Real impact depends on sovereign infrastructure, robust deployment stacks, clear use-case maturity, scalable architectures, and advanced AI research. This panel examines these critical dependencies and imperatives required to translate indigenous AI capabilities into inclusive, measurable outcomes for citizens, the economy, and public institutions.
