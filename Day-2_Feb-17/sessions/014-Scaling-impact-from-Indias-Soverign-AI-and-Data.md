## 📝 Summary

India and many nations are advancing indigenous generative AI to meet local linguistic, cultural, and governance needs while strengthening technology sovereignty. However, models alone cannot deliver national-scale value. Real impact depends on sovereign infrastructure, robust deployment stacks, clear use-case maturity, scalable architectures, and advanced AI research. This panel examines these critical dependencies and imperatives required to translate indigenous AI capabilities into inclusive, measurable outcomes for citizens, the economy, and public institutions.

## 📝 Transcript

utions and enterprises look at sovereign control. As India cementss its position as a global tech powerhouse, we face a critical question. Can we truly be self-reliant if the brains of our

digital economy? Our AI models are built on foreign logic. Our data is hosted on foreign soil and governed by foreign laws. Some very fundamental questions which I think are very relevant in these

times. So today's discussion is not just about technology. It is about strategic autonomy without isolation. And to enable true digital sovereignty, we must move beyond the nation of AI

consumers to becoming a nation of AI architects. Just think about that for a second. AI consumers to becoming AI architects. All of us. And this transition rests on

three non-negotiable pillars. First indigenous AI models. We need models that speak our languages not literally but also culturally. Do we feel comfortable with our children you know

uh working with those models from Bhashini's multilingual strides to Indiaentric LLM such as what Bharatan is building. Our models must understand the nuances of

the most populous country in the world to be truly effective. That was point number one. Second, sovereign infrastructure. Data residency is not enough. We need sovereign clouds

and domestic GPU clusters. If the hardware and hosting are external, the control becomes merely an illusion that can be switched off by a third party. Third, scalable architectures. Our

solutions must work at India scale. A model that works for a million users might fail when applied to our public health or agricultural systems. We need architectures that are hybrid by design,

open by nature, modular, interoperable, and more importantly, resilient. Digital sovereignty is also fueled by advanced research. We cannot rely on technology and models made for use in a

different market forever. We must invest in foundational research that addresses India Indian constraints. Low bandwidth, remote environments, diverse data quality and energy efficient edge

computing. A lot of what we will see with AI is going to happen at the edge. But research without use cases becomes an academic exercise. We must identify problems that are unique to India and

then work towards solving them with human ingenuity and technological productivity. Few questions to consider. How do we use AI to bring credit to the unbanked at a

lower cost? How do we provide precision agriculture to a farmer with a 5,000 rupees smartphone? How do we deliver personalized education in our diverse languages even in the remotest corners

of our country? By solving these, we We don't just secure our own future. We create a blueprint for global use. Innovating in India for India and the world. We are joined today by a panel of

experts who represent the very ecosystem we are discussing. From policy architects shaping our regulations to the researchers who are pushing the boundaries of what's possible. The goal

for the next 40 minutes or so is to move past the why and deep dive into the how. Our panelists will explore the dependencies and imperatives of India's digital future. But before that, we have

two distinguished speakers who will share their thoughts on why scaling impact from India's sovereign AI and data will be key to unlocking our Vixit Bharat vision.

First, Shri Aishek Abishek Singh, additional secretary in the ministry of electronics and information technology, director general of the national informatics center, but more importantly

who leads the India AI mission, you know, with a lot of dexterity and thought and then secondly Anna Paula, senior vice president and chair of IBM Europe, Middle East, Africa and Asia

Pacific. So without further ado, I'd love to welcome Shri Sing to come up on stage and say a few words. [applause] Thank you. Thank you SEP and uh uh

distinguished experts from IBM, from industry, from research community and uh ladies and gentlemen first and foremost I must congratulate IBM for hosting this very very important session on sovereign

AI and how we can use data to to claim sovereignty in today's age of technology and AI and it's indeed amazing to see this room fully packed at uh 9:30 in the morning in spite of the long cues and

the ways to to navigate and to enter. So good. Thank you all for joining in. In fact, the day two of the impact summit we've seen tremendous uh response if there's been any inconvenience we

express regrets. But that's the way it is. uh when the numbers go up and in India when you do anything you do at scale so right from building a population scale identity platform or a

payments platform or a vaccination platform anything that you do or even doing an event like this you have numbers that is sometimes seem overwhelming but yes technology is there

that helps us to navigate a part of it and especially when we talk about sovereign AI as sep mentioned like we need to break down like in today's age of dependencies on the global supply

chains and today's age of working with collaboration with various partners what does sovereignty mean? What does sovereign AI mean? So ideally if you break it down if you break it down and

as our minister had done a few weeks back at Davos like if you break it down into various sovereign AI stack it will include the the energy layer the chip layer the data center layer the

infrastructure layer in in short then the foundation models the uh the data layer the data sets layer and the of course the applications which will drive uh adoption and diffusion of AI. So in

all these layers if you look at it and if you look at where India is of course when it comes to the infrastructure when it comes to having energy when it comes to having surplus renewable energy green

energy required to power uh compute and AI we are quite there we are much self-sufficient and the whole global interest of big corporates in building data centers in India primarily comes

from that because energy is available energy is available at low cost second the cost of building data centers is very low in India so that's why we are seeing lot of invest investments in data

centers at the infrastructure layer we are quite there chip layer of course it requires a lot of work in fact we are working with the global companies including IBM for uh building capacities

in chip design and ensuring that we get self-sufficiency and sovereign control over how and capability for doing that we do our strength remains the designers the chip designers that we have because

we have our chip designers contribute to almost 20% of the chip designers globally so while the capability is there how do we ensure that the initial ial capital that is required to set up

sovereign uh companies which have IP overchip design that is something that we need to work on. Going beyond foundation models of course we do have uh uh server which is

uh demonstrating their foundation model and we are uh and some of the models that they launched in the last few weeks are competing well against benchmarks. So that's that's that's something that's

happening and we hope that six to seven more initiatives which are again showcased at the expo they will also be there. application layer we have had the strength from a long time and uh we do

believe that application layer will be able to do so I believe and I believe that with the right investments policy support partnerships with global companies in the next 3 to 5 years we

will be able to have complete sovereign control complete play at all the layers of sovereign AI stack but that doesn't mean that we do not have sovereign AI at the moment because sovereignty in the

today's age of dependence should also be looked into that what is sovereign. Sovereign should be defined as something wherein you have complete control over what you want to do, how you want to do,

with whom you want to do. It's not necessary that you do everything yourselves. In fact, the way technology is evolving, there will be need for working with each other. There will be

need for working with ASML. There will be need for getting your uh chips taped out at TSMC. And if you are able to decide what you want to do and you have control over the design of the chips

that is what should be considered sovereignty rather than thinking that I will do everything myself because that's not the way things will work out as we move forward. So we need to kind of uh

pivot sovereign AI also in such a way wherein it should mean having control having sovereign control over the way AI should be architected and ultimately the objective that we have what what what is

it that we need sovereign AI for? We need sovereign AI for improving lives of people. This means we should design sovereign AI system that solves our problems. It need not be because the

whole world is chasing AGI, we also start changing AGI and we'll have sovereign AI only if we have our own AGI. No, that's not the way we position it. We position it is that if we can

build AI which can solve problems of millions of Indians who are outside the digital ecosystem, if they are able to access services by using AI, by using voice in their mother tongue and if

they're able to become part of the digital economy, if they're able to benefit, if they're able to improve their productivity, efficiency and and uh increase their incomes and ultimately

move help move the country on the path of economic growth. That is what will be sovereign AI. If we can use AI to solve fundamental problems in in the sectors like healthare, education, agriculture,

if we can empower people, if we can ensure that healthcare reaches every individual at the last mile, that will be sovereignty. So that's how we need to pivot sovereignty. And I'm sure today we

have experts uh we have Amit S who is building a whole research institution. He will share share about how they are trying to contribute to strengthening the research ecosystem within India. And

there are other experts who will share about sovereign AI. We'll have lots to learn from them. So I look forward to hearing from this panel and the deliberations that go in will really

help us contribute to the paths that we follow in the days to come. So thank you once again for hosting this session and look forward to hearing the outcomes. Thank you.

Thank you secretary and uh Sundep for the very kind introduction. I'm really happy to be here to talk about this topic that I think is vital essential essential to the progress of all nations

that u want to embrace AI as a force for progress as a force for good. India uh is at a defining moment in its digital transformation journey. Across the world, governments are taking

deliberate steps to strengthen digital sovereignty to ensure that data, AI systems and critical infrastructure reflect national priorities, regulatory frameworks and societal values.

In India, this ambition carries particular weight given the country's scale, linguistic diversity and global leadership in digital infrastructure. Consider Bashini, India's national

language translation mission. It is more than a technology platform. It is a bridge. By supporting more than 36 Indian languages, it enables a farmer in Uttar

Pradesh or a student in Tamil Nadu to participate in the digital economy in their mother tongue. That is sovereignty translated into inclusion. But sovereign AI is not simply about

developing indigenous models. It is about ensuring those capabilities translate into economic resilience, institutional trust and inclusive growth at scale.

Digital sovereign today means the ability to innovate with control to deploy AI responsibly, protect sensitive data, maintain operational continuity and avoid technology locking.

It requires trusted architecture, open architectures and governance framework that embed accountability from design through deployment. The urgency is clear.

Growing regulatory and technological demands are accelerating sovereign strategies worldwide. In fact, by 2030, the majority of enterprises outside the United States are expected to have a

formal digital sovereign strategy in place. India is not just participating in this shift, it is helping define it. The next phase is about scale.

Sovereign AI and data frameworks must move beyond policy ambition and pilots to become embedded in real workflows across healthcare, agriculture with financial inclusion, public

administration and industrial capabilities. From an enterprise perspective, there are three dimensions of sovereignty that leaders must consider.

First, data sovereignty. The economic value of data is realized at the point of processing, not merely storage. True data sovereignty ensures

governance, transparency, and compliance across the entire data life cycle, retaining both trust and economic benefit within a national jurisdiction. Second, technology sovereignty.

A sovereign technology stack must be built for choice. It should operate fluidly across enterprises, private, public, and at the edge,

grounded in open standards and opensource foundations, ensuring transparency, auditability, and long-term control without locking.

Third, operational sovereignty. Mission critical systems must remain resilient and insulated from external disruptions. Operational sovereignty ensures

continuity uptime and independent control over processes. Achieving this requires a fundamental architectural shift where sovereignty is

not an overlay but an inherent property of the platform itself. That means customer operated control planes where organizations retain direct authority over deployment and system

configuration. identity encryption keys and access management that remain within jurisdictional boundaries. Logs, telemetry and audit trails

generated and governed locally. AI models and inference executed under local oversight with full traceability and governance. This is the philosophy behind IBM's

sovereign core approach embedding sovereignty into the cloud and AI architecture itself rather than treating treating it as a compliance afterthought.

Importantly, sovereignty does not mean isolation. It means choice and control. It means being globally connected while retaining the power to define its own digital

path. In summary, sovereignty is not autocracy. Hybrid cloud plays a central role hereby enabling governments and enterprises to manage sensitive workloads securely

while still leveraging the global innovation. Secure data governance frameworks will be foundational in India's next phase of digital growth. Today's discussion is

therefore not only about the what as Sundep said of sovereign AI and data. It is about the how. How do we move from successful pilots to national transformation?

How do we ensure that sovereign capabilities translate into measurable economic and social outcomes? Because while AI may be the engine, data the fuel and infrastructure the road,

our collective responsibility is to ensure every citizen can undertake that journey with trust, transparency, and security. I look forward to an enriching discussion and how we can make that

vision a reality here in India. Thank you very much. [applause] Thank you Sep. Uh thank you Abhishek G and thank you Anna for uh setting the stage so well helping us um have a

framework here for the discussion today around what sovereign AI means why it's important for India u you know what what should the stack have what are the ingredients around AI around data around

control around infrastructure uh around skills uh because all of these are the ingredients that we're going to talk about next over the next 35 minutes or so with uh very exciting panel of uh

I think not just eminent but extremely knowledgeable experts in a lot of these ingredient areas. Uh it's my pleasure to moderate this panel and I'm going to invite them one by one because the

chairs are a little tight. Um so professor Amit you can please come here take your seat and we have Mr. Rajiv Chaitwani

Rishi Mr. Rishibal and Milal please. Okay. So I'll request uh each of the panelists to just take 10 15 minutes and self introduce themselves. Uh that's probably the easiest way to do it. So,

Tani, could you please? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Hi everyone. Good morning. Uh, thank you for having me. So, I'm Tanvi Lal. I head strategy for uh a philanthropic initiative called E plus

AI. We are a part of Foundation uh which has been founded by Nandan and along with Chanka. Uh we've been around for about uh 10 to 12 years and uh you know historically have focused on uh building

digital public infrastructure for India which financial inclusion. So projects like Aadhaar, UPI uh and then many more in the education space. People plus is very focused on AI for good and uh you

know going back to what sitana said thinking about AI diffusion and how do we create diffusion pathways that actually help these large scale use create impact. So more than just

thinking about use cases at pilots, what will it take? What are the ingredients? What are the ecosystems that have to come together for impact? &gt;&gt; Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Yeah, thanks for having me here. U really excited to be here. My name is Rishi Bal and I lead the gen team at Bajen. Uh we are building India sovereign AI and ecosystem. very

passionate about the future of AI and the future of AI in India and creating the builders that we need to build the applications and the models that are needed to succeed. At Bharajin, we think

a lot about three things. We think a lot about sovereignty, Indianness and accessibility. And with sovereignty, we think a lot about supply security, the ability to

service your own AI and the ability to know what's gone into the AI that you deploy inside your sensitive sectors. With Indianness, we think a lot about language of course, but we think about a

lot about culture and perspective and how do you have LLMs that actually encode your own culture and perspective uh in the way they speak and interact with you. And with accessibility, we We

think a lot about a lot about cost, right? Cost is not an afterthought when you operate in India. U we think a lot about voice first as a modality that will drive AI adoption. And then we also

think a lot about what are the underserved sectors that we can go into early on and so that we don't need to wait for somebody else to build that AI support for us.

Good morning to all of you. Thanks for inviting me for this panel. I am Rajiv. I'm outstanding scientist at ISO and director for director of information systems and management. I'm with past 28

years. It's delight to come to be here among all of you. I was asked to introduce myself. So very briefly

I went to US in 81. One of the most defining moment of that as I just shared was the letter by Dr. Yashpal then director of for my application. So I've done a

couple of internship at I don't know why but anyway that changed one territory um 44 and a half years there in US I just returned back to India with my wife

um in US I worked for three companies had commercial products for my research uh I worked for three unities and did very substantial research research organizations

you know well known in their fields in the world and um [clears throat] I uh did four startups three of them in AI and licensing my own team's research of the companies and they done well um and

uh and my take away there is that or gain was the training of exceptional researchers and students they have become entrepreneurs they become you know they've gone to

academia and tier one schools and such and and they in industry and they've gotten outstanding you know awards multiple of them one of them is right there common um at IBM uh at Watson

and then chance uh uh thing happened was uh I used to meet the PM in uh on December 27th 2023 um my objective was to discuss the the part of the AI that we should focus on

and make our own you know we we have to be excellent in owning that particular part. So like western large language models uh for the general purpose consumer market is one different thing

Chinese models are very different uh India has its own um opportunity particularly focusing on high mission critical application high value applications perhaps we don't need uh we

we do need some large language models and and others are doing excellent job particularly with the linguistic part but there are a lot of business aspects manufacturing pharma

finance very high quality models uh with far less challenges and problems less hallucination uh and that on which they can build global products and

you know the chairman of our board a chri and sharma also they've been talking about India as a product nation. So with that um IO Indian AI research organization and we

shamelessly borrowed from ISRO so change to AI because we want to borrow some of the good things that ISRO has done for this nation. Um and um we are singular we are doing something I think

that is new of all create highestend talent. So India a lot of thing going for skills um and many many even you know we have created programming for high school students to teach them AI

that's going on I know is not needed for that but really high-end innovators um and then prototype to product that the that PMS talked about and then take

strategic area particularly creation of these custom compact neo symbolic AI models and AI systems which are meant for you know high safety high explanability high lot of reasoning

planning other kind of uh capabilities that uh you need for solution and few verticals that we have chosen I'll end there &gt;&gt; thank you okay so let's get to the

exciting questions we have uh and we'll start with rishi um rishi as you bajan is building sovereign models from scratch for India. Uh are there priority areas where you see these fully

sovereign models being imported for India and where do you see traction and what is the what is needed in the technology ecosystem to realize that impact from these

and uh just a reminder because there's big red time board there let's keep an eye on it all of us &gt;&gt; thanks and you can always If I'm going over time, I I'd say that u you know the

need for sovereign AI is across the board. Um but there's probably going to be some phasing in terms of how we and I think we have to think about what are what are the important sectors

that we can start with what are the sensitive sectors that we can start with and and think of it as a journey rather than a you know sector by sector adoption. What I would expect to see is

that we will have areas or or verticals within every sector where we'll see adoption parts of governance parts of citizen facing work that we're doing pieces of work within the financial

industry right in some ways I think there's also an interesting opportunity to start thinking of what do the digital rails in the AI sphere start the field itself is rapidly changing but

there is opportunity for us to to think ahead and and think about what enablement can we do so that everyone else that's building on top of AI or using AI can both build faster but

perhaps as importantly in a in a safer way. So maybe what I'll do is I'll actually expand on that answer to say that you know what we have to think about is

sovereignty in the context of the whole ecos. So how do we how do we have an ecosystem of models of of inference architectures of shared components that we can deploy across the country.

There's certainly going to be an opportunity where startups and and companies need to innovate and and build something that's unique, but there's also an opportunity for us to have

shared goods and and shared digital programs that everybody can leverage. And so what will be interesting I think in the coming years is to see how this infrastructure and ecosystem can be put

together. &gt;&gt; It's a great point. Yeah, you can't build it just with one entity, right? Okay. Uh so Rajiv G isro is unique in some ways because ISRO has a tremendous

amount of data that perhaps is unlocked yet but ISRO also can be a big consumer for its own applications of AI. So how does ISRO look at the emergence of sovereign AI models and sovereign

infrastructure in India and are there opportunities here to leaprog uh on the impact that the data from ISRO can create for the nation including geospatial data

&gt;&gt; sovereign my perspective on sovereign AI as applicable to ISRO is defined by a fine balance between uh strategic security requirements and the

massive data available especially geospatial data. Sovereign AI is viewed not just as a tool but as a strategic autonomy requirement and as a critical infrastructure in space observation and

earth observation and space operations. In fact, it's a strategic necessity for security, autonomy and technical self. The way I see it from perspective is

that the AI infrastructure needs to be onremise and it should not require direct that's a requirement from the strateg should be

file transfer transfer the file using one way transfer mechanism and update the software and we can't depend on opaque AI so the the blackbox AI is not acceptable what

we need is a glass box AI the complete transparency on how the models are trained including the lineage of training data and weights of the model. The uh

training pipeline also needs to be auditable and we need to use is not just sovereign AI, it extends to AI sovereignity. So it is not just comput capacity or data resency within

national borders but it also includes applicability of national legal framework which is very important and government is working on the right steps in that direction.

Coming to the second part of temporal multi significantly enhances the view of value of geing insight.

It can be applied to agriculture for crop monitoring for predicting yields to detect pest infestation. It can also be applied for disaster management for use cases like early

prediction of flood and depth of water rocks. Even for zonation of landslide susceptibility zones can be applied. It has applications in prediction of extreme weather conditions. By the way,

national Atmospheric research laboratory works in that direction and for this application we also need uh high resolution climate and weather models and advanced computing system. Another

application is monitoring from land and it is arising out of the rapid urbanization and using. Then there are many other applications like differentiating between snow cover

and cloud cover. Then what we call it normalized differential vegetation index prediction, urban sprawl applications and then 3D city model generation, natural color visualization in satellite

imagery, land use land classification applications. Even uh the surface monitoring, the surface fire monitoring in gold mines is one application. There are host of application data can be

of in geospatial applications. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you for that. So next we go to Tani. So Tani people plus AI pays a lot of attention to use

cases that can scale and horizontal enablers. Today we are starting to see deployment of conversational and automation AI agents in India. Do you see areas that

need attention to actually scale impact from these indigenous efforts and is there a real need to establish trust to enable this scale? &gt;&gt; I mean a very short answer is yes.

&gt;&gt; I hope it's not that short. Yes. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. So uh uh firstly the uh uh you know as a philanthropy uh our goal is to really study what's happening in the ecosystem and we try to focus on AI

for social good. So these high sectors like education, agriculture, healthare and we really what we've understood is that uh AI truly is being developed as a general purpose

technology. It's very similar to maybe how electricity or internet were you know whenever decades back when they were invented and very similarly if you don't create

diffusion pathways uh roots for this GPT general purpose technology to reach the people it won't uh so while and you know we've seen so many use cases just come out on this

panel in the last 10 minutes while a lot of value and purpose like it could help a person in climate monitoring or uh you know the value of the use case is lives in a sector in a vertical sector it

could be agri fintech uh manufacturing climate wherever it is but to for that use case to really create impact it needs many many horizontal enablers to unlock that value and I'll

give you a simple example when it comes to uh uh AI aents Let's take the example of Mahavistar. Very simply, Mahavistar is a comprehensive AI advisory bot that's

being deployed today in Maharashtra to serve 15 million farmers. Uh this is available through app. It's available through a browser. But please realize farmers today have $20 feature

phones. So the first thing they thought of was how can I create a voice telephone solution which can work in Marathi. So while the value is being created for a In Maharashtra the first

horizontal enabler is working with voice in multi. Mahavasar is highly benefited also from compute and models that are coming not just from one entity but many so they

work with India mission Nvidia open anthropic they work with uh ASR models coming from AIAR which is an indigenous uh institute which is creating data sets and models which work with ASR and

that's just the technology layer. So the first thing that's needed for indigenous agents to create impact is operational and that comes from the technology but it also comes from creating solutions

that can deal with very noisy environments. So for example in Maharashtra they very early on they realized when it was launched in May 2025 that the types of questions because

it's an advisory institution the types of questions that male farmers ask female farmers and the types of environments they ask is it in a home versus a farm environment is crucial to

actually delivering them. So the first piece is operation readiness and a key part here is what data systems are you plugging from right so in the case of Maharashtra there are 50 plus crops

there so it's very important that you talk to the IC or the mundies that are sitting in Maharashtra so that you get their local information so AI ready data systems from

Maharashtra became very important the second thing is institutional capacity agents as technology agents themselves not impact you have to think about the surrounding institutional capacity

within the state of Maharashtra and the department of agriculture that needs to get so for example if a farmer is calling up and asking a question now it needs it needs to get triaged by an

extension team you should be thinking about that extension from the kind of capacity and the third piece which we realize is actually the most important is trust so

A farmer is receiving an answer and not they need someone to stand behind that answer and say I am giving you this answer. you trust me as an institution and hence you know you should be using

this and the okay I know who is the persona person institution behind this uh advice that I'm getting and hence I should continue and what we realized is uh and uh you

know sort of spoke about this uh there is some amount of knowhow that's been created in mahabasal and uh you know we quickly realized that in agree solutions not just in Maharashtra

But in other states in Africa uh we should be able to package this knowhow and give it to them. While it took a couple of quarters to get to Maharashtra, they uh did a launch in

Ethiopia within three months because they said okay this is the vertical weather use cases. These are the horizontals that are needed for agri for farmer advisory and they said okay

Ethiopia can actually get started with the solution in uh last week uh there was a release called intelligence which is focused on daily farmer women daily farmers in that

solution delivery not just technology development that ent package operational readiness institution capacity. So we feel there's a lot of uh and you

know just see the panel itself you're not asking this one type of entity this question you're asking many different right we all have to sort of come together and enable that

&gt;&gt; thank you then that's uh actually quite insightful professor Amit um question for you uh you know IRO is an ambitious effort to create deep

skills research capacity address real problems um as you engage this ecos system. What are a couple of key actions you think that the Indian AI ecosystem needs to

take to advance and to benefit from advanced AI research and to ensure that there is long-term self-reliance, scalability and leadership? &gt;&gt; Thank you Amit. Um

suppose I was the gentleman who started Leapse. I had all the money that he has and I wanted to start deep and um wanted 200 to 250 top-notch AI researchers and engineers. How many of

you think I can get those people here right now? I would love to discuss with them. you know perhaps they're not using them personally as the uh you know population

scale but generally speaking um with only three raising the hand you see what's the situation we have um our businesses have chosen to invest in things that are very incremental

um IRO is a PPP uh and when I went to many corporates uh about uh support for research um and building uh the deep uh innovation expertise. Uh most of them were interested in treating us as um uh

contractor what I if I give you this how what can you deliver to me in you know by quarterly that's what they are looking for that's not how research capacity is built. Let me share another

very interesting. I just asked while I was s sitting there a question to Gemini. How many uh uh technology person who went to foreign countries for their

graduate studies returned? For India the answer is 15 to 20% are have return. The answer for China is guess what? So according Germany it is 86% have returned right and when I visited

China earlier in 2005 u already the thousand scholars program had started and some of the top people were now many of those people who returned went into academia and research

institutions how many um highend PhDs we produce in India Let me uh give you an example of what high end would mean. About onethird of

my PhD students so far 38 graduated 10 more to come have had more than 10,000 citations before they graduate and averages more than 500. This is one measure. There are many

measures for success but nevertheless for research that is the case. at conference out of 30,000 submissions China had 22,000 right so um

severe lack of high-end talent is the challenge uh our local production is not that high um uh there are ex uh there are exceptions no doubt I can tell you a few

exceptions but by and large um if they are high quality they AR conferences I don't see any of them the ratio is 1 to 20 in China so creation of talent highend talent not

the skills not something that we can learn from few courses but one in a guru system where they work and learn from you know exceptional environment ecosystem which us I have in US that

needs to be brought in. The first thing is uh uh the aspect uh where you know you really have the deep talent is the first thing uh that we really need and then uh we really need to um

think about our own uh you know needs and technologies but the one that has global implication global value uh you know high-tech companies from west are making a lot of money here

they're using our data they're making a lot of monies here well We ought to also create an environment where uh these highly technical people get into prototype to product. They get into

uh you know uh the IP is converted into global products and then India makes uh you know guesses value by solving Indian problem but also global problem. Yes, India has unique

problem. Yes, you should solve them. But economically if you're going to be successful you got to look at the world right there many companies from India that are moving back moving to US there

was one company that I'm advising on board of and their investors are now uh US based or going to US based and customers are US based so they are moving there we need to solve uh you

know those kind of issues here such that um as again uh the members of my say you know Ajit Chowri and Sir Sharma and others say we need to uh really make product nation and AI is sure that or

clearly an important part of uh India becoming product nation &gt;&gt; thank you thank you for that I think we have time for one rapid fire follow-up question

and maybe we'll go in the reverse order this time so having heard the discussion today do you see any particular areas of synergy or priority that may have arisen for you or any call to action you'd like

to make to this community. &gt;&gt; Yeah, first of all, you know, I sitting next to uh Ricky Bal and um uh and um I you know, it's clearly there is uh desire for uh you know strong

collaboration. Yesterday I was at NDMA and uh also uh IDM the muto you know department strong uh desire to share the data perhaps if I go uh to you know we'll get

positive answer so far as we take care of security and other issues like so um I think that the institutions that are coming up here are clearly uh quite ready to collaborate there are people um

my own partner in Iro is a investor but she's part of this highly technical mission. So again I mean we have IO has already um support from angels seed and uh scale you know scale

up VCs and um so if we really can develop deep tech for us to be able to take care of number of issues for getting them to the market uh that this collaboration is making will make that

much more possible. So I'm very very bullish on what lies &gt;&gt; Rajiv G either any synergy that stood out or any call to action for the community.

&gt;&gt; So uh what I see is the today focus is on consumer applications and enterprise AI applications but for strategic sector what is required is a trustworthy reliable AI mission grade AI and uh

which is auditable which is explainable I I give one quick example. So it's very generic. I will not get into specific. There is a use case where uh a part or a component needs to be

cleared visually. Visually I mean using instruments which provide magnified and there is a technician which looks at probably looking for micro cracks or something like that. Now this can be

these images the the magnified images can be fed to AI and AI can take us decision clear or not but the the risks are very high so unless we know how AI made a particular decision

we cannot depend on that and that's what professor also talked about so this is what entrepreneurs have to look at for strategic sector requirement I would say

that same question U this is a super interesting panel discussion and I think that question sort of ties it together which is as I'm

looking across this group the question I'm asking myself is how can I collaborate with each one of the people here which is I would love I see as an AI builder right we live in our own

bubble we build AI benchmark we put things out there but the thing that's most valuable to me is the actual feedback side from real people real industries governments that are actually

building on top of the work that we do, right? And in some ways, when you're when you're using sovereign AI solutions, you're making an investment back into an ecosystem

where you will derive the benefits, right? You're not just contributing into it, but if you have an AI builder that's literally sitting next to you, right? This is an opportunity for us to build

something together that somebody sitting, you know, half the world around is not going to do, right? So I think more engagement between all of us in terms of use cases. I also want to echo

sort of the the comment made earlier which is is it needs a full stack. This is not just about can I put an AI out there, right? And I I want to caution everyone on this because sort of the

tech perspective on this is let me build a farmer AI, right? For whatever reason, I've met, you know, half a dozen people now that have done farmer AI and it feels like something very simple to do,

but it's actually very difficult to actually make valuable and deploy to somebody who can actually use it. So when you come together, you can actually create that depth of thinking and actual

utility for the end users and customers. &gt;&gt; Thanks Rishi. &gt;&gt; Uh so you know the emerging thesis is that AI is only as good as the data it has access to and even just see the

breadth of not just knowledge but data systems that each one of us is sitting behind. Uh so my call to action and urge is that we have to start thinking of data as a foundation. If you are sitting

on data it could be public sector, civil society, private sector. How do I strengthen that foundation? But secondly, how do I create access such that AI models and applications can

actually be built on top of it. Uh so AI readiness of data is crucial and we have to actively think about it because just like no one entity can make a use case successful. It has to be a culmination

of a collaboration of many. Similarly, it's very unlikely that just one data source will create the perfect application. many data silos have to be broken and brought together. So uh uh

you know and I genuinely believe there's a lot of emphasis on compute and foundational models in India. Uh but there needs to be an equal emphasis and action taken on the database because if

you're not able to open up our data sources then we are receiving answers which are not applicable to us. Right? So that's both a call to action uh and also an urge that if you're thinking

about this please do talk reach out to me and people plus AI because we are actively thinking about this in different sectors. &gt;&gt; Awesome. Thank you and I think we made

it just in time. We could not get to question and answers. I apologize but it was a very short uh time for the entire session. Thank you everybody for your attention today. Enjoy the rest of the

day. Oh, we have some
