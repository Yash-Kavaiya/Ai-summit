## 📝 Summary

As AI moves beyond language, new foundation models are emerging that predict, design, and translate materials into manufacturable processes. This panel brings together academia, industry, and infrastructure partners to discuss physics-focused foundational models, their responsible applications in biology, energy, and manufacturing, and the national strategies needed for sovereign capability. Attendees will see a live Physics model demo, explore technical and ethical challenges, policy frameworks, and map pathways for industrial validation, pilot deployment, and collaborative scaling.
