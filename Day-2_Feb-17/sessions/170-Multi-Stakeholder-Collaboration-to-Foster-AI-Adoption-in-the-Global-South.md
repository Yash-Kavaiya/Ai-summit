## 📝 Transcript

holder collaboration to foster uh AI adoption in the global south and it's my pleasure to welcome and introduce Mr. Rahman Pandi who's the CEO of center for responsible item address and he's also

going to be wearing the moderator moderator's hat today. Over to you sir. &gt;&gt; Thank you Satan. It's it's a it's a privilege to be here uh representing

Sai as well as Vani AI. Um this reminds me of uh an instance uh in Seattle when 15 minutes before the session I was told that I was going to be one of the panelists because somebody didn't show

up. It's not that short a notice but I am the host today. However, the Alpan who was supposed to be the moderator today uh has been called out of town. So I'm going to be the moderator as well

today. Okay. Uh I hope that that day it did go well. I hope with your support with your support today's session I'm pretty sure it will go well. Let's collaborate on this one.

Uh so first let me introduce our eminent panel. Okay. So we have my friend Professor Dame Wendy Hall. She she tells me or she tells everyone that even though Dame is a pretty coveted title,

professor comes first &gt;&gt; because that's the noble profession. &gt;&gt; No, that's not right. &gt;&gt; Dave title goes with your first name. So I'm

&gt;&gt; so it's closely associated with the first name, right? &gt;&gt; So um since again this is kind of last moment I'm going to use a cheat sheet to introduce people. Okay. Um so Wendy um

she is DBE FRS. Yes. uh this regious professor regious

professor of computer science associate vice president of international engagements and the director of web science institute at the university of Southampton.

Uh she became the dame of British Empire in 2009 in the New Year's honors list. It's actually commander. &gt;&gt; Dame commander.

&gt;&gt; It's actually Dame commander occasionally. &gt;&gt; There's a little bit of the British Empire that I command &gt;&gt; and um as we don't have the empire

anymore, I don't know it really exists, but I'm a dame commander. &gt;&gt; But nevertheless, she does have a commanding presence. So um well, I know her from my and her ACM

days as well. Um Association for Computing Machinery. uh she's the adviser to the UK government and also uh other governments as well as United Nations. Welcome.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Dr. Aisha Wal Bryant. Uh she's senior staff research scientist and head of head of Google research Africa with sites in Acra that's Ghana uh and

Nairobi Kenya. She has over a decade of experience uh working in Africa and uh she leads teams to develop innovative uh technologies that leverage AI and u computing to

address Africa's most uh well Africa's challenges um and she drives uh Google research Africa food security and agricultural research um and they are developing AI

technology and tools tools that address food insecurity in Africa and also extending it globally. Welcome to the panel. [applause]

Professor Vukosi Marate. Uh Vikosi is professor of computer science and holds uh ABSA up chair of data

science at the University of Pritoria. Um he specializes in developing machine learning ML and AI uh methods to extract insights from data with a particular focus on the intersection of A IML and

NLP natural language processing. uh his research is dedicated to improving the methods, tools and availability of data uh for local and low resource languages. As the leader of data science for social

impact research group in computer science department, uh Vukosi is interested in using data science to solve social challenges which is very relevant for our session.

Thank you for being with us. [applause] Safia Hussein. Uh she is the chief impact officer and co-founder of uh Karia. She grew up in uh central Asia and has a background of humanitarian

work and research. Before Ken before Kar co-ounded two companies in India and worked as a research consultant for 3IIE and United Nations later at Stir Education I hope I'm say pronouncing it

right. uh and she led the monitoring and evaluation with design of some big impact uh research um research projects. Thank you very much for being here. Makaran Makran Tapasi. Dr. Makran

Tapasui is the principal uh ML uh scientist at Vadrani AI which is our partner for this uh this panel discussion. uh and and focuses on using AI for social

good. [clears throat] Uh he's also an assistant professor at CVIT, the computer visual group at triple Hyderabad. And at Vadwani, he's developing and deploying AI solutions

that create social impact in education, health and agriculture. Welcome to the panel. [applause] And finally, Dr. Nyati Chaya. uh she currently leads AI and um and co-founder

at uh Hyperbots Inc. She spent a decade at Adobe Research before starting up Hyperbots as a part of their research team focused on NLP and multimodel content uh content understanding. In

addition to her industry career, she has been teaching at triple IT Hyderabad and ISB as a junk faculty and holds several patents and publications to her credit. So as you can see we have a very eminent

panel and before I also give the context I'll show you why I'm saying that this is eminent and also relevant uh panel for our panel discussion today on multistakeholder collaboration because

as you can see from the description we have rep if not representative but advisor to multiple governments so working with governments

people from industry. There is one person who's with industry as well as academia. So wearing double hats, people from academia and also nonprofit organizations. So we

do have a very good sample here. And also another thing is that they are obviously consumers not only creators but consumers of product of AI right now.

Okay. AI itself has become a product now. So some of them are parents I mean various roles a person is student all the time. So anyway, so what I wanted to bring out is that uh opportunity, the

potential of collaborating right there in our panel itself. Okay, again welcome uh welcome to this panel. uh they also represent uh potential for collaboration across geographies because as we said uh

Africa, South Africa, um UK, India. Okay. So, uh that again represents a lot of global south. I know &gt;&gt; except &gt;&gt; except food you know perhaps England's

move away from Europe &gt;&gt; Bendy is used to being the diversity person from the gender perspective now you're diversity from geography as [laughter]

&gt;&gt; okay [snorts] so um &gt;&gt; I'll see you &gt;&gt; so uh yesterday in one of yesterday's panels people that was in the context of education so people talked about um how

everybody has a responsibility when it comes to um AI that may not be accountability or liability. Liability may lie with somebody some with the

institution or rather some the entity which institutionalizes it. But the responsibility of moral accountability lies with everybody. Okay.

Now with that again from the beginning there is need for collaboration. There is need for multiple stakeholders coming together so that from the design development up to deployment we have

collaboration which is inherent to it. Okay. So anyway, with this context, I'm going to launch into our our panel and um I'm going to um

ask a common question. Okay, I'm going to throw a common question to all of you and we'll go in the round robin fashion. Okay. Um so and that question is going to be please tell us in 2 to 3 minutes

each uh by the way the timer hasn't started here so is it because [laughter] this is the last session &gt;&gt; starting

&gt;&gt; so can the timer be started lean &gt;&gt; into it come &gt;&gt; yeah so time stands still really for this panel okay so the question that I'm going to have and each one answers in

their own way. In short, is that can you briefly summarize uh your work for our audience today uh especially highlighting how disparate stakeholders play an integral part in developing AI

solutions responsibly and what are the challenges inherent to it. So we'll start with Wendy. &gt;&gt; Okay, thank you HT. Hello everybody. Hello.

&gt;&gt; Hi. Um, so I think I I could talk about a lot of things. Um, but I think I should talk about the work of the UN advisory board because um, it was a huge um, my

background is I'm a I'm a computer scientist. um most well known for the web and the internet work I've done and the um I've always used AI though throughout and but

I was catapulted into AI policy by Theresa May when she was prime minister and I wrote co-wrote an AI review for the UK. So it sort of developed our national strategy for AI back in 2017.

This was before the chat GPT moment and uh but we all knew the m you know it was coming that the generative AI machine learning was coming but we didn't know how it was going to arrive. Um and then

uh in uh just there was chat GPT moment November 22 and that led to effectively the first one of these summits at Bletchley Park which I was much much smaller than this and I was privileged

to attend that. Um and we launched the AI safety institute there but also just at that time um it was October 23 the UN announced their high level advisory board um the AI advisory board and I was

hugely privileged beyond that there were 40 of us from around the world I mean you can you can't represent the whole world with 40 people but they it was very u multiddisciplinary

um mixed gender diverse but it was also So um very um I would say maybe half of the people there were from the global south on I can't remember exactly but it was it was very um geographically

diverse. We had people from China as well which is so important. I know it's um I mean if this conference was in China there'd be a lot of Chinese people there obviously but it is Chinese New

Year and I don't think there are that many of the Chinese people here. But um to me it's so important if we're going to talk about global governance of AI and how we get people to adopt AI, we

have to have China in the conversation as much as we have to have clearly the US and and and everywhere else in the world. But the US and China, China's got to be at the table. So the UN board had

two Chinese people on it and it was very very um well set up in that sense. uh we produced our report called governing um AI for humanity in September 24

um and that was at the UN General Assembly and in that we focused a lot on AI for everybody. I love the phrase by the way we keep seeing around in India AI stands for all inclusive. Is that

what it is? Have you seen the phrase all inclusive? Um, so the report was very much about and you're seeing the implementation of that report now. It was very much about how we get global

governance of of AI in a way that is all inclusive for the whole world and not just the rich west or the rich south of China. And um at just week ago they announced

um one of our first recommendations was for a global scientific um board and I Ravi is on it. I don't know if there's anyone else here. Are you on it?

&gt;&gt; But so guys you got to do great service on this. Okay. There's a lot writing on it. Lot of responsibility. I It's hard work by the way [laughter] and um because but you know it's f

There's there's a lot writing on this this panel and then there's supposed to be another one of our recommendations was a global dialogue about um AI and I think and we meant that to be policy

makers I believe that will be launched if it goes well at the AI for good conference in um in July. I'm going to more or less finish there because I can we could talk more about it if you want

to, but to me um the UN although potentially these days a flawed organization, an organization that doesn't have a lot of money, it is the only game in town when we're talking

about global and inclusive of the global south and China. Um talking about how we make AI safe, how we make it good for humanity, right? And so I would urge you all to follow what's going on there.

Thank you very much. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you for the background. Aisha. &gt;&gt; Hello. Hi everyone. Thank you uh for coming out today for for this great

panel in the evening just before dinner. Uh I'm Aisha. Um so I lead our Google research Africa team. Uh the work that we primarily do is um pioneering AI for Africa from Africa

to the world. A lot of our solutions that we develop um are by African scientists and researchers or collaborators across uh Google research broadly that are wanting to impact the

continent. But what we've seen is much of this work has scaled. Uh so we cover domains in climate, sustainability, health, education and others. Um much of what we do is this stakeholder

partnership. Uh I always say for me personally, I'm thinking about my community, children, um and what's the future of AI given our demographic dividend both in Africa and

in India, India. Um so we're building that future and I think a lot of this spirit comes out in our research team. Um some of the core uh interesting aspects of the work that we do is it's

kind of uh research innovation to product innovation to impact and we're very very rigorous and serious around measuring impact. It's a lot. If you are a scientist, you like to play on this

side, do something really creative, but if we're not able to get a path to impact, this is not the right project for us. So, picking that right project is very important around scale uh not

just for the continent but for the world. I'll give two examples of this multistakeholder collaboration and how we work. One in weather and the other in African languages which we just

launched. Um so our weather work our teams work with the local Met agencies across the continent and for many of you all uh you may know that in North America and Europe there's about 300

radar stations uh for for weather and in Africa there's an order of magnitude less about 37 and you know we can fit North America Europe and many other places uh inside of Africa. So you can

imagine the dir of of data that we have in that space. So our team was able to work uh and to create an innovation that leveraged satellite data and a global model that enabled us to launch a global

weather now casting that if you land in Africa you'll now find on search and you'll get precipitation estimations for 5 kilometer radius. So this is where your unique context just like in India

this is not a challenge or a barrier this is a breakthrough or innovation this is something that you guys can bring to the world the second example I'll do is working with collaborators on

more on the data collection side so if you think about it uh languages across India across Africa thousands and the way to reach AI doesn't always have to be from a keyboard and it can't

we have literacy barriers we have various uh uh barriers to entry and so what is an inclusive approach speech so we created a data set well actually through partnerships with Marera

University in Uganda with digital um and a number of other partners where it's partnershipled they uh collect the language speech and language data in order to make it open and available

to the communities. They own the data as well. What we've done is launch it as open-source 11,000 hours of ASR that's automated speech recognition and text to speech uh on hugging face for you

developers and it's called Wahal NLP. Wahal is Woolof in Sagal for speak. So this is one way that it's completely partnership driven and led and we're using technology as a as a layer to

amplify and reach the ecosystem in the community especially for languages. So those are some examples of the working and collaboration. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Um we'll pick up on some of

the points that you said later in the question and answer. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay. Uh nice to be here and good evening. Um yeah I I I wear a number of hats but uh for today I'll highlight

two. Um so on one being at at the university uh my my big interest is on African languages and how how we deal uh with that being represented in a lot of uh machine learning or natural language

processing. Uh but a thing I wanted to high like maybe uh give as a way for people to appreciate this um is on one side you might ask and say like where's the data for all these languages? Africa

has 2,000 3,000 languages and and many of them um like you know we would take them as being low resource. It doesn't mean they don't have many many speakers. They do uh but there might not be just

this digital presence that then makes it like you know easier for developers or other people to be able to use. Um if you only look at that as a technical problem uh you are going to very quickly

kind of run out of of of railway track. Uh so you then have to look at kind of the social technical and this is where now thinking about the community the partnerships as Aisha um has actually

said and even how uh people actually see languages becomes very important. Uh so one of the challenges that you have in in normally small languages or uh or like maybe the political nature of

working with language is then uh what happens in terms of what the community people are expecting on the use of a language in society if they're not expecting it to be used in math or

physics or astronomy. It limits then some of its kind of wider applicability when you think about where you're going to now build up systems. So you you now have to think who's the user at the end

of the day, what is it that they're expecting and those things. So a lot of our researcher at at at the university is trying to figure this out. So had to break out just not being in just the

computer science department but working with African languages, working with law on how then you can think about equitable licensing uh as a way to give power to kind of communities. On the

other side, it's been great also sitting next to Kia here. Um, I'm one of the co-founders of Laba AI, an AI startup company u that works and now building these uh kind of language technologies

uh but then at the end being uh available to businesses to enable that they can reach uh their stakeholders in a much better way. So there are a lot even there in working and saying how

you're going to improve those systems. you have to then think about partnerships and these multistakeholder u kind of relationships and that's where I will then hand it over uh to to thank

you &gt;&gt; thank you okay thank you thank you so much um so I mean I think maybe some of some of the work that Kadia does has been introduced

but um just to give a brief overview we're an impact focused AI and digital services company and we work all the way from the data set like data set collection to annotation all the way to

evaluations and I think I'm actually quite lucky to be flanked by two of the stakeholders that that we do work with uh both Lalapa and Radwani AI um so I think for us because we actually sit at

a very interesting place we sit almost as an intermediary between this extremely vast workforce of data collectors that I think Aisha mentioned as well as on the other side model

builders and big tech companies and a lot of the work that we have to do is creating a little bit of translation between these two. On the one end, because we work with a lot of low-income

communities, we have to create value for the types of data that they can create and we have to connect directly to, you know, ecosystem and model players to say, hey, you actually need to involve

these people. Um, so I think for us, you know, and I think when I talk about collaboration, I'm going to speak a little bit at the worker level because I think we need to increase not only the

representation, but also I think the knowledge that people have about this industry and what your individual human so everyone in this room, you have some sort of value

that you can bring to AI. But I think the question for us is as we're working together, how do you actually make sure that you engage in that responsibly across the entire value chain? I think

the only way that we can actually crack a value chain that becomes ethical that becomes something that we all want to participate in is through some sort of we do have a situation where I mean and

thankfully we do have you know Radwani we have Lapa they are building more in the south but right now we do have this unequal divide of so much on the model side coming from the global north and

not and so much from the building side from the data side coming from the global majority. Can we either flip that or just create a little bit of a more uh equitable playing uh playing field for

for all of us? So I think for us the key challenge really is power dynamics. How can we change that and how can we use systems like this right where we're actually able to come together to create

more equity and I think yeah a little bit of representation and inclusion at every level. Thank you. So you talked about equity representation which is very fortuitous because the

question that I'm going to ask of you later [laughter] this right um hello everyone thank you again for joining us uh and it's lovely to kind of hear from everyone before about

the importance of multi multistakeholder collaboration um I think uh so I'm an ML scientist I like to build models uh there's a lot joy in seeing models first fail and then eventually start working.

Um I think one of the things that I learned by joining Madwani AI which was briefly introduced uh before was if you really want to deploy solutions for the benefit of humanity it cannot happen

with ML scientists just sitting in one place and trying to do their thing right so that's just does not work um so AI we are a nonprofit organization applied AI institute that we uh we build develop

and deploy solutions in education health and agriculture um I've been working there for over a little five five years and um it's been a phenomenal journey where you get to see your models

actually now go out in the world and um get used by people and then they'll give you interesting feedback in terms of um not necessarily model performance because performance is not the only

thing that matters which is what you would typically expect for a machine learning scientist uh but also usability whether it's integrated well into the program itself health um whether as as

language barriers are addressed um is it a voice interface or is it does it require some form of literacy and all of these kind of factors come into play while making sure that a product

actually um gets used. So stop there and can take this next. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Hi everyone. Uh let me bring in a very complimentary view. So I lead a finance AI startup. Everything I put

out there needs to work. It needs to make my stakeholder who is a CFO a very conservative persona actually use AI. So if I look at someone who is not only trying to measure impact every day uh

ensure that the AI is responsible also ensure that it is working for all my customers and then finally ensure that they're going to trust it and actually pay me money. Right? So here my

stakeholders are not only your model builders or the data that is creating all of this but it is very much this whole trust building mechanism that not the obviously the marketing and the

sales need to bring in but the AI builders need to actually establish. So part of my stakeholders are these AI agents which will ensure that the customer data is safe. Um the second

thing is I actually need data or every startup or everyone who is in a sensitive uh B2B kind of vertical space needs data to actually build the AI that works right like I can't always go out

to close source models. I I'm definitely don't have the money to build large uh pre-trained models. So how do I make sure that I am able to convince my customer, give me good data, um

kind of gift wrap it and anonymize it or make it ethical to use for training and then further train it and actually think of it in terms of monetization. I want to all the way take it to the infraox

and ensure that hey give me something secure that a extremely conservative persona is going to use. So everything that everyone on this uh panel has been talking about uh impact collaboration

data uh model training all of that is something where uh you are in a very at a very small organization level is something that you kind of need to do every day. Um and this has direct uh

impact in terms of whether as organization I will survive tomorrow or not. Um the last thing I would like to comment on in in this context is that what uh is important is how do we ensure

that organizations like startups collaborate with other governance organizations and have a say in building those policies right because be it healthcare or fintech or education or

any other or defense for that matter all of us are talking about AI in these fields um having a space on the table where all the big players are actually bringing in the policy. Uh ensuring that

it is eminable to those small organizations who are trying to take this to their f uh end customer is is a kind of uh collaboration that I think we must nurture.

&gt;&gt; Thank you Nati. Um us well I said round robin but if I go by roundroin fashion then again you will be the last and right now you have the microphone so why don't I do this in the

reverse order now okay so you talked about AI responsible AI in in finance the finance industry was one of the very

early adopters So in the '90s and things like that but they all the models ML models and they were developed by the finance industry itself. So uh you alluded to some of those things but

perhaps let's drill down what has changed now uh in the finance uh industry. How exactly are they collaborating? How we are assimilating I mean examples of collaboration that's

what I would like to drill down on. &gt;&gt; Sure. So I think you nailed it. Math, finance, ta existed. Uh they have built their quant models and they still exist. But what is new is with u agent with NLP

getting useful or usable what has happened is that the unstructured or the financial operation side. So transactional data in finance has become aminable to uh models using it, models

generating it, models interpreting it. Um and that is the same data like those bills and the invoices and the simple transactional heavy manual tasks that uh while ' 90s automated uh planning and

budgeting to some extent or quant modeling no one touched these very dirty shabby scans which which have no regulation and they're all over the place. So, so that is that's one kind of

large open space where there are even today like hundreds of people manually doing that data entry and and that is the space where your office of the CFO is starting to open up and say that hey

can I instead of having 200 people process 10,000 invoices for me monthly can I have an AI agent do that for me so that if tomorrow I have 20,000 invoices can can can we handle it with the same

workforce. Obviously, there is cost optimization as well. One one other aspect still remains is that this transactional or semi-structured finance data is still very mathematical in

nature or semiructured in nature. So, it's it's not only the OCR and LLM on top of it. It is still very much going into those terms that accountants understand or charted accountants

understand or CPA understands to further drill down and say how can I save cost and that is where a lot of multistakeholder understanding or even on the science side bringing in math

reasoning or or bringing in a non-aggentic uh AI kind of very traditional stoastic model is important. So, so it's it's it's very interesting that while agents are taking over um it

seems OCR is solved but even then your best OCR in the world will not get any invoice right or always. So it's there are these nuances that where you go deeper and deeper within a domain you

learn that unless I start thinking like an accountant I won't be able to build AI for them. So the stakeholder there becomes these non- tech professionals who are my actually customers.

&gt;&gt; Great. &gt;&gt; So &gt;&gt; so thank you for bringing out the importance of nontech and non finance stakeholders into the collaboration

fold. Makan um you've been again involved in uh working in healthcare in education in agriculture and things like that. uh but the proliferation of AI has generally depended on internet bandwidth

and pre prevalence of internet in some of these domains internet may not be that well uh fast let's say agriculture the consumers and things like that so what's your view on

how we circumvent that challenge &gt;&gt; yeah I think it's an important question um much of the progress we've made since the last 5 years I believe is primarily because the data has been out there for

everyone to scrape and build large models on. um if that data doesn't exist online I think uh uh we spoke about this with the thousand African languages if that data is not on the internet

you will have to go and collect that data to build something for that society right so there's u from both the building perspective which is um where do you source the data from if it

doesn't exist and then from the deployment perspective where the the end user may not have access to a stable or a fast enough internet to perhaps um kind of have your models run and

interface with the uh tool. So I think both of these problems are important to address. Um I think the first one there's a question of do we need to build necessarily very large models for

every language out there? Maybe not, right? could we use um multilingual LLMs essentially and then fine-tune them with some hopefully lesser data uh which is sourced purposefully for that community

which we can then use um to to get that LLM or other models to benefit that community right so I think that is one way of perhaps looking at it essentially if you're trying to build for a

particular community probably helps to get data from that um source the second aspect is uh I think my my team from the whole anthropometry project is sitting here. Um so so I started out with uh

with this project on newborn anthropometry at Vadwani which the goal is can we take a video of a baby and then try and estimate what the weight is. Now you would think weight from

vision images that that seems a little unrealistic. Turns out you can do it or you can try and estimate it at least um and you can talk with all of my multiple stakeholders right who are collaborating

of course to get that data sourced to us. The way this works is it's not necessarily a large model that needs to kind of run on the internet uh or on some cloud server. We are able to

compress these models, put them in the lowcost smartphones, not just not even iPhones or like high-end phones, just phones of 8 to 10,000 rupees. Um, and have those models run offline, right? So

that serves the other purpose of even if you're disconnected from the internet, you're able to make use of AI models that have been developed which can then provide outputs real time and then

assist in the process that would other the frontline worker would otherwise do. And this can naturally extend to other domains like agriculture and education as well. Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Thank you for a road map of addressing the challenge of what I posed to you. Okay. Uh Safia um across the world the data set building that you're talking about

um has been done by people from the global south but the data has generally been coming from across the world especially from global north. You talked about the need for representation

equity. How can this fact that the people who are collecting the data that's they are working from global south how can we bring in their their inputs how we can

enable them? &gt;&gt; Excellent question. Thank you so much Hmon. So I mean I think as as you very much called out there are four countries that are kind of powerhouses of doing

this type of data work. Uh it is India, Kenya, Uganda and the Philippines. Um, and the reason why these countries have been the powerhouses is because English, right? Uh, these are all countries that

are able to speak English. They're able to decipher the types of data that the that the global north needs to have deciphered. Um and unfortunately there are mechanisms to unfairly pay people

and that is something that is uh something that is wanted sometimes in the AI value chain because there are a lot of uh I guess models that are chasing profit. But what I think we've

really seen in the past few years that I find to be very exciting is that I think the divide is closing and I think it's specifically because of language. I think we are realizing that if you want

to have AI work in the global majority, you cannot take an English view to it. You not only have to take a linguistically appropriate view, but you also have to take a culturally and

contextually relevant piece of view, right? So I think you know when I see the world and what we're doing uh sorry when I see this type of work in the world there's definitely a shift into

English being more of an era where expertise is needed right I think that will always be something that you know the global south will probably contribute to right doctor annotations

law annotations etc but I think what we've really seen and I will speak especially I think for for for India is a real growth in a desire to build foundational models uh a desire to

create inclusion through speech. I think this is something we're seeing not only from the government which I mean I think this year there has been an unprecedented amount of budget [music]

allocation specifically for local language data collection which is something that's extremely exciting. There's also been budget allocation for stress testing and evaluations which I

think is something that is very new because we are realizing that if we don't make sure that models actually fit the realities of the people that are going to use them then there's actually

no point in deploying that model. You actually won't see very high pickup, very high retention. There actually won't be safety and trust, right? Um so I think what's going to change and I I

really do see this growing and I think you know the is a really great example of that is that we are actually seeing so much demand growing for what does I mean in some ways I'll use this term

very loosely but what does sovereign AI mean for each of these countries? How do we create two true products that actually help people? So I think evaluations are going to be something

that are very critical and I think building the proper data sets but in both of these things what is very important I think for all of us to remember and that's why we need to have

good collaboration and safeguards is that we don't become extractive because what I wouldn't want to happen is in this big uh you know desire to collect so much data it shouldn't be that the

people who are contributing to this either a don't get to benefit from the technologies or B don't have some way to see that data as their own asset. And so I

actually would like and encourage all of us as we're thinking about collaboration, let's also think about ownership and how we can redefine that within the global south because I think

we have the ability and we're so many countries we have so much power together. Can we change that narrative to say what is data ownership? What is model ownership? and who actually gets

to be in the room to decide how and what we build. &gt;&gt; Thank you. With that thought, uh I would like to ask you for um you

talked of of course talked about specific challenges of Africa, specific problems and things like that. So as a leader in developing AI for for Africa Africans what lessons have you

have you gathered and how do we address the lesson expand those things to address the problems of overall global south. Yeah, that that's a very tall order. Uh

in this case that I I do see myself as a servant as opposed to a leader [laughter] in in in that area. um in in terms of just trying to understand um also as a researcher uh I think um yeah

on on one has has been after spending a number of years building models collecting data uh was we spent uh the last year or so now working on analyzing what were some of the practices that

were being done uh across um uh uh like natural language processing and African language community uh specifically through Masakhani. uh masakan is is a a kind of distributed research uh network

uh for African languages and uh not like on one part not surprisingly uh one of the things that came out was uh if we are being extractive you limit your long-term impact

because it closes doors it breaks trust people don't want to interact whether sure there might be the data side but the part I'm also very um interested in especially this year I'm on on

sabbatical year just working on some research on thinking about evaluation. What are these uh kind of practices that we're doing in evaluation and how do they really connect to what's happening

kind of on the ground. So that's one of the extractive is like you know being extractive and just thinking of let's go fast. It does have an impact and I know it's visceral but if you're a researcher

it's like this thing where you're now questioning the decisions that you're making. I think it's worthwhile to make those the those questions and feel a little bit um out of it in that in in

that way. The other one just to to to to uh to finish was a a a leap that people kind of took on saying how do we get to creating tools that again not computational to assist either

communities or people in keeping uh some way of control or or or like you know of choosing how whether their data their models are going to be used. So yes, equitable licensing conversations have

to happen. They are not going to be one sizefits-all. They're going to be very different for different communities, but we can't block them. Uh just because we're saying we're just rushing towards

there has to be an LLM in every language. That doesn't necessarily need to be true. It doesn't need to be big. It doesn't need to be and some communities won't want that at all. How

do we get that to be part of our practice? Thank you for giving a researchers's view for the solutions to be really applicable for the community. And

talking about community, you also mentioned community in your opening remark. U so uh there seems to be a fundamental conflict in marrying cuttingedge large

scale uh technology to highly localized problems in in Africa. Okay. Uh so do you do you see this as a conflict or you have a more positive view optimistic view of that?

&gt;&gt; I've been known to be very optimistic. &gt;&gt; Let's hear the optimist &gt;&gt; and I I I appreciate my own energy. It fuels me. Uh so I definitely don't see this as a conflict. I think

complimentary to what many folks uh discussed on stage, I'll give uh an an example to kind of highlight that. So um you know with my Google hat on [laughter] we have we have models like

uh Jimma which is an openw weight model. We have medjima which is actually more positive like more downloads than jimma itself which is trained on medical uh text and imagery. And then we were

looking at the challenge from a healthc care perspective of how how do we make that medical reality relevant to the continent of Africa? our burdens of disease are not equally distributed

around the world. Uh and so this is actually at the hallmark of this you know this collaboration. It's a we made this data set called Afromed QA. It is a pan-African

Q&amp;A data set from medical institutions uh more than 16 countries across Africa about I think it's 32 different uh disciplines but most importantly it's 25,000 question and answers from the

African context from those who are medically trained and so what's key about that is as you use these types of models you're now being able to okay first you you might benchmark with this

type of data data set but also you know evaluate how these large language models are representing your context. Uh further down the line it could be fine-tuning or you know leveraging some

of the open models with this data set. So that allows us to bring in our reality and our context into the technologies that are there. So that's one way that I think you know there is a

power in leveraging those models that are openly available. &gt;&gt; Sounds like my time's up. &gt;&gt; Could you stop that? I'm actually tracking time. Uh we

we are well in time. I noticed that when we started it started with 35 instead of 55. I'm not going to take that long, but I think we certainly do have at least 10 minutes.

Yeah. Uh so you have two minutes [laughter] though. Uh so Wendy as a pioneering computer scientist um as the AI revolution is unfolding

how do you uh address the digital divide that exists even within the global south? Your uh thoughts on that. Uh I'm sorry I don't um I'm going to say I don't understand the question because

you said as a computer explain ask me again. Yeah, you've done pioneering. What's the digital &gt;&gt; computer science and the digital divide? What's what's

&gt;&gt; Oh, uh as but okay, let me rephrase that. As a leader, as a thought leader, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; So, what

&gt;&gt; uh there is a divide right now. I mean there are various u challenges which are unique and there is a digital divide. Some of them are more enabled even within uh global south. Uh so what are

your views on um uh bridging that divide? &gt;&gt; I still don't understand the question. I'm sorry because what are you talking about? Are you saying um every country

has problems [snorts] where correct &gt;&gt; people some people are &gt;&gt; so any any okay any commonality that you see any commonality that you see &gt;&gt; it's not just a global south thing is it

&gt;&gt; we have people I mean we have a huge problem every well in Europe certainly in the UK about people who know the world most of the people in the world do not understand AI right at all is that

the digital divide you're talking about what you &gt;&gt; sure that's one of the things that deployment of AI really becomes a challenge right now. Okay. So, your

thoughts on on that? I mean, u collaboration is one example of that. &gt;&gt; No, it does. So, I don't get does anyone want to answer this question? &gt;&gt; Anybody else who would like to help out

here with this question? Anyway, um &gt;&gt; well, let me just say right the whole the key thing for me is that um we are we are there's currently a huge contract going on, right? We are being conned.

I'm going to talk about this in my keynote tomorrow by the big tech companies, right? We're all being conned. They're saying, "Oh, SORRY. ACTUALLY, [laughter]

I'LL TELL YOU, GOOGLE'S MY FAVORITE, RIGHT? Who knows there? &gt;&gt; Google's my favorite." But there's this huge thing about we're going to reach AGI by the end of the year, right?

That's what um Dario said at Davos. We're going to reach AGI by the end of the year. Demis slowed him down a bit, okay, and said five to 10 years. What does AGI mean? You know, it's a

meaningless term. And this um so and and the world out there thinks AI is going to take their job and thinks that we're all going to be overrun by AI and is and it gets very scary because people don't

understand. So the key to this and and it's true for for politicians and the media as well as your average person in the street or the farm or wherever is education, education, education. You've

absolutely got to help people understand what it is we're dealing with here so that they can um I mean lobby is maybe not the right word local politicians or their local schools or their local

universities or &gt;&gt; no good stuff &gt;&gt; to um to help people understand what this technology is and what it might do to their lives. lives, how it might

change their careers or their careers their children might aspire to, what the teachers make of it. Um, and these people are not going to ever understand how this technology really works in

terms of um the mathematics behind it in that sort of detail. So we have to explain to people uh when the you know this whole I mean the taxi driver taking me to heater

airport yesterday said how do I tell the difference between a deep fake and a I don't know what's truth anymore and we're really coming in you know we've got AI slop everywhere

I'll just &gt;&gt; thank you u so education is one of the uh ways of u along with collaboration educating people on AI and it's

again we talking about multistake collaboration &gt;&gt; getting everybody's views while developing deploying uh AI solutions okay we do have time for a couple of

questions from the audience we yeah go ahead uh microphone or I can give my microphone Thank you so much for such a wonderful panel. Um I had a simple question on

evaluation because a lot of you brought it up. How would you structure that evaluation? Should it be different in different contexts? Should it be different um in different countries?

What baseline would be would we follow across the world? And I asked this mainly because I'm very interested in participatory approaches to building deployment and evaluation. Um where you

actually bring the lived experience of the end beneficiaries into the equation. So how would you structure evaluation and monitoring? Um this could be for Safia or anyone else on the panel. Thank

you. &gt;&gt; Can I just ask what are you evaluating? &gt;&gt; The impact of the technology. &gt;&gt; The impact of the technology &gt;&gt; is working for them. So sorry just to

clarify you mean impact evaluation and not AI evaluation. &gt;&gt; Understood. Yeah. No because that does make quite a big difference. I mean I think the

well I mean from a very impact measurement perspective it would be very difficult given how much AI is infused to find a counterfactual. So I think that is actually quite a big question

that even as an impact measurement specialist I have as well. Um and and just like you have in many evaluations, impact evaluations, I don't think that there is a one-sizefits-all approach, I

think it really depends on what is the causal relationship you're trying to understand, right? I think already today we do see a lot of evaluations happening at the expert level, right? Is the

output exactly what we want? But I think if you want to ask the social question, you have to first decide on what parameters. And I don't think you can have a mega evaluation um because that's

going to give you a lot of confounding answers. Right? So I think we are not at a place where there should be where there is a baseline framework and I'm also not sure that that is the future

that we should be pursuing because each technology will will have its nuance and if we don't you know evaluate impact in the way that picks on those nuances then we're actually you know risking perhaps

not understanding what true impact that intervention or that technology would have. &gt;&gt; Anyone else wants to add? Yeah, I I think uh

uh one big thing is going to be uh not completing the two &gt;&gt; and no from the perspective on the other side as well that when we do have big claims of how AI now the way we've

evaluated AI is going to now change all of these sectors and everything because now we're getting whatever humanity's last exam or or the and now saying that that means on the other tide like you

know the tide will lift all boats and everybody's going to benefit in the same way. These are not the same kind uh kind of thing and making the point is on on one side making those big claims because

of maybe the ecosystem in terms of where money flows or or resources are going to flow. It does have it it does have impact in in terms and it does hurt uh because in some places then people then

say we are not going to make uh the education um investments because it's fine somebody else has taken care of this but actually that's not the reality in in in in on the social on the social

side. Uh but then now yeah nobody is now going to invest in in solving some of these things. So let's not it is a very good question in terms of let's not conflate the two but sometimes it looks

like on on in public that oh it's the same thing and it's it's not &gt;&gt; uh we have time for one more question &gt;&gt; um thank you thank you for the panel uh wonderful comments mine um one is a

reflection around I think impact if you think about it from medical diagnostics for example like simple things like radiology a simple small model that could fit on a cell phone that a nurse

could use. If the output is to catch more, you know, infections, maybe it would be much faster. But then if the outcome you're looking for is people getting the the help they need once they

figure it out, that's a that's another dimension to it. But my question um you know to anybody on the panel is for our future generation. So I I I'm a professor and I teach undergraduates and

I feel like a lot of students are not ready or are not evolving uh as the world is evolving um really quickly and so in terms of preparation like what kind of from your leadership perspective

what do you see is the the shift in terms of being ready for you know the unknown Right? Um if you think about computer science students graduating right now,

they're graduating in the millions. I'm making that up in the US for example. So the question is um what does it look like uh for an undergraduate or graduate student who's finishing right now in the

current in the current environment? &gt;&gt; No jobs. I think it's ironic that the industry that's creating all this is the one that's destroying jobs for programmers.

Um but actually I say that quite glibly because I don't think that is the case. I but I we've already seen and I think it's a true in the US a fall in the numbers of people applying for computer

science because the because the rhetoric is you we don't need programmers in the future. Actually this was what I'm talking &gt;&gt; [laughter]

&gt;&gt; It's a love alert. &gt;&gt; But we Yeah, &gt;&gt; we will need we will need because the moment I mean this is this is another bit of the com which is that it's not AI

that's doing this. People do this with AI at the moment and I don't know for how long but at the moment AI doesn't decide what it's going to do, what programs it's going to build. I mean

that could come in the future but it's not here now. And so we are going to need these types but the rhetoric that gets out there very quickly is no we don't need any programmers. Um so okay

sorry I'll shut up let someone else say something. &gt;&gt; I'll add to add to your points. Uh I think what's really important actually uh you're training undergraduates is uh

teaching them early as early as possible to question everything. And that means that you need to as a a computer scientist or any any field that you're in, you you need to separate yourself

from your work. So, you know, maybe you're going through the PhD, I was in robotics, you love your robot, you know, it's capturing elements about the world. You really have to separate yourself

from your work and think about what are the thousand ways this can go wrong. The interesting thing about being in robotics is that I had to think about safety first because for all sorts of

reasons. So that's kind of baked into the set of algorithms that you learn first. But in general, I think there's and and it's not just for undergrad also your children. uh in the similar similar

way you talked about deep fakes, question everything. Separate yourself from the tools and techniques that you build and start to think about what are the ramifications, positive, negative,

what could be some uh you know downstream impacts and don't do it by yourself. Do it collaboratively with different people. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much for bringing in

students. Uh I think you they are going to be here for some time actually. you you can connect with them later unless they are feeling or everybody's feeling very very hungry but what

happened towards the end is that students and fresh graduates were brought in as one big community as a stakeholder in this but I would like to thank all panelists for giving their

views on [applause] the need [cheering] for collaboration for responsible THANK YOU VERY IT DOESN'T HAVE MY NAME.

&gt;&gt; That's definitely Yeah, &gt;&gt; thank you. &gt;&gt; Um, we have a of appreciation.
