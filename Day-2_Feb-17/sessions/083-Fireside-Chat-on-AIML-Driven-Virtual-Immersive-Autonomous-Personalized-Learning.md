we're really talking about people, isn't it? Those who get access, who gets empowered, who gets left behind. So the sutras of people, planet and

progress remind us that technology without it's just computation. So as India accelerate into the into the next world that AI world the defining

question is no longer can we build advanced systems it is can we build inclusive human capital at the same pace. Today we'll explore how AI powered

learning system like ATNS are helping answer that question by delivering personalized immersive education reaching talent wherever it exists. And we'll also step back to

examine how AI can become a power for social good connecting innovation to opportunity across sectors. Thomas or Widian as I've always known

you as the founder and CEO of Eton, you've been at the intersection of AI and immersive learning a long before AI as a word became cool. So you've seen the evolution up close,

what works, what doesn't, and more importantly what scales particularly when inclusion is the goal. So tell us about how how it has been for you, your story, how it's

been in the early days particularly with your customers and some of them are here and most importantly how immersive learning has shaped your vision for building talent at scale in India.

&gt;&gt; Thank you George. Um thank you and thank you Lada for that lovely introduction. So as we were talking uh when we spoke a few weeks back about this event, Agentic AI is quite the buzz word now but that

is something that we have been sandboxing in our organization for close to 15 plus years and um that happened some some of you might have noticed on the background with some of the early

research that we did with North Carolina State University and um parallelly with Virginia Tech and Howard was also doing that which was trying to see how the digital

natives of today could be better engaged through methods that the Department of Defense was using in creating war simulations etc. And what was most interesting was the results that came

out of it which as you can see there uh in 2005 NSF came out and said we only retain 10% of what we read. Now we have videos but that goes to 30%. But if we do something even as a simulation it

goes up to 90%. Let me you know even now in this 2026 it's pathetic that we follow 18th century pedagoguy uh where it's instructor-led

you know there is no kind of assessment of applying of your knowledge and it is more content knowledge that is being assessed which is what happens with the multiple choice that you get and we

Indians are really good at mugging it up and vomiting it out but not so much in uh in applying it. So that is what um we have tried to bring about based on this research

&gt;&gt; an early augmented reality game where school students learn of red &gt;&gt; you might not be able to hear the volume but scientists &gt;&gt; these were some of the early examples

that we did with our project research. This is how kids were were learning &gt;&gt; playing games etc to win the race. &gt;&gt; Now this is a pretty cool looking

video game. &gt;&gt; Uh somewhere &gt;&gt; I would be amazed if you could guess uh who we built this for. This was for JP Morgan Chase in 2009.

Can you imagine &gt;&gt; where we took um uh some of their early associates who joined and created pathways for them to become CEOs, CFOs etc. in a very fun way and I just will

talk a little bit more about it but it became so good that even the wees wanted to take it. &gt;&gt; These are some examples where teachers are t trained there and the beauty of

this is we use agentic AI there you know they are taken through multiple decision-m models. The virtual mentor tells you what you're doing wrong, what you're doing right, etc.

&gt;&gt; We created a virtual fractionation facility for a Spanish company called Grief Falls where they could walk in even before the building was made and they could take trainings in each of

them. There were people there, leadership from Japan who could walk in virtually and look at things how it was progressing. &gt;&gt; The bioactive training wrong could even

cause an explosion. In this particular case, there are uh cases where a bioreactor can blow up if you walk away. So we take people through those kind of experiences and make them learn that and

you know give them experience which they would not otherwise be able to have in real life in these virtual worlds. &gt;&gt; Simulate real life scenarios making it fun, challenging and exciting through

gamification. And what we have heard from our users is when we transform 100page standard operating procedures in this kind of learning they love it they learn better

&gt;&gt; and I'll talk later about it but the impact on learning is phenomenal this is a pilot training simulation uh l had mentioned is that this enables people to apply

what they have learned &gt;&gt; you are making them. You're showing them first what to do, how to do it, and then you're making them do it. So, you're creating a simulated immersive environ

where they can apply what they have learned. That is what happens here. &gt;&gt; Place the engine just below the horizon line depending on your power setting for 20 seconds.

Ajit, you had uh quite a bit of experience with some of our early and later uh Sure. products. Why don't you? &gt;&gt; Sure. No, thanks. Thanks, Zin. Um, so this goes uh back about 16 years. Um,

and this is a chance conversation and this I was at JP Morgan at that point of time, you know, heading the finance function and a chance conversation with the then CEO of JP Morgan India, Kalpa

Morpari. I mean she was saying her nephew uh learned driving a car just by playing a video game or a few video games and that got me thinking um I just thought wy you know uh since I'm a

finance person can someone learn finance you know by gaming by playing a game uh so you make a dry subject like finance interesting you know you learn a game and then through that pick some con

concepts and learn a program whatever I I got working on it you know spoke to a few service providers got them to our office my team spoke to them but I was really not satisfied with you know what

I heard because they had not progressed at all. Um at chance conversation with Thomas Widen actually you know during one of our reunions where we are you know sitting in you know with our uh

legs in the water and spirits high as he say you know I just told him look this is the dilemma I'm facing and he said look do you know what I do I said no I have a vague idea what do you do but not

really he said look this is what we are in we are in immersive learning you know we can you know we can help you I said yeah why not why don't you come over to Mumbai come to our office speak to my

team uh and then let's see how it goes so he came over we had a meeting uh and uh because I wanted my seemed to sort of you know truly believe in it not pushed something down to them. So all of them

were very very excited. Uh that first meeting went off very well. Then I actually assigned a project team to it. I went up to the IB CFO and said look this is the idea. Uh can you give me

some seed funding and uh and I asked for an amount uh and he said yes uh go ahead. And I said look if I come back to you with a good product then I'll probably come back to you with 10x of

that amount. And which is what happened you know uh we succeeded. In fact, we won a global award, you know, from Jamie Diamond himself, you know, giving us an award for that particular innovation,

which was, I think, maybe a little too early for our time. I'm talking 16 years back where, you know, a concept like finance trying to learn through gaming was maybe a little early. Uh, but

probably not because others appreciated it. &gt;&gt; That's exactly what we did, right? We took that and then &gt;&gt; and yeah, exact. So this is something

really cutting edge at that time and everyone involved in that whole project was so excited and I think we got to a certain level and then um yeah and Thomas obviously delivered he had a team

sitting you know in India frankly you know in the in room right I mean you know that is a team so uh so it was cost effective uh because you know for doing something like this I couldn't go to him

and say I want a million dollars eventually got it but the initial funding was much lesser but then we managed to get it done. Yeah, but what we learned from those uh experiences

early on, including the stealth assessments that Jim Walk was very scared about, but uh where we took people through these kind of decision-m situations where we actually applied

some of the earliest agentic AI to guide them through decision-m scenarios including uh tracking their time on task, integrity, etc. helped us later come to this aton approach and the

multiple frameworks that we have built. So, so the whole approach that we have is when we go and do a digital transformation for some of our organizations, we say we show them how

to do it, we make them do it and as they do it track and assess how they do it. Now that is very important because this big data enables the AI agent or virtual mentor to give them what is called the

instant formative feedback which is just like you know now you have all these tution teachers which we never had in our days or more like say somebody was coaching suchin and saying hey you have

to hold this bat this way or swing your racket this way which is individualized for each person. So, so just imagine right right now you guys study in classrooms of 35 to 200 people but here

thousands of people all over the world could be doing it at the same time but how the virtual mentor reacts is to your strengths and weaknesses and that is where the application for a place like

India comes into play right where we could learn in different languages the same thing have the same uh kind of uh objective the same parameters for Everybody, a billion people could have

the same lesson in different languages, right? But they progress at their own pace and they fail and succeed. People can succeed after multiple attempts. We call it a safe environment. And for you

in the industry, this would be most important because the impact on the bottom line is powerful. We have seen 30% productivity improvement uh handling time 21% training throughput 50% and

attrition 81% improvement you I can while you're reeling out the numbers I mean I can tell you from a real life example so I spoke about the JP Morgan you know 16 years back but more recently

about 5 years back when I was a CFO at Wells Fargo and the head of finance uh I had you know we had engaged on a similar project and then by then agent had improved significantly you know from

what we started 16 years back their methodology technology had changed. You know, the technology had improved. Uh the team was getting tighter, the you know, response time, the ability to get

things done was much better. And then frankly, you know, we actually came up with a product where we were able to train a virtual team, some of them sitting in India, some sitting in

London, some sitting in the US, all with the same uh I mean at scale to the point which he made, which is phenomenal. I mean, you know, so you're able to actually sort of translate learning and

the and talking about metrics, something which used to take 12 weeks to complete in training, we managed to crunch that down to about 5 weeks or so. So significant reduction in training time

because you had individualized attention you know and sort of going through each person looking at how they progressed and all of that. So uh practically it made a lot of sense and by then in 10

years time or 15 years time you know things had advanced so much uh that you know we really got some very good benefit in the second time you know we did it

&gt;&gt; and that is what we need in India right when we are talking about upskilling for semiconductor industry upskilling for robotics etc. We need people to be reskilled fast and these these are the

kind of tools that we need and I'm glad we are able to share it and we create this kind of a virtuous cycle where from the time we hire we kind of check out people's strengths and weaknesses and

right through the time they leave everything is tracked and assessed and predictive analytics etc given so it's extremely extremely powerful um and um you know Arvind and I were talking a

little bit u about this of how it could be applied in the healthcare uh forum. So healthcare is always a very people inensive skill inensive industry as we all know and we've talked about we've

talked about ways in which you could ramp up even the use of technology across large healthcare remmits where if you used immersive learning you probably could cut the time it takes to train a

workforce of 3500 4,000 people that serve of a health system by 20 to 30% but more importantly get them the to the competency level that's very uniform so that you don't have gaps in how they're

using technology in providing care. So we've talked about some of those examples at doctor's offices clinics and so on. &gt;&gt; Yeah and and again that is something we

need in the health care field in India for the massive number of people that is needed. Anyway, one aside but something that might interest all of you. Here is another agentic tool that we have

created for free for needy kids especially after watching the movie 12th fail. Most of you must have seen it and I thought we have the resources to do it. So this is a free competitive exam

preparation tool. You can go in there, your kids can do it for free and please share it with whoever needs it because you can there is a personality test that agent will assess your personality tell

you this is the college that is ideal for you this is the career that is ideal for you and if you want to prepare yourself for any of the competitive exams here or in US you can do that and

it'll guide you through that process thank you &gt;&gt; thank you van Ajit Arvind I think the idea of uh immersive personalized uh platforms, AI platforms

like ATINS actually promises learning to be fun after all. So as we shift into the next part of our conversation, I'd like to broaden the lens. So far we've spoken about talent and learning. Now

let's explore how AI AI can become our power for social good particularly across sectors like the subject matter experts over here financial services technology and

healthcare. Each of these sectors touch lives at scale but healthcare perhaps does so more directly and more humanely. Aravind, you've been a thought leader in your

domain for a fairly for decades now and more recently a very uh forceful advocate of the responsible use of AI in your domain. You've seen you've seen your domain evolve through multiple

waves of change from systems to output and now to intelligence. So I'm going to put out a slightly uncomfortable truth. AI in healthcare often benefits

those who have access. Fair enough. What would what would it take for AI to actually work for the last person in the queue, not just the first? How can these AIdriven diagnostic tools

uh help expand uh good quality health care to the to the rural as well as you know the the underserved population uh in India while also keeping empathy

at the core. &gt;&gt; Excellent question. I'll contextualize a little bit with what's happening in the US and then [snorts] bring it back to what work is going on in India that I'm

aware of and we hear about in the industry. So I'd like to open by saying India's healthcare AI success metric is not sophistication. It really is about how you could prevent

blindness, how you could prevent sepsis, how you could prevent diseases by screening early on by scaling in a way where AI plays a role in providing that success because if you look at the US in

the last two years there is about a 22% penetration of AI in domain specific areas but is really focused on two domains. It's focused on documentation, ambient listening, ambient intelligence

and billing and coding. So you're b basically leveraging that touch point around improving operational efficiencies. Well, you're giving back time to the

clinician and now the US is getting ready to think about if I give time back to the physicians or the doctors, what does that do for me? Does it improve patient experience? Does it improve

outcomes? It's a question we don't know. But it's a t-fold increase since 2023. So let's bring that back to India. So taking that breakout success from the US, I think India's opportunity is much

bigger and it's bigger because it can create human capacity. You've got a constricted patient to specialist ratio. How can you free that up?

Think about a product that I think has come in the Indian market. It's called there is chaos in the outpatient department. You go to a large metro, you have

patients with different multilingual needs who need to be taken care of and the doctor's attention in making that note takingaking and also taking care of the patient by while not losing eye

contact gets diluted if not for using ambient intelligence. Now you take that and scale it to different clinics out in the rural areas, you've created a huge capacity

multiplier and that's very very helpful. There are other examples I've come across Presco. I know there is an infantile sepsis problem in India and Presco offers a solution where the

frontline worker it could be a community health worker could use that tool on the edge and do an early detection. So they're kind of playing the role of the neonatlogist in early detection. So

things like this are going to be very helpful for India to scale with and I think it I bring it back to three principles. First, India needs to do an AI first

design. Multilingual offline, deal with messy data. There's plenty of it out there. There's plenty of messy data in the US, too. By the way, workflow integration.

Move away from point solutions or if you bring point solutions to the table, make them more enterprise and scalable as part of the workflow. And finally, empathy by design. Make sure you're

benefiting that doctor patient relationship. I think those are come up some of the factors that will take us there. &gt;&gt; So essentially the the the the empathy

as well as putting people in the line ultimately there is an human element uh while working with AI that's that's essentially and India seems to be you know getting some of the fundamental

pieces in place as as you see it right now and uh it it needs to be designed for the country. So AI first from an India perspective rather than just copying and mimicking the US. Thank you.

Thank you Arvinda. Uh now over to you Ajit. You you've been a leader um in the financial services space with uh with JP Morgan and with Wells Fargo and working with Eton in the AI space long before

you know AI was was cool. Now we often say AI will democratize finance but is AI really reducing the inequality or just digitizing it faster from credit scoring to fraud detection uh AI is

fundamentally altering financial ecosystems. Now how can we ensure that these innovations also include the unbanked and the underbanked populations in India. So

George excellent question. Uh so currently uh and it's it's a question which is close to my heart because this is where AI can truly make a difference and it scale currently if you look at

the credit system and I'm talking about retail credit. I mean most banks lend to people based on elability and willingness to pay. So you know abilities do you have a steady source of

income either a salary income or a business income of a steady establishment and obviously willingness to pay based on your past credit history but that takes care of maybe 5% of the

population or maybe uh what what about the rest what about the roadside kirana wala what about the vegetable vendor you know what about the tea shop wala the vegetable vendor I just give an example

so you go in the morning to the money lender you get goods worth 950 rupees or or rather you get 950 rupees you buy your p your vegetables with that and and end of the day you had to give a,000

rupees so that's 50 rupees per day which works out to more than 3,000 rupees peranom in terms of interest uh you know which you're paying now that's significant right but if you can use AI

intelligently and by intelligently I mean look there are up transactions you know every other shop every small chala is accepting now UPI transactions you look at digital payment history you look

at telephone usage you look at your you know your payment history through various means means other than cash of course because everything is now digital. I mean you know most people

just want your Google pay or your paytm or whatever. So using those means AI can translate or or interpret thousands and thousands of data points and by doing this as opposed to having a regular

salary or a regular business income you know uh any person with a regular money flow which can be tracked through an AI tool which you can now do you open up the whole credit uh you know space to

these individuals and as a bank or as a micr finance lender very attractive you lender 15% which is 3 4% % more than what you would lend to any other customer as opposed to the customer

who's getting it at 15% as opposed to paying 3,000%. So, it's a win-win for everyone. Uh, and then, you know, you can also include your women angle to it. Uh, if you want to saying that, no, you

lend to women in the household because then the women typically, I don't want to generalize, but the repayment patterns are much better. You get your money faster and the women's respect in

the household increases, you know. So you you become a valued member you know because you're here you know because of you we are getting credit from the bank. So it's a win-win for everyone concerned

and the woman makes sure that the money is paid back in time uh to the so everyone is happy. So that's the way you know at scale you can sort of expand it. So actually the the the digital stack

that India has built the the government stack that India has built is going to is is going to be a big enabler for AI because that's &gt;&gt; game changer

game changer. it's going to completely alter the game. &gt;&gt; So it's it's actually when you look at when you look at uh social good as such which is this part of the conversation

actually India will have an edge over other countries because our government &gt;&gt; because we already have an edge in the digital space our trans uh system is unparalleled. There's no other part of

the world which has it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Uh well Thomas as everyone else seems to call you you're being you're the tech visionary. My my next question is to

you. We seeing a lot of uh acceleration of AI in different industries whether drug discovery, materials design, climate modeling. Now tell me what area of that AI science synergy excites you

most particularly for the next 10 years in about India. &gt;&gt; Yeah, this is a question I've been waiting for all day George. It it totally excites me uh because um India

as both of them mentioned Arvind uh Ajit uh there's a lot of innovations already happening uh including over and above healthcare and fintech in the educational world. You've heard of UI AI

and multiple other um uh initiatives that are working extremely well. But uh from a AI technology science perspective, you might have all heard of this word called convergence

and that is mindblowing in the way it is happening. It is bringing together five major technologies AI public blockchains energy um and multiomics. I don't know whether you're familiar with multiomics

but it is basically the layering of multiple um genomics and similar studies to bring out healthcare products uh cure cancer and things like that. So this is happening in such a huge way that the

convergence of all this in the coming right now and in the coming years could really transform our lives and that is where the impact on India could be huge. Let me give you an example. I I um I

drive a robo a robo car right now. You might have heard of the Tesla, right? I I have one of the first cars. &gt;&gt; So, you're not driving? &gt;&gt; Yeah. I have one of the first cars which

when I bought I told my son uh uh Adita, this is going to be the last car Tesla built because now the latest versions that I have are entirely driving by itself. I just sit in the car and say,

"Go here." And even over like five inches of snow as we had two two weeks back, it just goes wonderfully. It stops at stop signs, avoids puddles, and even has a Mad Max mode. The way I drive,

right? But the beauty of it is after around 7 billion miles of data, it is 10 times or a thousand% safer than a human driver. Just think about it. Tesla is also building out a humanoid robot. We,

you know, you might have heard of the Optimus. It's already breaking eggs and making a omelette. It is making it is folding clothes. You know, those are things which are difficult for a robot

to do. So, they're bringing that out in a in a year's time. So, what does that how does that affect us right in India? Well, in pretty much all the areas that we have spoken about from education,

from health care, from energy storage, uh, and also you might have heard of the reusable rockets that SpaceX brings into play, right? I mean, ISRO is doing a phenomenal job, but how come we are not

there? We've got smarter, brilliant people here. So, we need to get into all those. However, you know, all those opportunities are there, but there are also certain challenges to uh applying

it at large scale here in India and one of those challenges is upskilling particularly in the robotics and multiomics area where we have strength but we need to get it faster. So, and

that is a message to leadership here. How can we do that faster better? &gt;&gt; Yeah. So I I guess it's uh not just AI but AI was continuously learning with data that's really making it even more

powerful and today AI building the next generation of AI. I think that's really what's what's interesting and so back to you Arvind I think the healthcare industry is probably trying to catch up

on much of these things which is uh which is very technologically advanced in the technology sector. So tell me when an AI system gives medical advice who do patients really trust the doctor,

the machine, the brand behind it and what happens when all of them disagree as AI takes on more roles on clinical decision making what kind of safeguards

or checks should should you put to ensure that there is transparency there's accountability and there's a trust between doctor, patient and AI which is the algorithm itself.

&gt;&gt; So if you walk into a primary care physician's office or a doctor's office even at the Mass General, one of the most annoying aspects that they face is the patient shows up with a bunch of

research and self diagnosis. So it used to be Dr. Google, now it's Dr. chat GPD and you know the doctor or the physician themselves are also constantly researching using some of these tools

but with the right guard rail. So where do you build this trust right and that's still a question we're all trying to determine but I'll tell you there has been incidents of in in the US you have

something called medical malpractice. So, in the last two years, there's been a 14% increase in medical malpractice claims. They pay millions of dollars if they find out that or they prove that

you have moved away from what is called a standard of care. And these medical malpractice claims are in fact being alleged against the models, but it's

going to come back to the same thing. What is that? The clinician is ultimately accountable. The doctor is ultimately accountable. The models and algorithms should remain auditable

and the institution or the physician remains responsible for safety and not just for approving use of AI in the care. So with that type of context, I know in

India this is not very maturely framed out. There is the consumer protection act that protects data privacy. Then there is the National Medical

Commission with guidelines where it shows AI can be a collaborator but leaves matters in the gray zone and the ICMR has offered clear guidance and ethical AI use emphasizing on consent,

data privacy, fairness, human oversight, etc. What I'm trying to get at is the US is still evolving from putting out a lot of AI solutions

out there and then coming back to governance. India should take a very bold step of establishing some governance frameworks and put in place what other parts of the world have

emulated or they're starting to promote including the US. There's the consortium for healthcare AI. there's a joint commission. They're putting out guidelines to be able to create that

level of trust and responsibility between the physician and the patient. So I don't think I answered your question but I definitely will tell you there are guard rails and those

guardrails are around right now it's human in the loop and it'll move to human the as the auditor. So I guess ultimately it comes down whichever way the way you see it the accountability at

least for the foreseeable future will lie with the human right whichever way you look at it. Thank you. Thank you for that. Now Ajit you've been you've been CFO managing budgets in your various

sector in in your financial services career. tell us a little bit about about how AI can play a role in identifying and financing the green or sustainable projects helping that

finance sector today to contribute to the the the the planet sutra if I may of the summit. &gt;&gt; Sure. Uh thanks uh for that question George.

So um I think AI can uh truly be a differentiator there and let me explain you know how that can happen. So if you look at any large scale projects um that will go through

because you know you have ability to track and monitor you know you have systems behind it you know structures etc. But what about the smaller micro projects? What about in smaller farms,

villages, a solar project as an example which will lead to result you know reduction in electricity costs uh which result in climate change. Um AI can help monitor that how through

output uh you know methods like through weather pattern changes uh through uh you know seasonality you know using AI you can monitor things which otherwise is not possible. So there are ways to

measure the efficacy of a climate change project as an example using solar panels and using that that makes it more attractive and then once you do that uh a use case could be you know leveraging

that for you know investing in a smaller scale you know in a in a farmline environment and the repayments happen in time. So um just imagine if you can imagine let's say 10,000 such projects

happening you know in uh small micro lending projects happening all over India that's possible with AI. So that's where AI can truly be a differentiator as opposed to just being an enabler uh

to your very point about climate change uh or you know projects around climate change. So ultimately it's about the analytics providing measurements and as they say what you cannot measure you

cannot improve and here analytics the ability to analyze you know incredible amounts of data convert that data into information and insight of course you know we're now getting there with

machine learning you know providing insight but maybe leave the insight of the human beings but at least you're converting data into information and that information is useful for us to

take decisions and fund these projects &gt;&gt; I guess that that's really one of the advantages India also has any sector you take the the the quantity of data that we have is phenomenal right so uh coming

back to you uh Ven uh just I'm very curious right um innovation particularly in the AI space is moving so fast from I was reading uh one of

those articles recently saying that in 2023 AI couldn't make basic arithmetic calculations in 2026 they're writing whole programs particularly in our technology sector so innovation is

moving really fast yet sectors right? Uh healthcare, financial services, they they might not be moving as fast. So, governance and regulations and certain sectors move slowly. Now, tell me what

scares you more today, moving too slowly on AI or moving too fast without guardrails. So both of us are entrepreneurs and we go by the ethos of build fast, break

things but this is one of the few areas where I would urge caution. uh and it is better to be slow than sorry uh you know precisely because we have all kinds of AI agents models going haywire right now

and it's almost like the wild wide west there right um even in US which typically has a lot of guard rails most of them are being removed right now a and so particularly in India's case uh

without robot uh really really good robers governance ethical alignment, transparency in training data, bias mitigation, uh, and international standards. We could really

be amplifying some of the things that could go wrong, right? And from deep fakes to job disruptions. I mean, even folks like Jeffrey Hinton and Elon Musk speak about how it could

affect uh super intelligent scenarios, right? And I I think here in India we have had some great examples of how things can go wrong. In 2025 I believe there was this deep fake video that went

around and uh about a finance minister and a doctor got scammed out of 20 lakhs. And then there was the case during the India Pakistan border flare up where fake um deep fake videos almost

escalated that crisis. And of course you've all heard about the voice cloning scams. the grandma calls which uh you know I believe it's hitting 47% of Indian adults double the global rate in

fact I warned my mother about those kind of calls be very very cautious so yeah slow governance isn't ideal but in this particular case I would urge caution and adherence to some of the safe open

source safety practices collaborative regulation and India itself pass the India 25 guidelines to have a good check and balance in place. &gt;&gt; Okay, thank you. Thank you Vin for that.

We just have another five minutes. So I just want to open up maybe one or two questions depending on how long our panelists will take to answer that question. So if there's anyone in the

audience who would like to ask a question, uh please do. Um yes, please come along. &gt;&gt; Just pass the mic to the and the panelists I mean I'm requesting

all of you to keep it very short because we do have just four minutes. Go ahead. &gt;&gt; Uh hi uh I'm Sang. I'm a student at Ashoka University. I'm I'm a student at Ashoka University and uh my question to

you essentially was that um you know in in in Indian business um how how difficult is it to minus geopolitical risk especially with visav AI &gt;&gt; how to manage risks

&gt;&gt; geopolitical risk &gt;&gt; geopolitical risks uh in the context way would any of you would like to take that question &gt;&gt; uh geopolitical risks are something that

now organizations in US are having a chief officer for that. It is it is that scary, right? Especially in the current uh geopolitical environment. You never know what is going to go wrong the next

day like what is going to erupt in Iran or the straight of Horus tomorrow. So I think India for that matter has been impacted by the recent tariffs and things like that. But what has amazed me

is how well it has handled the scenario. How it has redirected itself say to align better with Europe. Uh and uh so I I think India is well staged to do that. Uh anybody else on that?

&gt;&gt; Yeah. No I can give you Yeah. So Biden covered the geopolitical risk around finance and you know all of that and the tariffs etc. What about you know a real risk nowadays which you're facing where

wars as an example border skirmishes and things it's moved out of the realm of human you know uh army or hordes of army now it's all AI right you you're creating drones you know you're sending

thousands and thousands of drones technically you can do that so unless you have an ability to counter that with a counter you know AI or an ability to sort of detect and sort of neuter um you

have an issue so I guess my oneline answer to that is be prepared you know So because the whole world is changing and unless we change individuals as individuals all of us and as companies

and corporates and of course as a country uh and this AI conference is a fabulous example of how you know we are trying to sort of get it all together to be prepared in all realms be it

financial be economic be geopolitical uh &gt;&gt; I'll add the healthcare perspective when is the next pandemic going to hit us and what will it be it's all driven by data and so many risk

factors. Uh thank you. Unfortunately, we've really just uh run out of time and &gt;&gt; Georgia. Let me one little thing. You know, I see a lot of young faces out

there and one of the things I'm sure is a burning question is how is it going to impact my future? How is it going to impact jobs for me? Uh and let me just touch on it. Uh this could be utopian,

but I mentioned about Robos taking over most of his job in in US for instance. already a quarter million jobs have been lost this year and primarily to AI right so that is going to happen but here is a

good scenario at least in the west that might come on initially where we go into uh into a model of universal high income where we are taxing companies for AI and robotics where we have 247 productivity

uh and we come with a scenario where most of us won't have to work for a living But we only work if we want to. So let us hope that is where we go to. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So sit on a beach, sip your beer,

and let AI do the work for you, I guess. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you guys. Thank you. I have a question. &gt;&gt; Uh I just want to Yeah. Unfortunately, we've run out of time and I do need to

moderate it. So let's &gt;&gt; surely one more question. &gt;&gt; One more question. Okay. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Go ahead. &gt;&gt; All right. Go ahead.

&gt;&gt; Okay. Hello everyone. &gt;&gt; Uh my name is Arjun Singh from Vijeria Foundation. My question is here is that how we can use the AI in fundraising aspects.

&gt;&gt; All right, let me take that. So you know uh I think AI can change the uh dramatically change the ball game as far as fundraising is concerned because right now what does AI do? It helps you

provide data points. Uh a lender, what is a lender looking for or or a consortium of lenders? They look for credible information, right? So as opposed to being fed pitches and sort of

you know powerful poweroint presentations in a you know sort of um promising the world if you can have AI convert data the multiple data points to sort of information which you can then

provide uh which was not the ability which you didn't have the ability before. uh I talked about micro lending you know at a small scale but even if it's a large large scale project you can

effectively leverage AI to provide the data and information which a lender is looking for to be able to sort of help in fundraising does that answer your &gt;&gt; yes somewhat thank you

&gt;&gt; thank you so thank you Arvind Ajit and Thomas for your thoughts comments and contextualizing your experience for the sutras of people planet and progress let's just uh couple of seconds let's

zoom out and summarize before we close In India, AI must mean inclusion. Be it in healthcare or in talent or wider opportunities in financial services. And the future, the future of AI should not

be decided by algorithms. It needs to be decided by our values. And we humans hold accountability for that. So let's build intelligence that uplifts. So in closing, in a nation of 1.4 4 billion

dreams. AI must not replace ambition. It must amplify it. Thank you. Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; Thank you everyone. Thank you. [applause]

&gt;&gt; Oh, thank you. &gt;&gt; Can I Everyone get lost. Yes, that's why I kind of addressed

Yeah.
