## 📝 Transcript

IT along with government of Punjab, Startup Punjab and Invest Punjab look forward to join hands with UD impact to bring meaningful collaborations for science, technology and innovation.

I Radhika on behalf of IIT Roper will be hosting all of you together here. So with this I take pleasure in inviting our distinguished key speakers of the

inaugural panel of the session. I'll request Mr. Lee from UD impact Korea to be here with us. Today we'll have a group photograph earlier together. Yeah. Dr. Dr. Pushpender Pal Singh project

director Anam AI Foundation Award IIT Roper and Dean Caps IIT Roper. Mr. Yong Wu, co-founder UD impact from AI from Korea. Mr. Ahmed Dhaka, I chief executive

officer of Invest Punjab. And we are also awaiting for Dr. Jay Kong Lee, director Koreanme and startup agency Cosmi. prayer once he is there with us we you

can escort him uh till the dice so I'll request our speakers to please stand we are going to have a group photograph and at the end we are going to get back from India AI team so we can

have a quick photograph very much. 550. Now I take pleasure to call our partners from UD impact who are the main

organizer of this session and seeding the collaborations between South Korea and India specifically from Punjab. I would love to invite Mr. Tong Hong Lee from UD Impact Korea to give us a

glimpse of what UD impact is and how we are going to take the collaborations forward. Uh hello everyone, my name is Tahhung Lee and I'm the director of global

business department in UD impact. Uh first of all I apolog I apolog I loa and punjab to uh joining us here and also cost me and now uh it is really pleasure to be here today and UD impact

creates social impact through entrepreneurship education and for the past 10 years uh we have used government and corporate CSR budgets to provide uh free entrepreneurship programs for

aspire hiring entrepreneurs and early stage startups. Uh we support the full journey uh education, mentoring, networking and followup support to the startup. And so

far we have helped build more than 30,000 startups in Korea. But entrepreneurship education is not only about the how to build a company. It is about learning how to find real programs

uh problems and how to understand them deeply and how to create practically solutions together. So we teach people to test ideas in the real market and meet customers and improve through

actions. So entrepreneurship is a process of solving real world pro uh problems not only just uh building a company. So recently we developed our own AI based LMS platform. So this

system includes an AI coach that gives personal feedback, learning guidance and progress tracking. Learners can study in self uh directed way. So because of this we spend less time on lectures. So and

more time on real execution, customer interviews and market validation and action. With this scalable system, we are now a available to support over 10,000 startups every year.

So entrepreneurship uh creates real and measurement impact. It leads to job creation and growth of local business and stronger regional economies. So startups are one of the most direct ways

to create new jobs and new opportunities. We are also expanding globally beyond Korea. We now operate programs in Japan and India. In India, we train talented

young people and prepare them to work in startups around all over the world. And our goal is reduce the global talent mismatch and help uh solve youth unemployment and build a stronger uh

global startup workforce. We believe enterpreneurs are natural underdogs. They start with limited resources. So they face uncertaintity. They compete with bigger

players. That is why we hold the Asian trademark for the brand underdogs. Under this brand, we run our entrepreneurship education programs to

support the board founders who start from the ground up. UD impact is building a scalable entrepreneurship platform powered by CSR funding and AI technology. We connect people with ideas

to real markets and real opportunities. So anybody who wants to uh be the entrepreneurship please be focused on our underdogs program. Thank you. Please take a seat.

&gt;&gt; Thank you so much Miss Thank you so much Mr. Lee from UD Impact Korea for opening wonderful opportunities where India and Korea come together to boost deep tech entrepreneurial ecosystem specifically

in artificial intelligence. With this I take pleasure in inviting Mr. Amit Dhaka is chief executive officer of invest Punjab. We can sit and have a that would be fine

for his insights into drawing investments to the state of business to state of agriculture state of economic from state of Punjab. A very good evening. I think all

youngsters sitting here must be watching that why this boring bureaucrat is sitting among us. So &gt;&gt; you're also young. &gt;&gt; No, I said boring.

&gt;&gt; Okay, &gt;&gt; I'm not denying that I'm not young. Everybody wants to be young only. So uh thank you very much u for our part partners from South Korea and I roer

which is always integral part of invest Punjab team and we are working with them. So we in government understand very well our role in new age new tech. Our role is of facilitator

and our role is to provide a conducive ecosystem to the new tech industry to survive, thrive and grow. And in current era we know very well that when metros

are saturated the cost to companies and cost to employees and happiness index which matters a lot in terms of quality of life. I think mojali is the best city where one can live half

an hour from shivalik 10 minutes 15 minutes minutes drive to your office which is a luxury in metro cities. the cost of living, the quality of life, the education institutions

around it, uh even schooling and the medical facilities, everything is world class. So you know at times when I interact I don't see any reason that why these tech

companies are not coming to Mojali. Though we have a good ecosystem but when we benchmark us against Gorgams or Hyderabads and Bangalurus of the world then our score is not very healthy. So

we are trying to tell everybody that we are there and somehow now there is a moment of IT companies and tech companies and new age companies towards tier 2 cities and we are very confident

that in tier 2 cities in terms of infra the quality of we have ring of you know tech institutions around mali so let's start with IIT Roper as sir is sitting here we have Punjab engineing college we

have taper Indian college we have IIT Mandi Just in the vicinity we have NIT Kuruketra, NIT Jalander and other reputed colleges ISB, Mouali, Plakshai University which is coming up so well.

Then we have I am ADA Amritsur. So there are ring of institution and research institutions when you talk about semiconductor which everybody's talking about the Mohali is the birthplace of

semiconductor industry in the country. Every senior guy in the semiconductor sector today in different company has been baptized in SCCL moali and fortunately government of India is

funding SCCL and Tata advanced system is going there going to implement that with 5,000 K investment. So in moi we have these research institutions DRDO labs, NIPER,

Iser uh very other organizations of government of India for research, semiconductor manufacturing, the CDIL for packaging everything is there. So now we are pushing very hard to get the

new tech industry whether it is GCC, semiconductor, ESDM, defense and aerospace and in the new policy we are trying to encourage whatever nudge as government we can give in terms of

fiscal incentive we are trying to bring in our next policy and we are starting a campaign called brand moali. a young team is there and we are going to tell that what we have and our biggest USP is

that please come and see don't believe what we are telling so that's how we are approaching things and with new policy we hope that we will cut lot of ice in in in the new

propositions infosys is coming up with a very big uh campus in Mojali with 6,000 uh capacity and we are talking to few GCC's And we are we are fortunate to get one R&amp;D center of 500 kores and CDL,

Mojali and SCL I have already mentioned. So we are trying to put things together and as I was me mentioning Rajiv G that we are in talk with few drone companies. We are trying to put in place a drone

ecosystem. So we are not talking only about the bigger segments. We are going to sub segments and deeper so that you know we can offer something concrete to uh next generation which is uh going to

stay there in and around Mali because Mali is catchment of all of the north everybody who belongs to Himachel Hana JN Kat Rajasthan they want they are happy and happy to be settled at Mojali

and the second part is what state is doing in terms of facilitation there I think at At the cost of being boastful, I can tell that Punjab today has the best regulatory framework in the

country and we are the benchmark. We are the only unified regulator in the country where the all clearances are given by the invest Punjab. It is actual single window which we are talking since

four five decades. All officers of different departments sit in my office. they report to me and file or there is no file of course but things doesn't move out of that uh window and the

clearance time is so fast that if for a particular category if it is green and industrial area you can start your work in 5 days so we are trying to work on manufacturing service sector we

are proposing some rental incentives already there is a gap of IT rentals in Guram and Mali up to delta of nearly half. So we are trying to push it further. So we hope that we are if we

are able to bring initial you know critical mass then it will automatically explode. So that is our goal and for the startups also we are uh we went to Korea and with chief minister and whole

delegation was there and we visited one of the centers uh and on those line as professor Ajiv will agree that we are I'm in discussion with him and I hope that within 2 3 months we have a very

good space which will come up buzzing with the activity already one floor is there and we are going to introduce the first branches given by the state government we are trying to introduce

the second branch for startups. So hopefully it will get through and we are trying to encourage already mature startups to shift to Mojali. There also we are trying to bring in some fiscal

incentives so that you know they are able to sustain. So this is what all about we are doing and we are open to any suggestions any inputs because you guys are more well informed than us. So

whenever you feel like please come to us let us know what we can do how we can improve because it is a continuous journey we can't rest we have to uh try to be better and better every day

and these young and bright brains are our basic requirement to go further. Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much uh Mr. Dhaka for emphasizing on brand Punjab not on just

brand Molly but we are going to make brand Punjab brand India of course with this summit we are bringing brand India on the forefront of global south in artificial intelligence with this now I

invite Dr. Pushpendra Pal Singh project director IIIT Roper Anami Foundation and Award and Dean Caps corporate alumini placements and strategy from IIT Roper for his address and his vision for South

Korea and India collaboration and before I hand over to you Dr. Bushbender we have Dr. Jay Kuang Lei the director for Korean theme and startup agency. We would like you to be here with us.

We welcome you here. Over to you Dr. Pushpender. &gt;&gt; Thank you Radika. Um I thought of extending what uh Mr. Dhaka

talked about the opportunities that Chandigar region or the Mohali region offers. Uh for the colleagues who has not been um to this part of India and have not seen this particular ecosystem,

I would like to update you that around Chundigard and these uh cities we call them Mojali, Jirpur, Chundigard, the the entire tri city area is actually very very good for nurturing a startup

ecosystem. probably in India there is no other place better than uh this area to nurture a startup. There are regions to it. Reasons to it because the lifestyle

is very good. The road survived from one point to other if you want to travel you take very less time. Chandigar region, Mouali region and Jirakpur region has been ranked in India uh five and six in

the startup ecosystem and we are ramping very fast. how I ropper is contributing. I would like to emphasize on that and then I'll talk about how we can do with um the relationship with UD impact and

Korea. um III roer uh though it's uh it's a very young institute only uh 16 17 year old institute on the bank of Slas River is ramping startups

like no other institute ever did in this country today we have more than 400 startups at ID Ropper incubated and all of them are known to be as per the conventional definition of uh deep tech.

These startups are R&amp;D driven. They are not just any startup but the startup which are bringing lot of research and development uh ecosystem together. I ropper also offers which other

institutions are not able to offer because we have a very robust R&amp;D ecosystem at the institute and therefore any opportunity that is needed for a startup to grow a startup if it is going

to develop a prototype they have to actually go through the entire uh ecosystem to do it but when you are at ID ropper you don't have to worry about anything all the labs are available uh

just round the clock and you can go anytime and work the uh the administration at ID Ropper thanks to our director professor Rahuja it has been very very positive and we

could manage to incubate all these startups in last five year of time. Today we are ranked three in the country in the number of startup that any institute have have incubated uh in this

region. We run a program for 100 days and 100 startups. Very successful program. We do support a startup in different schemes with of course uh our ecosystem partners in Punjab and

Chandigar. I would like to um share with you that Punjab itself has 36 plus incubators in the entire region and we call it PINE. PINE stands for Punjab incubator network.

And this entire incubator network when you are planning a startup helps you in many ways which no other. Now when we talk about Korea I think Korea and India has wonderful uh relationship uh in many

ways and uh with the help of Korea and we giving some hands uh to Korea I think we can uh bring this deep tech startup ecosystem to a different height. together we can work. When we talk about

AI, we have to talk about semiconductor. And when we talk about semiconductor, we cannot ignore the very presence of Korea. And therefore, it's important that we work together for the startup

ecosystem in the region. Not only um the startups that are incubated at IDOpper, they are not only incubated let's say from the region of Punjab or Chandigar they are coming from all over the

country and this essentially mean that the relationship that we can build with Korea will enrich this uh ecosystem even further. We hope that such an interaction or such

a gathering we will be of course open at the at some point of time for the questions. I would like to close by saying that do not just rush to one city in this country if you want to build

highquality deep tech startup. Mojali and Chundigad region do offer you the world-class facility the world-class R&amp;D infrastructure. There are 22 plus R&amp;D institutes within the vicinity of 50

kilometer and that only offered in the region of Chandigar and Mujali. So my friends you please consider uh this region. I roer is always available for you and the partners like uh UD impact

in Korea. We will be happy to support you in whatever way we can. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much Dr. Pushpender for highlighting what is there to offer from our side to the budding entrepreneurs

budding startups and we are here to build the ecosystem for deep tech entrepreneurial ecosystem in Punjab spanning the boundary across the nation across the globe with this now I would

like to invite Mr. Yong Su Wu, co-founder UD Impact Area from Korea. &gt;&gt; Hello. Uh my name is Yongu. Uh I'm from South Korea, which is UD impact. Um yeah. Uh I don't have much time to sing.

So I'm going to just emphasize five key factor about the AI. So uh when we running the and incubating startups we always um the I mean the most important thing is about the diagnosis.

So when we did the diagnosis there's four kind of diagnosis. First one is about the character of the founder. We figure out the 12 types of the character of founders which call we call that d o

gs uh dogs but we we uh just yeah say like um uh bishong or like yeah so yeah and the second thing is we emphasize about the act premier which is execution action and the entrepreneur the

collaboration. So we have five key factor about the act premier things like setting goal and uh find figure out the environment and making the structure and set the execution plan and making the

routine. So those things we check about the five uh things about the execution. After that we check about the uh AI skill set. So we have five uh we call the five dimension which is AI domain

data and then finance strategy and the last one is global. So um recently uh because of the AI the start of turning to the globalization like we call that born to global we when we starting the

startup we we need to think about the global market first because of the AI when you use CHP or like a Germany um you can just translate other language easily and you can also understand the

all the culture in the global. So we always think about the global market. So we usually running the crossber program. So we already connect with the Japan, Indonesia, India of course and Korea. So

we running program four different countries together. So we call that crossber program. So we have two type of crossber program. First thing is like um incubating we call that batch program.

So incubating and investing the startup and the second one we raising coach program we call that underdog coach academy which is like a uh for the pacemaker with the startup and uh

there's also our coaches from India. So, oh can you just stand up a little bit and say yeah hello hello to us. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So

I really want to say that this was learning experience for me and amazing learning experience and especially the global aspect of it where I was uh Hello. Hello. Yeah. Hi good evening all.

So I really want to emphasize on the learning experience that I had with uh UCA um learning experience and then the glo global aspect of it was amazing. So there were four countries that

participated into that and uh it was really mind-blowing and also it changed my perspective where I was able to learn the ecosystem of different countries and then collaborate with people who are

having same mindset as me. So it was really amazing. &gt;&gt; All right. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Yeah. And um yeah anyway the last uh I want to emphasize about the um

from the AI we can do anything you want. So uh before when we running the startup we normally say we need three people for the CEO who running the company and the developer and designer. But now AI can

do the design and can we don't need to use coding program. So there's no code. So we call that solo printer. So uh recently we tried to raise the CEO I mean the enterprise only one person can

running the pro uh the company. uh from the solar premier um the most important thing is about the problem definition. I think AI can do all the things and there are so many skills and agent and

automatic automation but when you got uh when you didn't set the problem definition well especially focus on the specific domain you if you don't have uh the domain knowledge or specific domain

uh the legac legacy domain system uh you cannot not uh turn into the AI startup. So that's why we focus on the problem definition really really deeply. Yeah. When we do running the AI startup. So

yeah that's all yeah what we are doing and incubating for the startup and the last one I want to say that um yeah it's really globalization like um also I came here to speak for you guys and so I

think India is one of the biggest and smartest country I There are so many intelligent developer especially in IIT ROA. Yeah. And there's

also big money and global company also there's Google and Meta lots of Nvidia. So there's so many money and so many intelligent people and when you think about the global market first I think uh

there is so many chance to start. All right. Thank you. Thank you so much Wu for wonderfully narrating us what is there to offer and how we can collaborate together

specifically for building startups not just from India or from Korea but together from India and Korea. Thank you. Thank you so much for your insights. Now I take pleasure in

inviting our partner and we also had Dr. Lee at IIT Roper itself when we were having a preAI summit. It's wonderful to have Dr. Jake Wangi, director Korea SMMES and Startup Agency Cosmi with us

who's the person who is driving the South Korean collaboration and integration for SMMES. When we talk about SMMES, India is very very rich inmemes sector and startup sector and

there's loads of things that we are going to do together. So over to you Lee for your insights. &gt;&gt; Nice to meet you everyone. Uh good evening. Uh I am Seyongi, director of

Cosme. Cosme is a uh Korean uh government agency for supporting small and medium enterprise and startup from South Korea in India. I have worked for two years in India as your

representative of India branch of South Korea to support Korean company and startup. So I would like to introduce the our uh actu activity story for supporting uh startup in AI sector. uh

very briefly uh it's a pleasure to be here uh at the India AI impact summit a platform that truly reflect a growing role in shaping

the global innovation landscape. uh India and Korea already share strong and trust partnership in areas such as technology, manufacturing and innovation.

What make this relation special is that our strengths are complimentary. India offers a large market, strong technowing start ecosystem. Korea brings structure

structured business model deep industry experience and global scaling knowow from consumer side we uh have already started working on practical India Korea AI space we have built a partnership

with IIT ROA uh AAHI hub to support Korean AIM and startup in understanding the Indian ecosystem. We also launched the uh the India AI forum already. In addition, we uh

conducted market analysis of AI sector in India to help Korean uh startup make a informed decision. Uh throughout this experiments uh experience we clearly uh see that AI act actor bridge combining

combining the Indian market and technology strength with Korean business models and uh execution capability. I believe AI startup collaboration between India and Korea will become even

more important. uh the future right in uh co-creation not competition. Uh second thing is a joint pilot test bed and market entry program. The third thing is helping startup scale from Asia

to global market. If uh India and Korea work together, we can help our startup become global player, not just a local success story. Uh thank you very much and I look

forward to exchanging view during panel discussion. Thank you very much. Thank you so much Dr. Lee for emphasizing on what things we can do together and how we are already

collaborating to nurture many new innovative ideas specifically in field of AI. Now it's the time uh with pleasure I would like to invite our driving force director IIT Roper

Professor Rajiv Vuja for his insights and how IIT Roper is pushing itself to the frontier areas of artificial intelligence. Over to you sir. So thank you Radhika and uh first of all

I would like to welcome the Korea delegation on behalf of IIT Roper and uh you make some time to come to India. I know it's not easy to travel sometime especially both of you actually and I

can tell you Korea is my second home. I used to spend 3 months every year in Korea and I know a little bit Korean also. So I already talked to these two guys and uh I have two of my student

they are professor in Korea also one in Soul National University and one in postc in Pohhank. So uh what we are talking what Pushbendra has mentioned already about IIT Roper as we are a

young generation IIT. So we have a different kind of aspiration. So when you are young people you are more curious. When you are more curious

then you will be more innovative. So what we are going in doing at IIT Roper we are growing through research and innovation. And when I say research research is the mother of innovation. So

if you want to make India as a innovative country. So you have to do more research. When we talk about research we are talking about translational research. So uh this is a

more emphasis in India than that. uh also the for IIT Roper is a main focus and that's what is it turns out that we have so many number of startups uh coming out from IIT Roper being a

younger institution and uh I can tell you that we have that kind of ecosystem at IIT Roper which can help you to incubate your companies and we have have a staff or we have a

faculty that is also young so it works very well actually And when I talked about South Korea actually I I told you that I've been there many times and I am at their world-class university program

and I was the one who started this in Korea IBS program uh when we started because Korea want to get a Nobel prize and I say you don't do any basic research Nobel Prize is given for basic

research because of that they started this program called IBS. So we want to work together and being a roper in a Punjab we can get a a right kind of ecosystem already Amit Dhaka has

tell you told you about uh Roper or about Punjab or about Mahali. So it roert is only 45 minute from Chundigar and 50 minutes from the airport. So it's a very good connectivity and there are

many of institution of national importance in that area more than 30 institution. So you can have a all ecosystem to have a right kind of a startups and when we talk at IIT Robot

we are here not to help big industry we want to helpmemes or or medium scale industry because they need the help they need innovation and they are the biggest sector which give

the employment in India that's a medium scale industry and small scale industry so we are working with them and we want to help them and uh I roer is collaborating with them in that

direction so they can develop in a right way becoming a company more innovative companies rather than doing a traditional job. So this is the way to grow and this is the way to IoT robot is

growing and we are willing to work with South Korea and uh being a one of the technology premium institution in India and we have a presence in all over India. So we can work not only in Punjab

but we can all work in other state also and we are looking open for a close collaboration with the south of South Korea actually because I was reading somewhere logo actually they said that

South Korea is a soul of Asia is it right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. It's a south of Asia. &gt;&gt; So that what they talk actually and we we have a win-win opportunity and we

can work a young country like South Korea and and with India and then I'm I'm sure that this collaboration will lead some a wonderful and meaningful result. Thank you.

Thank you so much, Professor Huja, specifically for sharing the memories that you have with South Korea and seeding the seeds for the wonderful collaboration in deep tech with South

Korea. So, we will take a moment to felicitate and express our gratitude towards all our speakers for making this wonderful panel exciting, deliberating and definitely leading to more and more

collaborations in future. So I'll request uh Dr. Pushpender and Dr. Lee to step in front to felicitate professor Rajiv Wahhuja &gt;&gt; and then we will get felicitations to

them from your side. We'll start with you and then &gt;&gt; we have to &gt;&gt; guest. &gt;&gt; So I know

Now I request Professor Huja to felicitate our partners from South Korea. We'll start with Dr. Jay Kuang Lei, director Korea and startup agency Cosmi.

will uh request Mr. Yongu Wu, co-founder UD Impact AI Korea and we thank you for your presence to this session. Korean

&gt;&gt; recently we do like this together. &gt;&gt; I have those video. &gt;&gt; Now I request Mr. Tong Lee from UD Impact Korea to please step forward.

Now I request all our Korean partners to come together to felicitate Dr. Pushpendra Pal Singh. Now I invite all the team members from the organizer side from startup Punjab

from Invest Punjab from cosmi from UD impact from IIT Roper to be here for a group photograph Dr. Radhilan, Amar Pal, Salil, Dimple G, please all of you come together here and team IIT Roper and

from Cosmi and UD impact please be here with us for a group photograph. You also come here. Where is our camera? &gt;&gt; Sorry.

Look at the me. Thank you. &gt;&gt; We have a special appreciation for our India AI team and the coordinators from their side. We love to have Ria here,
