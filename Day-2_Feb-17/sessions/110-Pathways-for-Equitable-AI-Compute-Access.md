## 📝 Transcript

Welcome all of you to this multistakeholder dialogue that is being organized by the Oxford Martin AI governance initiative in collaboration with the quantum hub and the committee

of global thought Columbia University. As you know this will be focusing on shared compute hubs a pathway for equitable AI compute access. We will be having a panel discussion and

most of the panelists are here except one who's running slightly late and as all of us who navigated the cues we know that there's a reason behind it. Um the session today will be focusing on AI

infrastructure. As AI gets more and more intricately woven into every fiber of our world, we aim to spark a conversation today on the need for equitable access to AI compute and

ensure that countries or companies and there is a systemic global balance here. Uh we have a stellar panel with us today. First and foremost, there is Robert Trager who's

the co-director of the Oxford Martin AI governance in Initiative and he focuses a lot on global AI governance and strategic risk. There's also Linda Griffin who's the vice president global

policy from Mozilla. She leads public policy on topics like platform accountability and artificial intelligence. We have Miss Sangeita Gupta, senior vice president and chief

strategy officer from NASCOM. She works closely with industry, government and startups to advance India's innovation ecosystem. We have Hector with us who's the director responsible AI public

policy at Microsoft. He focuses on governance of safety and security risks associated with advanced AI systems. We also have Pente who's the senior policy adviser Tony Blair Institute for Global

Change. Her research focuses on translating emerging tech into practical policy frameworks to strengthen state capacity. Sunil will be joining us soon. He's the managing director and CEO of

Yota data services. He's also known as the data center man of India. Perhaps that explains the delay. And lastly, we have Rohit Kumar, founding partner, the quantum hub, who will be moderating the

discussion today. He brings deep expertise in technology policy and leads the firm's AI governance practice. Over to you Rohit. &gt;&gt; Thank you Sanskriti and uh good

afternoon everyone and thank you for being here. Um I think I just wanted to start by saying that since we are at the impact summit I think it's important to begin with a simple question. Uh impact

for whom and powered by whose compute. Uh this is the part of the day when the glamour kind of drops where we are just talking about you know all the positive use cases of uh AI but and the export

controls kind of kick in. Um what I wanted to say is that uh since morning and yesterday I've been listening into a lot of conversations how we need to diffuse AI faster through our societies

what it can do for our economies what it can do for public services etc. uh but while AI is borderless in its applications unfortunately compute is not and where compute is concentrated

has a big role to play in terms of who gets to innovate who gets to govern uh and who gets to eventually deliver impact right uh so this is what we are here to unpack today in this session how

do we move from ambition to use AI to actually have meaningful access especially for the global south uh there is a model of shared compute hubs that the Oxford uh uh institute has been

working on and you know we would love to sort of see if that is a viable solution uh that we could sort of look at what are the risks and the trade-offs that come with it but at the core I want to

emphasize again that this is not a technology discussion this is a political discussion this discussion is going to unpack the political economy of this particular technology uh so with

that let me start I've sort of divided the discussion into two parts part one where we sort of look at the lay of the land and part two where we go a little bit more detail into the political

economy. Uh I wanted to start with Linda uh because Linda at Mosula uh you know and Mosula has been doing a lot of work talking about how uh has argued that foundations of digital systems need to

be as accessible as the applications that are built on top and they have been looking at concentration of uh you know in markets and so Linda from your perspective why is compute such a

critical issue right now what are you seeing happening around the globe and why do you think we should all pay attention &gt;&gt; a simple question. Uh thank you for that

very meaty question and I'm very happy to kind of uh uh I set the tone. Quite simply um AI progress is bottlenecked right to influence the rest of the ecosystem.

So you touched on this you can choose what to build, who gets to test to research, what models to train, what products to scale, what research agendas to prioritize. is it has a huge knock-on

effect. Um, Mozilla has seen this before, right? Control of critical infrastructure concentrates. You've less choice, you have less accountability, and you have fewer paths for newcomers.

Uh, who here remembers the 1990s? Hands up. Come on. I knew there'd be a few of you, right? Something really special and important happened in the 1990s, and it was the battle for the early web. And

often, uh, what worries me a lot, I have a global role at Mozilla. A lot of policy makers, not all but a lot of policy makers have forgotten what happened in the 1990s and the lessons of

history, right? Um India is a country with a huge history, right? And we know that the lessons of history repeat themselves. Um so there was a massive concentration of power in the early days

of the web. Um, and what emerged from that was this kind of very special moment of fighting back where and it was it was kind of one of those tingling moments where you had the likes of

Linux, Apache and Mozilla kind of emerge from this fight, try and battle for the open web. Um, they really approved like Linux through the operating system, Apache through the

web server like which you know set up the success of the early web and Mozilla through the idea that you can build technology in the public interest. Um, these or organizations shaped how tech

could power the world's infrastructure and often do it better than proprietary models and systems and and that was a big thing and it's something we don't talk about enough right now. It showed

us that the internet can be affordable, right? You don't have to buy expensive licenses. Startups and universities and research institutions can use a lot more shared tools. Uh, the internet uh can

enable innovation, right? A lot more experimentation. Uh, you can keep the internet open. Not one company can set the rule the rules for how it should be rolled out and opensource at scale does

work right uh and that's something a lot of us from Azilla are here at the summit to talk about the power and the role of open source so today compute equals power we know this that's why we're here

but if we don't distribute access then there's no competition without competition there is no innovation and we know that the market is just not incentivized to do this on its own. So

we need both better policies and we need new technical innovation and ideas like this comput hub to start actually tackling these issues and not just describing them as I've done so well

right now. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much and welcome Sunil. Um I wanted to actually uh and you know it's good Linda that you touched upon some of these things you know the themes

that you touched upon open source uh compute equals power competition are all things actually I think the global south is very critically thinking about in fact India has been thinking about it

quite critically you see the AI governance guidelines that we've released all of these themes are sort of touching are being touched upon the question however is that how do you

practically then try and translate some of this into actually hedging your risks as a country and uh how do you sort get some leverage. So in that context, Robert, um I know that you uh at uh you

know shared compute hubs is one potential idea that has been sort of discussed. So I just wanted to sort of come to you and understand that at a conceptual level, what would something

like this look like and why do you think can it outperform purely national strategies? And if I may before you come in, is this in some ways also what the Canadian PM was trying to get to get at

at Davos that the middle powers band together and try and create something strategic that they control? &gt;&gt; Yeah, thank you. Yeah, I think you know for a lot of the world today these

questions that fundamentally center around sovereignty are really at the core of uh what many are asking. And you know I think can we imagine in the

world today that uh some actors would be very trans transactional about the access to advanced technology. You know is that is that something that we can imagine today? I think many of us

can quite easily imagine that. And so then the question becomes what should all other countries in the world do? So all countries in the world in fact Kalik Kabali uh made this point

yesterday. All countries in the world that are not the United States and that are not China seem to have a bit of a common interest in being sure that they have continued

and certain access to these advanced technologies into the future that seem likely to be the bases ever more to economic systems and even to security. And so then the question becomes uh how

should that happen? And I think you know one of the interesting things when we're thinking about what sort of world we want to create is also that you know even the United States and if you listen

to some of the things that for instance Michael Katzios has been saying uh has been recognizing this that is has been understanding that in order to uh have the sort of economic relationships that

it would like to have it's going to require uh something like security and sovereignty uh guarantees for for other places. So you know right now um often countries

are sort of renting compute you know there will be an international cloud provider who will build a data center in the country and then there's been a big emphasis on data localization.

So data from the country staying in the country which is great but I don't think it gets you all the way in fact not nearly all the way to digital sovereignty

because instances of of models tend to be hosted elsewhere. if there was a you know a moment when when that became something that uh

perhaps uh could be restricted elsewhere even if there's a local data center there's no way to pre prevent that at least there's some technical details here but in most of the world given the

current setup of of the technology and and legal frameworks there's no way to prevent that. So, three minutes left. Three minutes over. Yeah. Yeah. No, I'm coming to the end. [laughter]

Absolutely. I just want to make sure. Thank you. Um, yeah. So, um, so I think, you know, if if countries want real digital sovereignty, compute is very much at the core of

that. And so the possibility of uh pooling compute in some way having compute that there is governance over that maybe is treated as digital public infrastructure something India really

has lots of experience in. Um these things are potentially I think very important not the only things we need to do because we can also think of examples of companies that had huge financial

resources lots of access to compute but haven't been able to get to the frontier of AI uh I think in some cases because they didn't have uh really a a critical mass of of AI talent but you

AI talent in its origin is incredibly distributed around the world. This is the last thing I'll say, I promise. Uh is incredibly distributed around the world. We did a back of the envelope on

all the leading AI scientists in the world in industry and out. And we found that 90% uh do not come from either the United States or China. And so I think there is kind of a global interest in

the sorts of solutions both on on compute and on talent uh that would benefit most of of the world and and in fact potentially all of the world. Um so you know it is kind of the challenge of

our time. &gt;&gt; To the point that you made 90% don't come from the US and China but do they stay there? you know they re it's amazing to see how

just they're spread all over the world you know leading scientists of course from India and Cambodia and Japan and Europe and all around uh and many of them are working in the US and China

&gt;&gt; but that visa regime may change that very soon so &gt;&gt; yeah [laughter] &gt;&gt; uh okay cool uh Sunil I wanted to come to you but before I u you know ask you

the question I wanted to just sort of explain to the audience the idea of the shared comput hubs and there's a paper that uh you know the Oxford Institute has put out is putting out is that

countries recognize that standalone they can't build large infrastructure. They don't have the bargaining power uh you know to get the best prices. They may not it is also very capital intensive.

So the idea is that can we pull together resources build something and then based on maybe the amount of capital that you put in you share the access to it and there is a governance structure to it

that is relatively independent of the political structure uh so that uh you know it it it can be used now. So Sunil building on that now since you are the data center uh man of India and I think

there's nobody here who has more experience of the realities of building infrastructure uh what are the challenges that sometimes policy makers don't foresee

when they think about this kind of infrastructure cost uptime tradeoffs uh it'll it will be great to hear from you &gt;&gt; yeah uh thanks u I think if we just uh turn ourselves us two years back just

two years back and we had a GPI summit in India and uh we all were talking about that India has skill sets India startups uh you know India nobody can give you a market bigger than India when

one 1 billion people are carrying smartphones and connected to internet you know most of them on 5G or fiber so you cannot have a better market than India and of course there's a supply you

know the raw material for building AI startup skill sets data sets everything is there what India does not have is compute You won't believe two years back India was practically not having any

compute. From that stage to today when you are seeing a interest of that we all are just struggling to even get into Batamand attending this event. We can just see by the way I came rushing from

a different hotel to here just to just to get in and that shows the where India has reached just in two years and many many great things happened during this period. Of course private sector has

taken rest. People like us have built data centers which are very very specific to GPUs. It's very very different type of data center. You are talking about like 25 50 times more

densely populated from a power and cooling point of view. We have learned our own cycles of how to deploy these monsters called GPUs and now thousands of them putting a special type of

networking how to build energy and power for that. We have done and obviously there's a whole lot of technical stack around that but the point is we have done it. India as we know any technology

India adopts India will always be late adopter you know whether it was a laptops or desktop at some time or whether it was mobile revolution whether it was a 3G 4G 5G revolution or for that

matter digital payment revolution we all were late to start but when India started we have a very good knack of doing everything in a frugal economy way we build it on a huge scale cing to our

population but once that scale is reached we bring the unit cost of living to such a low level that the whole population start adopting it and that is the key to success for any technology in

India. Same thing I think we were able to foresee two years back. Government was able to foresee when they started India emission. What was happening? Government of India

had two challenges at that time. Three I would say scenarios at that time. Should India leave it to a capitalist uh you know a framework like a capitalist economy like a US where private sector

with deep pockets can just invest and you know let them drive the whole AI revolution. Should India completely like government start building data centers, purchasing GPUs and do the complete wave

on their own or should India follow a hybrid type of a model and I would say rightly so government has done a y job in creating something called India mission they are acting not only as a

policy maker as a regulator but more importantly they're acting as a marketplace right they never decided we will build data centers we will buy GPUs right they said you guys in private

sector you know it better how to build data center how to build GPUs how to do all this you know how to do innovation you guys put capital you guys take risk you build it you run it you you know

give it on a consumption model we'll just take it from you make your business model viable but we will take GPUs from you put our own money government is funding they are giving me money for my

GPUs and then they are giving those GPUs to people like a serv people like a bhajan people like a socket people like Bashini and you can see the India skill set taking for that is why you see so

many of models getting inaugurated in this event itself and you have done a revolution that server's model are now beating chad GPT and Gemini is also in certain certain areas of AI right so

what I would say is certain things India has done right we have been not able to not only able to create data centers which are being for cloud revolution obviously the same infrastructure is

getting now ready for taking the AI way different data center but we have learned our way how to purchase land how to go through government approvals, how to make buildings, how to source power.

You know in India we have something called jugarard culture. So even though you have all the problems, you still are able to find your way through that and still able to grow your industry from

200 megawatt to 1.4 gawatt. Even if AI would not have come, our industry was in any case becoming 3 gawatt in next 3 4 years. Now it'll become 6 gawatt to 10 gawatt. AI coming in we don't know. But

the ingredients in terms of states giving policies and incentives to us attracting people like us to build into their state. They're giving us free land. They're giving us stamp duty

wavers, registration waiverss. They're giving us cheaper power, competing with each other to attract us. India emission is f funding us. So what I would say and now you will see in this event and I

think till the next three days you will see lots of global operators. Yesterday you saw Blackstone investing into India. In the next two days you will hear some big announcement from Yota and Nvidia

also. You will see it from private sector also. So now possibly people have tested blood that India tipping point has started coming in AI what you saw in UPI. 50 UPI moments in AI is about to

come in India. So if we invest now India will scale to possibly five times 10 time 15 time more 1.4 billion people adopting AI on their smartphones will do the magic. I would say we are on the

right path. Government is doing great job. Private sector is doing a great job. I would say just remain on this path. Don't stop. I saw a statement from secretary or minister two days back. Now

let private sector take over. I think that is the most dangerous statement to give. Government has done a great job in funding the training cycle of models. Let them take it through the inferencing

cycle also because once these models get into inferencing use cases go in people hand. People will become comfortable paying maybe some transaction fee of 10 pesa per transaction or maybe some

subscription fee of 100 rupees. Once those business models of serums and software become successful then government say okay let me take a policymaker role I'll not fund anymore

till that time let private sector let government let all of us here keep on building keep on doing what we are doing we on the right path thank you &gt;&gt; I think that was a fantastic fantastic

question [applause] if I had the money I would have invested uh but unfortunately I don't uh so with that sangeita let me come to you I mean you can build on actually a lot of what

said because at natcom you've seen both sides you've been involved in all the discussions. Uh so I wanted and uh you know it's really good to hear how the government has played that supportive

ecosystem building role in trying to ramp up India's compute infrastructure but from your lens one what does the compute market largely look like right now are you happy with the progress uh

what is working well in coordination and where perhaps more gaps remain and we need to do more &gt;&gt; I think after sunil's inspirational speech it's very hard to match uh you

know anything else that's going but I think I just want to build on a few things he said right one I think the India approach to how we looked at compute. So don't just try and build it

on your own. Build this hybrid model where government and industry can come together and you offer it at at the lowest possible price because compute is just so expensive. Right. So I think

that was definitely a very differentiating factor that India did. I I think the second is uh as in the current environment the whole focus on expanding data center capacity in India

whether it's the hyperscalers and you know investments that they are going to be doing in India whether it's the India data centers and the expansion that they are doing uh and I think even the recent

budget announcements right so clearly uh the focus on data centers cloud GPU compute is become central to India's AI growth story right I mean it's no more just something on the fringe it's just

like maybe what the technology services so industry saw in the 1990s to Linda's point you're really seeing that moment come together for for really AI in India now uh I think to get your specific

questions is it enough uh I think they're doing a great job with aggregating 38,000 GPUs and you know obviously they're putting in a request for more and and making that happen but

I think the demand far outpaces that right clearly uh you know the government has to be picky on choosing what they are investing and subsidizing in but there are a large number of startups the

large number of researchers who will need much more affordable access to compute. So how do we make that happen? And it's not an easy job to do that but but I think we've got to seize this

moment as Sunil said and and make a higher investment to make sure that we are not just restricting it to a few big bets but many many more bets that we can take forward right so I think that that

would be one I think uh constraints or you know issues that probably need addressing one is while there's a lot of policies on paper from a you know land acquisition from a uh electricity

[snorts] and all of those issues I think the coordination is always not so easy right especially state center what policies are available what incentives are

available I think we need again to use an example of a digiatra kind experience right something which is very very seamless which links state laws central laws all together rather than trying to

do one thing here and one thing there so I think that's one two is I think as a country we need to think about uh energy right I know ya is uh all built out on renewable energy but we cannot only

focus not keep you know we have to make sure that we are rightly focused on what energy will be needed to drive all this compute and data center capacity and how do we make sure we are rightly prepared

for that. So yeah, I think that's where I would put it. I think it's still a glass half full. We have a long battle a long journey ahead but and it's a journey which we need to compress over

the next 18 24 months. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you so much. And in fact building on what you said that you know the demand significantly outpaces the supply. Uh let me come to you

Hector. uh you lead responsible AI policy work at Microsoft and so I just want in the context of infrastructure how does Microsoft look at responsibility especially when you're

operating across jurisdictions u and with different political and regulatory expectations and uh if I may say so how do you kind of balance commercial realities with equitable access

can you hear me and thank you very much thanks for having Microsoft on this panel um let me take a step back here and and actually give you a couple of figures from our latest diffusion report

because I think it it helps to illustrate a bit the problem. Um we see today that roughly one in six people globally use generative AI tools. And the the problem that we have here is

that 40 uh 24.7 of working age people in the global north are using these global tools at the at an adult age versus 14.1 in the global south. And I think this gap unfortunately is only widening and

we need to do something about it. I guess we're we're sometimes overindexing the question on do you have a frontier model? Do you have a very powerful AI model? And I I think the reality of AI

adoption it's it's more based on on the three T's, right? The first T is do you have the technology? Do you have the technology foundation? Do you have the connectivity? Do you have the power? Do

you have the compute? The second T is trust. Do you have the security infrastructure? Do you have the responsible AI practices that help to scale AI and and create, you know, these

essential layers of confidence? And this and the third T is the is the T of talent. Do you have the skills to make AI useful in practice? And this is where I think your point about talent being a

bit too concentrated in China and the US. Well, it's it's a good point, but if you see AI adoption trends today, countries like Norway, Singapore, and UAE are actually leading the the race in

terms of AI adoption. So, I guess you have considerable pool of talents capable of making this AI these different AI tools in practice across the tech stack. And so when we talk

about technology foundation, it's obviously how AI can be deployed and constrained by the availability of infrastructure. And we have been increasing our own investments at

Microsoft in terms of data centers across the global south and supporting local infrastructure ecosystem um deployers deployers companies helping public services also to adopt AI

confidently etc. It's like um to focus a bit on the trust uh dimension here because that's that's my area of expertise. When we created our office of responsible AI in 2019, we were relying

on some responsible AI principles, principles such as privacy, inclusion, transparency, fairness, and we're still relying on these principles to shape how we deploy

our AI models and systems. And so basically, I think when we talk about the infrastructure layer, we're talking about three different things. The first thing is the rule of law and the

importance to reflect you know access decisions that are grounded in obligations and objective standards that belong to one country. The second subject that is so important is the

subject of fair competition on our Asia platform. We host a thousand models. So of course we have open AI entropic models but we also have Mistra models. We also have coher models a

Canadian company. We also have deepseek models hosted on Asia. And I think that's because AI social value depends on this plural ecosystem. And I guess you know

on on this dimension of of trust partnership as governance is critical and and Robert you mentioning digital sovereignty and and I guess this is

where some delicate questions come at play whether what what does it actually mean digital sovereignty? Does it mean control? Does it mean ownership? And that's a question that have been so

present during the web debates of course but also during the cloud computing debates um in Europe during the past years. And so um my my personal belief is that no state or no company can or

must dominate every layer of the IT tech stack. And so the practical play here is is to decide where you want to build durable influence. And I think that becomes in this in this principle in

specific layers whether it's like data creation or having specialized models which are very very good at coding uh but also like building the regulatory standards and trust layers that are

necessary for people to adopt these technologies. And I think that's that's really that's really indispensable. Um just a last point on on sovereignty and I I know I'm over time. Um I I I

think the point that Khalika made yesterday is actually critical. the capacity of language to perform well uh of models to perform well across languages, cultures and contexts is such

a critical point and so you could imagine a world where fine-tuning some model with the right data sets with the right safety tools that would be translation of English normsbased safety

tools but actually like safety tools reflecting community based needs is actually a critical question and I think an interesting one for my co-panelists as well.

&gt;&gt; Great. No, thank you so much. I think and it's interesting that you spoke about rule of law and access and I'll build on that uh in the second part but also you mentioned that a lot of us are

overindexing on frontier models uh basically this narrative that each country needs to build its own frontier models foundational models and then make sure that you control the entire tech

stack so that you don't get left behind in this global arms race so to speak or the AI race that has started uh interestingly pin has a very is a kind of a different take because uh most

recently they did some at the Tony Blair Institute They did a study to say that we are probably reframing AI sovereignity incorrectly. Uh it's less about being self-sufficient and owning

everything on your own but uh noticing parts of the stack where you should have leverage. So would you want to come in on that? &gt;&gt; Hi um thank you for the question and um

today is the first day of Chinese New Year and this is the first time I left my uh family to be with you. So very happy to be here. [laughter] Um I think these discussions are really

critical which is why I'm here and I think um Hector you really prefaced uh what I'm going to say very well because I think in over the past few years uh we've heard things like you know AI's

arms race uh AI sovereignty and that is not really helpful because I think that is framed in a way that treats um sovereignty primarily as something to be owned and to be controlled and it was

informed uh primarily by uh previous um industrial ages uh you know where assets are um first and foremost physical. Um but there is a very profound challenge for governments today when um you know

how to govern and lead in the age of AI when many of these digital assets uh are borderless and are globally. Um so I think there is a nuanced difference between what we call AI

sovereignty and sovereignty in the age of AI. And in our latest paper we reframed uh sovereignty as um strategic agency meaning um the ability of governments to exercise deliberate

choices over how AI is being governed, assessed and deployed. And as you as you pointed out a few of you uh that no country can actually own the entire AI stack right from models,

access to compute, energy, talent, applications and so on. So in our paper we developed what we call the control steer depend framework CSD and actually um Sunni you earlier mentioned about

some of these things and I think India is a really prime example of how you are not um trying to control the market but actually how you at times you have to depend on the market but really

importantly is about securing access to frontier model instead of building everything yourself. um and also by sheer scale of your population you were able to steer the market in areas you

know that are important to you so that you can unlock uh national um economic competitiveness. So I think having said that uh I just wanted to underscore an important point uh which you also uh

mentioned earlier. Um we look at we want to look at AI in two different uh phases right one is around training and a lot of uh emphasis a lot of discourse is talking about uh hard infrastructure

right who will build the frontier models who will own the data centers um who has access to energy and so on but I think very importantly it's about uh uh inference how can we draw on the the

models uh to infer or to create outputs that are useful to your citizens to society at large so that we really unlock the transformative potential um of AI. Kind of speaking to what Hector

also mentioned about the divergence in adoption because I think diffusion is a really important um aspect here that also needs to be considered so that we can really um harness the potential of

AI to deliver to society at large. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. I think this helps me move into the second part of the uh discussion which is about the political economy and unfortunately the debate has

gone in this direction because recent developments in geopolitics have sort of led this discussion because two years ago I think it was a little different world uh and there was less worry around

some of these issues now the question is that if you don't control this if this technology permeates your entire ecosystem and now you don't control the infrastructure on which it runs can you

suddenly find yourself hamstrung Right. And so before I go in, I wanted to just introduce a very interesting concept that was uh uh you know spoken about by professor John H of the Harvard Kennedy

School at a presummit event that we had done uh on the same subject and he said there is a AI trillemma which is that the idea that it is extremely difficult to maximize all three speed of AI

development competitive advantage and democratic control and oversight which means that if you try hard to get any two you are most likely going to miss on the third. So if you move very fast on

innovation and speed, you will most likely lose democratic control, right? Uh so and shared compute hubs in that way that you know countries band together is presented as one way to

address this trade-off. So I wanted to come to either Linda or Robert to say that how quickly uh uh you know tech has become a geopolitical lever over the past couple of years. Will shared

compute hubs survive this test of the AI trilma? Um and let's say the shared comput hub is physically located in India in the you know in South Asia we have one of the largest populations

great tech talent and tomorrow there is a fight that happens you know India Pakistan are fighting India Bangladesh are fighting and India controls the physical infrastructure so what gives

confidence to my neighbors to share the compute with me &gt;&gt; I'll happily start and then I'm going to bat to you sir excellent I'm actually going to reference something you said

earlier on uh it was actually a year ago at the French AI summit the Martin Tis day who was a key architect of that was quoted, "If you're not China or the US, we are all in the same boat." Now, I'm

going to add to that metaphor. We are in that same boat facing a wall of money. An absolute wall. If anyone's seen the Game of Thrones, imagine that great wall. That's it. Um, and we can't get

past it. It is, it is unbelievable. Um, AI is all about, and again, my other esteemed panelists have talked about this, the biggest, the best, the fastest. Um and surprisingly that all

adds up to an unsustainable business model. What we have now in AI is not sustainable. What we have in AI in five years might be very very different. Um to geopolitics, I've been working in

public policy globally for 20 years. This doesn't feel so different to me if I'm frank to what's been happening in the past. It's just different language, different lexicon. I've seen this

before. It doesn't mean it's not serious and these aren't serious issues. They absolutely are. But um geopolitics, death, taxes, tech regulation, geopolitics, facts of life. So we must

just take that as part of what we need to work with. It's a given. So there's two principles I think when we're thinking about shared compute hubs and how we approach this. First of all, the

lessons of open source. We need to remember what has happened before and how we can learn from this. This thesis about working across countries, open-source software, right? The lessons

of that open source AI, it is it is about decentralization. in it is about working across countries. So governments when they're thinking about shared compute and how they work together need

to think about how they promote that, right? How can you incentivize more open source projects by requiring maybe readouts, interoperability, openness from the projects that they support. And

the second is get your shared principles right. You want no surprises in this, right? Those shared principles need to be about public interest. If governments are going to work together in something

as big as compute, they cannot take a market approach. Yes, we all want to win the AI race. We all want to uh it's that fear of missing out that that really per you know is pervasive in AI at the

moment for good reason. There's a lot of money on the table, a lot of development, a lot of change. Um but we have to stop with this myopic focus on product market fit and think about long

term. Think like a VC, right? What is my long-term investment here? there might not be a market for this but actually this is something that is important in our shared values as societies that we

want to invest in and see more of what's the public AI infrastructure that we need to be building so I think getting those principles right and agreeing those principles if you're going to

partner internationally on these things and like let me be clear we need to partner internationally on these types of projects and find better ways of doing that um just to say there's also a

lot of innovation be open to that um at Mozilla we're at the very beginning of what we can contribute to the comput debate. So the Misilla Foundation is starting to explore alternative

um public compute architectures especially for low resource countries. We need to start thinking about precise problems we want to solve and not just what we want to build and make. We're

also investing and partnering with lots of startups who are investing um and building decentralized compute. Such things can be a reality but we've got to again fund together, work together to

make that happen. I hope next year at a future AI summit, we're talking about things like small AI. I was talking about small AI with someone just before this conference. Small AI focused,

decentralized. That would be a very good evolution to what we're talking about now. &gt;&gt; Yeah, Robert. Uh yeah, &gt;&gt; there we are. I'll be brief. I just want

to make two points. uh first on on sovereignty and I want to underscore uh that one thing India is doing incredibly well and and stands to continue to do incredibly well into the future is uh

the use of AI models and applications of AI models and developing an AI developer ecosystem here in India that's doing incredible work. I think India is very well positioned to do that and to

continue doing that and that's incredibly important to underscore and we also though at the same time that we emphasize that we have to ask ourselves a lot of that work is premised upon

access to frontier models. So we have to ask ourselves is the access to those frontier models guaranteed? Is it guaranteed? And we have to maybe not assume that the future is going to

be like the past. Do we have guaranteed access to that? And I would say there are, you know, we can answer ourselves questions like, you know, what, you know, is open-

source going to be enough? Maybe it is. But maybe there will be a divergence between capabilities of open source and non-opensource models. I think that's to be determined and we have some ability

to influence that. Um so we can ask ourselves are local instances of models being hosted here in India you know if you're using um chat GPT no uh and so what does that what does that

mean and then we can ask ourselves well if there is compute that's based in a place you know I think we have to also be careful uh when we're thinking geographically

about compute because you can have compute As my colleagues know very well, you can have compute in a place, but that compute has a logic layer that means that it is essentially calling

back calling home if you will uh before it can do things uh like major updates and shut down and all sorts of things. So there is an ability for places that are far away if they decided to there is

an ability to be transactional about access to these frontier models. So I think while we are celebrating the incredible things about the ecosystem, we also have to be asking ourselves what

are the solutions to to this issue. And just very quickly um a view that I think others are are echoing here is that it is impossible for any country in the world really to go it alone when it

comes to building this extraordinary infrastructure. So I think we do need to think about how can there be collaboration in this space. &gt;&gt; Got it. Uh we're running out of time but

we uh I just wanted to give a heads up that everyone who has left uh who I come to just keep it a little shorter. Uh uh Pin I wanted to come to you. Do you want to come in on that and do you disagree

with anything that was said because also this whole thing even India has for instance decided that small models is the way to go. We don't necessarily need to build a foundational and that will

then fundamentally affect the kind of compute power that we need domestically. &gt;&gt; Yeah. No, I I think I I fully resonate with that. So I think if we take the analogy right do you have to own a

building to be able to use it or can you just you know reliably rent it um tapping on a very robust uh uh legal system for example I think I think that is a interest useful analogy for us to

maybe keep in mind um and I think we all agree that we don't have to build um everything ourselves but I think the main thing that I wanted to highlight here is that uh it's not just about

having sovereignty but having meaningful sovereignty And we already see this playing out in some countries right like in North Africa for example um you know countries hosting and

building their own data centers and then outsourcing the management of it to a third party provider. Uh but actually there are certain risks that they're exposing themselves to when they don't

build enough um institutional uh capacity to be able to have genuine operational autonomy. Um so I think this is what we're talking about here when we say um you know control, steer and

depend because we're not saying that absolutely you have to control everything. It's about understanding where your strengths and weaknesses are and what strategic goals you are trying

um to get to in order to navigate the postures. &gt;&gt; Got it. Uh Sunil and Sangeita coming to you what's your take on it given you've been a part of many of these discussions

with the government and if India were to tomorrow want to hold you know host a hub do you think our neighbors or others would what kind of procedural safeguards etc rule of law to access do we need to

enable something like that &gt;&gt; ladies first [laughter] &gt;&gt; no I I think it's an very interesting question but I I think the fundamental

premise has to be that you know a hub like this will require a shared trust between these nations, right? So if if the trust is already missing with some of our neighbors already, I think it's

very unlikely that you can do this for the entire global south and and make it successful. So I think one [snorts] you have to do it with countries which where we already have a shared and trusted

relationship. So that you know this is not a lever that we will use if things go wrong. So I think that's very very important and those principles of the old world will apply equally in a in an

environment like this. uh but I think it's an interesting concept and I think fully agree with the comments made around sovereignty right because sovereignty is is not about owning the

entire stack it's about knowing where to play where to partner where to build right so I think that is India's approach right now but I think even trying to do the shared hop in a limited

way is a good start to see how this can really play out &gt;&gt; yeah u no I I concur with everything what everybody's saying but uh uh see somewhere The technology

partnership landscape in the world will have to follow the geopolitical landscape in the world. Right? Technically, possibly you can do everything. You want to just have

technology at one place and be accessible from across the world, you can do that. There are undersc fiber optic cables. You can still transport anything to anywhere in 250 millisecond.

And there are technically possible to have shared compute hubs, orchestration layers, you know, all those things are technically possible. But as you said rightly even if let's say India as a

polity as a society is believing in uh to quote prime minister's words subkas subkavikas or v wasuv kotimum that we would rather like to take the benefits of anything to everybody and be happy

and you know as as a as a as a overall community but you'll still have some people you don't gel with and there will still be isolation they will have to figure their own way out but having said

that is digital sovereignty meaning that we just try to do ourselves. I think lots of debate and a lot of confusion is around that. I think that is not technically possible on any technology

stack. AI obviously is far too complex. India may say we have skill sets. We have startups. It's all about mathematics and science and Indians are too good at that. We have lots of data

because of our historical lineage and we are creating consuming data every moment in every industry healthcare education everywhere agriculture everywhere. But can I create chips? We just started

semiconductor mission. We obviously want to be independent as much as possible. But I think it's a long way to go before I can create two nanometer 3 nanometer chips and I start manufacturing GPUs.

Even if I try to do that, there's a whole lot of dependency ecosystem there. Will I have all the chemicals and gases? Will I have the rarers? You know, obviously we know there's a whole lot of

geopolitical war going on just on rare earth stuff. So ultimately the digital sovereignity will mean I am not dependent on a one country or one company to define my digital

destiny. Do I have productive friendship relationship with multiple companies and multiple countries so that in the time of a problem because India also is saying that I am also now the third pole

in the world. I'm not like just aligned with any word. There will be areas where India will be pushed into the corner. So can India still define its path and not be bullied around right. So if I have

productive relationship with multiple countries and companies for maybe some things I'm good at some things I'm partnering with like for example of course my chips are coming from Nvidia a

lot part in my orchestration layer I think he was talking about that in orchestration also this possible that uh you know you even if you have the chips but your data may be going somewhere or

some part of the orchestration layer is controlled from somewhere else maybe in US. I cannot control that but can I have a great relationship that I bring the

technology but I don't allow that telemetry data or the logs or the control to go anywhere else these things are possible technically possible the chain

&gt;&gt; exactly so how do we product have a productive relationship keep a control keep productive relationships with each other's company and then once you have built that

&gt;&gt; then you try to take it to you are creating FTAs economically I'm sure you can create FTAs in AI space as Got it. &gt;&gt; Uh Hector, any last thoughts around, you know, global norms on computer access or

anything that you want to sort of come in on? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Um at the Paris AI summit last year, I remember very well that the US government had created some rules. Um

well limiting the expert the expert of semiconductors. I just want to say very transparently that Microsoft did not support these rules

&gt;&gt; and we actually requested many times uh that these rules could be changed in order for every country to access um the latest of our AI systems and models. That's that's I think the first point I

wanted to make. when it comes to like collaborations on international norms for these kind of topics. I guess the geopolitical tensions can can remove a bit of the margin for maneuver that we

have. But I still see a lot of potential and I think that was stated in in your paper somewhere around the infrastructure translation of some existing frameworks. And so here I'm

referring to the Hiroshima process reporting framework for instance which really sets a baseline for risk management transparency expectations globally setting some principles around

a code of conduct and having companies reporting the risk that they see the R&amp;D trends that they see the you know security and safety dimensions um on which they invest. I think that's that's

a best practice and we could also we could actually like implement this this practice at at the compute layer as well around access principles around meaningful control and security over the

AI tools institutions rely on. &gt;&gt; Great. No, thank you so much. Thank you so much. Can we please give a very big round of hand to the panelists? [applause]

We only just started uh peeling the layers of a very complicated topic. I'm sure that this is the first of many many discussions that is to follow but uh really glad to hear from all of you and

hope uh I love look forward to seeing the shared hubs computes paper uh in this thing and I think it will be accessible to everyone here as well. Thank you so much.

&gt;&gt; Um just want to request the panelists if you all can keep sitting and we can have a group photo maybe someday shared computer hub will be really famous and we can look back.

[clears throat] Let let them do the pitch and then &gt;&gt; you can also catch the &gt;&gt; you can also catch the panelists outside. We'll ensure that

&gt;&gt; okay sure &gt;&gt; and a big thank you to all the audience members. Thank you for being here and patiently engaging with this discussion. and to the panelists who made their way

through traffic who came here missing their new year's. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Basically, how do you deal with the
