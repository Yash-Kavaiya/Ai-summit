## 📝 Transcript

Yes. &gt;&gt; All good. &gt;&gt; Good evening everyone. Uh welcome to our session. So today India is not just a consumer of technology but a primary

architect of the global AI hardware stack. Uh without you know wasting any more time I'd like to invite um additional secretary Shri Amitesh Singhaji who's also the CEO of the India

semiconductor mission to start um with his policy keynote on how the India semiconductor mission is fueling India's uh localized compute roadmap followed by a panel discussion of um eminent Indian

builders who are building in the space um of silicon hardware um and compute. Um over to you sir. &gt;&gt; Thank you. I will start with uh my dignitaries on the pilot and dear

members who are here today. Actually uh we all know the journey and we have seen that how semicenter India mission is focusing on three particular aspect. One is uh design, second is manufacturing

and third is packaging. And in that process the focus on design was basically on the startups in India semigrator mission 1.0. You want to say something or not? Okay.

So in design segment uh uh we were supporting startups and msmemes and there was a very good traction and we approved 24 such projects. They are progressing very well. out of uh 24 14

has already got VC funding and now they are entering into next leg of journey in manufacturing we have already approved uh 10 projects one fab one silicon silicon fab one silicon carbide fab and

eight packaging units and then uh in ISM 2.0 because ISM 1.0 is over now you may see couple of announcement uh very soon but it is over for new applications and in ISM 2.0 Z we are going to focus on

the complete ecosystem. So complete ecosystem means the earlier uh verticles will continue like design, manufacturing and packaging. On design side we will increase our investment to a very great

extent and uh when policy will come you will able to see that in manufacturing and packaging incentives will continue and now we will add new verticles of uh R&amp;D which is very very important for

cutting edge technologies in all verticles whether whether it is advanced technology nodes or it is uh silicon photonics or it is OLED uh technology for display or it is any kind of similar

technologies. Then we'll also focus uh on equipment which is very very important for semiconductor manufacturing. So equipment R&amp;D, equipment manufacturing, equipment

components uh sourcing all those things will focus and then all kind of chemical gases and materials these will be the focus area and then a big focus on scaling that is very very important. So

whatever efforts today we are doing it is all all earlier efforts apart from some new initiative that we had taken in the form of curriculum revision and all that but going forward you will see that

uh a national push for semiconductor skilling in all verticals design manufacturing packaging focusing on equipment needs chemical gases needs all those things will be covered in the new

skilling uh techniques that will follow. Uh friends this is a time where uh we need lot of uh investment from outside including in design segment also. Today we are here uh to discuss uh uh VC

funding also as well as how the complete AI stack we are building. So when we talk about AI stack uh the basic fundamental building blocks are semiconductor chips in that we are also

working you know about the CDC. So we are uh our own journey and lot of high power computing uh machines we are now generating very soon you will see see that uh the computing power of those

machines will increase tremendously. We have developed certain capabilities uh like u the board the entire u uh body the cooling system interconnect of high power computing that we have developed

uh CPU and GPUs now we are taking from outside but that journey is there and we will also uh reach out to a level when we own uh self-develop those chips also uh on that there are v various uh

different layers and we are very strong in software this is uh the AI uh is our moment since we are strong in software. We we can develop a lot of good fundamental

uh large language models also application specific model also in this AI summit. You have seen how companies are showcasing the new new startup companies they are showcasing their

talent in very less time understanding the challenge they have developed their systems but very soon it will be a very robust and very good system and on many parameters as honorable minister was

telling they are surpassing the available large language models today in the world. So I'll end here uh so that uh further we will discuss during the panel discussion. Thank you.

&gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Thank you. See this works. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Uh thank you Amitesh. Uh hi everyone. I'm Rajan Anand. Uh that's

actually my AI avatar because he has his name next to him. Um I've always wanted to be like Sashwhat. So uh firstly uh welcome everyone. Um you know I think uh even uh 2 months ago if somebody had

told me there'll be a semiconductor panel uh at the AI summit at uh what time is it now? Like 5:30 p.m. Uh and the room's going to be full. I would have said man that's that's going to be

a bit of a stretch. In fact when we uh when we suggested this panel uh Amitesh I told the team you know please make sure at least there are 15 people in the room. uh you know and I said ideally it

would be like 10 of them actually startup founders with good investing you know so firstly thank you for coming and uh thank you for your interest let me get a quick maybe show of hands how many

of you are building semi- startups uh anybody in the I I know by the way we have three semiconductor startups uh I know I know the three of you obviously are like I mean I wasn't asking about

you guys um anybody anybody in the room how many are from large semiconductor companies okay there's quite a few okay good everybody else is I guess uh keen to learn which is uh which is terrific.

Uh so look the the focus of our panel is we're going to focus on what does it take for India to become a global leader in semiconductors. Okay. Um I'll give you three interesting data points um of

why India can do pretty much whatever she decides to do. Um 2015 India was not in the top 100 countries when it came to digital payments. 2025 we were 60% of all global real-time payments in the

world. Right. Today there's no question in the world who leads the world in terms of uh digital payments. 2015 you probably know this Amitesh India had two space tech startups. Today we have over

300 space tech uh space tech startups right. uh if you if you actually had asked us even a year ago uh would a Indian model company be soda on voice in Indic languages we would have said

that's a bit hard because you have you know Google and uh you know 11 labs and all these companies but uh as of like about 3 weeks ago right Saram basically became sota state-of-the-art uh in both

uh speech to text and text to voice so and this week basically India enters the model model race right which we have 12 companies basically launching models obviously there are call it 1 billion to

about 100 billion ion parameter models. They're not trillion parameter models yet. So I think look basically we can pretty much set ourselves to and I want to start by thanking you uh Amitesha and

the government of India and the India semiconductor mission for I think uh embarking on the mission. I think if you had asked me even like I remember seeing Chandra like 18 whatever it was like 2

years ago when he had a like when they announced the fabs and I said are you really serious and he said look you're getting an invite show up you know when the when the fab opens. So the fact that

we can actually build semiconductor fabs in India that we have a design ecosystem and innovation ecosystem I think is fantastic. So what we're going to do is uh let me introduce very quickly our

panelists. We have Dimant who's the founder of a company called Agrani. Agrani basically is going to build GPUs. Yeah, you heard me right. They're going to build GPUs ground up. Uh he's going

to talk about that comes from a you know very I'm going to have each of them talk a little bit about their companies so that they can articulate in their own uh terms. Pritham uh Pritham is the

co-founder of a company called C2I. C2I is basically making chips for power. Um you know comes from Texas Instruments. Basically took the top 15 people out of TI in India who are building power

chips. That's their company. They added another 45 people building power chips in every other company you know for all the other players and that's pretty much 60% team that they have. They're going

to have a tape out in uh tape out in April. Uh then we have Naven. Naven is from Marvel leads Marvel's business in India. as you guys know uh Marvel $70 billion by the way we only need about

five 70 billion market cap semiconductor companies and I think Amitesh can finally go to honorable prime minister and say I think we've done it now um and then finally we have Shashwat Shashwat

is u uh the co-founder of a company called Mind it was actually the first semiconductor investment that we made as a firm we have Peak 15 uh and they're actually building SOC's low power SOC's

starting for the Indian market part you know chips that go into things like smartphones uh uh energy meters, things like that. So, we have a we have a we have a we have three startup founders.

We have the head of uh a global company that is uh that has been very very seriously committed to India. And we're going to focus the next uh call it 40 actually I'll ask questions for about 20

minutes and then I'm going to open it up for you all. Uh we're going to focus on this central question of what does it take for us to build global leadership right because what we know is when we

set our minds to it takes between 10 and 15 years. Now, of course, lots of things need to come into place. Somebody just pointed out the world's most valuable company today is semiconductor company.

Insane, right? Like that's like really insane. So Amitesh I'll start with you. Um look uh ISM 1.0 very successful. ISM 2.0 lots of excitement. If you just take this simple objective and say look in 10

years we want to be a global leader period. Is ISM 2.0 enough or if you had you know a free hand uh i.e. allocate as much resources as you want get you know you wave your magic wand what would it

take &gt;&gt; so I will I'll only quote honorable prime minister he has very clearly said that this journey is for next 20 25 years for the

time being it may continue forever also so we'll see ISM 1.0 0 is is about to over ISM2 very seamlessly it will come in next couple of months and after that we may see ISM 3.0 4.0 Z all like that

because this is not a uh a kind of uh race 100 m race it's kind of marathon and where wherever semiconductor industry is completely set up those countries have taken 20 30 40 50 60

years time to come to reach to this level and nothing happens here in a day so the first &gt;&gt; does something happen in a decade though &gt;&gt; yes obviously

&gt;&gt; wait like like if you said look I I know 30 years is better 30 years gives us more time but if he genuinely said Look in a decade from now 2036 India AI summit is happening we'll have 3.5

million people showing up at barat mandapam because hopefully it'll be like 10 times larger I actually think that'll happen by the way I think every year this number is going to keep going up

you know eventually we'll have to like I don't know I have like I don't know many floors so what would it take like what like and you know you can be honest there's no media in the room right is

there &gt;&gt; some few media by the way just just just don't write any of this okay just just don't write any of it I mean whatever you don't want them to write so you know

like what would it take &gt;&gt; so Actually from my side there's no restriction. You can write anything. &gt;&gt; Oh, there you go. Perfect. You're like V coastline. You know Vinod was in the

other room just now. He said the same thing. You can write whatever you want. &gt;&gt; So uh in in by 2030 we have 10 projects right now. All of them will be fully functional and commission.

&gt;&gt; So we'll have 10 fabs. &gt;&gt; 10 not 10 fabs. We have approved one fab silicon five one silicon carbide 5 and eight packaging units. All of uh these 10 will start commercial production from

this year and they will attain full capacity by the end of 2028, 2029 and 2030. In the meantime, we will approve in ISM 2.0 many such projects and some of them will again come because uh the

the period of uh setting up facility it varies from 2 year to five year. So some of them will also come. So this 10 can become 15 or 17 or 18. But this time our focus is to create a fabulous company.

So now the company sitting here the three candidates three candidates they are very very promising and we want to see them as a billion dollars fabulous company

&gt;&gt; think bigger no &gt;&gt; no no I'm take I'm &gt;&gt; like Nvidia is like 5 trillion &gt;&gt; I have a timeline I have a timeline &gt;&gt; don't stop at a billion okay

&gt;&gt; so I'm what I'm saying that &gt;&gt; yeah I mean like what is this there 5 trillion we're going to be 1 billion you guys don't stop at 1 billion &gt;&gt; so he has given me a timeline so I'm

coming with that thing in first phase when ISM 2 2.0 will over 3.0 0 will start by that by that time these companies 24 companies and the promising one which are also coming now you will

see some of the fabulous 1 billion company and after that we want to see them as a Broadcom Qualcomm Nvidia and all all those kind of companies so I'm setting this time and I'm very hopeful

we are working very meticulously to see that all piece of puzzle is in place so that anybody can build up their uh solutions whether it design company or manufacturing company or packaging

company or equipment company or any kind of uh new technologies that can uh prosper in this country. &gt;&gt; Terrific. Thank you. And and again by the way thank you so much on behalf of I

think the entire ecosystem for the amazing work that India semiconductor mission is doing. But I do think by the way these three will soon be just get there quickly. Okay. Like become like uh

a billion dollar companies. Okay D let's start with you. So you know maybe you can start with a little bit like where's this even ambition coming from like &gt;&gt; by the way this is this is the level of

ambition in the Indian startup ecosystem today. Okay. Um this team has basically said we're going to build GPUs period that's it. &gt;&gt; Uh we're going to build you know we're

going to compete with the absolute best in the world. So talk a little bit about whatever you can share. I know there's a lot you can't share. Maybe your background your team's background just

30 seconds and then what are you guys trying to do and why should we believe because you're soon going to come to him no and ask for some big &gt;&gt; thing no from ISM. He's coming to you.

He might have come to you already you know. So why should he believe that this team from India is going to build a GPU? &gt;&gt; Well actually building a GPU is second nature for us Rajan. We've been doing it

for 30 years, right? So, we have been doing it in hardware, in software, at Intel, at AMD and IBM. So, we just have to go replicate it. Uh, &gt;&gt; actually, that's a good point. You've

just been building it. Now, you're going to build it for yourself and you're going to build it for India. &gt;&gt; Yes, absolutely. So, it's it's second nature for us. I I I don't worry about

our ability to build a world-class GPU hardware wise or software wise. There are other things we can talk about that I worry about but um yeah so our background is u you can see you know

gray hair no hair uh &gt;&gt; but you still have black hair &gt;&gt; black hair whatever uh you know 25 years in the industry uh founding team with uh 150 years of experience in these um you

know MNC's uh built multiple generations of data center CPUs GPUs our software leader is a 30-year IBM veteran one of the most prolific opensource contributors in the

country So one of the best teams in the world. I think what gets us going is um yeah you know India there's a concentration of talent and we have a mission. We're taking this mission to

heart. In 10 years, we want to be, you know, in the top five fabulous companies in the world, right? We're taking it up. And this is a mission that motivates everybody who's joining us and even some

of the brightest minds in the country who are young, they're giving up their, you know, jobs in data bricks and rubrics and joining us, right? So, we are on a mission. So, uh, what else do

you want? &gt;&gt; No, I think that's good. We'll come back to I think some of the challenges I want to because I know big round of &gt;&gt; Let's let's give them a big round of

applause. [applause] I think it's really going after a big moonshot. Uh Pam, let's go to you next. Maybe uh talk a little bit about what does CTI CTI trying to do maybe again

like give some sense of uh the team's background and also you know you're only months away from a tape out. So maybe you can talk a little bit about whatever you can share you know share with the

group. &gt;&gt; Sure. Um our background is like uh we pretty much came from Texas Instruments in in Bangalore. Um the beauty is like we were the ones who actually started

power or power management in TI 20 years ago. So we built it got it to a point where there huge revenues huge technology that got built into the place did process development built fabs did

OSATs did all that learning and there came a point where we said you know what is it exactly we're trying to do when sitting in a corporate company versus um big motivation thank you to government

of India and the ISM that um the question really came like what is it that India is trying to do and why is it that uh um somebody like me who's done 25 years of power um cannot contribute

to that. That's how it started and then I think five six of us who came out from TI were pretty much the heart of the group. TI actually very welcomingly let us go set up the company. Um we started

CTI in in 2024. Um and we were also lucky to get DLI. Um and and the story basically is like you know why power right you know I I I'll try and put it down as simply as I can u if you look at

AI like you know AI has completely changed the way we build even data centers most of you probably know about it and then it used what used to be like you know a systems problem like you know

a training model AI for human interface changed to a completely different way of like you know always on AI trying to convert uh data silicon power into intelligence at a scale that is

unprecedented right you know what does it really translate to we used to talk about having GPUs on cards like you know that's what really now it is like GPU clusters and GPU racks like that's the

scale of AI right how does it translate to power you know [clears throat] what used to be few hundred watts of GPU and a rack of maybe few kilowatts today is hundreds of kilowatts and then which

means if I'm putting like 10 racks filling up this kind of a space. We're already talking about a megawatt of power getting into this simple room here, right? And then that that that's

the scale, right? And and when you bring in a megawatt of power, by the time it comes from the grid to the actual GPU that he's trying to put together, you already lost 30 40% of the power in in

distribution, in conversions, and in cooling. So power lost is like power not doing something useful, right? Generating tokens for example, right? So that is really the crux of the problem,

right? So when you look at how you really want to solve that problem, that's where C2I is trying to address it at maybe two or three different levels and break it down to keep it simple. At

a systems level, we're trying to see, well, we're getting in 800 volts. You're trying to convert it down to maybe 800 millolts. So that's like a,000 times conversion. So how how do you really do

that? How efficiently can you do that? That's the first problem. Second, like you know, you're trying to pump in 2,000 amps into a GPU. When you're pumping 2,000 ants into GPU, it needs space to

do that, right? Like what is all that real estate, right? That active real estate is lost for something that you could do better for processing and management. That's the second problem.

The third is just think of like when you do welding that actually consumes 40 ampers, folks, just to get a feel for numbers. We talking about 2,000 amps getting into something like he's trying

to build, right? That is a challenge from reliability and robustness. Like how do you keep it up and make sure that doesn't come down? So these are the three different problems CTI is trying

to address and then we have technology that is able to bring down efficiency by a big percent. Um get the real estate down by more than three times or four times and then increase the life by 2x.

That's really what we're trying to do. The first tape out is happening in April. uh we're actually it's a two chip solution and the total solution will be a like for a 2,000 amps we'll probably

have 26 uh 32 of these little chips and a big controller sitting trying to manage all the power for like an Marvel GPU for example or a Marvel uh uh solution ASIC for example right so

that's really what we're trying to build and I think um if CTI really hits the trifecta on all these three vectors that we're talking about I think that we really would have shown you can build

such high complex power solution ions to meet the AI demands that we'll see in the future. That's the &gt;&gt; and there's a huge synergy between what he's building and what

&gt;&gt; perfect. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. First make stuff then you can sell stuff to each other. [laughter] &gt;&gt; First step you got to make stuff. Okay. Let's uh Navin I'm going to get to you

in a second. Uh Shashwat. So, so I think both Agrani and C2I are building global businesses. For them to win they have to be globally the best. Uh I think mine you're taking a different starting

position which is you're building building for India first and I know eventually over time you'll become global. Uh and actually mine was the first uh semiconductor uh investment

that we made. We actually have four investments now. Mangrove was the first second is a company called incor that's a co IP company in risk 5 uh and then aani and so so sashwhat maybe talk a

little bit about uh mine what you guys do. By the way, they've also done a tape out and this year he's committed to me. He's going to generate some serious revenue and next year is going to be

like a waterfall, right? Um tell you know tell the group a little bit about what does mine do where are you guys in your journey also you have a different background right you guys came out of

academia maybe so so that's you have like a very seasoned team you have a team that's come out of academia that provides the color &gt;&gt; so uh almost everything that we're doing

is uh coming from a different end from both of them uh &gt;&gt; that's why we put you on the other end of the room too [laughter] the panel you know

&gt;&gt; so u mangrove is a um company we work mostly on the edge and not in the data center. We work on things that uh you know things that you guys are holding in your hands, cameras, phones later maybe,

I don't know yet. But a lot of things that go into phones like the chips that control the cameras, um the smart locks that let you into your house, the um controllers that power the drones and uh

autonomous vehicles that uh run around our warehouses. um all of those kind of things. So what we build are microcontrollers and moving into microprocessors that's a

technical difference I don't think we need to get into but what you see here this chip over here which I'm pointing to is the chip that we taped out &gt;&gt; the one in the middle

&gt;&gt; the one in the middle over here that's a high performance microcontroller which is meant for secure applications um all the things that you need to touch physically and you still need to keep

your data secure And we are a very young team. Um I bring the average age of the team up to about 26 27. So

&gt;&gt; like how how like the rest of the team how young are they? &gt;&gt; Uh they're fresh out. &gt;&gt; We built this chip with a total team of seven people

&gt;&gt; of whom I had the maximum experience at that point. So um there is that and what we are doing. Yeah, like I said, everything is on the other side, right? Young team, small team, growing big and

&gt;&gt; don't grow too big though. Keep it small. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it's nice to be agile. Um, but like sir was saying, it's a marathon. It's not uh sprint. And in a

marathon, you're paying more attention to what you're doing and improving yourself rather than uh keeping your eye out on the competition too much. Oh, of course you need to keep your eye on

who's catching up with you, but it's more about pacing and getting yourself to that point where you're at the peak of the performance that you can achieve and that's basically what we're doing.

&gt;&gt; Terrific. So, I think you hopefully you got a sense now of the spectrum of companies that we have and I think there 24 companies that you've supported through DI. So, Adit I hope we've met

the remaining 20. Adit is on our team actually. Yeah. I just want to make sure like there four but like then like 20 more now. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Right. Um so, so Naven let's

move to you now. um you lead Marvel in India. um you know I think it'll be helpful for you to talk a little bit about what are you guys doing in India and maybe for most of the group maybe we

are not semiconductor what is Marvel what do you do what what all are you doing in India and why are you guys excited about India I mean I'm told that you're continuing to double down in

India so it' be helpful to start there &gt;&gt; yeah so so Marvel is a fabulous company just like many others and and our primary focus is on building the data infrastructure and when we say data

think about it saying you have to process the data you have to move the data you have to store the data and you have to keep the data secure Right. And that's what we do by building

infrastructure that goes either into the data centers or into the enterprise and carrier market segment. What it means is that we make lot of processors uh networking, storage, security and and

many of those chips. And the way look to look at it is that our revenue is means he was calling the market caps around 8 billion revenue. A large part comes from the AI data center. And if you get into

the data center, there's one which called GPU. It's a massive element but what's happening is because of the different use cases and the workload we are seeing a custom processing units

call it XPU that's coming in for you to optimize your workload and get the best power performance and and enhance build economics and scale for the product but then it's not just the GPU when you open

the cluster or XPU you have lot of co-processors and and other elements that goes along with it and then you have the whole networking that needs to be there to connect a millions of them

right starting with the switches that needs to be there the network the interconnect which is both copper as well as electrical and then you have to do it what we call a scale up scale out

and scale across what means it's it's on the rack the racks and the and and I would say the data center and then across the continents so we build all of those uh across the world in India

specifically I think we are a replica of what the global company is uh we build the foundational IPs blocks flows methology the softwares and the packaging and then we have the business

and product teams which actually integrates all of them and ensure that we can put an XPU the XPU attach the networking fabric interconnects and all of that

&gt;&gt; got it very helpful &gt;&gt; point a little bit of a statistical anomaly here and I have batchmates from undergrad so 6 p.m. in a global AI conference on a semicon final. Two guys

from the same batch. &gt;&gt; Oh my god, that is insane. That's great. All you have to do is catch up to 70 billion of market cap next, [laughter] you know. Um, you are on track.

&gt;&gt; Yeah. No, and I be very clear since he's he's shooting for a billion, you know, like uh &gt;&gt; 10 years. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. 10 years. 10 years. No, no,

no. What are you talking about? Are [laughter] you kidding me? Okay. Um, let's now move to I think I want to maybe uh ask two more questions and then we're going to open it up. Please have

your questions ready. Um let's talk about India's right to win. I mean as you can see right like this is an ecosystem that had zero semiconductor startups 5 years ago right like what

2020 there was zero right today we have 24 uh we have companies building sort of you know chips on the edge all the way through GPU uh GPUs. Um what is India's right to win? I know the headline always

says uh 20% of the world's semiconductor designers are based in India. Uh lots of these global companies are doing cutting edge work. Uh, and then obviously when you have great talent in these

companies, they spin out and start companies. Exhibit A, Aani, exhibit B, you know, C to I, uh, exhibit C, soon to be Naven. No, I'm just kidding. Um, you know, um, no, just just joking. I know

you have a bunch of your Marvel colleagues here. They'll all like go, uh, whoa, what's going on here? Anyways, but so we got that part. Okay. But what else like uh and maybe even on that part

maybe Naven you can start with you know what to what extent are you doing the really cutting edge work here right uh talk about that and then since you guys are obviously have capabilities here you

know you build big centers here like as you look at India's right to win not as Marvel because for Marvel your capability for the company but as these other three companies right like other

than having awesome talent what else is our right to Yeah. So, so if I pick two examples of what the cutting edge that we are doing and then maybe uh build on it, right?

So, many of these building blocks very high-end processors or the networking the main foundational building block is at IP called service, right? you need to have this serializer d serializer for

you to be able to push the data around and and it has gone to the insane speed of what we call as 448 GHz uh speed and then that IP is built by I can I I won't even go to the second

hand right &gt;&gt; wait how many people &gt;&gt; few people in the few few companies in the world &gt;&gt; okay in the world and how many people

within those companies &gt;&gt; uh few hundreds &gt;&gt; wow not bad how many of them are in India &gt;&gt; oh quite a lot You really like how many?

&gt;&gt; No, like let's get specific. No, this is important. I mean, it's important for us, you know. I &gt;&gt; mean, you have that you have that metrics like 20% of [laughter] them.

&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know. But 20% a big number. You tell me there's 20 of them that matter. Okay, we'll go find them. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, that's interesting. So, you're saying meaningful percentage of this

really high caliber talent is in India. &gt;&gt; It is in India and and across I have one of my colleague as well who is doing it from here as well. Right. So there are quite a few people doing this and that's

the building foundational block for any of these chips that we're talking especially in the data center and AI and it's equally there in the other side. Uh but we have a lot of those being done

from here not just the design but the whole layout validation characterization and all of that. That's one part of it. The second one I'll twist it is that right we are building the solutions for

the AI of the world but when AI is ready how do I use it so that I can turn around and do the chip in 12 months I think you'll like it just like you'll ask these guys can you use AI to shrink

the cycle time can &gt;&gt; so what just talk about that what is the impact that AI will have on on development cycles in the semiconductor &gt;&gt; it will I think all of us are

quantifying at this time any number I say is more a gut feel than anything else uh it's a case of saying do I reduce the iterations Do I add value into the chip by using AI or or or by

like you know just shrinking the whole cycle by the brute force because we can run things on GPU or do iterations fast and all of that right but that's again is another very I would say strategic

angle that how do we leverage AI for my chip design and the software design and the system design so that I can this bring this whole thing faster into the market and and because every year you

want to see a new infrastructure coming up by the hyperscape ers and everyone else. So those are two building blocks. I would say there are a lot of things you will hear. One topic I will touch if

India has to win uh and then Sinasa talked about it is we are buying a lot of technologies when we are building these 10 plants. All the technologies is coming from outside. So we have to

invest in what we call as the foundational R&amp;D and that's a project that we are working with Amit sir office and many others is to put up that R&amp;D ecosystem where we have industrydriven

research on the next generation device materials circuits architectures packaging thermal power all of those things and be ready when these 10 projects and many of these people they

need the next generation IP next generation any of this this is available from more research ecosystem which will be primarily industrydriven but may be executed a lot by academia and research

labs and to get us going faster on these journey rather than always relying on buying from outside. &gt;&gt; That's a great uh and maybe I'll I'm going to come back to you and have you

uh talk about what you're what we're doing in R&amp;D. Maybe now let's go through with each of the three um uh founders. Dimat will start with you. Uh you were about to talk about challenges,

&gt;&gt; right? what could make it easier uh for you guys to achieve your mission and what can what can what what can India do really and and we have Amit here &gt;&gt; yeah yeah yeah I I think uh if I think

about it uh Rajan right there is talent I don't think that's a problem uh we have &gt;&gt; can you get the talent that you need in India to build out

&gt;&gt; tape out a GPU &gt;&gt; yeah yeah so you know what we are building is deep tech in hardware deep tech in software and in some ways manufacturing as well and I can tell you

like order of 100 billion transistors pytorch to you know compilers All of that we are hiring largely in India. Uh I I'm not sure if we can build 20 such startups but five with this

concentration of talent definitely end to end teams I think we can. So u I was just going to say there's talent there's capital there's the whole you know ecosystem supply chain and all of that

and then there is go to market right and just uh market access. I would say um talent is not a problem. uh I I think because for the reasons we're talking about right there are so few of these we

have 20% you people doing silicon design for 30 years uh people doing software low-level system programming so that talent is not a problem capital I think uh between you know what folks like peak

are doing and what the government is doing understanding patient capital better understanding how the semiconductor cycles work uh you I I think we'll figure it out right So and I

also feel like uh as entrepreneurs we'll figure it out right we we will right we'll figure it out. I think the third aspect around ecosystem supply chain definitely we need help right uh you

know at the end of the day uh this &gt;&gt; and break it down like maybe yeah break it down what are the specifics so that I'm sure he knows but for the broader audience

&gt;&gt; yeah simple things right like today the uh the supply chain is monopolized by a small number of big players right whether it is access to wafer starts at a place like TSMC memory right uh any uh

any chip of uh the the nature we are building requires high performance high bandwidth memory the three memory vendors it's all sold out like if you want to go buy memory for this year it's

sold out right so &gt;&gt; what a great business to be in huh &gt;&gt; absolutely and you can see the markups that these guys are getting right so uh it's unbelievable so I I think the the

point is that um access to supply chain is something that gives me sleepless nights definitely u I think uh with the good offices of the government uh you know and and I would say how do we do it

today we are going to partner with the likes of Marvel or a Broadcom who will be our condute to these supply chains uh but they have to believe in us because we have to make business sense and they

there's an opportunity cost for them to do it so we have to solve for that uh and I I think between uh the government essentially using their good offices for example Micron is a is a big player in

this ecosystem so there should be an allocation from Micron for as an example right if I am going to build a worldleading product micron should allocate HPMs to India and that can be

something that that can be arranged right so that's one example then when it comes to uh market access same thing right um like I said I have no uh concerns about us building and I'm not

just you know it's not bravado right I'm just saying that in in the true sense give us three generations we will be a world-class product but it's not just about world building world-class

products it's about monopolies and market access and how do you penetrate and so on. Uh that's where we'll have to figure out right how you know that's where I think again the government can

come in and you know we just for context right we are at 1.2 2 gawatt of installed data center base today going to 8 or 9 gawatt in you know 5 to 6 years a gawatt is 400,000 to 500,000

GPUs and if you say a GPU is you know $40,000 right just one gawatt of GPU deployment is $20 billion in India if we say that you know we're going to have 4 gawatt of deployment in the next four

five years that's $80 billion now if there is a worthwhile technology team that is building for this market and we're not asking for favors, right? this is we are going to be you know right up

there how can there be a policy that helps us penetrate this market right that's what gives us sleepless I mean we will compete at the global level we are building from India for the global

market we will work with global players we will do all of that but it's our technology it's our markets there's data sovereignity I mean we talked about yesterday Rahul uh from anthropic was

talking about second biggest knowledge usage of anthropic right and so when technology is being used so rampantly here it's only natural that technology that's built here.

&gt;&gt; So that's good right? So supply chain and market access market access specifically I mean in a massively growing Indian market can be created &gt;&gt; and we can be the leaders of global

Amitesh G often talks about it right it's what we build here um there may be uh you know geopolitics on whether we can sell it in the US or not we we'll figure that out but we can be the leader

of the global south and you know that's that's a big market so we should just work on it &gt;&gt; got it priam anything to add in terms of constraints outside of uh those two

topics that uh the highlighted Maybe I'll um take a guess my minor um detour from the talent portion of it. Right. I think what India has been building as a skill is to know how to do

things. I think there are great great talent available in semiconductor space. I think for the last few years at least the top players like Marvel, TI, uh Renaissance now they're all investing in

building technology leaders. like you need someone who can use that 20% talent pool, put them together, guide them in building to build something that we wanted to put together. I think that

technology leadership is where really India needs to focus on. I think encouraging them within the organizations or outside the organizations through startups like TI

or C2I will be the way to go forward. That I think is one dimension. I think second dimension just to extend on the ecosystem portion of it. I think today I think India is at a beautiful cusp of

like you know transitioning from build in India to actually make in India right I think you're you can do everything that we are talking about completely tops down end to end like you know where

true systems down to the last component can be done out of India and should be done out of India right I think that technology equity is what India needs to invest in now and that only comes when

you have the right ecosystem some partners to go with right today if you see his $80 billion that he talked about that there is $2 billion of power right there right so I think there are pieces

that you can put together in a much more potent way analyze the problem saying you know if I'm building a 1 gawatt equivalent system a data center for India for Indian applications okay this

is how it should break it down to this is what I really need from an end toend system and then this is the components I'm looking for hey I have all of these in India now let me go out and get it

Yeah and specific goals right to what he's saying let's say we talk about population scale AI right this whole you know summit is about population scale AI and in India there are always inflection

points around cost when after that things take off exponentially right and the question is we take goals and say in India AI is going to be delivered services are going to be delivered

through voice most likely right u and it has to be delivered at let's say five I say per minute per user what does that mean everything from the model to the infrastructure layer to compute layer.

How do we actually have a blueprint to be able to deliver that? That is something that we can work together. &gt;&gt; All right. You want let's uh yeah, let's just in the interest of time, anything

to add to what they brought up? &gt;&gt; I will chime in on the supply chain part of it. Definitely everything that he said is true and I'm feeling it a lot more as we go to deployment.

But um one tag that I would like to take is uh one um really great um challenge that we have is also created by the opportunity that we have. We have a huge population but it's a very disapp

[laughter] but we uh we have um very disagregated kind of a population. So um gathering volume um it's hard and again to your point

good great product design is necessary um that's a skill I don't know how to teach that skill but great product design is necessary to aggregate that volume to actually be able to serve the

entire country because the needs are so diverse. &gt;&gt; Got it. All right. Cool. So let's uh uh maybe I'll have you respond to some of these asks and then we're going to open

it up for a couple of questions. We don't have too much time left. So Amitesh I think maybe start with R&amp;D [clears throat] because uh I I think that is a super important point. Maybe

talk a little bit about how are you guys thinking about R&amp;D uh and then supply chain uh uh as well as market access maybe just those three areas and what what are you all doing?

&gt;&gt; Yeah. So uh friends we all know that uh technology sometimes it is available sometime it is not available. So whenever we talked about high power computing earlier it was not available

to us and now we are developing and now it is available to us also. Similarly in future we are doing 28 nanometer to 180 nanometer when we come down probably technology will not be available though

the commercially it is available all companies are setting up elsewhere but perhaps they will not set up here. So I so should we wait for them or should we develop something? So now R&amp;D which

government of India is focusing is all those kind of technologies. Suppose you are advanced node is there you want to attempt 7 nanometer 5 nanometer 4 nanometer 3 nanometer then you want to

have a display ecosystem. So you want to attempt OLED kind of uh R&amp;D in India to have because these technologies are quite guarded. So unless LG and Samsung is not coming to India it will not come

to India. Similarly you want to uh transfer data at a very higher speed. So whether you want to do in silicon photonics or similar kind of technology there are various kind of technologies.

So in in each of these technology which is very critical whether is a quantum or any kind of other kind of materials we will now venture into that area. So this is one thing. Second is that ecosystem

is very very important that all of them has said. So tape out at TSMC will take a very long time but getting a memory will get a very long time because the situation is like that. There are many

such uh ecosystem problems. If they want to do a very critical 2 nanometer or below that also designing they need a material uh of a specific nature. So again material R&amp;D is also important. So

ecosystem takes care of everything. So now they talking about power. So power dissipation is a very very important thing. So can you do something on diamond as a substrate or can you do

something to dissipate heat because all these solutions will need such kind of material and substrate. So this this is the area of ecosystem more and more will be approved. So we are we are seeing a

very good proposals in different technology whether it is GAN or on and sapphire or or silicon carbide in different flavors uh and then uh uh advanced packaging is again a very very

important thing from today point of view. So we will uh approve many such uh projects including R&amp;D in material equipment and other things. Precision engineering is also very important. So

this will fill the ecosystem gap narrow the timeline and then the market access is a very very important thing. So there are two ways to gain market access. Either government is procuring or

government is not procuring. Whether government is pro procuring we can do any many things because make in India there are lot of provisions are there and we are going to leverage that so for

all strategic applications whether it's a defense for space and we can define strategic application depending upon our need our security concerns our different things so on those area we can mandate

something and our startups our uh innovators our product developers can have access on commercial side which is not directly covered in the make in There there are many ways because we are

getting lot of substandard items and ultimately consumers are losing on that. So suppose you are having a two-heer and your charger is not working. It is just because the standards are not good. So

we can impose many such conditions also to see that the credible stuff is coming to the country and there is a living level playing field for our startups and for that for providing that level

playing field we are we are now uh funding them. We want to be uh their partner. We want to give them all kind of supports in the in terms of EDA tools which is a very uh uh first enabler for

a startup is EDA tools which is very costly and then we we will also provide them some incentive. So once they are ready to run at that point of time because of sheer scale because you are

not uh matching to the fabulous companies of the world probably uh the tape cost will be high the marketing cost will be high all those things are there to cover up those things also we

will provide certain PLI in terms of uh level playing field for the startup so all these things I I hope it will take care of much of their need and probably we will see lot of fabulous company and

unicorns coming from semiconductor uh domain. &gt;&gt; Terrific. Well, thank you for that. Okay, let's open it up for a couple of questions. Uh there's a gentleman there

uh in a tie. &gt;&gt; Are you with Qualcomm? &gt;&gt; No, I'm No, not you. Yeah, the the the gentleman with the glasses with the tie. &gt;&gt; You don't have a tie on. You haven't

realized yet. Thank you very much. You too. &gt;&gt; Uh I am Aziz. I am Aziz Aram from Ministry of Economy and Finance of Usbekistan. I'm not from Qualcomm. So,

&gt;&gt; oh man, bummer. I've been trying to meet somebody from Qualcomm. You know they just did a 2 nanometer chip tape out. &gt;&gt; I'm trying to find that team. I thought you might be I was just I was just

trying my luck. Go ahead. How are things in USPakistan? Yeah. Go ahead. &gt;&gt; I'm director for uh semiconductor strategies development within minister of economy and finance. So uh I have

just a couple of questions. Uh I need your uh opinion thoughts. So can you say a few words from your experience from the starting point in semiconductor industry first if uh

and the second question is for countries uh who are not uh the part of this current leading semiconductor system what is the most realistic entry point and uh what would you advise what would

you do first if you were advising the government today &gt;&gt; it's a great one for you Amitesh Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, uh experience wise I will say that uh initially it will be difficult

because companies will not believe you. We uh so this journey started from 2022 when the scheme was rolled out and uh whenever we were discussing with any global company or uh uh even global

experts, Indian experts u staying outside India, they were not believing this story and they were all of them were giving lot of uh knowledge and uh exper sharing their experience. So we

called in Hindi called gan. So so so lot of things but we took it very seriously. We said them what are the one or two or three or four or five advices that you want to give us and they all gave us uh

good advices. We followed them and then we start we we started seeing that things are happening now. So when the DIA started there was no uh startup company we saw some companies coming

around and then the manufacturing happened. So no tier one, tier two companies still is is there except Micron. So the companies are not believing that actually it can happen in

India but the moment you will start growing so in 3 four years journey now we are seeing that many good companies are uh uh trying to come to India and they are very interested but still the

tier one is missing. So that may come uh towards the end of semicon 2.0 or in semicon 3.0 every company has to come here. This is my gut feeling because the market dynamics is like that. So we we

cannot be avoided. So my my suggestions to all global companies who are listening this this is opportunity and government of India is also tapering down their incentive. So first movers

who have took courage to set up this ecosystem government has enabled by giving more capex subsidy to them along with the state government. When ISM 2.0 will come you'll see that it is tapering

down and when ISM 3.0 Z will come you'll see the further tripling down of incentive because now we are creating a ecosystem and that ecosystem pulls investment many companies today memory

company they want to produce memory in one year time not two years time that's why they are acquiring readymate fabs outside so PSMC P5 is one example that company wants to manufacture memory

because the cost of memory today is very very high so that is the ecosystem that is enabling getting them to manufacturing HBM or other kind of memory in a faster way. So that kind of

ecosystem we have to create so that companies automatically come irrespective of the incentive or financial support coming from our side. So believe in any kind of policy

try to uh try to implement those policy in a transparent ma manner and interact with the industry. So today matey is not working like a government ministry. We are working fully with the industry

players whether is startups whether whether company like big 15 or uh any manufacturing company or global company like Marvel. So we are interacting with them still we are learning with them and

we'll continue learning till we set up this complete ecosystem to the satisfaction of uh global companies tier one companies which will compel them to come here.

&gt;&gt; Terrific. There was a question if you just in the interest of time. No go ahead. Yeah. Now you can go ahead. &gt;&gt; Yes. Hi. Uh my name is DJ. I work for a company called Gro um which has got

acquired by &gt;&gt; Yeah. We've all heard of it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, &gt;&gt; by the way, uh uh uh Dim Grock would be nice. 20 billion, not 10, not one.

&gt;&gt; I I first want to hire him. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. By the way, yeah. Yeah. Go ahead. Now, anyway, now you're going to be now you with Invidia. Have they offered out the letters yet or not?

Anyway, just kidding. Keep going. Go ahead. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, my question is around So, you said right there are three companies which essentially does HBMs, right? um

Micron for example has stopped any um any of their consumer RAM. So my question is what is the bottleneck when we think about HPMs like uh why aren't there more

companies doing HBMs other than Hinx, Micron and Samsung? Uh there should be more right it's just concentrated within those three. So how do we solve for that? What are the bottlenecks? What are

the next steps outside of those three? &gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm not a memory expert. Maybe Naveen can chime in as well, right? But I I think this is pretty high-tech technology, right? Just think about it.

I mean, HPMs, uh, you have stack of 16 uh, you know, it's something that has to fit in a package. You know, when we talk about HPM 4 in the time frame that we would have products, these are 16 giga

transfers, the cooling, the thermals and DRAM has its own scaling challenges, right? The DAM cells. So, it's pretty high-tech, right? just like you know it's hard to have a 2 nanometer fab or a

you know 3 nanometer fab it takes time and but I I think uh there are green shoots in places like China they are uh you know creating a parallel memory ecosystem it's something that we have to

study to see you know what's our priorities you know memory obviously is a bottleneck the other way to think about it is should we leaprog and come up with more innovative ways to not rely

on something like a HPM right that that may be the other &gt;&gt; great thank you namin do you want to add anything to No, he has covered. We can take more questions.

&gt;&gt; Okay, good. Yeah, there's a question here. Let's take these two and then I think we're going to have to wrap. Yeah, go ahead. Yeah, give him a mic. &gt;&gt; Hi, I am Shash. I'm the founder of

grad.AI. Um, my question is to Dim. Um, so you said that that in three generations you'll have the hardware capability that uh is like state-of-the-art uh top of the line. Um

but uh like AMD as well has the hardware cap capabilities that are much better than Nvidia in the air space. Um but still they don't succeed uh as much because of CUDA uh and their ecosystem.

So do you have any plans that uh to uh challenge in the software line and &gt;&gt; No, that's a great question and uh you're hitting on the core of all our learnings. We build GPUs at Intel. You

know, I was at AMD. Software is a challenge. It has to be thought through and you know, one of our strong focus areas is around software. We are a software first company and we're kind of

inverting and thinking through the ecosystem and how the software ecosystem is fledging and how to leverage it. U so that's that's probably as far I can say today. Right.

&gt;&gt; Watch the space. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Is there &gt;&gt; great question. Is there an uh open-source thing that

&gt;&gt; No, I don't think he's comfortable sharing, but that is the heart of &gt;&gt; Rajan. Uh while you hit it, you hit it. &gt;&gt; While we wait for the next question, um &gt;&gt; I um from our side, what we say is

softwaredriven code design. So hardware and software work together, but software is driving the hardware design. &gt;&gt; True. Yeah, let's go ahead. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Hi. Uh Hi, I'm Bharav. I'm both

from electronics and semiconductors on the product side. Just lucky, you know. Uh I have a suggestion and a comment actually uh both and uh when we are talking about GPUs you know and you know

C2I what uh we really need a systems company to make them successful if you are looking at to go global so I think that is something which has to be addressed

as part of the policy I think because otherwise it cannot happen because world over uh we have grown you know from assembly to electronics products to chips you know uh we have not gone

through that trajectory we are still at the BMS you know and suddenly we have jumped into chips you know so that that system thing is totally missing in the country you know good point

&gt;&gt; we need a policy for that you know really very quickly even for him it's the same problem where it is we use you know like he was talking about product designers that's a very good I think

problem we have to solve because we have been into services we don't have product people, product managers that might. It's a very big gap to be

&gt;&gt; absolutely yeah and system design is getting a lot more complicated. uh &gt;&gt; we don't have companies design we need a policy and a system you know to make system when I say board level racks

those kind of things otherwise we will be just doing GPUs nobody to sell we have a good suggestion I think it's a good suggestion we'll keep going second just very quick just to add you know

when we are talking again GPU kind of thing we have to look at lower level of software and that requires again a policy either in AI mission or ISM I don't you know all the way you know from

the firmware middleware we have to go because today this world is dominated by CUDA and if you want to get into GPS it's a very long thing you know [clears throat] very long race you know

so I think that has to be done parallelly as a part of policy otherwise uh out of India doing going full solution would be difficult

[clears throat] go ahead Actually Matey has already noted this point and uh we are already working on this kind of system particularly in uh HPC and all full stack and development of softwares

across the top layer and bottom layer everywhere. So that exercise is going on in that process we are also integrating all kind of startups and all kind of new innovation that is coming. So whenever

this will come it will come as a complete solution and in the meantime uh what the problem you are mentioning it's a real problem and we need lot of product companies uh and for that uh

there should be a conducive environment also. So you will see that progressive government policy will try to address this product development also. And just to add HD I think um one

important aspect is like at least from when you look at C2I right the way we are trying to solve the problem is to look at the entire system for the way the power actually is from the point it

reaches into the hyperspace or hyperscaler to the GPU right that's how we trying to address it and then break it down into a piece that becomes a semiconductor problem that is how we are

trying to address and I think I think most of these I think same uh for mine or for Aani Gen one you are actually building a product gen two and gen three when you

are actually trying to get to a leadership position you have to think systems end to end I think that is natural when you start to build a technology for a global market and

trying to establish a leadership position right that is how I think we need to gear up and stop looking at components and start looking at like you know how do I take this component and

address the space in a much wider way that's how I think it'll grow &gt;&gt; I think his point is that we are missing a family called OEM, ODM system integrators. We like to acknowledge and

create them as well in the ecosystem. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So that exactly is the point where we need what you need is anchor customers. &gt;&gt; Exactly. So I think what we need is like

you know &gt;&gt; solution gets pro and you know &gt;&gt; Yeah. But but here's what I would say right. I mean this is all valid. Nvidia is a US company. There are no you know

supply chain providers in the US. Lot of the manufacturing gets done in Taiwan. It's still a $5 trillion company. Right. Let's start with building what we can and we'll build ecosystem right so

&gt;&gt; okay with that I think you guys should take this offline I think it's a very fascinating conversation uh but thank you everyone for joining I want to first thank Amitesh Amitesh thank you thank

you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you to you and the team for the heroic work that you guys are doing [applause] and also I think to our three founders

uh it's absolutely wonderful that you guys have moonshot companies that you're trying to build [applause] and Naveen and Marvel thanks for uh thanks for I think leveraging India to

the and and hopefully uh you'll you know we'll we'll be able to find those five people at the company that are you know doing this very special things you know. All right with that guys thank you very

much. Big thank to 15 also. They have funed four startups. This is very very needed and unless is not. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. [applause]

Thank you.
