## 📝 Summary

The ability of countries, regions, and alliances to thrive amid geopolitical volatility and systemic shocks depends on aligning three domains: AI and strategic technologies, diversified low-carbon energy systems, and modernised security capabilities. Rather than advancing in isolation, these pillars must progress together, at speed and scale, to strengthen economic and societal resilience. This discussion explores the "triple transition," outlining practical pathways to navigate it while promoting cooperation, accountability, and public trust globally.

## 📝 Transcript

We're driving the system bottom up. So essentially it is from school to space. We have labs in about 10,000 schools. We adding another 50,000. Fascinating elements of stories which are happening

there. We're getting ready for you and as sir mentioned the workforce of tomorrow. These are the startups of today and tomorrow. At the second level we have one of the highest number of

incubators sitting with us. The utter incubation mission itself. In fact, two weeks ago, we crossed 100. And this is where we are picking up these startups. We are picking up this

AI. We are picking up new technologies, nurturing them and trying to see how they are bringing about a real grassroot impact. You know what's interesting? Of those incubators who have

those 100 incubators currently over 20 of them are in small towns and cities and they are not looking to become a financial unicorn. These are my social unicorns.

Each one of them is touching issues which are touching a billion lives not just for India but everywhere else. And then we have the highend ones which are at the

which is what we work with directly. So it is actually creating this entire ecosystem which goes from within the government for example creating an entity in the ministry of defense which

is how can we bring transformation and how can we bring technology and innovation into the government that's a big thing and government everywhere will be a big adopter. So how do you help the

government pick up and bring that in and we are now taking it across a number of other ministries and similarly we're working with the state governments to bring in similar activities. So with

this entire effort is actually joining the dots and creating that web of innovation and creating that ground up impact which you started to begin to see.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. Well, happy 10th birthday [laughter] and um thank you for those very concrete examples. And Ser, we were talking before about the idea that regulation

should be or can be an enabler of innovation. Tell us a little bit about the Israeli approach to productive regulation to enable critical AI innovations.

&gt;&gt; Uh so first of all, thank you. Thank you for inviting me to this panel with this distinguish and honorable best guests and thank you all for being here. Um so a few words about Israel. You might know

it with from other things but I'll I'll tell you something. Uh um a very small country and a very small market. Okay, we're 10 million people. Uh third of only New Delhi I think right? Um so we

are small market and we are also a country with we don't have almost any natural resources and that lead us to be very tech dependent. Our tech sector is really

crucial to our economy. And when I say that we are a small market, it's to if if Israel will set its own specific regulation, I assume that companies will not develop their products and services

according to our regulation. When a company develop their products or services, they think about bigger markets, right? the EU 400 million people, the US, Asia, not a market of 10

million people. And we have to be conscious about that when we set regulation on AI. So u but in the same time we cannot also like sit on the fence and and let product and service

come in and that might um harm safety or uh other public other public interest. So the approach Israel has taken towards the AI regulation is uh first of all we'll do it for the time being sector

specific uh we're not going to think about it as an horizontal regulation that covers all artificial intelligence wherever it is but uh rather each sector if it's finance health education or the

public sector the government will think about the opportunities of AI in this sector uh whether the current regulation blocks it blocks it or whe the regulation doesn't give enough

protection. If you'll think about finance for example or law enforcement, right? We still we have when we do the regulation to these sectors, we have something in mind. If it's finance, we

want to think about social inclusion, right? We don't want people to be deprived of credit because it's it's crucial for their life. And if it's law enforcement, we don't want people um to

risk their freedom with no uh justified reason. So I think the idea is for the time being we give regulator to control their areas in many other fields whether it's privacy consumer protection so they

can do it also in the field of AI and for the time being it's working I'm not sure uh there's also disadvantage to this approach uh there can be a regulatory arbitrage uh when one

regulator um decide to take a very strict approach and one regulator decides on a very light approach But uh recently in Israel we've established an AI director was supposed

to harmonize u the activity of each sector. So that's one thing uh we're doing that the second thing that we're doing in um in terms of regulation. So I'm I'm a

lawyer and I perceive like when I u in my government when I go to parliament I think they see me with a stop sign on my head or something like that. Um but it's it's not like my my former boss used to

say that uh artificial intelligence requires human trust. Uh people has to trust it. If they'll trust it, they'll adopt it. If they um they'll adopt it, it will lead to wide implementation and

and and so on. And when you think about it, when you're driving a car or when you put your money in the bank, you have trust in this institution. You think some I hope so that someone somewhere

um has made enough rules that your money is safe or that the car that you're driving is is safe. So regulation in a sense is also uh a way to gain the public's trust. Now I think regulation

should be measured proportion proportionate uh risk based u but it's it shouldn't be perceived as a contradiction innovation and regulation and regulation has much uh is a much of

a player uh in achieving innovation as much as public investment and and um and by the country. So this is like in a nutshell our approach. we can speak afterwards on other things.

&gt;&gt; Thank you for that very clear view and we'll definitely come back to the trust component that you mentioned. Um Nick, we've been hearing a lot about the role of government, but I'd also like to hear

your perspective on the role of firms and firm level governance in this story because I think it's certainly part of the picture. How do you see firms um engaging governance to really galvanize

critical innovations? &gt;&gt; Yeah, thank you Tanya and thank you everyone for It's a great privilege. Tanya, when you started, you laid out kind of three big goals. We want kind of

resilient climate enhancing infrastructure, energy infrastructure. We want a really dynamic, innovative economy that creates opportunities and solves problems for us. And we want

really clear, safe, secure, resilient, self-determining, stable societies with a good, you know, defense rapper as part of all of that. Um, and the problem is that triangle is a little bit unstable,

right? When it comes to new technologies, um, often the Jebans paradox means the more efficient we get at delivering a service, the more emissions we produce because demand goes

up. Uh, states excited about new technologies like AGI can start to worry about the geopolitical kind of relationships in and and get into a race mentality in technologies. We've seen

that before. And when it comes to the climate resilient infrastructure versus security, often cost and uh alliances are relied upon to get, you know, materials flowing. Uh and so, you know,

the point that my esteemed colleague from Israel has made is it's really important to think about what are the rules that then stop that from fracturing so that we can rely on having

all three good things rather than just allowing us to fall into one corner of the triangle. Um but it's completely right because you have no matter what the rules and and regime is and speaking

as a lawyer uh a regulation that's written down is worth absolutely nothing to industry we know from particularly from studies in areas like work health and safety um unless you have very clear

signals of intent and enforcement of those rules people will just push the boundaries of it and Australia like Israel and also like India with the governance guidelines released last year

we're taking a bit of a touch approach to this. We're saying that what should happen is uh each sector should be looking at technology neutral rules as much as possible. Um and what we're

seeing in Australia is we're trying to really give life to the point that you made which is regulation and governance is an enabler of innovation. And so it's in the interest of every business uh

particularly businesses with a bit of profile to invest in actually doing the right thing from the beginning. The one problem I see with governance or one of the one of the key ones is um

organizations as they experiment with um artificial intelligence, they sometimes get caught in some of those triangular instabilities in terms of um starting to race against another competitor. And if

you race and you think if you're a as chief executive or you're a senior executive in a in a company um if someone says I sat next to a tech a tech person on an airplane or a bus and I

think we should invest in AI and that's the reason you invest in AI in your company you are much more likely to fall foul of the uh the regulation and the governance issues then if you say what

are the problems we're trying to solve and then what are the processes we need to put in place to build that trust with our clients. customers and stakeholders. Um, and so for me, this big picture and

this small picture of decision- making that all of us make within the organizations and even in our families, it's a really important link uh that we have to be consistent in and and policy

really has to support the incentives for us to think like that um throughout the stack. &gt;&gt; Thank you. And I really want to continue on this theme of trust which I think is

already emerging as as very critical to this conversation. I think it's worth acknowledging is that when we think about transitions or disruptions, they come with tradeoffs. Um so if we think

about defense and security for example, the need for defense innovation comes with higher public spending. I know that India in the in the um budget will be increasing its public spending on

defense by about uh more than 15%. India is of course also a country of huge scale and so I'm curious about how public trust is created in these new resilience building measures um across

the population and I'd like to also just start this question by acknowledging that you know this event in itself is highly inclusive people have come from from all parts to be here it's also very

evident still the G20 signs from 20 uh from 2023 that are very evident across the country. Um that that was an event that was really across states and and involved many many people. So Mr. Shinga

perhaps you can tell us about how you build public trust when it comes to new resilience building measures. &gt;&gt; Tanya, you're right. I mean I think the word trust is very important here and uh

when you talk of summit like this uh you know our whole I think purpose of of being able to host a summit of this nature is to make it as inclusive as possible uh to reach out to as many

people in our own country as possible. So if you notice it's not just those of us who are involved with EI but there's a lot of people from the public who are here at this at the conference venue uh

you know at the exhibition uh yesterday I was at a restaurant and the waiter said I'd like to visit the exhibition and I was a bit surprised because I said hello isn't it for professionals he said

no my children are very keen and then I realized that there's a public interface here which is great I think this is the way it should be and G20 was similar you know G20 was a rare moment when we were

you know presumed the presidency and so uh I think the prime minister decided that instead of making it an event that was just based in the capital that we would broadcast it and take it to uh you

know every uh city uh every state of our country and uh and as a result I think people across the country whether it's in uh you know in Gujarat or in Nagaland or Jammu and Kashmir or Kerala were able

to feel that they were a part of that existence. So inclusivity is critical. Uh I saw that the CEO of Anthropic yesterday spoke about uh you know this opportunity of the AI summit uh to

democratize. He said that India has the opportunity to democratize the to make it more effective and I think this is what it is all about. I mean our efforts to democratize it not not only in our

own country but also across the global south and and this I think is uh you know your point is important that you know as you invest in AI and to invest in systems uh that would be uh you know

uh uh important as you move ahead into the future. Uh you know the costs are more and of course uh public trust is important here. The public needs to be part of that exercise. Uh I think um you

know if you look at it in one way I think the public understands that there is a need for an investment in your public security. In other words that you face external challenges you face

internal threats. How do you uh make sure that you are able to provide a secure environment for your people? Uh how does the same technology work to your benefit? Whether it's the use of

drones uh you know in in agriculture and farming uh for field mapping or for land zoning you know there's always property disputes in India you know because of the fact that demarcation of land

holdings is not clear. We're now using drones uh to map it out and AI to make sure that this particular mapping is accurate. Um so use of AI I think is critical in building the public trust.

Uh many of us here would remember that during co we had a software called co-win that ensured that you know two billion uh you know vaccinations were administered to our people. We did it uh

across the country in a very very smooth manner which meant that uh you know you could really take it up to scale and at the same time you had systems that enabled everybody to be identified uh

you know in in a database but imagine if AI were to be used in that how much simpler that exercise would become so I think again the public is is an important part of that they have to

understand that whatever you do is for their benefit I don't I personally believe that any money should be spent without public trust and confidence. I mean it's very important you know I'm

have to leave a little early because I have to go for a parliamentary committee that scrutinizes the budget that is now present before us and I think it's very important to be there because I want to

make sure that you know I'm present to see that whatever is proposed is something which is which is uh you know what we can live with it's for the public interest. I mean everything is

for the public interest but you have to make sure that every small part of that proposal uh lives to that commitment lives up to that commitment and so uh I think when you talk about EI when you

talk about futuristic systems you're investing in the future and I think for India it's very important that we invest in the future we must leaprog technologies we cannot afford to be

moving in the normal way we have already found that uh you know in many senses certain countries have done that and have got ahead in a way that is not always helpful or constructive We want

to be constructive players. We believe uh you know in humanentric globalization. How do you use technology for the benefit of people across the world and in our own country and we want

to be that player that constructive player in the global stage that can use technology use development to help our own people help others. &gt;&gt; Thank you. And Mr.

in creating a a culture let's say of innovation and entrepreneurship across demographics in the country how do you feel that that contributes to this development of social and economic

resilience &gt;&gt; so the first point we go back to inclusion and empowerment the moment you have that you have a greater sense of trust which comes but let's look at

trust per se and you're thinking of the government's role in creating that trust would you think So one is policy reflects the mood of society right so you need to read the mood and

then create a policy around it to create that trust won't trust be a responsibility of every stakeholder in the system which is every citizen every private entity every government entity

the government as a whole and as an individual so it's a very collective element which happens and now think about the ability of creating trust you know in the Ian context you will notice

that whenever there is a challenge between innovation and regulation I think the sense always is that we tend to tilt towards innovation I may be wrong so I mean we are more innovation

happy and as you are saying we need to create the new ideas and leaprog into new situations but at the same time look at the role of a policy maker is it to enable or is it to regulate

That's a very difficult role in the current context as we are going forward also because as we discussed disruption is happening every moment when the core is changing let's say

you're entering into a world where everything is possible but nothing is certain now to create a structure around that scenario with creative destruction at

its peak the I think of the most challenging jobs in today's world is that of a policy maker and the element of creating trust also comes in with a lot of other

elements which are changing by the way. So from that perspective what we are now trying to work is that the moment you have inclusion and empowerment if every individual is empowered

to take see what they want is right or wrong for them and have the ability to be included in the process then they are a stakeholder in the process and the moment you are a

stakeholder in the process you are a part of that trust building effort and I think that This is where when you're looking at a bottom up approach and a top down and they all meet. So we

moved away from it essentially top down approach. It's all driven bottom up and that is what creates the trust that is what creates the flexibility. That is what reflects the mood of the society

and that's what enables a collective sense of trust to get involved. That's what we are doing. &gt;&gt; Thank you. And I want to pick up on what you mentioned around the role of the

policy maker and the idea that trust takes coordination. It takes new kinds of capacity building as well. And I think what often we're seeing across the three domains we're talking about

critical technologies, uh, energy innovations, defense and security innovations, is that often they don't neatly fit the structures of government. Um and I think that this can be very

very challenging for those that who are trying to think through the policy and regulatory landscape. So sit I'd like to ask you about the experience in Israel of inter agency cooperation of how you

see uh ministerial collaboration happening and perhaps the cross- sectoral level as well. Um and if I can add it would be interesting to hear about the role of the new artificial

intelligence directorate playing that coordinating function. So thank you. Well, I think I think Israel will not be special in that sense that we work also

in silos and AI being the new and I'll be a bit cynical now, but like the new shining toy, everybody also wants to have like a a stake in it. And in in these circumstances, I won't lie, it's

hard to cooperate. Everyone wants to uh control like AI. And also in Isra, we We experienced lately like a political we're not like political instability which means that

we have like um elections quite often which makes it hard to think of long-term policies. U so in that sense we are really looking forward to this new director of AI which is um led by

professionals who will have the opportunity to think about it long term how Israel wants to lead in AI in five 10 15 years I don't know if we went to 47 20 47 but at least um 10 years ahead

so I think that's one way to break the silo and also this director will be located at the prime minister office and I think that's also to give a sense how the importance that Israel seeing it now

uh until now there was I would say organized chaos in Israel for what it what concerns AI but I think It was also a good thing right because it gave some kind of pioneer like people on the

ground companies they um they they worked on AI they try to promote AI and it gave us like as government like a period of time what we can see where the market is heading what are the needs of

Israeli companies in order to uh to thrive in AI. So I think the director comes in a good like in a good momentum not too early and not too late and his role will be to understand where Israel

has advantages, what are disadvantages and to and and to um allocate our resources and resources are not just money. It's it's time right it's time of policy makers or or they're like have a

lot on their mind. you have to catch like their attention for a certain moment and it's think about regulators of in the transportation on the education their main role is not to

encourage AI if you're the minister of education your main role is that the education system will function you as a director will have to give them resources and the motivation to invest

time in AI if you're a financial regulator it's the same you think about your consumers you don't think or financial stability you don't think necessarily about why AI is important

and I think the director role was to be as well to give them resources to catch their attention and to uh push them in a direction to invest in AI and to make AI part of their daily thinking but I think

all sectors will be impacted there's no way around it and another thing that I I um I want to mention regarding the is I think in Israel at least um the government is uh you spoke about public

spending so our uh public spending in defense uh was always high and in the last three years it skyrocketed like so we need to think about how we make our government more efficient

and and AI is a part of I'll give you just an example it also has to do with trust right when you think about how can use AI. We see all these uh sometimes like

doomsday example, right? Like incarcination. But why do we need to start there? We can start like in so many simple things that can improve our our government. I'll give you an example

in Israel. Uh in Israel there is a long wait for public housing. We don't have a lot of public housing and the demands the demand exceed what what we have to offer. Uh sometimes people

seven months to get an answer whether they're eligible to because the people who ask for public housing they I when I was a law student I volunteered in a center like that they

come with a bunch of they don't get into a form in the computer and like very organized like this is my salary the number of kids I have they come with a lot of and until I know six months ago

seven clerks took this all of these papers and made like a chart of like whether they're eligible or not and brought that to a community. It took about six, seven hours to sum up one

request. Okay, they brought AI to do this summary, right? Uh there is a human in the loop that is looking that they were not and that uh it shortened the time of the committee to receive but

70%. Okay. And I assume it would be better because the system will be better and the human in the loop will have less work. It's not a risky use. All this all the AI is doing is uh making information

more organized. It it helps with public trust because people because people know that this AI works for them and and in that sense I think building that the government is leading by example that we

adopt AI, we adopt it in a responsible uh manner and I think that also um will also help also in gaining trust but also to to show the companies or regulators the government

is doing it the government is using it that mean we are in a state where we can uh go to the next level &gt;&gt; thank you Mr. ing that I know you have to go soon. So I'll come to you for one

additional comment. I want to draw on your experience as foreign secretary. Um I think a lot of the challenges that we're talking about cross borders. We're thinking about energy, defense, critical

technologies, these are national stories, but they're very much also regional. And so I'm curious to hear from you about the role of international cooperation in in galvanizing the

changes that you'd like to see. um and in particular to think about the role of regional alliances in this picture. &gt;&gt; Well um you know you have a global governance structure. You've got the

United Nations, you've got the Bretonwoods institutions, you've got the WTO, but none of them are geared up for technologies that represent the future. So whether it's AI or you know whether

it is uh you know use of say critical minerals or whether it is any futuristic technology how do you as uh you know deeply said how do you regulate that space how do you ensure that there is

some level of international governance where every country has certain responsibility. So how do you use AI responsibly? I mean I think I fully agree about the disruptions that AI

could cause. I mean the disruptions could be in many senses. I mean there's already concern in uh in our country about the disruptions in terms of employment or unemployment that AI could

cause because it'll make a whole lot of people redundant. Um on the other hand AI could also be used in a manner that could be uh you know socially uh I would say u of concern. For example, the

social media you know u fake uh messages, fake posts uh using AI uh you know to morph and change pictures and so on so forth. This is something that could be beyond just individuals but it

could affect societies you know it could lead to incidents it could lead to unrest. Uh so how do you deal with that and how do you deal with it at a global scale? Uh take a simple thing like cyber

crime. You know cyber crime today is is a global uh I mean syndicated operation. Your uh something taken from your account illegally through the means of technology is going into 60 accounts and

then uh you know 600 accounts and then going into uh into cryptocurrency and you can't trace it. So how do you regulate crypto for example? So I think you need another global governance uh

let's say framework that can help countries across the board provide some regulation. I don't know in what sense I think the AI summit is a good place for a discussion of all of that uh you know

all of those concerns. Uh and I think some work is being done by the United Nations as well. But I think it needs more than just the UN because this is technology which is cutting edge which

is you know not not just there but might come up in future. You need people who have a good idea and and some of our friends here are I think well placed to provide us with that and Deeper quite

correctly pointed out that I'm probably the only exception in this room. My only familiarity with with AI is that my son deals with AI but having said that having said that I think there's a lot

more that we can do in terms of bringing some sort of you know control over this entire framework that you have and not just nationally but internationally. So I I'll stop there and I'll also take

your indulgence to &gt;&gt; sorry to come in the middle of the session uh as Sri Hwadan Singla has to leave. So I request Sroj Bharat from our team to give a moment to him.

Thank you very much. Thank you, sir. &gt;&gt; Thank you. And Nick, I I know that you have both very extensive experience when it comes to international cooperation, but also a

particular view on on the role of perhaps the global competition narrative uh that's emerging. tell us about your thoughts on this. &gt;&gt; Yes. So, um the um point that was made

um at the beginning of the session was regulation as an enabler. Uh and certainly international coordination is also an incredible enabler of the safe and responsible use of uh of AI systems

um for for many reasons, but one of them is because it doesn't just lead to products and services that are more likely to be trusted uh but they're actually more trustworthy because you

can move from country to country, service to service and feel okay there is an a standard that I'm aware of that this uh is based upon at the organizational level the the kind of

predominant standard in the AI space is 4201 ISO 4201 which is a management standard so it's a standard that that attaches to the the use and the organization the processes around by

which you know whether you have works and is safe. And in my mind here on both the international level and all the way down to you know us using uh things individually there are three big

questions that I think we have to be really um clear on and this this includes in work in the military domain that I've done with the the global commission and the first one is that

it's the right tool for the job. So within an organization or across uh countries this is actually going to what it says and it is suited to that task. And just for example, I don't use claude

or GPT5 for most of my summarization work. I have GPT OSS running on my hard drive and it's a much lighter, you know, use of the thing. I don't need an internet connection and I know how much

energy it burns, right, which is directly from my battery. Choosing the right tool for a job, whether it's robotic process automation or others, is the is an absolute key. But the second

one is the team, the group of people that are using it together. And I think this is the most under investigated thing when it comes particularly to generative AI. We all use it

individually but at an organizational level it's actually how teams use it together to get an outcome in a ministry or your example of lawyers helping someone make an application. The whole

process has to be adjusted and people have to know what the um system is doing. That is also true at the international level. So when groups of company countries come together and

increasingly track two and track 1.5 dialogues where these are the key people in uh labs and tech firms talking to each other about geopolitically sensitive questions. They also there has

to be enough transparency about what is happening in these systems. That's probably the sticking point at the moment in terms of international competition. Um but like at the at the

at the very bottom level you need to understand the trade-offs and I think that's where um sessions like this really start to think well what trade-offs are the most important for us

to uh manage and in the military realm one of the most important ones is human agencies and control over the the deadliest of systems. Uh and that's the one where a lot of focus has been at the

UN level uh recently on on uh military systems. Thank you, Nick. I want to give uh both of our additional speakers a minute just to talk about their country's

perceptions of the role of international cooperation before I hand over to Sham Krishna for some closing remarks. Sorry. Um so as I mentioned before Israel small market um we won't make our own unique

regulations where we are very much looking towards the world to set some standard that we can we can adopt because we understand our uh the limits of our our regulation. So we we we

looking with anticipation for this uh standards to to to sink in. I do want to say also that sometimes I'm not a policy maker. I'm a legal adviser to policy makers and when I have to come to

parliament or when I have to come to meet with the minister and I have to come with recommendation I look at international papers and there are so many of them and there the OECD and then

the UN and the UNESCO and and they're all very valuable but I think we need to start narrowing it down and think what is the unique um advantage of each of these papers and what we can take from

them um and think how we I I think we are in a stage of limited resources also for these organizations and how we make this war more work more collaborative and how we can take the most out of it

because we and I'm not I'm sure that Israel is not unique in that sense we're very much looking to see these works and to learn from them and to implement them when we do our AI regulations. So that's

that's one thing I will also want to say even though it's not but I'm you know I'm Israeli I can um just because of the discussion that was here earlier there is also so much that you can expect from

regulation reg there was it was said here for example disinformation and fake news um regulation will not encourage critical thinking among kids right uh regulation will not explain my father

why not everything in charge is true and he will call me to say you know I judge told me that and that and I have to tell them that it's wrong. Um so and regulation will not make any caution

like um all cautionary measures that has to do with AI. So I think you were talking about tradeoff and everything but I think also we need to think about what we do accept regulation if you want

to have trust uh in AI and so I'll sum with that and thank you so much again for having me. You know you would have seen where global cooperation is concerned or

partnership. I think India's position is very clear. Look at our ethos. You know in Sanskrit and the prime minister often used it is is vas kamasu

right the world is one family for us we are very clear it's nothing but that and for us family is number one like for all of us and within that family we expect everyone to cooperate and we want to do

it. So for us cooperation is a part of our DNA. The second interesting thing is that for the first time in human history until now, if you look at our entire history,

it was defined by geographical borders and then came nation states etc. For the first time, we are now coming to a position where there is a new agent which doesn't

understand physical boundaries or borders. That is a completely different And for us that challenge fits in very well with us because we in any case look

at it as a good big partnership family. &gt;&gt; Thank you. We are fortunate to have partnered on this event with two organizations with the Prrenava Institute and with Arya

India. And I'd now like to turn to Sham Krishna Kuma for a short closing remark. As we approach the closing of the session, we would like to thank uh Shri Debbak Baglaji for his presence and
