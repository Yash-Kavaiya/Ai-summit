## 📝 Summary

The ability of countries, regions, and alliances to thrive amid geopolitical volatility and systemic shocks depends on aligning three domains: AI and strategic technologies, diversified low-carbon energy systems, and modernised security capabilities.

This discussion explores the "triple transition," outlining practical pathways to navigate it while promoting cooperation, accountability, and public trust globally.
