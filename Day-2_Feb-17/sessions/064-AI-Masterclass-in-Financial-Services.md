## 📝 Transcript

keep context setting on what we see from our vantage point as well in financial services in terms of the AI adoption what's happening on the ground a lot being talked about it but that's also a

fact about making it work in an enterprise and a f so that's on the first part that we'll do um we'll then move to the next one which is uh about we wanted all of you to experience a bit

of especially from a a w session standpoint more in the area of uh taking an idea through a proof of value uh more of a VIP design and a V build session. Um so you have a lot of laptops out

there. Uh there are series of instructions. It will be both assisted as well as if some of you wanted to do on your own more than welcome to do it as well. So but we'll assist in the

process flow to get a feel for it. How does that work through the design and the initial prototype build part of it and then of course we'll wrap it up uh as a final thing.

Let me give a little bit of context setting uh from our vantage point. what BCS I think uh it's all well recognized that AI has really gone into a hyper acceleration phase uh maybe two or three

key call out that I would do out here I'm sure most of you familiar with it but just make a call out one is the fact that uh there is a genuine movement from the traditional chatbot kind of an

interface to more of agents and action it's really happening out there in the market in the industry as well and BFSI is definitely in in in lead in that as well there are multiple uh I would call

it as S waves that are happening right now multiple interventions happening at the same point so that kind of giving a bit of challenge as well as an opportunity exciting but at the same

time it's also giving a lot of challenge in terms of the adoption standpoint we see a significant focus on multimodel adoption uh and believe that's the future in

which it will shape up you would judiciously use multiple models to accomplish a particular task or a a process flow and the most Important thing is that end of the day it's all

about context engineering. You go to build the context before you engage with the model. So three call outs because there's a lot of flurry of activity happening as you could see a series of

models that are coming into the market. Competing ones uh quality is improving. For instance, think about these two the 5.3 cordex and the sonet 4.6 were launched in a space of 20 minutes and

you could expect what would happen down the line as well. So with this flurry of activity, it's important that we keep those three call outs in mind. We're going to judicially use which model

would factor for and what context in an enterprise as well. While that happens this flurry of activity happening what we believe is that there is also a convergence

happening in this space. Uh there is a vertical convergence happening right from so far the focus has lot been on models and applications. It's all about hardware and infrastructure as well. You

could see a lot of investment being called out in the space globally within India and from our organization standpoint or from the group. We have announced the launch of an AI data

center a 1 gawatt data center of reput of next five years as well. So the point is that there is a vertical alignment that's happening right through infrastructure to the models both

specialized and foundation models and to the applications. It's very important to things so that it has got off to a inflection point that cannot be seen in isolation. It has to be seen in terms of

the endear vertical stack to make it more impactful. We did a survey among customers both globally and in India because 170 of our customers we did a survey and saying

what's adoption and how is it shaping up a very recent survey that we did the multiple things that came out one good news is all about that close to 90 odd percentage of the customers are in some

form of shape and this cut across banking capital markets and insurance customers I said both India and globally are in some form of shape adopting it with almost 60%age fairly fairly in

advanced state of the adoption uh standpoint as I just want to make one specific call out here be interesting to many of you as well 50%age of the customer base feels that a lot of focus

need to be given on enterprise specific models and some fine-tuned models as well this is something which is very important given the regulated nature of the financial service industry how much

of secure and how much of accurate models are also needed u from an enterprise standpoint then of A majority overwhelming majority also felt there is a good need to measure the

outcome. Metrics are needed. It's one to talk about P and pilot but another to talk about the business outcome. In India I think it's also interesting to see India the opportunity and challenges

the nuances around the language. India I would to call it is a very voiceled demography as well focus on voice. So the key thing is that how well nuance that you address the voices the

different language constricts the different variations in that and how do you make sure that that's been delivered through it we worked with TA capital I think I'll just do a quick demonstration

of a work that we uh TA cap has launched to the market in the area of retail land &gt;&gt; India is a land of many voices spoken in different languages across diverse geographies and most important ly with

unique financial needs. At Tata Capital, financial inclusion means more than just access to finance. It means being present, being understood, and being reachable to everyone, everywhere.

Today, we are proud to showcase a multimodal voice AI solution supporting our customers across every key moment of their financial journey. Truly end to end.

Hello Sharma this is calling from capital we talk Preapproved loan offer self-employed madam.

Madam Croc WhatsApp information details. Speech,

Mother's Mommy, Madam B. What you just saw? Well, that is the future. The future of conversations, of

customer engagement, and of AIEL transformation. This isn't just a concept. It is already powering millions of customer conversations. This this is how Tata Capital is reimagining

engagement at scale, with responsibility, with empathy, and with real impact. Because when trust finally finds a voice, Bhat engages. And when Bhat eng engages, Bhat progresses.

&gt;&gt; So, so this was a scenario in which if you look at it, I think voice A is not new. I think it's been around for a while. But ability to engage in a very conversational mode and the entire

conversation has been modeled on an AI on one side of it. It's a multimodel in nature. It uses our own India based models based on sal. So I think a lot of linguistic variation that is at present

I think is important because on one side we have the global models available but most important to address the local nuances and the second thing is it's also now allowing from a multi channel

standpoint. So I think the ability to come together more from a customer servicing I think that has taken at a different league al while that happens uh let me call you

out some key pointers from what we have been experiencing over the last I mean I would say 9 to 12 months some very grounded reality has been popped up here from our vantage when we're looking at

the adoption in terms of AI for business and AI for IT is pretty straightforward in terms of it's mostly around a lot of focus on coding assistance And plus the fact that you do a lot using

modernization huge focus in many firms in terms of technology modernizing the ability of AI to accelerate it and these are not PC's and part is really getting into production and the business side of

it if you look at it it's got a broad stake happening on it right from customer servicesvicing to horizontal functions corporate functions and also in the wealth and investment advisory as

well. So there is a significant progress happening in this space but just also wanted to call out some of the ground realities that are ROI challenges still persist there is still challenges in

terms of the accuracy the compliance aspect of it that's still an important thing to be addressed and factored in building an AI solution the other part is that building an AI solution is one

thing making it work in an enterprise in terms of integration is so critical a lot of our have been built around building solution but not nec necessarily there for that you need to

make it work connecting to your enterprise systems connecting your CRM your core banking your learning application that's a critical aspect of this whole process flow I think it's

fairly recognized that individual use case are not giving you the benefit the real benefit come by process flows and by workflows and that you got to look at workflows differently not to the

traditional left to right but more from right to left in terms of an outcome standpoint um we see and we believe uh finetuning is something that

financial services would pick up in a significant way. We already seeing that that would really do an uptick in the next 6 to9 months would definitely see that picking up in a big way. Why?

Because of the need for much more accurate much more precise models that need to happen to say that it will be a hybrid scenario. You would have fine-tuned models on one hand you'll

also have large language model you judiciously use it. There is definitely a shift towards HENTIC. Um having said that these are not agentic as in high level of autonomy but

slow pedigree of autonomy is being enabled and the agentic workflows are happening. The bottom point I think we refer to that the vertical stack that's evolving very important to look at and

interest in the platform based thought process. Again the whole point is that I can do a great PC pilot shiny object but how do I scale it across and you need a platform engineered thought process to

make it happen. So these are some of the experiences that we kind of picked up. Thought I will relay that all of you as well. Just wanted to give a quick perspective around the fine-tuning that

we talked about. This is something which piggy back on the fact that it will be in hybrid AI solutions and models that you would end up with. You would have both the scenarios. you will

continuously leverage large language motor for broad measurable enterprise task and activities with proper grounding. I think it's very important I just double

down on the fact that it has to be engineered. How well do you orchestrate your workflows? How well do you build your eval around which is very critical but I think this is an equally important

how well you build your domain adapted models in compliance area in advisory in tradition research. I think it's important to see how well they build the proper in high accuracy. From our

vantage point, we believe it's going to be convergence between the two, not one over the other because each has its own space. It's very important that you use this and just give you a couple of quick

anecdotes around it. These are real life examples. Something that we've done for litigation prediction in a claims value chain. uh if you look at it uh what a base model

provided versus what a fine-tuned model provides and this is not something that happens straight away. You need to iteratively build it. But very important to continue make sure that right from

base model with different techniques of fine-tuning to make it more domain adapted in that context and you could see the high percentage of uh accuracy as you do build that incrementally and

this is where business gets a lot glued to it saying that Now it's come to a point it's not just technical it's also important to make it work. Same thing in compliance and we have used two

different models just to give a variation. There are many models out there but these are models that you could enable it and whether it's llama or mal family there many other models

for instance as I said for server mod in terms of voice a stand but the key message I want to leave out here is that fine-tuning or making it proprietary it's not just technology I think it's

all about building this domain curation how well do you build the instruction set for a finetuning and that need a lot of domain understanding Once you build that the initial set then I think it's a

lot about applying the right techniques. Um and it's also equally important look at the right models. You have a slew of models out there and there is a method to the madness in terms of which model

would fit into what context. So all the three are very important building the right uh instruction sets for finetuning and then for all the for all of you who I'm sure finetuning is something that

all of you are aware of it but essentially what you're trying to do is that make making sure a broader model has been fine- tuned towards specific domain and adaptation so that it get

much more relevant in that context and accuracy of the decision it takes is to a higher level a series of business scenarios that are evolving in this area We see this in India. We see this in

globally. So this is something from our vantage. We see a strong uptick that's happening. So just wanted to give a quick flavor of that before we get into the wide thought process. I think it's

important to look at it from the the context engineering very important. Enterprise adoption is not just about building use cases but also making work in the broad end. It's very

critical to make sure that your judicial use of large language models and domain adapted models. And with that, we think let me just show you one specific scenario where

&gt;&gt; Good afternoon. Thank you for calling. Do I have the pleasure of speaking with &gt;&gt; Hi, Katherine. This is Daniel Thompson. Um, I need to report an accident that happened earlier today morning at um

4:30 a.m. &gt;&gt; I am sorry to hear. Could I please have your policy number. &gt;&gt; Yes, it is. ALC76 123905. &gt;&gt; Thanks, Daniel. I thought that's your

policy. Everything looks active. Could you describe what happened? &gt;&gt; I was already on the highway. I was driving um southbound um on the M1 Pacific Motorway past the Gossford exit

in New South Wales, maintaining my lane and speed when a silver SUV suddenly merged from the left onto the motorway and wiped my vehicle. &gt;&gt; So is this the impact was on the left

side? &gt;&gt; Yes, quite severely. It hit around the front left door and fender area. I had no chance to react. The other driver didn't yield or check for traffic.

&gt;&gt; Understood. Um, were the police called to the scene? &gt;&gt; Yes. A patrol unit came by. They've noted the details. I have the uh the event number. I was took several uh

photos of the of the damage. &gt;&gt; Great. If you can send us the event number, police notes, and any photos that will help us proceed. We'll also need the um repair estimate or tow

docket if you've received one. &gt;&gt; I will email all documents shortly. &gt;&gt; Perfect. Drive safe and let us know if you need anything else. All right. As you could relate, I think

the accent of this is for a UK based customer and the context a little different from the first one that you saw from a voice AI which was a very specific scenario where in the TA

capital story it was AI at the thick and center of everything in terms of engaging in a customer service but not actions are not being taken. It's more of a conversational uh uh flow. This one

a scenario in which a multimodel with a fine tune model brought into the picture. So if you could see the focus of the customer service rep is more in terms of looking at the information that

can be gleaned around it. This is an augmented AI. A was listening to the whole conversation providing from an augmented standard what additional information normally this whole proc

of loss for all the from the insurance background would know when you met meet with an accident you the first notice of loss that you make a call to the back office to inform a lot of information

you gather at that point it's very important to capture that information today it's a very back and forth happens and your claims get delayed because a simple reason you haven't captured

enough information in this scenario behind the scenes a so a was not in the front and center behind the scenes capturing the information and there was a litigation validator which I was

telling the fine tune model looking at it is there any fraud in this process so that there is a subsequent litigation possible down the line and that information I know how many have watched

that that information was gleaned through in between providers say this looks like a good call let's proceed so I think I think that the modality is little different out there but the whole

point is that it's very important to look from both the scenarios So uh to to put it in nutshell I think it's important uh from an enterprise fo I think is proper calibration is very

critical great technology great capabilities evolving but it's also important how do you enable that in a context and where do you not apply a also I think it's important also look

you don't apply a uh because at times we have the thought process of applying a all over the place I think it's very important to break it and then make sure that the once and that's where our

philosophy is that don't look at from a traditional process flow from left to right which you break it down to series of task and say where I can apply it look at from a right to left and see

outcome what is outcome and how do I reapply back um so what we're going to do now for the next 60 minutes or so what I thought is that uh our belie that this need to be

broken into three broad areas you got to have a quick proof of value you need to build that proof of value because there are certain things you will just move forward then you say okay this is not

working. Let me try the next one. You have the ability right now to do a cuke prototyping, a cuke w design and prototyping. Then you go into rapid build over a period of time, five to six

weeks and then you really scale it. This is the model that we would advocate as enterprises start picking up more and more because as I said it's very important to look at outcome backwards.

It's very important to look for what is the business assurance that I bring in. So we have constructed the next uh 60 minutes or so in that format. You have certain challenge cards on your table.

You have laptops out there. We're going to do this in two formats. We could have we'll assist you in the process in how do I go through the process and second is also in terms of those who are more

wanting to do on their own they feel free to uh try it out. Instructions are also given out there. Let me invite Kavita now to run you through the white coding design and prototyping session.

Thank you. to continue on the topic of scaling. Uh in financial services, AI doesn't scale when the model is ready. It's when legal, compliance,

regulatory, all of the body comes together that's when they are ready, it's when AI scales, right? So I think that's one of the challenges that uh we face when we look at scaling I this is

just one of them and um I um my name is Kavita and I lead the AI labs for financial services and um I'm I help customers on their journey to adopt AI and scale AI and one of the other

challenges that really come across when we start discussing about AI use cases is uh how do I get the business teams on board Because if you look at the kind of implementations we have seen so far in

AI, uh you've got knowledge assistance, you've got chat bots, you've got good document AI capability. And if you look at these implementations, they have actually

filled the gap where the traditional AI traditional IT has failed in the sense inability to act access unstructured data. That was a gap which AI saw. So most of the use cases have been around

these lines and that's primarily because AI has not been we have not let the business teams actually drive AI. So what does it take to help enable the business teams to understand the power

of AI and look at more transformative use cases. So that's the construct of what we want to do today. We want you to experience that how a business user or a business team can be enabled with AI to

accelerate that whole journey of identifying the right opportunity uh doing a working prototype and actually even testing it out and seeing the proof of value. How do we shift left

in the sense that how do we give business more control and working with the engineering team build out a quick proof of value that you can validate and then scale to production because in one

of the earlier conversations I had with one of you here was that you know scaling is a challenge but sometimes you don't get to scale because you've not identified the right opportunity you try

to apply every AI everywhere. So how to use AI to help you in that journey and and what we want to achieve through this is let business lead the whole AI redesign. So how do we do that and

that's something that we will uh cover today and uh what we're going to show you demonstrate to you is not a tool but how we can bring all the AI capability together for a business audience. So um

Yeah, switching on to that. So, what we'll see today, a disclaimer before I start. This tool is not uh a single tool. It's a workbench that we have created that brings together different

AI capabilities. And then what we do is that we start off with something called a business challenge because that's the starting point for a business team. Where do I

begin my journey? What is the challenge that I need to address? And for the sake of this demonstration, I'll pick up one use case. Something that's uh a challenge that has come up in one of our

customer conversations was that you have a lot of portfolio managers who need to at the end of the quarter generate a summary of how their portfolio has performed and along with collecting a

lot of data, they need to actually uh check out the sentiment that's of the stock on the public domain. So there's a lot of data gathering, lot of analysis that comes in and as a result there's a

lot of time that goes into that activity and that delays the overall report and sometimes it's get delegated to a junior analyst. The quality of the report is affected. So how do I bring all of that

in a way that AI can help the portfolio manager solve? So that was the challenge that we picked up and I'll show you a quick demonstration of how that challenge works. The challenge uh was

just creating an assistant to help the u AI agent uh to help the portfolio manager actually look up what is the right um what is the data that's available out there on the public domain

or uh even look up Yahoo Finance to see what how the stock has performed. So all of that was being done by AI in the background and this is a solution that when we piloted with our customers they

see saw a huge advantage because today they were actually outsourcing a lot of this activity to a third party organization and they were able to bring that back and bring down the overall

time to generate the report and even the quality of the report started coming out much better. So this is ex I thought I'll give you a view of the final outcome but and take you back to where

we started and that's the platform that we were trying to show. So switching on so to that platform so what we do as a first step is actually pick up the challenge and how do we use

AI to ideulate and come up with something called the opportunity canvas. So many of our users have you know if you see our business users are all equipped with u copilots because there's

already available in the enterprise but what we've observed is that just not giving them AI tools or training them on prompts is really going to help it's about helping them to understand that

end to end process and letting them have complete control. So that's what we've done over here. So we looked at what could be a set of questions that a business user needs to look at when they

see a challenge and convert it to an opportunity. So we've curated a set of prompts which can go through the data and come up with what we call the opportunity camps. So we'll just walk

you through those different steps. So I think one thing that we always need to keep in mind is that uh when we when when we give uh AI to the business users the research is primarily on you can use

a lot of research tools available but the organization context is more important how do we know what the user is uh what are the different users going through what is their challenges and

pain points so loading the context is the first step and the reason I'm walking you through this is because once I finish the demo want you also to try and just see whether as a business

leader or a practitioner how the whole experience will be and how can we really build that capability for business teams to use. So we'll go through this flow. Uh so we've built the context

and then after that you can even go back and do a deep research because sometimes your context is not enough. You want to know how your peers are performing. You can pull out a deep research from Gemini

or Chachi PT put that context also in and then you have an overall knowledge base that your business team can now use to start ideating. So what we've done is created an ideation framework here. Now

as you go through the ideation process you'll have lot of questions. Have I captured all the pain points right? Because you want to be sure that you're actually solving a problem. There's pain

points that you capture and there are quite a lot of steps. But I won't go through all of them but if you quickly go through you'll have pain points you'll have um you'll want to assess

what the business impact is what's the possible solution direction that you want to take right and as we go through these steps you'll see that it's not enough just to analyze the data that's

available but to actually start seeing AI as a thinking partner that's what we want the business to do be able to bounce ideas validate them feed the input support and finally at the end of

it create what we call an opportunity canvas. So a lot of thought has gone in. So while while these demonstrations uh while he uh brings up the opportunity canvas something that we have observed

is that uh just giving a tool uh may not be the only solution what we do uh in TC something that's worked for us is that we conduct an AI day for business teams where we try to create that immersive

experience where they understand what are the right AI tools and also how to use them and how to apply them in the context. So I'll If you can just go through the Yeah. So

there's a lot of questions. So we don't we and it will take a minute to uh go through but if our demo is ready you can show that as well. Yeah. So this is what the final product

looked like. So it it uh it just you you give a pro company name and it went through the organization's research. It also went to the um public domain and started picking up all the stock

information and uh brought that up into an overall summary that that that can be then used by the portfolio manager to make a decision on how his stock has performed. How do I report that to to

his to his customers? How do I report that into the uh performance reporting? And if you see it's was instant and has gone through I think 15 to 20 sites we've configured uh all the financial

sites to go through and capture the sentiment uh capture key financial metrics all of that instantly on a on a very high speeded internet now I think we would be done with the

opportunity canvas last one step so it's important that we go through these steps so that that's why you know we have consciously made these steps so that you don't Don't pick

an idea which is not which is not the right one. So identifying the opportunity what is the possible solution direction what's the impact and what your road map will and there you

have an opportunity canvas which the user has co-created along with AI now you go on to the next step and this is important now all this is fine you can you comfortable the business team could

be comfortable in opportunity canvas but can can now the business with the help of AI drive the overall design process. So what you'll see is that you can brainstorm with AI and actually give a

direction of what that design should be and this is what AI has generated. It's kind of broken down that whole opportunity into a set of different agents that can go in because as we

covered in the previous session a lot of attent focus is on moving to agent. So can we look at building what that agentic solution would look like is what you're going to see here. It's not done

the coding yet but what it has done is broken up that entire opportunity into a series of agents which can address this need and we'll just you can try you will get a chance to try this so I won't go

into the detail but here it's come up with four agents it's organized and and as a business team they can actually go and say you know I want these kind of checks and balances I want to do it this

way and now you see the difference right earlier it was all left to the engineering team to actually build the solution. But now we we're passing the power back to the business to drive all

this. Now going forward what is the next important step is to validate what this um uh opportunity looks like from an experience. So you go to you use a simple wipe coding tool. We

have here used uh both lovable and Google AI studio. This tool generates the prompt. you copy the prompt and then you actually can see it um through a visual experience.

So it's as simple as putting it and if you see the prompt it's all English and you know when you get into your W session you'll see that you can actually edit some of it and see what that

experience looks like. So this will take how much time? Maybe a minute or so. Do you have something? Do you have something that you've already pre-built? Yeah. So, this is something

that that came out of the tool. A very very nice experience which shows what the portfolio summary should look like, what are the stocks etc. So, it kind of understood the opportunity and

translated that and you can play around with it and tweak it to the experience. This step becomes very important because what earlier took two to three weeks of building a UX prototype as the end of a

design phase actually got converted to minutes and this something you take to your to these stakeholders validate it and you're ready with what is that real uh uh challenge you want to address

what's the real opportunity comes out so quickly now we can't stop with just a UX prototype because that just gives you an experience you need to actually engineer some of the uh backend capability and

there are low codeore platforms that are available. So in today's V session we will show you that as well and one of the uh examples that we have shown here is a solution called N10. It's a low

code platform building. It's not that we are saying this is the right tool you as per your enterprise decision you could have different option but this really helps in our view to ideulate and

understand or discuss with your engineering teams you know how your design should be it easily you can easily visualize what are the models being used here how have I thought

through all the guard rails have I bit my built my business evaluations all of this can be verified in one And then from this the code get can get generated and you'll have a working end

to end solution. So this is the process we followed for quickly prototyping and the demo that you saw was an example of something that was built uh using this uh this approach. So what we'd like to

do now is you know shift the back to you and see if you'd like to try this. I mean some of you could uh you know we have laptops configured with uh your with user ids. We have all the tools

available. It's an opportunity for you to try out and we have mentors. We have mentors available for each table. A lot of our uh teams here to support you and we really encourage you to try and uh we

can guide you here as you go along explore. Yeah. Okay. So to let me just walk you through what you would do. Okay. So, all of your laptops will have a handbook already

preloaded which talks about uh the use case that you would be picking up. Okay. So, and um that that is in green. It's tagged as challenge. So, that's the use case that you will uh start with. And

you have different phases and you have resources for each of the phase. So feel free to go through this handbook, take it step by step and we'll help you with it in your workspace five.

So yeah, so log to your workspace based on the number that's on your table. So when you start it would be the discovery and design and yeah you can start the solution with

The resource present Okay. Notice. This is the floor that makes Okay. So, just a quick time check. We just have five minutes. So, if you have

want some help on any particular section, just raise your hand. We'll come and help. But I'm so happy to see many of you have generated very nice UX prototypes. And uh you can also move

into that uh build phase if that's an optional one. But try it out. We'll have mentors to support you. I think it's actually optional because opport

Foreign speech. Foreign speech. other side. So I think we'll just uh conclude. Yeah. Uh so so far we we spoke about uh

I only covered I'll hand it over to him but what you did essentially comes as step one you actually did and I'm so happy that many of you got challenge completed and and you saw your uh your

code getting converted and I see a lot of happy faces because it it was I heard words like amazing I can do the same thing for my in my with my tools so very happy to hear all that. So what we did

was the first step proof of value. We've tried to establish is this is something a problem worth solving for my organization and you may have an answer at the end. You have an answer at the

end of stage but the journey to take it to production is a is involves something called rapid building. What you've built is a foundation which you can add on more functionality and then create it

into a full-fledged solution. And that's where we call the rapid build which is about engineering the full-fledged solution before you go to production. And then finally the scale and when you

look at scale and someone asked me that question you have to build a lot of AI foundation capability the control plane lot of things need to go in and that's important if you want to bring that

scale. I'll just hand it over to Uni to close. &gt;&gt; I think thank you thank you for being a real sport out there. I think all of you joining in uh being through the VIP

session as well. Great to see all of you continuing out there. Uh once again, thanks for uh being participating. I think this is one important thing that we believe AI would make a difference in

the the ability to quickly translate an idea to prototype. Not to say that that prototype is what you would eventually scale to production, but that gives you the feel of what can be done and then

you naturally scale it into production in a very calibrated way. But again, thanks for your time and then being part of it. feel free to reach out. Uh some of these I'm assuming uh would have been

captured in your email etc. So it's available for you to do some prompting and wiping back home as well. Uh if you're adventurous and wanting to extend the focus. Thank you once again and uh

have a good rest of the day.
