## 📝 Summary

MDB financing can play a critical role in covering the substantial upfront and ongoing costs of deploying AI for social good (AISG) to achieve the SDGs. However, sustainable and large-scale deployment will require coordinated multisectoral action and support from concessional funders. Additionally, MDBs must adapt their traditional transaction processes to better align with the fast pace of AI innovation and the rapidly evolving needs of social sectors.
