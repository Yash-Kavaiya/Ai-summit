## 📝 Summary

MDB financing can play a critical role in covering the substantial upfront and ongoing costs of deploying AI for social good (AISG) to achieve the SDGs. However, sustainable and large-scale deployment will require coordinated multisectoral action and support from concessional funders. Additionally, MDBs must adapt their traditional transaction processes to better align with the fast pace of AI innovation and the rapidly evolving needs of social sectors.

## 📝 Transcript

We'll just a couple of minutes. uh the photographer is here. If all the speakers could just uh get up for a small photo before we start the session. Yeah. All

Okay, great. I'll hand it over to the moderator now to take over the session. Thank you so much. Uh very good morning everyone. Um this is an interesting uh session to start

day two with. Uh we are joined today with some of the the leading folks from AI sector in the MDB space or the the multilateral development banking space as well as use case leaders like uh XEP

to talk about what it's going to take to mobilize funding and resources from the multiral development banks for the scaling of AI use cases for social good and for economic growth.

So this is a particularly important domain and it's an area which we at the Gates Foundation have been looking at fairly closely for the last few years that we've been investing in AI

solutions. Uh it's been it's been interesting to see the curve uh in terms of the aspirations in what AI can do for uh populations that we care about and as we are now going past the pilot stage um

and getting to the validation stage of some of these use cases that we think will move the needle on key domains like healthcare, education, and agriculture. As those numbers and those validations

start to come out, we're going to start seeing an increasing demand to scale these solutions up to population levels across states across countries. And as that happens, it will need resources. Uh

it will need both capital expenditure as well as operational expenditure uh to run those. And that will have to be informed by good returns on investment. Uh it'll have to be informed by good

public finance practices which allow governments to make the right choices. Um and all of this is a evolving domain particularly given that AI has been very rapidly evolving itself as a technology

and so we we really glad to have this opportunity to speak with uh with this very est distinguished group about this particular topic. I'll take a moment to to introduce uh my panelists here today.

We have uh Shankar Maruada from the Except Foundation. uh Shankar in at least in India needs no introduction as uh somebody who's been part of the core movement around DPI and uh and digital

in India along with uh with the entire Astep ecosystem uh that's been very foundational to building these things. I have uh Mahesh Tamchandani from the World Bank who's the regional practice

director for digital and AI. Uh and Mahesh is is is also himself a digital leader and will will help us elaborate a little bit on what sort of uh maturity needs to come into the system for it to

uh for it to be truly impactful. I have uh sorry I'm missing my order here. I have Dr. Jay Ganesian from uh the the Hana Arjun SPV Hana's premier uh mission around using AI for their developmental

needs. I have Antonio Zabalos from the ADB uh and then I have Jia from the AIIB. I'm going to start jumping into the panel uh right away and start getting into questions uh with the

panelists. Uh a moment to get my notes here. So, um, I'm going to start with the with my MBB guests here first. Um, so Mahesh, maybe we'll we'll put you in the hot

spot to start with. what do you see as the opportunity for MDB financing and is it an area where you're seeing demand already from developing countries or uh you know what what are you seeing

in the space in terms of demand and what do you see as the opportunity for MDBs in this space? &gt;&gt; Yeah, thank thanks very much and and first of all thanks very much for

inviting me today. It's a privilege to be here um at this event in Delhi. I I guess just to reflect for a second, I'm thinking back to November 2022 when certainly at least in in the World Bank,

we were sitting around a table and everybody sharing their immediate reactions to the launch of ChachiPT, right? And at the time, this felt uh it did feel important, but it felt like an

incremental change in how technology might be applied to development. And we went very quickly from there to a discussion around how AI might be used to leapfrog certain development

challenges, right? And I think that's still a valid point. But the technology has gone very very quickly from being a kind of um nice to have in the development context to absolutely

mission critical. And I think in some ways although it presents a huge opportunity and and that's what I think we'll spend most of the time talking about today it presents a huge risk in

terms of exacerbating the digital divide. Right? So we went very quickly from wow this is something shiny and new and interesting but probably marginal to this is absolutely missionritical to to

delivering development and we see that kind of bear out in some of the numbers. Um I think uh low-income countries account for only 1% of CHPT subscriptions. Um and I think we're

looking at South Asia as being uh you know Gen AI traffic in South Asia is only about 20% the level of it is in emerging market countries. So when we as MDBs think about sorry 20% of what it is

in high income countries when we as MDBs think about how we are going to help finance this transition I think we have to start to think differently about how we do business right and the onus is on

us to do that. So financing AI transformation is not like traditional infrastructure financing. Um that's certainly not going to be sufficient. If we think about what's required for the

AI transition, there going to be a lot of high upfront costs, returning operational expenditures, and the tale of the benefits is going to be diffuse and long-term, right? So we can't look

at this in a traditional kind of four-year project cycle. I'm going to finance this bridge, build this bridge and then more traffic will flow. And I think we then start to think about what

are all the blended finance and other instrument tools we have at our disposal. Right? So combining concessional funds, grants, trust funds, uh guarantees, mobilizing private

capital, which is a huge point that I want to come back to in a second. Um and of course concessional and philanthropic uh funding to absorb some of the early risk while the MDB lending and

guarantees can be leveraged to crowd in private capital um and private solutions kind of nationally and regionally. We think a lot also about our advisory work. So in India in both Hana and

Talangana we are working in an advisory capacity with governments to help implement uh AI sandboxes and these are going to be environments in which solutions can be tested verified achieve

proof of concept and then move to scale and that's increasingly how we are thinking about development solutions which is how do we go from kind of retail solutions to wholesale and I

think sandboxes are going to be one element in thinking through how we test and do that. But every dollar of MDB capital that is invested has to be invested with the thinking of how it's

going to mobilize private capital, right? Um we are going to be at our best and and I think Antonio will agree with me a drop in the ocean of what is needed from an investment perspective. So where

can public funding be used to either unlock or mobilize private capital? And that's I think a lot of what we think about. So I mean I'll give you one small example of of regulatory reform we did

in the Philippines where uh we helped the government institute a common tower framework which then paved the way for more foreign investment in the sector u because it sort of you know simplified

the infrastructure investment and made it a lot more sense for private investors to to come in. So these are the kinds of things we have to think about where we're not just deploying our

capital, we're deploying our our kind of knowledge solutions. Um the other thing I think we need to think about is in many cases AI is at the tail end of a long value chain of of technology

investment, right? And AI solutions are not going to sort of appear out of nowhere. They're going to come from investments in digital infrastructure, computing resources, training data sets,

and talent. This is all going to be indispensable ingredients to to to us doing this. Last couple of things I want to say. Um, we as MDBs have to get more efficient and one of the things I'm most

proud of is we've recently entered into a partnership with with our friends at the Asian Development Bank under what we call the full mutual reliance framework, which is a very uh convoluted way of

saying that when countries want to borrow uh from us, they can rely on one institution's paperwork, due diligence, safeguards, and so on and both institutions can can uh then support the

investment. So in [clears throat] Nepal for example we are partnering with ADB on the first ever digital investment that will fall under this f full mutual reliance framework. It's a way of

lowering transaction cost. It's a way of getting us to move more quickly which I think is critical um and a way for us to kind of ask ourselves how can we be leaner and more efficient. Last point I

promise is we are thinking a lot at the World Bank about small AI right there's a lot of conversations around large language models India is I think uniquely placed amongst emerging markets

to to be in that space but there's a lot of need for smaller targeted potentially offline use cases for the use of AI where um these have to be deployed to end users at scale in what I would call

low tech environments. So if you think about AI solutions that are uh applying predictive technology to weather to help farmers in the field make better sense of planting crops, right? AI solutions

that are being used for diagnostics in the health sector in regions that have traditionally been unserved or underserved by health services because they are very far a field um and and

very far from kind of the core source of of uh delivery of health services. So these are the kinds of things that I think we have to work in parallel on as MDBs um helping invest in infrastructure

helping through through how to mobilize capital but also deploying small AI solutions at scale to actually reach end users very quickly because this is a now issue not a tomorrow issue. Thanks.

&gt;&gt; Thanks Mah. You said a lot of things that made my day. Small AI u shared practices to lower costs. These are these are all things that we understand really well here. uh and many of these

are things that we've implemented in in the digital space um in in good ways. The India mission is great example of of some of these uh sort of attempts to lower sort of ecosystem costs by doing

shared practices uh using each other's knowledges sort of what you've learned and what you've validated for for yourself. How does somebody else use that? So so maybe I'll turn it over to

Antonio. Do you would you would you want to respond to that Antonio? Is this something um beyond the collaboration that you have with with the World Bank uh also a little bit more about that and

then beyond that is this something that you see um what how do you see the value chain of AI and digital evolving over the next few years and how do you see the role of MDBs uh in that and and what

opportunities do you see for ADB &gt;&gt; I think now is working so thank you very much for for the invitation to be here and uh also for for the question. Um let let me just reflect a little bit on on

the question on on what is the particular role of the NDVS in the way forward on AI. Um you know I joined the Asian Development

Bank one year and a half ago and uh the word the two words that I have listened the most in these uh 18 months h have been artificial intelligence and uh every time that I'm listening the

word h I have mixed feelings I have to say mixed feelings in the sense that I don't know if uh people really understand what what AI really means and stands for and second if people really h

is ready to uh take the h the chance and the challenge that is going to represent. So the way we see h and this is basically the the result of you know in

this 18 months and my team can can tell I think that we have been traveling probably more than 20 countries all of them are super interested on data centers but the truth is that for a data

center to properly work h you you will need you know the energy you will need the human capital, you will need h eventually h the connectivity and more importantly you are going to need the

demand. So I think that we are entering into a loop where countries just want to have a data center just because the neighboring country also has a data center and on top of everything the

countries just want to have a bigger data center than the neighbor. Erh but the truth thing is that when this is happening at the end of the day there are some tensions in terms of the energy

power grid that also needs to be included in the in the discussion. So AI is not just AI. AI is many different infrastructure that needs to come together and behind there's a business

plan that most of the time we are not talking about. So we are talking about investments in terms of billions of dollars and at the end of the day the role of the NDVS you know is follow the

demand that is coming from the countries. So we are just working uh demanddriven and uh we also need to keep in mind that uh behind all those investment there

should be some cost benefit analysis that estimates what is the impact associated to that investment because at the end of the day this is taxpayer and it's something that eventually we need

to be co-responsible with you know so the way I see this in the future is that there will be a crazy amount of investment where sovereign and non-s sovereign is going to come together and

this is something that we actually are doing at the ADV. Second, I see h more and more uh importance in terms of cost benefit analysis and impact assessment on the investment that is being done.

And third also in terms of a a you know center for AI and creation of human capital because at the end of the day it's not just one country issue is also a you know a regional cooperation and

integration that needs to come together to make that investment more feasible and more sustainable. you know h as part of that role the fmrf the future I mean the mutual framework reliance agreement

that we have with the world bank is definitely contributing to that as mahers is mentioning we have a success story already in the case of Nepal but we expect to replicate in Canada

countries around Asia Pacific because at the end of the day you know I think that this is a a role uh for all the MDVS and the size of the investment and the size of the impact is expected to be so huge

that only I mean we are more powerful when we are together when we are separated. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you Antonio. You've now brought this to a little bit of a more

practical and tangible set of considerations and things like how is there good costbenefit analysis? Has this been given enough thought in terms of is it going to add value? So maybe

I'll turn it over to Jay. J do you feel like MDBs today and firstly would you'd like to respond to any of what Mahesh or or Antonio said and then the specific question I had from you was do you feel

like MDBs today have the right instruments um to sort of support this sort of thinking for governments to scale up AI use cases do you feel like that's

already mature is it mature where do you see that &gt;&gt; thank you very much and thank [clears throat] you for having me um uh I think uh as MDBs we have been

financing digital infrastructure for years and uh AI is a subset of dig infrastructure. So what changes? I think we have to see AI as its systemic nature that it is um AI for public services uh

needs interconnected uh hard infrastructure, recurring operational capacity and trust based governance. Um operational hard infrastructure we've been uh supporting for years. Uh but to

unlock the true digital uh potential of digital infrastructure, I think we need AI to take a much larger role. Now I think uh MDBs have been uh doing a lot. Uh we have uh a toolkit that has been

supporting um digital infrastructure for years. Um I think uh but there are there are a couple of uh shifts that are that are needed. So beyond the interconnectedness of hard

infrastructure uh the stressbased governance we also need to see uh the skills that are needed to uh to deliver uh AI uh and the governance that is needed and also the uh the spillovers to

other sectors as both of the colleagues mentioned energy systems water uh urban and industrial real estate. So all of this has uh much much larger overlap and integration with with what AI needs

today. But uh focusing on what shifts our needs maybe uh a couple of couple of points there. First is um shifting from siloed projects to uh platformcentric financing. I think uh we need not

support or maybe it would be better to not support fragmented uh standalone projects but rather go on a on a platformcentric approach. Uh we've done this in uh digital fiber infrastructure.

We've uh bankrolled uh thousands of kilometers of optic fiber. similar kind of things can be done in AI and that would just help uh uh you know reinforce its cross- sectoral nature because then

you can use the same infrastructure across across uh sectors. It is much more efficient uh and it is much more uh useful uh for our our beneficiaries. The second is programmatic approach um or or

the results focused approach uh that is that that can be helpful. uh from programmatic approach I think uh uh AI's long-term viability depends on having uh some recurring cost available um

maintenance up workforce upskilling uh skills in place governance etc. So the traditional capex lending model may not be a specific uh uh an apt fit in this uh scenario. But then if we have a

programmatic approach we can uh deploy results based financing or or a host of instruments that uh MDBs have then we can um we can u you know uh take AI to to from demonstration to scale in a much

more efficient manner and case in point we've done this uh in other sectors for example in water sector cutting down water uh cutting down the losses removing inefficiencies scaling u

scaling manpower uh putting in regulations etc. So I think uh the existing u you know uh template exists so we can just replicate that and lastly um very much uh uh echoing what Mahesh

mentioned on private capital mobilization and the blending of various uh uh sources of funding. So I think uh there are uh there needs to be a sequential risk sharing among

philanthropies or concessional funders MDBs and private sector financing. private sector financing comes in uh needs to comes in I mean that's that's a that's a foregone conclusion but to

enable private sector to come in and remember they need a bankable uh bankable model to come in so therefore the early risks need to be taken with much more concessional money that can

that can risk that can go ahead prove some of the concepts and then they they can be scaled with long-term MDB financing um that can come in long term that can support uh among other things

as MDBs do uh the governance the safeguards the uh you know the policy side of things. So I think uh the the shift is in uh narrative in in in how systemically we perceive it. Uh this is

about shared infrastructure, service capacity and governance. Um and just uh to make a point I think at AIBR our uh strategic priorities squarely align with what AI needs. So we focus on green

infrastructure, technology enabled infrastructure, connectivity, private capital mobilization. I think those are all the points that our colleagues mentioned. So I think uh those are the

points that are needed. MDBs are definitely uh have a unique role as conveners and de-riskers and system builders. So I think uh we are in a good place but then we need to shift this uh

uh you know the viewpoint and and place ourselves better to support uh AI. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much J. Um, so the clock's kind of showing up in my face. So I'm

going to uh do a little bit of a script jump and and compress stuff because knowing Shanka, I know he'll he'll handle that. Uh, but Shanka, firstly, do you feel like one, are we ready for

scale? Are we is there enough evidence in the ecosystem that you feel governments will have what they need to make the decisions that scale can happen? That's probably just a yes no

for the most part. But then you're you've been part of this ecosystem of building blocks, platforms, networks, and then the sustainability of it for now years and we've all learned from

from that experience. How how would you respond to some of the discussions that we've had here? There's been talk about shared knowledge, shared infrastructure, templates, building

blocks. What a little bit of your point of view on this having seen this played out over a few cycles would be great to hear. We'll start with do you feel like there's enough maturity in the ecosystem

to now start hitting scale? &gt;&gt; I think 2026 is the year that we'll hit maturity. I'll give few examples. 3rd February Ethiopia launches its Ethiopia open agreeet

advisory for farmers on AI. 11th February, Amul the world's largest milk cooperative launches its AI advisory for milk farmers. Today as we speak, India is launching Bharat Vista, the

government of India's advisory on uh in Jaipur with actual farmers. Within two weeks, federal, state, crosscontinental, what is common to all of these? They all

learned from a 9month intensive trial and error experience that Maharashtra went through when they launched their Mahavistar back in May and that was rolled out starting November

in AI. Know as Mah said we all remember the 30th November 2022 charge GPT moment but from the initial demos the initial magic the initial pilots to production there's been a big chasm

today an organization needs to have a whole bunch of resources financial technological data to be able to use AI. If this persists, we are further going to be exasperating the digital divide.

The halves will get more. The have nots will fall worth behind. Why this year is important is what this has shown and by the way all of this that what happened what is uh what

happened is we compressed the adoption time the learning curve from 9 months to 6 months to 3 months to 3 weeks. This is not a step Gates Foundation, World Bank, private sector players, India AI

mission, Bhashini, Academia like Triple IT Bangalore, IIT Madras because everyone knows one piece of the puzzle. It is the adopter who takes the institutional risk in putting everything

together and is their reputation on the line. If the farmer gets wrong advice from AI, the farmer is not going to say, "Hey, I I know the algorithm was wrong." They're going to get after the

institution they trusted which let them down. Now, that's a huge risk. Are there ways we can reduce the compress the learning time, the learning cost and the learning risk? This year is going to be

that year where operational models of various types will come out that give adopters confidence that the path from pilot to production has been hacked by someone before and so they are following

a welltrodden path or at least a clear path. As Astep Foundation along with Gates and several others, we are talking starting with this summit that as a civilization

as humanity we need 100 such diffusion pathways by 2030 across sectors, countries, continents. Each pathway is uh shows an adopter the journey they have

to take but they choose the pathway. You start with proprietary models and maybe you switch to open. You start with uh your data centers or somebody else's the flexibility autonomy choice has to be

that of the adopter. All we are doing as a collaborative is coming together bringing the best of knowledge creating impact on the ground. So these diffusion pathways are pathways to impact. It is

the adopter who decides where am I going but the journey is always that of the adopter. And what my fellow panelists said, whatever we do is a drop in the ocean, this is a marathon that we are

running to achieve impact, not a sprint. Unfortunately, it's a series of sprints. So you run a sprint, celebrate success that gets more people, more motivation, more capacity, and then it goes on.

Ultimately, the financing model has to be sustainable whether it's inclusion and therefore government and the costs are relatively much lower than any alternative as we seeing in Maharashtra,

Amul etc. or by private sector when they bring in the risk capital to earn the rewards. So how do you operationalize from pilot to production and our bet which 2026 will be pivotal is create

those that infrastructure so that everybody is not hacking their own path at the same time you're not wedded to the path you are wedded to your destination. The choice of paths

allow you to switch when you are ready, when you have more capability. You can change tracks, come back. Uh that the last two weeks have shown us this is possible. This year will show the world

that this is possible. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you. This is it's it's an exciting year and and I'm I'm more optimistic this year about AI scaling than I was last year, but I'm not sure

yet whether that's just something that happens every year. So, so we'll we'll we'll we'll know at the end of the year where we got to. Uh but but I'll I'll I'll also jump script again a little bit

and I want to give uh Dr. Ganeshan a chance to to respond to some of what's been said so far. Uh Dr. Ganesh, you're leading Arjun SPV and Hana has very clear AI aspirations to use and uh and

apply. uh so you would you know as an adopter from what you're hearing from uh folks like us at the gates foundation folks like on you know architectural thinking and the MDBs on how how you

know scale might might work out and what their role is uh would be great to to hear your point of view on on as a as an adopter what what do you feel that the ecosystem can do additionally to to make

that decision-m process a lot more easy and a lot more uh rigorous &gt;&gt; uh good morning everyone thank you so so much. Uh so some of the points have already been touched on uh especially

with respect to the challenges that the government uh experiences by my fellow panelist. I'll just put some of them in uh perspective so that it is uh clear. The first issue that the governments

face with respect to the AI projects is the uh sustainability beyond the project period which was uh touched by the fellow panelist also. So uh what happens when uh the project period completes?

How how are we going to sustain uh where is the money going to come from is uh basic issue. You know over time the you know this uh the the the data uh sets are going to increase. You know you need

more compute capacity and financing for such things have to be uh factored in. The second issue that normally comes up is the you know the cross department value and the single uh department

financing. For example, in the AI project that Hariana is uh doing it the project cuts across multiple departments. So we are looking for building use cases across multiple

departments but the financing has to lend has to land at one single point right. So where does it land? How do we you know take it across the departments is a challenge that we continuously uh

face. The third was always already touched by Mahesh to a certain extent is the timing and the uh flexibility uh which is required while financing the AI projects. The cross uh the thing between

ADB and World Bank that was touched upon which which I will actually help in it. the uh because since we do not have the structural uh flexibility uh the experience with the World Bank and the

other project is that it takes a lot of time they have their stringent processes in place and to get the financing takes up uh takes up time. So the the apprehension is once uh you know the

project gets matured and the finance starts following the requirements might change. So this is one challenge that we always uh have and uh the other issue with respect to

So that is a great idea. &gt;&gt; So that is always a great idea because u what happens is that in in in the government sectors we we spend money we start uh you know uh scale scaling it up

but then it ends up in no results. So it is always better that we test and then we uh scale up these uh issues. The one more issue that we face is how do we measure impact when it comes to AI

projects. So when uh it is traditional infrastructure projects, we put up a bridge, we put up you know build power plants and the impact is there to see. But then in case of AI projects, how do

we measure impact? So the financing bodies must also give us certain framework by which we can show to the public and to the government that these are the impact that we have created uh

because of this particular project. And one last thing is uh the institutional capacity that the governments lack while uh you know uh working on the projects. So we cannot depend upon consultants for

a long time. We need to create capacity and the must. So to sum it up is the sustainability and the cost

and the timing and that comes up and uh thank you so much sir. this is uh this is very useful and uh and I'll now sort of it it also I guess puts the rest

of the panelists in a little bit of spot to respond to some of that but uh but but Antonio maybe I'll I'll I'll call on you next uh you know based on what what uh Dr. Ganeshan just said, do you feel

like the MDBs are well equipped internally uh in terms of skills and and uh processes to provide some of this support in uh in terms of you know thinking through sovereign financing in

in solutions? Uh do you feel like MDBs are there with with some of that skill set already existing? &gt;&gt; Let let me try to be a little bit provocative here. NDVS are a mirror in

most of the cases of what we have in in many countries in the region. So you cannot expect the MDVS to be a Silicon Valley and all of a sudden have a a huge labor force already trained and with all

the capabilities related to AI. We are facilitators. We are enablers. We are funders. I mean uh financiers. We are eventually institutions that are working together

hand in hand with the countries uh to make sure that $1 invested eventually is having a soio economic return in various sectors of the economy. So I cannot deny that uh we are adjusting

as we move forward. Meaning that for instance for the Asian Development Bank we have a number of priorities that could be comprising three. One is precisely private sector development

because we believe that private sector is going to be one of the key drivers in such a era where investment is taking place. Second, regional cooperation and integration precisely because the

countries needs to get economies of a scales coming from a network economy and and you know when we are talking about all the things that we are discussing today

we are talking about a network economy same as energy telecom you know the more is the traffic the more is the data that is passing through the lower is going to be the unitary cost associated to to

this particular investment and third which is the glue of the other two is digital transformation. So we are precisely getting traction internally both across the

sectors and also at the h you know even at the at the board of directors where there are particularly h working groups related to digital transformation that are supporting uh the bank in terms of

human and financial resources. H but you know we are getting there as the demand as I was mentioning before is increasing. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you and Mahesh.

&gt;&gt; Yeah, please go for it. &gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely. Please. Yeah, you're you're you're anywhere next on my my go for it. &gt;&gt; No, look, I I I agree with everything

Antonio said. I mean look in the World Bank in 2024 I think we deployed about 1.7 billion uh in in digital infrastructure investments I think our total portfolio stands at around 7

billion which is both a very big number and in some ways a very small number right it's indicative I think of how we can scale up in this space which we've been doing uh but also indicative of how

much more work that needs to be done and we have rightly focused on financing in this conversation but I think you know I don't want to trivialize the convening power that MDBs have, right? Um, one of

the things we're working on together with the ADB and with other MDBs is a AI use case repository that'll be launched very soon that will curate um both large and principally small AI examples uh of

how you know this is being deployed in real life examples. What are the conditions that are required? What's the technology that's required? What can people learn from this? I think this is

really important. Another thing that we're doing at the World Bank is the government of Korea has asked us to set up a digital knowledge center in Seoul um through which we will help share and

export the Korean experience which I think is one of uh a handful of really incredible emerging market to advanced economy kind of transitions and how digital transformation is in many ways

propelled this transition. And so we'll be exporting that experience um you know using this knowledge center as a kind of lighthouse to share that. So I I think we bring something to the table that

goes beyond our financing. Financing will be critical but sharing that knowledge is super important &gt;&gt; and and you you really touched upon the one thing that I wanted to to dive in a

little bit more into. So, so do you feel like u and I'll I'll pass this on right after you to Jay as well, but do you feel like structures like the the repository can actually um I mean what

what needs to happen for these structures to be really functional for for the purpose to be met that you have in mind? &gt;&gt; Well, I think first and foremost, I mean

it's fairly simple. They have to be curated properly and updated frequently, right? um you know what is it uh we say we we need to share

efficiently and steal ruthlessly right and and we need to enable that um that for others to do so that that's a basic kind of knowledge function that we need to serve really well but I think that a

point that Jay made also that I think is very important is is this concept of platforms is is very important and one of the things again that as MDBs we can do because we are having conversations

across government with multiple sectors. In some cases, those conversations are are um happening less frequently between the sectors within government themselves. And one of the things we

have learned, I think, is that individual siloed sector specific solutions do not achieve scale. They do not have the network effects that shared solutions do. So the more we can do to

bring these conversations together across health and education and finance all of the so-called use cases that we talk about that are going to have their own shared technological platform and

their own network effects that's again I think value ad we bring to the table. &gt;&gt; Thank you. And um and J that question moving to you is really how do you think MDBs can coordinate better um in in what

what Mahes and I'll I'll ask you to repeat that share ruthlessly uh &gt;&gt; share efficiently steal &gt;&gt; share efficiently steal ruthlessly lovely so so how on that front how do

you feel um MDBs can do better in terms of coordination &gt;&gt; thank you I think uh [clears throat] first of all on uh how our clients actually work and uh to Mahesh's point I

think often things work in silos so uh often uh one line ministry or department is not talking to another and then they are duplicating things and whereas AI works on cross- sectoral uh things um so

we as MDBs can work collaborate closely and avoid fragmentation I think that's one of the important things uh to ensure that pilots move to scale um the good thing is that the at system level things

are happening uh all the MDBs on this are actually working together. I think uh AIB has co-inanced and leveraging uh relying on the crow financing frameworks of World Bank and ADB a lot of projects.

So that is already happening. In 2024, heads of MDBs, 10 MDBs came together and said we will work more as a system. I think those are good starting points and I think that's exactly what AI needs.

But I think to scale AI two things could happen much more uh in a in a detailed manner. One is uh to build on common stacks and avoiding fragmentation. So digital public infrastructure I think

those are important rails on which a lot of things get built. So uh we need to strengthen by working together. Um the second is standardizing project preparation cost templates result

outcomes monitors uh indicators so that we don't duplicate things. Um there are a lot of things that are still emerging the cost models or how you evaluate things or returns and um things like

that. So I think MDBs can collaborate on uh these costing templates which can improve both access which is um how you process projects and uh uh fund projects and also quality of how you have uh

prepared a project how well a project is prepared. So I think uh uh this division of labor some of the MDBs may be expert in one thing and the others in another. So I think that division of labor would

also go in hand in hand uh uh on this uh aspect. uh so whatever one is expert at could take up and lead on that and the other could take up on uh uh others. So I think u all in all uh there are

foundations for collaboration much uh you know well well settled but we just need to build on them and I think going forward we can have discussion on uh you know what projects to finance rather

than how to work closely together. Thank &gt;&gt; Thank you. evaluated once you figure out an architecture for how you can swap in swap out models continuously improve

data. This need not be restricted to any one sector which is the scale thing also to any one area which is the pilot thing. As we think of these what we call as horizontals investing to create

reusable ingredients which can be put together by the adopter who's scaling it in ways that minimize risk and maximize impact. It's also efficient. So phil

philanthropies play a very important catalytic role. This is what we are learning. It is I'll give you a simple analogy to drive home the point. Somebody climbed

Mount Everest in 1950s. If he comes back and says I'm not sharing anything, right? You guys figure it out. Somebody went and created base camp infrastructure. Camp 1, camp 2,

camp 3. Imagine if they just packed up their tents and you know went off. Philanthropy can work with the early adopters to create those base camps and milestones so that the next adopter

across sectors across countries across continents finds it easier. that we believe is the only way that we can guide AI towards equity rather than towards concentration and and

philanthropy plays a very important co-creation and collaborative role with MDVs with private sector with academia uh with not forprofits and with a whole bunch of ecosystem partners but

everybody should have their eye on the summit which in this case is impact to the farmer to the teacher to the learner. If you don't have that, if you're looking at our what our expertise

is, it'll soon result in squables rather than there's only one summit, one goal and that is improving the lives of the uh people we all have come here to serve.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. And u I'll just say that this has been one of the more stimulating discussions I've had on AI resourcing. uh it's it's rare to find people who who know this space and who have opinions on

it which uh which are nuanced and and and mature. So, so thank you so much for for taking out the time and all of you for being here u and and sharing your points of view with us and we really

hope that structures like the the uh AI commons uh and some of the outcomes that come out from this summit will become the the sort of substrate on which we can all collaborate and build um sort of

robust pathways to to get AI to to scale um impactfully and uh and and appropriately. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Sorry, before uh the speakers head off,

we would like to have some souvenirs from the India mission uh be given to them. Rich, please go ahead.
