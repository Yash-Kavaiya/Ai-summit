## 📝 Transcript

Okay. Uh, may I request for a group photograph first? Uh, for the dignies. Thank you. So uh we start with the session. Uh good evening distinguished guests, esteemed panelists and

participants. On behalf of Vicki, it's my privilege to warmly welcome you to this important session from policy to harvest leveraging generative AI for datadriven agriculture transformation.

being organized as part of the AI summit 2026. Indian agriculture stands at a pivotal juncture as we work towards enhancing farmer incomes, strengthening climate resilience and ensuring food and

nutritional security for a growing population. The emphasis must increasingly move beyond policy intent to implementation excellence and measurable impact on the ground. In this

transformation journey, digital innovation, particularly generative AI offers unprecedented possibilities. From precision farming and predictive crop analytics to climate risk modeling,

personalized advisories and smarter supply chains, AI has the potential to reshape agriculture into a more datadriven, efficient and farmercentric ecosystem.

The key question before us today is how we can responsibly and effectively integrate these technologies within India's evolving digital agriculture architecture to create scalable and

inclusive outcomes. We are deeply honored to have with us Shri Sanjay Kumar Agarwal joint secretary department of agriculture and farmer welfare government of India whose

guidance and leadership have significantly contributed to advancing digital reforms and innovation in the agriculture sector. We are also privileged to be joined by

eminent panel representing government global institution industry technology and agi entrepreneurship. Mr. Simon Torson Vibush chairman Fiki committee on crop protection and co be

bare crop science limited and country division head crop science division of beer for India Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. Miss Elizabeth for representative and country director world food program

India Dr. Alogbi Mukhajji director research analytics and modeling leads connect service private limited and chief system scientist AI programs BL Agro Industries Limited Mr. Anan Chandra

co-founder executive director Arya EG Mr. Malik Bansali chief executive officer Nete software to share this important dialogue we have with us Mr.

Matur chairman Fiki task force on agricult agri startups and venture partner bhart innovation fund who will be moderating the session. With these words I once again extend a warm welcome

to all the distinguished speakers and participants and I now request Shri Sanjay Kumar Aaral to kindly deliver the special address. Thereafter Mr. Mahendra Matur will take the decision discussion

forward. Thank you very much. Uh good evening everyone. First of all, I would like to thank Ficki for organizing this seminar for discussing a very important topic

agriculture and AI. When we are thinking AI, how can we forget agriculture transformation through AI? Earlier whenever we used to think about

agriculture, the image in our mind comes with a poor farmer. using the old technology, using the hal and bale. But now things

are changing. Now we have educated farmers, we have progressive farmers and farmers who are using technology as an essential tools for agriculture

and AI is moving towards agriculture sector. Today government of India has launched Bhat Vistar

a AIdriven module to enrich every farmer to reach every farmer because without farmers if technologies are not reaching to the farmer it is

very difficult to increase the production it is very difficult increase the quality. There are many challenges before the agriculture sector

and low use of technology is major challenge before all of us. Farmers are not getting good market. Farmers are not getting good prices. Farmers don't know what is the market demand.

Farmers have any very few knowledge where their demand can get their produce can get better prices. They don't know the right advisory.

They don't know from where the seed will come and where they can sell the produce. There are many questions which are remains unanswered and because of that

farmers are compelled to sell their products at lower prices. They grow what is not needed in the market and ultimately farmers become a matter of concern for everyone.

Now young farmers are coming. The youth role in farmer the young farmers are coming. They are coming with a vision to enrich farming. They are trying. They are using many technology.

They are not satisfied what their father used to grow. They want something new and that technology is making lots of changes.

Earlier they wanted advisory. It was difficult to get advised. Now every mobile is having some chatbot and they are getting advised. Earlier farmers used to have some grievances

where they should go. Now at the click they can lodge their complaint and they get can get the answers. And today what our bhat vistar

chatbot bharti is going to solve many such problems and we are going to use in different languages language is was a major

barrier for all of us our farmers they don't understand many farmers they don't understand Hindi also they want to chat in local dialogue or local dialect and Our chatbot is being used for

different languages and later on we are going to use all the languages of our country. Farmers need is second is they want weather advisories. Weather is uncertain

and again a major challenge for our farmers. Now all types of weather advisories, weather forecast are easily available and accessible. They are more accurate than earlier

because of many AI technologies are being used. The market prices earlier what is market prices it was difficult to know. Now all the mundies all the markets are

integrated with one system. You want market price of Berlin, you want market of price of Chennai at a click you can know. Transportation was a major issue.

Now transportation is there, agriculture mechanization again a challenge before all of us that our farmers are using very less technology and mechanization.

Now young farmers and the progressive farmers are using it extensively and with use of AI they are doing irrigation they are doing use of fertilizer they

are taking use of pesticides and all based on AI now storage cold storage warehousing these are also

these were also problem areas for Now with the help of various private partners, credit, warehousing, logistic is also made accessible to farmers.

Now any farmer wants that he wants to store his food grain. Earlier he used to sell at throwaway prices. Now he can take decision that I am not going to sell it right now. I will keep

it but I need some money. So now financing is also available through technology. So it's a complete ecosystem is coming and that ecosystem is working in such a

way that ultimately farmer will benefit and the consumer will also benefit. Now we have a challenge that our farmers are aging. The average age of farmer is more than

50 years. Young students who are who wants to become some uh to do some career they don't want to come in agriculture sector through AI through technology

we can bring that those talent in agriculture sector also because unless they will come the more progressive farming more remmonative farming more export

oriented farming more diversified farming will not be possible. We want to diversify our sectors. We want to come out from patty and wheat

culture. Many things we are importing. We want to be self-sufficient. We don't know where is the deficit and where the production is. Now through

various decision supporting system in agriculture ministry agri stake we are doing digital crop survey and all these data are coming agree course

and in future this agree course will provide data to everyone. We have a great database and we are accumulating that database and we are creating that database for better use of

AI. Now many AI tools are giving advisories but they don't have sufficient data to support that advisory to validate that advisory.

Now in agriculture sector sector we will not have darth of data in future through PMISAN scheme. We are giving at least around 10 crores of farmer every month some

pension some incentive and that data is coming into our system. If any farmer is having any problem they can go to chatbot and they can ask any question and AI is answering their problems.

Why my installment has not come? Why why my payment is delayed? So just I want to summarize that agriculture sector is not very far from AI

and if you want to develop this sector more we have to use AI extensively and various private partners are helping in this regard we alone can't work and we need support from all

the private stakeholders who are working in this sector and I hope to together we will achieve the aim to make agriculture more vibrant. Thank you very much. Um, thanks Sanjay G for a very

insightful address. Uh, good evening everyone. I know it's the last session of the day. Um, but we'll try to make it interesting. Good to see a full house and especially a lot of young minds

sitting in the room. Um, so very very delighted to be part of this gathering. Thanks Vicki for organizing this uh wonderful session and u the topic that we have today how AI can transform

agriculture sector um and I'm really blessed to have a fantastic set of panelist with representation from policy makers and industry software providers uh and and bunch of

startups. So I think it is going to be very interesting. So before I get into question and answer just couple of minutes to set the context for the panel. U as I always said agriculture is

is heaven for data scientists. Not just because it is a large part of our agree and food economy but also because of the gigabytes and terabytes of data that we generate almost every second from 160

million hectares of farmland and 150 million farms um 14 agroclimatic zones different types of soil 7,000 mundes and you can go on and on so I think we are sitting on a repository of data uh which

is which is quite spectacular And I don't think any of the big AI giants have really scrapped it. You know, they've scrapped what whatever is available on the web. But what about the

data which is lying with in our universities in a weather stations and things like that and and that's where it becomes far more interesting and the volatility of the data and the

variability of data. It can hurt to go up the best of the data scientist you know in terms of how to model such various data points, how to triangulate it and how to make sense out of it. But

yeah, we all believe that it has a huge power. AI has a huge power to solve for challenges that we see in the country in terms of especially farmers access to markets, price,

um soil testing, uh pest detection, u you know buyer discovery and all that. So that's where I think we going to discuss some of the opportunities that are there on the hand

and how do we scale some of these use cases and how industry and policy makers can play a very critical role in enabling use of AI to solve for challenges that we see in the country.

Uh so with that context I'll start the discussion probably Elizabeth if I can start with you that's okay. Okay. So Elizabeth represent world food program that we all are aware of. Uh Elizabeth,

I would like you to talk about how AI can help especially in the post-h harvest value chain. I'm sure most of the audience will be aware that we waste almost onethird of the food that we

produce um both in volume and value terms. Uh and that needs a lot of attention and that's where we need technology. So Elizabeth, if you can share your thoughts on how do we use AI

to make to drive food security to drive nutritional security at scale. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. Can you hear me? &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes, you are. &gt;&gt; Good. Well, thank you Vicki for

organizing this dialogue. Let me first of all I want to just situate this in a broader context. At the World Food Program, we are particularly concerned about um the food crisis that are

currently happening around the world. When we think about AI and technology, we're thinking very much about how can we um how can we use these technologies to uh address global hunger and I just

wanted to share a few overarching figures with you because um it's quite staggering and and I think it's important for our awareness. Um you know global hunger is at an unprecedented

level globally. um 318 million people are facing crisis level um hunger and and it's really uh very much concentrated in a um handful of countries where we see particular um

acute need for example in in in Gaza in parts of Sudan, Afghanistan, Yemen, Haiti um the Sahel, the Horn of Africa and at the World Food Program we have launched a new AI I strategy. We're the

only um the first uh UN agency to have done that so far. And it's very much around how do we use data for predicting um crisis for anal analyzing also where when a disaster hits um you know where

are the hungry poor where what kind of situation they find themselves in. So very much around um around early warning systems um but also for targeting our programs um and finding you know data to

make the right decisions at the right time. That's at the global level um and just to highlight a couple of tools that we have. One is called a hunger map live u and it's it's very much um you know

it's based on satellite data. you can see where people are facing food and nutrition insecurity around the world um in p practically real time and that enables um us and partners and

governments to be able to address that. Um I haven't answered your point about post-h harvest losses in India. The cornerstone of WFP's partnership with the government of India is very much

around strengthening the food um the food systems the the uh the big uh public distribution system that is the largest uh safety net in the world food safety net in the world and of course so

much grain is moved every single day as part of this um public distribution system and world food program has worked on streamlining these um these supply chains. For example, through root

optimiz optimization, optimizing the routes that go from the farmers to the warehouses to the you know 600 um thousand plus fair price shops um so that people can get their entitlements.

um also smart warehouse solutions with sensors to reduce the posth harvest losses um within warehouses at all the different levels um and I just launched um an exhibition just now where we were

showcasing these solutions. One is for example very new one is a robot an autonomous mobile robot that circulates around the warehouses and that can provide alerts when the spoilage is

happening or where there might be other uh you know pests rodents and so on and so forth. So we're trying to work very much with the government to bring these technologies and these innovations um to

improve the quality I would say of the of the food but the quality of these safety nets that is designed for the most vulnerable people which is really the the lens through which the world

food program is viewing all of this may be quite different from some of the other panelists here. &gt;&gt; That's great. I think WFP coming up with proprietary a tools

and taking a lead on it is is is very enlightening to um learn about. With that coming you to Simon. Simon is a veteran from a from the crop protection industry.

He knows India probably than more Indians know. Uh so so Simon the question to you you know of course I think agree inputs is a large industry and the multiple possible

use cases of how AI can be used especially developing new molecules and R&amp;D and of course farmer advisory I think Sanjay also talked about that so can you throw some light on you know how

we can use technology AI uh to drive some of these innovation on the agree input side &gt;&gt; yeah be happy to do that thank you Hand and Um Sanjay G um I really appreciate

what you said in terms of saying government and private need to work together here because going back to how he you opened up the complexity of Indian agriculture actually has been

waiting for something like AI and when you look at the atomization of land ownership the small hold of farmers that we have in the country we have struggled for decades to try to really help them

to advance because often we wouldn't understand their own fields. Yeah, the interaction points were not often enough. Let me let me try to give you a very concrete example and move a little

bit away from just making better chemicals, right? But um imagine all of us, right? We we go to UP in our minds. We go to UP and think of a

FPO that has give it 200 farmers, 200 hectars of direct seated rice. Right now imagine we've been watching these fields with satellites. We know more or less what was temperatures over

the last couple of months since growing season. We've been looking at moisture in the fields and we actually have this FBO together with a better life farming center a buyer which has let's call them

five or six drone dies a government program right where in the mornings they would fly drones just to for surveillance reasons and look at those 200 plots and identify in each

individual plot whether it needs fertilization whether because of the weather data we're trying to We could already see there's risk of diseases coming in, potentially pest migration

being seen. And then you start applying what needs to be applied. You apply fertilizer where the field might need some fertilizer. You apply pesticides where you need maybe just in the

vicinities and not on every single field because you can predict that if you kill the pests on the sides, they're not going to go to the other fields. Each individual farmer on their apps on the

farmiz app will know what is the interventions which is happening in their fields and can potentially also say whether they want it or not right a trace is built on what exactly

happened on that field for this batch of rice and then you have somebody like I don't know whether in the room fortune buying that rice off of the FPO and exporting

that rice to a UK supermarket where This UK supermarket knows exactly what has happened to this rice. Now, this rice has been grown with low water input. It's not patty. It's direct seeded. It

has not emitted as much methane and the farmer will probably get a better price because it goes into export and there is a trail of evidence that this is sustainably grown rice.

Now if we get things right, you'll even have the cherry on the cake and the government will have a carbon trading system in place where he gets carbon credits for have growing that rice. All

that is only possible for 200 fields with AI. Now imagine this around the country on maybe 20 million hectares, right? I mean this is probably the biggest of wishes one could have. But

only AI makes something like that thinkable. &gt;&gt; Fantastic. No, thanks for sharing that example. So that's um very inspiring. I hope it percolates to different parts of

the country and we get few million hectares under under this kind of surveillance. Yeah. So that's represents two organization BL agro which is a large agri business and leads

connect which is a startup within Blro and has done phenomenal work on developing some interesting tech tools. Look where the big question is of course AI is great and it's it's doing lot of

good for everyone the big question is is AI making money you know what are the use cases where you see an ROI coming especially for someone like you who's already using it at scale

good evening uh I hope I'm audible uh namaste and good evening everyone uh this is Aluk Mukji and uh firstly thank you so much Piki for uh giving uh this opportunity to share our thoughts on on

this very important uh topic. Uh yes sir. Uh my answer would be yes uh with some challenges. But before I go into the details uh I would like to share our experience in this regard. Uh we have

been uh working uh on agriculture we are we we are uh an analyst organization with core focus on agriculture and climate extensions. So when we started this journey so I just want to give a

kind of some pointers and then with this curve we will understand that what is the reach and what kind of developments happened actually in the context of application of AI in agriculture and and

and the business aspects also and the interventions also when we started we worked with governments also the private sectors also foundations also we have been working currently it started with

one district currently standing at 155 districts across India uh for different uh things when we started it started with the IL dynamics ill modeling project and all and then in this regard

when we talking about the ROI and all in this journey we saw and delivered and we got opportunity the market the entire ecosystem opened up and especially in last five six years we have seen this uh

very it's kind of a huge transition so what happened today we see the AI the use of application of AI uh kind of in the uh smart irrigations, the precision farming

uh the dynamics we see the application of AI and the solutions uh develop and driven by AI on the forecast dynamics in the context of productivity dynamics the crop mapping and one more thing in the

opening remarks sir mentioned one very important thing that like uh the farmers the way they were cultivating now it means a kind of a change is required and all now we see and we have been working

with the value chain because we we we come from the entire value chain 360°ree implementation of value chain. So now we see a huge implementation of AI in the dimension of in the context of value

chain dynamics identifying new value chains. Recently I would like to say that uh we did one kind of pilot study in Uttar Pradesh only and there we implemented this uh the uh our

proprietary algorithms and frameworks to understand that the current cultivation pattern if it can be changed and at least 20 to 30% other crop can come into the picture. So it just doesn't increase

the income of farmers plus it takes care of the ecological dynamics also. So if you see now where does AI stand in the context of agricultural dynamics? So it is in the uh precision farming it is in

the productivity dynamics not just post harvest it's a preh harvest analysis entire entire the value chain spectrum and the market linkage and the price forecasting side also so the entire uh

the entire dimension is now opened up uh through this one and one more very important thing that uh since these options are coming and uh and one more thing in the context of this one why why

this is encouraging now if I have some kind of chat boards okay fine we will keep building will keep will make our advisory advisory engines more robust and all more parameters more stacks will

come into the picture but what happens now we are uh lesser dependent on a very kind of a asset heavy infrastructures and plus then we see one I I would like to share one use case I will not go into

the details I'll not take much time we are working with some of the apps in Hiana there we were supposed to take care of the soil dynamics also in the context of forecast and there's a huge

demand of soil sensors. Now I want to give one example for one district if I have to go with 100 sensors instead of that if I have some kind of proprietary algorithms or frameworks AIdriven if it

can help us to reduce this 100 number of 100 to like 10 20 and this one then cascading analytics can be taken into the picture. It helps both sides for scaling also in the context of finance

also the the costing requirement and the fast deployment of this one. So sir my answer would be yes that uh the situation has been very increasing because uh day by day we have we we have

witnessed that the use cases are increasing and the penetration of AI right now it's it's no more kind of alien thing on the ground also sir thank you

&gt;&gt; thanks no that thanks for that positive remark an coming uh coming to you um I don't know I'm sure a lot of people will know area is one of the largest aggregator of grains in the country uh

they only talk in millions of tons now. Uh so Anand uh coming to you you know especially for a startup you know you know of course when agree techch started I think the focus was more on digital

and AI didn't exist and now it has become more and more mainstream. So how do you see how startups can use it can create value especially the kind of work you do for

providing credit for example for doing quality are saying for providing storage in the post-h harvest value chain &gt;&gt; no so hi good good evening everyone I'll just correct you AI word still existed

in agriculture it was called as artificial insemination &gt;&gt; I was about to say &gt;&gt; so that's the first time when I heard uh doing my BSc in agriculture I heard

about AI. So which was like 25 years ago. Uh coming to the topic even I think uh uh uh as a country we always get excited when new technology comes in. I remember 3 years ago we were focusing

more on blockchain and we thought blockchain is the panicia for all our problems. Uh and hope is not a bad strategy but it should not be the only strategy that AI is going to solve all

our problems. you know we should be excited about it but uh before any thing happens the structural issues or I would say the perception agriculture which we are

dealing with needs to be sorted out that data which we talk about I have two datas in front of me and both are contradictory to what is there uh global hunger index rates as 102 among the 123

countries which participates in that but the day India put a ban on export all the WTO members were crying please send wheat, please send wheat. How come uh you know a country where people are

starving, people are requesting to export? And they were crying. So first data at the perception level has to align with what this country is capable of. Number one, at a global level.

Number two, the at the policy level you we always been 22 years in the industry, we always talk about private public partnership. there has to be an alignment on that front. Uh still the

efforts are there but it gets diluted by the time it reaches to the end. The third and the more important point is while we talk about agriculture we should not always restrict it to

farmers. That's what uh I see most of the forums the discussion should not be only on the farmers. there are other participants who are equally important to run the

supply chain and show the discussions I enter always gets concentrated on the farmer uh which is important we and and uh the fourth important structural issue which I always keep on you know as a

feedback to government sir is the welfare and the business should be separated the uh that is uh the structural issues once sorted out. Trust me uh

technologies are enough available to solve most of the problems we have otherwise data uh him as you asked me you know uh people uh AI AI end of the day who will pay for it see a farmer has

to pay you for the data if the cost of AI is so high who will pay end of the day it will come back to the government and come back to us through taxes it's a vicious cycle

&gt;&gt; so while we evaluate any technology uh We should be we should start with a hope but we should also start with a caution as to the value it will generate which will make the consumer or the farmer or

the users of those uh or the people using it pay for it. What value add it and in the country till in last 22 years I have not seen people paying you for data. Everybody wants data but when it

comes to you know taking out money from your wallet oh we will see we'll come back and then those datas which get used are those islands of excellence in certain pockets say one person here one

FBO there two FBO there if if something is very critical like the UPI infrastructure which government has created look at its acceptance because it had a use case and it had like a

growth grocery store ariksha wala everybody found utility in it and it got adopted so something like that is what is needed in agree &gt;&gt; thanks no thanks for bringing some very

&gt;&gt; difficult points &gt;&gt; difficult points but it's it's important to have a contradictory point of view and though I've also said on forums and I've gotten got beaten for it when I say

don't build AI for the farmers build for the layer which can be trusted by the farmers you know so uh and that's where the value chain becomes more and more important And agriculture to me is a

case of embedded AI rather than a a farmercentric AI. You can embed AI in so in so many ways and across the value chain. U so with that coming to you Malik and sorry for keep you waiting.

I've taken the liberty of proximity. Uh the question to you is um um how do we make the question which Anand raised you know who's going to pay for it you know um and frankly AI needs a lot of

investments. We seeing venture capital putting billions of dollar every $30 billion deal looks like a just another deal in AI. Uh so how do we you know make it more and more affordable? Where

does public platforms comes into picture? Where DPI comes into picture? Where data sharing comes into picture? Uh and you know as that point is also being raised you know how do you make

authentic data sets available so that AI tools become far and for robust to be used by farmers or anyone in the value chain. too many questions right um and

fantastic uh you know views from our friends here. So thank you for having me. If if you look at uh two different data sets again talking about data right um

one is uh what's the workforce that's in farming in agriculture in the country close to 45 48%. Right? On the other hand, if you look at the contribution to the GDP, right,

which is much less than 20%. Less than 1/5 of the GDP there is a huge gap out there. So what it means honestly in my understanding that putting technology on on the side

being a technologist but thinking the context of it right uh there is a huge gap to be really filled. I mean we looking about productivity which is much much much less that's what it means per

person per farmer productivity how much it is I think it tells some story about that so I think there is some gap to really work on and it's a transformational need out there in my

honest opinion and can AI help there yes it can but we need to look at uh from the context in terms of what and how right and the point of making it affordable is very very

essential. All the large language models that we've been talking very costtheavy resource hungry we all know it right can they help of course can they can help what we need is more

focused more solution more uh sectordriven more taskdriven smaller models and I'm sure someone like friends like Alo can possibly uh second

to that and Anand you can also possibly can relate to that. So I think we need something which is very focused smaller not giant GPT like kind of a heavy model to look at that's one second we need

something which is more focused on various different uh you know data sets possibly there are various different things that you solve and Simon talked about best detection and disease for

example how do you solve that we talked about value chain we talked about uh logistics yeah in every which if you think about it's a model in its own way and different problems therefore to be

solving using that model. So there is no one single LLM possibly that can really solve it and if it does it's too cost heavy to resource hungry right but what we need is more focused approach out

here that's one second I think it's equally important to understand how are we really building that infrastructure right uh in terms of solving that problem right I think

public private partnership is very essential we heard about that uh there are initiatives which I know I do not know how much far it has gone ahead is in terms of how about the agriculture

producer organizations or cooperative societies possibly buying a pool of resources cloud credits for example and giving out to the farmers and to the users and I

think government possibly also can intervene then in terms of giving out such credits to the farmers as well and to the point that Anand made uh you know UPI it has done wonderful uh you know

impact it has made a wonderful impact right data is essential but access of data and making that available at large

democratization that is even more essential so first is of course to bring the data together right the data sets right that's the first thing I don't even worry about compute right now

honestly I don't I would not not that it is not important but data is even moreant important to be able to then kind of extract necessary data points from it and then of course work on how

we are able to really make it accessible affordable right so for example we recent just talked we just heard about uh you know bhat vistar right it's

an amazing AI tool which kind of shares the resources can we do that for other data sets as well. Can we do that for other parameters as well? Right? I think that

brings down the cost of access. Of course, it also democratizes. Furthermore, it will be more accessible by startups like in case of UPI that we have been seeing to be able to then

integrate within their solutions, within their applications to come up with some wonderful solutions. So, these are few ideas possibly that we should possibly look at and work on. And I think more

than um just solving one problem, I think if you do that, it's not just about scaling and helping AI scale. Honestly, it is actually nation building if you think about it.

Absolutely. I think frugal engineering is is critical and this sector is known for frugality. I think the startups I know who have done the best are the ones who are the most frugal in terms of

spending and figuring out where does capital need to be deployed and I think the point you made around data infrastructure shared infrastructure I think that that's extremely critical to

for these AI tools to be more affordable with that Elizabeth I'll come to you um you know I think clearly for a sector like agriculture uh policy is at the core of it you know

if you have to scale anything I always say capital is a multip multiplier but policy is a bigger multiplier especially in sector like agriculture. So how does policy enable adoption of technology?

You have Sanjay G sitting next to you. You can if you can make some recommendation how how government should be looking at it. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much. So let me share

that one of the groups that at the World Food Program we've worked with closely um and and you know where there's there's really extra support required is with women farmers. Um you know there

are so many excellent um government schemes that seek to support women farmers. But we do see when we speak to them that often they are feeling a bit left out um sometimes the status of

women farmers is much lower than men. They tend to um they can be seen as not necessarily as farmers in their own right but as doing work that is an extension of housework. Um that's

something that you know that we've noticed through our work at the grassroots. Um they often need a special support to access certain schemes um and training

and financial products and loans and credit and so on. The reason I'm mentioning this is because perhaps some of the colleagues in the panel would have ideas on how we might join forces.

We've talked about public private partnerships bringing um AI and technology solutions uh to support um these groups would would be excellent. So one of the things that we've worked

on with with the government are is to set up climate adaptation information centers for example um some chat bots and apps that can provide advice um on whether it's you know climate smart

approaches or plant clinics very practical things like that where we're trying to bring technology u to to that level and and I would say that what the gentleman said about small models and

testing small models. I see an application there in terms of partnering at the field level where we could be very happy to to look at things like that. Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Thanks. No, wonderful. And thanks for bringing the gender lens. I think that's extremely critical. Not many of us realize whenever think of a farmer, it's a picture of men which comes into a

mind. But go to villages. is I think the number of women which is employed in agriculture is is is large and growing especially articulture and animals bendry. So totally with you Elizabeth on

this. Uh Simon coming back to you um I think you gave a very good example of that FPO. Now I think one of the challenges that we see with a lot of advisory and lot of solutions is that

the it is not contextualized or curated plot by plot you know it's it's it's more generic. Uh first of all is there a need for it or you know or and if if yes can AI play role out there to make it

very far farm specific probably what agree also intends to do whenever it gets open sourced. &gt;&gt; Yeah. It's a it's a very fair question. It's a

touchy question, right? Um I mean obviously when when when I look at FPOS's and be it also women FBOs, I look at the opportunity for collectivization which means decision making is done more

in cohesion. Right? &gt;&gt; What I was trying to get at is obviously if you start using drones ideally all farmers will let those drones fly over their fields and take pictures and also

give recommendations, right? I think we are not at a point yet where we can say the farmer has no intervention. Right. Right. It it's just doesn't feel right in the country yet. So I would say it is

still it needs to be a recommendation which might be because the FBO puts pressure on and says hey we are only going to do DSR. Yeah. So either you are a DSR farmer or not. But I think we need

to find a middle way in this country always. Right. What is important to me though is also when we're talking smaller models and stuff is the topic of agri stack right there is a need for

public infrastructure on data right because if everybody generates their own data and especially with advice we say see it today one model says A the other says B it's completely contradictory

it's a bit like the guy from buyer and the guy from tenta goes there and recommend different products right that's something we need to overcome and I do believe in a longer run you're

going to be sitting here as a government and say we don't necessarily want people do certain interventions on their own. Yeah. We will come to a point where what I call the pesticide is taken out of the

hand of the farmer and it is applied by a machine which is controlled where it's very very clear that there is a trail of evidence why it needs to be done. Yeah. So it will be at points where I do

believe the intervention will become universal and the farmer will not take the decision any longer. Thank you. Thanks Amon. With that coming to you Aloc and Anand maybe you can also

comment on it. I think one of the challenges that we are seeing is is climate uh and the kind of rains we saw last monsoon. Um it's not just the intensity of rain. It's the distribution

of rains. The heat wave that we has seen this year you know we are already one of the hottest summer for Delhi in the last 5 years. uh and as some of you will know one degree increase in temperature is

five millions of wheat getting lost right so this that that kind of impact so how do we tackle this whole climate change issue how do we make clim chains more climate resilient uh using some of

these uh technology tools you can comment on that &gt;&gt; uh so I have mean uh this to say on uh this particular question uh and before I go into this one I just want to legal

liberty just to share one thing mean I have been hearing this one like uh when we are talking about LLM SLMs and all so it's like uh data centers and the huge requirements and all so if we change the

requirement from the like datadriven to context driven the day we orient this one the moment we go into this picture just I want to give one example that when we build things like this one

suppose in one business indexes or something where just just a raw example if we fix that at particular stage this index gives this kind of idea about the agriculture plus a kind of indicative

analysis for soil then what happens suppose hypothetically I have five parameters the maximum combination is 120 I can reduce it to 30 so what happens data points decrease so these

kind of dynamics need to be taken care of so it requires the shift from datadriven to contactdriven analysis now coming back to these questions very important now but but we need to

understand that when the climate thing is coming to the picture the story cannot be confined to the farmland land the ecosystem dynamics came should come into the picture. Ecosystem dynamics

means uh the entire idea is the land system vibrations. What we see is the consequence and all. So it means if we are even aiming or targeting the agricultural uh dynamics means what is

the impact of climate change on that? So what actually happens the journey starts from the root causes the process parameters. So I I would like to give you two three pointers on this process

parameters means the land system dynamics will come into the picture. Landscape profiling come into the picture. Atmospheric profiling will come into the picture. So d will come into

the pictures. All stacks then merge into one. So what happens different domains different scales has to be merged at uh at uh one go. So what kind of architectures we may have to tackle this

one. So I would like to share one thing mean the entire respected air frant is here. We started the journey with the conventional level then the deep tech and then right now we strong we talking

about strong AI architecture why to tackle this one only because if we have to have a solution on this so entire ecological dynamics should be put on one uh on one scale seamlessly. Now this

requires the understanding of th complexities the thresholding the trigger parameters from different domains. So it means we have if if if I have to say it means uh not

hypothetically it's a kind of a kind of a basian architecture it's it's it's it's it goes in in that direction we cannot have a blackbox kind of uh understanding and then we understand

that my data is also authentic or not or it's triggering or not but it's right for that analysis. So here actually AI not just AI I I'll make it very specific strong AI architectures will have a very

very strong role to play and and actually have been playing sir so him the to answer I think climate change is for real it's it's knocking our doors there's no two way about it

but I think the first department which needs or the first industry which needs AI in the country especially for agriculture is the media if million tons for one degree would

have damaged India would not be in a position to export allow export they huge stocks with us right now our warehouses are full government I think sir would can comment so the department

which needs data right now vi data is the media because they blow things out of proposition most of the time and and especially when it's related to farmers it's a very sensitive and this

negativity sells much faster than a wildfire in a forest so the data so it's it's for real we have to be prepared for climate smart agriculture. There's no two way about it. But not at the cost of

you know spending our entire energy towards it. See we as agriculture what is happening? We are taking too many priorities in one go which makes the execution difficult. We have to pick up

two three things on a I say a five to seven year horizon and do it. But what happens if we pick up something too many things? That's where things are taking time.

&gt;&gt; Thanks. No, that's a that's a good message for the media to be more realistic and datadriven. Thank you. Thanks, An Mik. Last question to you. So clearly you talked about data

infrastructure. Now when it comes to agriculture, there's a hardware part. So you know we are using a lot of remote sensing. Uh Simon talked about use of drones. There are weather stations under

winds project. There are about two lakh weather stations which are going to be installed. Uh there's IoT being used. There's sensors being used. So how do you see hardware play

coming in that's one sort of source of data and of course the the data that you need to store to run these interesting AI algorithms that most of us don't understand but yeah you need a lot of

infrastructure for that right. I I all I know is that it consumes a lot of energy, right? I think uh one you talked was from the more from the data acquisition point of

view. I think which is more operational need operational technology classically we call that in industry which is an essential item but that too can be

worked in a very frugal way. Um coming to the uh point that you know we heard about LLM and uh small models as well. See what we need here the best models here are not the biggest models.

Okay, the best models here would be the deepest models uh more context aware models. Right? So thinking from that point of view then you come to an understanding in terms of what

infrastructure would you then require. Right? It would require edge computing possibly you will need to run these models on your phones, smartphones, right? you will need to run on your

local CPUs more than just GPUs, right? Uh so architecting it, designing it is something which is very essential to it and how we kind of break this into what is really required to even deploy,

right? And again coming to the point that we talked earlier, but how do you really do it? The point is edge computing is out there, cloud computing is out there, right? But

we have to figure out a solution somewhere in middle in between such that it is available as an infrastructure to people at large. Right? Which again comes to the point of digital public

infrastructure. Right? And digital public infrastructure by by that we mean it is governed, it is democratized, accessibility is out there, right? Bringing out the cost down

and therefore you have more innovations around it. you have more API economy around it, right? What we are seeing is in API economy, right? Even in within UPI, what we are seeing is API economy.

So, I think it kind of helps to kind of scale as well, it brings the cost down as well. So I would not worry much about honestly speaking again on the compute power for example

it can be something which can be designed for your simple uh CPUs and some edge computing as well and to an extent GPUs as well but not that heavy if you're talking about small focus

models here which is very important and essential. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thanks. No that's a very practical suggestion. Um Sanjay G any closing remarks from you? I think there's a lot

of excitement in the private sector about the public stacks you know agree and batwistar which got launched you know just educate us you know how do we when do we use it how do we use it now

&gt;&gt; I think when we talk about bat wistar we want to extend it throughout the country vistar means to extend it as far as possible to all the stakeholders it is not only farmers but various

stakeholders are involved this in this process And ultimately through varatistar and through various other AI technologies which we are using

we are also going to save the taxpayers money also. I would like to give one or two examples like procurement. We are going to save huge money to save some fake procurement

which is being done in the name of farmers. Similarly fertilizer subsidy that is a huge challenge before us that our subsidy burd is increasing day by day

now through all AI help through soil testing reports now farmers are using fertilizer they don't know the problems but they use fertilizers through AI there are so many things

which we are planning to do and that digital public infrastructure that agree force is coming in a huge way. The data is not a problem. We have a huge database. We

have a low but now this is time has come that through with the help of AI we are able to use that huge database which we were that was lying with us and now we are capitalizing that database and

making it useful for a larger uh benefit of our country. I think all together we can do wonders and agriculture farmers need it. All the stakeholders need it and ultimately our

country will benefit through all these efforts and hunger will not be a problem for our country that I can assure everyone here. Thank you very much. &gt;&gt; Thanks for that positive note. Uh

can we can we take some question him? I I know we have gone beyond time. two or three questions. Uh so yeah, let's take get the questions first and please be brief and as much as you can

just request to understand when you are inviting when you are inviting them up. &gt;&gt; Yes. produces like product

&gt;&gt; in UFI. When you are going to release that &gt;&gt; unified farmer &gt;&gt; ID I think if you can say we have already working on farmer ID that is

unifi farmer ID more than 10 core farmers are already listed and they got unique farmer ID and it is going to cover all the farmers in next one year and by the time every

farmer will have a definite unique ID with them and with that ID they can take credit, they can go for bank loan, they can will take fertilizer, they can take any advantage from market seed to market

and everything will be connected with that farmer ID and that is already in there. Since last one year more than 8 cr farmers have been added to that and this silent revolution like Aadhaar

today we all are having Aadhaar ID. I think in coming time within a year of so every farmer will have a different comprehensive ID that will be connected with his land records also and

ultimately it will work as Aadhaar for all the farmers and it will be linked with all the schemes all the benefits all the land records with that ID.

Uh my question is to Simon. You mentioned very rightly that the decision regarding the p pesticide spray can be taken away from the farmers. Can the entire decision taking in case

of agriculture or horiculture be left to the AI in a given circumstance and from say resource to root from supply to demand and the farmer is

merely a stakeholder as owner of the land that he has got and also his uh involvement is very minimal. You know we have a system called batai. Bai in the sense the farmer is the

absent farmer and is given to somebody else. In this case this the AI happens to be the one which takes a decision and can you think about doing this kind of experiment in case of one particular

FPO and see how the results come out because you know the problems he has given a complete summarization of the problem. You have the solution. He he knows about the data as such but then

&gt;&gt; at least we can &gt;&gt; I understand where you come from and I I mean there there is a question of infrastructure and that starts with mechanization do we have AI ready

mechanization in the country right so simple answer in the long run yes and when I was many years back in Bangkok I was saying exactly because he saw this farmers would own their land they would

be offsite online farmer farmers right they would use WhatsApp and whatever and tell their laborers to do what to do right now obviously we've come a long way and yes in theory you should be

coming to a point where AI can do most intervention for the farmer but the farmer will still take a choice he will say I'm an organic farmer I want to have high yields I want to whatever preserve

my land this year right so I don't think it's going to be 100% but the decision vision points will be much more as you say contextual and might be limited because yes a

government might at one point say I don't want people to decide on fertilization themselves if AI can do it better because maybe the simple solution I don't want to pay so much subsidy the

better solution obviously because I want to have ecological services come in right and ultimately that's where you want to come you want to have an incentive system where the farmer that

takes the best ecological decisions actually earns most. &gt;&gt; Thank you. I think one last question. Yeah, doesn't matter. &gt;&gt; It's a very interesting panel. I I come

from the AI side. So I my question is uh purely towards uh the food processing and the food uh waste. uh this is something that I have I'm doing a project in northeast and I find that the

amount of food wastage that is happening which is uh um posth harvest it's not uh at the consumer level it's the food waste uh because of lack of market access at the

same time there are lot of food processing possibilities which are there but that doesn't get really uh accomplished now there are two different ministries really handling it. So it

doesn't become uh a viable proposition. Every every effort that is really happening is to really address to the farmer but then uh food processing becomes a different uh industry

altogether. So why can't we really look at what kind of uh uh systems we can develop to really look at the food wastage and try to see how we could reposition the extra food that is not

getting marketed. uh through a food processing mechanism. Now that's the research that I've done and I have practical uh this thing which is there. We have also identified certain crop

certain uh vegetables and fruits uh which can be really brought into that area. This is through a proper data analysis. Now these are things that we really don't know who should be

addressing it and that's something that is a question for uh you plus where do we really get that food wastage data right now there is no data available. Uh so there has to be a conscious mechanism

to really look at the kind of food wastage which is happening. Most of the time the farmer is not able to really accomplish what he can uh just because of the wastage in terms of all kinds of

problems that one has in terms of transportation in terms of market access in terms of uh perishability and so on so forth. I think when we talk about seed to market the concept is that that

there should not be a food wastage rather farmer should get the right price for the his food because there's no wastage but they are not getting the right price for the product. So now in

current two policies the recent two policies of pulses mission and oil seed mission we have kept this into mind and we have added food processing meals that pulses processing meals and oil

processing mills are also included to be set up in that particular area where the this is grown more than 1,000 pulses mills at at the same time more than 1,000 oil seed mills oil processing

mills are being set up under these missions so that the this wastage or this force selling can be reduced and as far as other marketing concerns are there because perishable goods are there

many agriculture products are perishable so there are some such problems comes many times no now the FPO farmer producer organization they are playing very good role to address this problem

they are providing a bridge between farmers and market and I I think in coming time as they are going to be more strong things will be better and through this only we can reduce this gap of

wastage. &gt;&gt; So my question was in context with northeast northeast has a typical problem of this because of many other variations. Is there some specific

effort that can be done to really have a AI mission on that where we can actually address because um um I am um volunteering to really work on that that's something that

&gt;&gt; please share your data and your findings with us &gt;&gt; sure &gt;&gt; and our government there's a 10% funding is reserved for northeast as most of the

development schemes welfare schemes we have a separate dedicated funds for northeast. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; And if you have data and some findings

certainly it will help us. Please share with us. Thank you very much. &gt;&gt; So thank you. I think one good thing about the last session is that we can extend it and we have taken the liberty

of extending it by like 30 minutes. Uh but yeah thanks to all the panelists for some wonderful insights and to all the audience I think it's been a for all your curiosity and your patience and

thanks to my Viki colleagues who have worked hard to make this session work. Thank you. That would work. Just allow.
