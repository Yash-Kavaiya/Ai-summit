## 📝 Transcript

that it will start with understanding of the problem, diagnosing the issue, envisioning what the what the system should look like and then designing it. Last but not the least, our third mus

musketeers uh Chandra Johi will help wrap up the session. So, welcome once again. Please fasten your seat belts to soar into the world of AI. And u last but not the least, please stay away from

your mobile phones and enjoy the journey. Thank you. So thank you Mir u thanks for that very peppy start. Uh so I would uh like to first wish you all a very good afternoon

to all the assembled dignitaries, senior leaders from the government. Um members of the public and TCS colleagues and friends um I would like to first start by

thanking every leader from the government here that we thank you really for your service from the bottom of our heart and uh I would like to say that with AI we are at a very transformative

uh juncture where technology where nation building and where governance have to come together. Right? So if you really look at uh the past uh the world um has said that India missed

the industrial revolution. uh they also said in some terms that we were a bit late to the Silicon party as we call it and but what we did was we we developed

Aadhaar we developed EPI and in doing so we actually rewrote the rules we showed what was actually possible right by a nation like India and I think that with AI we are yet again at another juncture

because the choices that India makes with AI will actually set the tone for the rest of the world. Right? So the the key thing is that AI is merely not a technological change as you will

see and as you would have heard multiple times. It's actually a civilizational change. It's going to affect all of us. uh it's also uh uh you know a deeply ethical and moral uh change that we have

to you know we as citizens and we as policy makers we have to take and the thing that I want to say is that AI will be built everywhere all nations will build AI but it is up to us to make

sure that the most ethical the most uplifting and empowering AI is built in India is built by Indian hands and Indian minds. But in order to do that there are

three guiding principles that we as leaders we have to keep in our minds. The first is that a confident India marched into the digital age for the last 10 years. So we

built you know a very comprehensive set of DPIs. uh we bought millions of people into the digital fold. But it is also a time where we have to

stop and question ourselves that is digital enough right because the future is not digital first systems the future is AI first systems. The problem with digital is that digital

systems actually wait for a citizen to knock on its doors. They expect a citizen to fill forms. U they usually work using they take inputs in a couple of languages and most importantly these

systems usually tend to be very reactive. They're not very proactive. But yet our people speak hundreds of languages and they live thousands of realities.

The lit the digital literacy in India is about 38%. which means that uh we have given them access but most people in India are not able to avail that access

because of certain constraints. For example, a low level of digital literacy means that people who have to use these fantastic digital systems that we built often have to go to middlemen

to access and use these systems. And what that actually does is that that pushes up the cost of service right for people and also for the government. So

while digital helped us scale, we firmly believe that AI will help us transform. So AI first systems will not wait for citizen to knock on their doors.

They will anticipate, they will reach out, they will guide, and they will uplift. So imagine a system that speaks to you in your language, that understands your

context, not only your words, but your reality, and says, "I hear you. I understand you. Let me help you." So picture an agent

sensing that there is a deficit monsoon. Proactively calling a farmer making him aware of a subsidy and very patiently

through voice guiding him through the entire process of actually applying for that subsidy in a very very respectful dignified and patient way. So this if this happens it's not a

technological change it is actually a change in empathy that we have towards our people. The second guiding principle that we have to keep in mind is this whole idea

of the missing middle. So if you really look at it as a nation, our story is extremely unique, right? All our knowledge and all our capability is concentrated in our cities, but most

of our people live far beyond them. So if you really think there are millions of Asha workers, Anganwari workers uh there are postmen

uh there are financial intermediaries uh and they are spread across this country delivering service essential services to millions of citizens. Uh in fact there are about 1 million

Asha workers who pour empathy into every home that they visit. But they often lack these basic tools which can help them do their jobs better. So the world calls them frontline

workers but we really know they are hardline workers, right? They are the backbone of this country. So what AI can actually do is AI can give these frontline workers the support

that they need to do their jobs better. So an Asha worker today can be armed with an intelligent assistant who diagnoses, who transcribes, who advises and most

importantly helps us succeed in our job. So what will end up happening is that AI will start becoming this missing middle. Now what is the missing middle? It is this bridge between human empathy that

our frontline workers have and all the expert knowledge that resides elsewhere. So the way AI will do that is that it will digitize the shared context of these frontline workers.

It will digitize the specialist knowledge that is available uh with uh you know experts uh in the domains that they work in. And it will digitize all of this into

models. And these models will be used to build intelligent assistants who will deliver prescriptions and predictions in vernacular language

on frugal devices on a sovereign stack, right? A stack that is ours. And the most important truth in all of this is that AI will never be able to fully replace any of them. It will only

end up empowering them. Because in the front lines, what will end up happening is that humans will bring empathy and AI will bring knowledge and intelligence and together they will script a

completely new India. The third the third choice or the third guiding principle that we have to follow is this whole principle that the India story of

AI cannot be built on a borrowed brain right so if you really look at AI it's an entire stack while we think it is algorithms but it's actually an entire

stack which comprises of infrastructure data centers uh where all these applications run. Then you need a lot of data to train models. Then there are the models themselves. And then there are

platforms uh on which you build applications and you distribute applications. And finally, there are the applications themselves. And to truly be sovereign, you have to make sovereign

choices at each level of the stack. But for the first time I think we are truly prepared because the India AI mission today has about 38,000 GPUs which it has made available to Indian

innovators to build models to train them test them deploy them. There are also initiatives such as uh AI kosh uh which is essentially creating millions of data sets that you

will need to train these models and also from a model perspective you would have followed the news over the last couple of days that there are today indic models which understand our

language which understand our context and perform at benchmarks which are as set as high as global models and sometimes even surpassing them. So as leaders we have to make a couple

of choices. The first choice that we have to make is that when we use data for training models or we use data for feeding into intelligent assistants and uh AI algorithms, we have

to make sure that our data resides on sovereign data centers. Right? When we use models for inferencing, for essentially making these intelligent decisions for us, we have to at least

make sure that even if these models are not Indian models, at least these models have open weights, which means that we can host them on our own data centers and we know what we are dealing with and

we know that you know whatever the model the kinds of decisions that the model makes these are transparent decisions. And the third thing is that we have to use tools which are either open source

or built with India in mind. So I'll just summarize. Uh so we have to create AI first systems. We have to make sure that we create systems which fill the missing middle

and we have to make sure that we avoid a borrowed brain. And all of this requires us to make design choices in the applications that we build. And the first design choice is that we have

to choose voice and vernacular as our primary interfaces. Right? Interfaces which are voice driven and which can understand vernacular. The second design choice that we have to

make is that we have to completely stay away from forms as much as possible. have conversations, right? The third design choice is that we have to design systems that are proactive and that are

not reactive. Which means these systems should reach out to citizens rather than citizens having to chase these systems. And the fourth choice that we have to make is that we have to make systems

that are frugal, which means they can work on commodity devices, but are also sovereign. So what follows next is a V coding session where essentially my colleague

Arun who you have met uh will allow you to apply these design principles uh on a few challenges that we have carefully curated for you and you will build these AI applications yourself

using AI, Right? And all of this will be done without you knowing a single line of coding or programming as they call it. You will use today the most

powerful language in the world for programming which is natural language in this case English. But remember uh today in India for example there's a session running next door uh where uh you have

thousands of rural women actually building apps like you will build it but not in English in vernacular languages using uh you know a special application that we have built for them. Uh so the

goal of the next 70 minutes is essentially to test this hypothesis that AI can drastically shorten the gap between ideation to your first prototype. So we will not be building

systems which you can put into your data centers and start scaling immediately because building those systems requires a lot of checks and balances which uh anyway you know we have to do while we

deploy the system. So these are not production grade systems you build but what it will essentially show you that you can today compress this whole thing from ideation to a prototype. It usually

used to take months but today it will just take you 60 minutes actually less than 60 minutes 40 minutes right. So please participate enthusiastically have animated discussions at the tables. Our

volunteers are here and they will guide you through every step of the way and have fun at the end of it. and please go back and enthuse your colleagues to also try and build their first AI prototype.

So I'll just end with u a thought uh that uh when you look at the global context right uh people measure progress in AI by something that's called the Turing

test which is essentially are we building AI that is smarter than humans but I think the AI that we have to build for this country uh has to be measured on a different metric and whether that

that metric is that whether AI systems that we built are uplifting the last person on the last mile. Right? So you call it an anthodia test or you give it another name but that's going to be the

true benchmark of systems that we build for India uh and by Indians. Uh so I will end by saying that the future is calling. You're all here. Uh so let's build India first AI systems. Thank you

very much. Over to you. So, it's my job to actually make you get your hands dirty and actually see things as they happen. So, I'll just start with

one quick question. I know that Shank already said that you're not going to have to code today, but just a quick question. How many of you have coded anywhere, including back in school in

basic or made any kind of a program at any point of time? Okay, that's a lot more than I expected. That's great. All right, so this is really something very good. But here

today, the kind of complex programs that our engineers who are sitting near your tables do on a daily basis is going to be accelerated significantly using AI. Now when we say AI, there's one thing

that I want you to take very strongly over there. It's not the intelligence part, it's the artificial part. Because at the end of the day, trust me, AI is something that really accelerates things

and does things extremely fast. But the job of making AI focus on a particular task and guiding it to do the thing the right way is still us. We have to actually do that. We need to make that

artificial come into the realm. To give you an example, um, a couple of years ago when AI actually started becoming something very real, something that all of us could access, the very common

thing that people were doing was drafting their emails using AI or chat GPT or any of these things. And some of the fundamental mistakes they would make is they would make a query that said,

uh, okay, can you please draft a formal email saying that I'm going to be taking some time off from work due due to my medical condition? a very generic non you know doesn't explain much AI would

go ahead and and literally this happened AI created an email saying I would like to take three months of leave since I'm in my sixth month of pregnancy it just hallucinated right it did not get the

exact guidance it went ahead and it was well on the first hand it's extremely tough for someone to suddenly go to office and say I'm six months pregnant and even more tougher because this

person was a man so does put you in very difficult positions if you don't guide it the right way so that's where guiding AI by saying listen AI I want you to ask me questions so that my question or my

request to you is more accurate makes it a lot more makes it a lot more sensible. AI should be retroelementing what you actually want to achieve by first asking and checking with you if the information

that it's thinking of is right and that's what we're actually going to be doing today. The reason why it has become extremely accessible now is purely because of technological

advancements. If we go back to 1975, Arya 1, our first satellite that was actually launched into space, the processor that was used on that functioned at a maximum clock of 5

megahertz. 5 MHz. And it did telemetry, it did astronomy, it did communications. It lasted 5 days, but for that era, it was amazing. Your Apple Watch or your phone today has

well close to 1,000 times of that compute power. And that's literally why AI has become much more accessible to all of us right now. So that's it's the power of all of these things that we're

going to use together. But the most important thing which is particularly very strong in the public sector is we approach things from the humanitarian side. I've worked with a lot of

enterprises and they approach it from a business side, from a product side, from a service side that they have to provide to their consumer. How can they make more profits? But AI is something which

serves best when you approach it from the perspective of the consumer, the person who's going to use this particular service. And that's why the challenges that all of you have today

are designed specifically for that. And we've also channeled AI to ask you the right questions, provide you information that it already knows and ask you, am I right? Is there something that you would

like to add to this? Because at the end of the day about each of your services, you know better than AI. You can tell AI you're wrong. You can tell AI you've forgotten this point. Add it into your

calculations as well. And that's what we're going to do. So let me take you through a very fast live example of what exactly you're going to be seeing. All of you at your tables have this screen

in front of you with multiple challenges. I'm going to take one of these challenges which my colleague Shank also mentioned of the Asha worker. You will see exactly what the problem is

here. Suna an Asha worker. Once again approaching it from the person's perspective. We know that we have over one 10 lakh one million um Asha workers around who are actually going from place

to place providing medical information, advice and getting all of this information. What we know is that they gather all this information on paper as they go from place to place. Then they

have to go to a system and then manually enter that information for it to come come into the government health portal. What if we could make things a lot easier for her? What if we could make it

such that no matter which language the Asha worker speaks, they can actually enter their data. What if they could actually attend to more than six to seven people a day and you know increase

their efficiency if AI can augment them. Now make note of one thing. AI is extremely good at making processes that work better. Don't think that AI is going to be the groundup solution. You

need a process in place. You need some form of digitization in place and AI will make it better. Don't try to make AI fix a broken process. Fix a process and use AI to make it better. So in Asha

in in this case in Suna's case, what we're going to do today is we'll start and here we have a full-fledged AI guided platform for all of you which you'll see on your screens where AI is

going to understand what the Asha workers problem is and it's going to start asking you questions saying basically categorized into three things. Who is involved in this particular

process? What is the reason that they're involved? What is the reason that this process or this problem exists? And finally, how can we actually solve that

problem for you? Come up with your imagination. And fourth phase, our engineers over here will actually build that prototype for you. So as you can see here it's recommending things to me

saying well considering this problem I see Asha workers auxiliary nurses or midwives ministry of health rural families does this capture everyone and I can just go ahead and say I can either

type it or use one of the suggested uh responses I can say yes I think that covers everyone but if I think it doesn't or if I think of someone that hasn't I can go ahead and give my input

now for each of those workers it's coming up and saying well what do you think is the issue facing by each and every one of them what's the possible problem what's the possible pain area

for them so Asha worker double entry AMS access to real-time data etc it's pointed specifically all of those things out however if I do feel that the technical reliability for Arsha workers

is also a pain point I'll say please add that also if there's something that comes up to my mind because I know the process is different I can type that in as well so when I add that it adds that

point as well so we go on like this excuse me we go on like this and we start gathering information about the who who are the people who are affected and how they are affected so it takes

information I've told AI to first gather as much information as it can from all of you in order to get this detail now once it goes ahead and captures that information it'll then take me into the

next phase which will be the diagnos phase just give me a moment It's taking a little bit of time here. Sorry. Zoom in a little bit. Oh, of course. Of

course. There we go. Oh, there we go. Yes. So, great. I understand what the pain points are. Now let's see what success would look like for each of those people. So

here we have all of those details captured. So one by one you'll go through all of these questions that AI is actually asking you. You'll accept them or you'll augment them or you'll

negate them saying this is not an issue etc. And finally it'll say what if we go with this kind of a flow. What if things worked out this way and we would say yes that is the exact flow or I would say no

I want to add certain things to it. go ahead argue with AI you know contest it make it think once or twice more and finally you would actually go ahead and well it'll say let's go ahead and

diagnose why this is happening we now know how it's affecting people what their pain points are let's move forward to why it is happening so that is diagnosing what's the root cause why are

we having these issues once again same process go ahead accept argue tell AI no I don't accept what you're saying or tell AI Please add this also. You're right about this, but something's not

right. You'll have this conversation not just with AI, but with all the people at your desk as well because everyone brings a certain perspective, a certain angle to each of the problems that

you'll face. So we do this and we basically as we're doing all of these discussions AI is gathering the inputs that each and every one of you is contributing and as you go forward with

this maybe within another couple of minutes or so you'll eventually enter into the imagine phase. The imagine phase is basically the phase where it's going to say now let me considering that

I understand who is involved and what is their problem and why that problem is happening. How's about I imagine a solution for you? So I go ahead and say yes. Let's see

what that AI solution can be where it goes ahead and resolves all these problems and it says I can make something an application that does all of these things ranging from integration

digital shadow register time reclaim data latency all of these details the user experience offline voice queuing etc. takes all of that and I say yes that's captures everything well if

there's something more that I want to add I can specifically add it there finally we come to the PRD the big document that we generally submit to our suppliers to say this is the solution

that I want built and it'll say do you want me based on the entire conversation that you've had based on everything that you've told me do you want me to go ahead and build a PRD for you and I say

yes go ahead now that we've discussed everything now that we have argued now that we've seen the pros of pros and cons build the PRD and that's precisely what we'll do over here now as it's

generating the PRD based on the entire conversation once the PRD file is available that's when the rapid build process starts along with all of these experts that you have in front of you so

my PRD is ready I can just download this file and if I open this file right now you'll notice that based on my entire discussion It's taken up a lot of things. I'm sorry, it's a little bit

small. Let me see if I can make it bigger. There we go. The problem statement, the solution overview, who were the target users, what are the key features, what was the user flow like of

your app, of your imagined solution. Everything's been taken just based on the discussions that you've had. Now, nothing is programming language. Everything is just plain English. And

we'll just take this file, put it inside an EI system, and say, make this an app. And you will see magically within a few minutes that it actually makes an app. That app is kind of like the first draft

of the email that the person said where it ended up saying, "Yes, I need to take leave because I'm pregnant." You need to then reiterate along with our programmers again in plain English

saying, "Yes, this app looks good, but I'm not pregnant. I'm just unwell with a cold." That kind of a comment regarding your app has to be passed on and it will once again make the changes that you

want quickly rapidly just by talking to AI and you'll eventually get a fully functioning prototype and that's what we want to achieve with you today. Remember the primary goal here is to understand

how to interact with AI. The prototype is the isn't the goal, it's the well it's the bonus. So learn how to interact with AI to understand how AI can actually help you solve a problem and

get to the root of it and eventually end up with an idea that can possibly help you solve the problem. And then you'll see how AI platforms these days can rapidly help you without any coding

knowledge build an actual mobile app, web platform, you name it, it'll build it for you as long as you can explain your problem properly. So with that let's jump straight into our workshops

along with our experts who will be joining joining you at our table and I think each table has been assigned a random challenge. You you won't be doing the Asha worker challenge. But that

said, let me actually give you a quick view of what the uh Asha worker looked or the Asha worker challenge actually resulted in. So just give me one moment. I actually

downloaded the PRD and I went ahead and created a solution for this as well. So just give me a moment. This is the platform that we actually use there. There are multiple rapid

build platforms that exist u across the globe. We use this platform called lovable. You can use Google, you can use base 44. There's so many of them. All you have to tell it is here's what I

want my solution to look like. Can you please build it for me? So, we actually built quite a few solutions for you rapidly. And here's what the Asha solution turned out to be.

Which one is it? Give me a moment. I built quite a few for all of you. There we go. So all I did was give that PRD the the complete requirement document. It built

this solution. I made a couple of iterations couple of corrections to the language. The fact that I wanted it to support Gujarati and various other languages from India as well. So if I

was to go ahead and just say something using just voice from anywhere saying um 39 years 58 kilosp. So on the go your asha worker would just talk into her phone and it would take

all of those details that I just said translate it into the language that they were speaking in make that entry directly over here and I could just register that then and there. This

essentially makes that double work to be completely negated. The ability to use natural language to take anything considering that we using servi our own indigenous uh built texttospe and

speakto text engine it can support up to 22 languages Indian languages Indian dialects Indian voices to actually give you all of these details rapid quick solution and this was built within an

hour. So with that in mind, I ask all of you to please go ahead, jump in with your people, see what your challenge is, and try and replicate what I just did over here along with them. And they're

here to support you, and we'll be here to guide you as well. So have fun most importantly. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. &gt;&gt; Hello. I know you're all engrossed but

uh important announcement. Uh wherever you are, you have to uh end in the next two minutes. So if you have crossed diagnose just press enter enter after uh

&gt;&gt; we have a time limit here for the hall so we have to finish it off in next 2 minutes please &gt;&gt; uh we don't have to vacate the hall in 2 minutes but we have to there is

something else we want to do after this okay so uh some summary stats if you look at that out of the 16 apps that you were building 12 have been completed already. So which is a huge

huge achievement. So let's give each ourselves a big applause. Um so now uh so now uh here's the important thing everybody important thing. I would like one volunteer

to come here and show everyone what they have built. Just one. Come on. Thank you ma'am. &gt;&gt; Ma'am and when you do, please tell us who you are and what you have built.

&gt;&gt; One from each table, please. Hello everyone. So I think we all participated from this team on this uh document doctor exercise. I'm myself Anita Mittal. I work with GIS as a lead

for uh social protection program which is dealing with you know digital transformation of social protection. So this topic was very relevant for me. I also consult for the world bank. So both

the profiles is the objective what we aim for. So here we used the way Arun had presented followed all the steps made few changes just to test out you know

not a happy flow but added few things and we were doing the PRD my colleague said you know in the PRD we added generate in a Calvin hop style and there we also made a spelling mistake

purposely to see if it'll or not. So if you will see the screen this is where we have the document doctor and when we were when we build the

document doctor and we had to upload birth certificate as well as a utility bill. Okay I let me step. So the purpose of this document doctor is to verify the

documents that the person brings for service to see that they are accurate so that at the point of service delivery it doesn't happen that you have brought the wrong

documents your documents are too old they are not legible to avoid those issues. So this is pre-checked by the citizen at his own home that all the documents that are going to take for the

appointment are valid. So when we wanted to test this, we took this app and we uploaded few dummy birth certificates which we downloaded from internet and also utility bill. So they were random

birth certificate was from somebody from Canada as you will see Oliver Benjamin. So the tool did that the birth certificate doesn't have the site name and not on the right country. And

obviously when we uploaded the electricity it was from October 2018. So it flagged that it is a very very old birth certificate and it also provided us with guidance that you need to

provide the address proof. &gt;&gt; So I think we like the look and feel. So I should thank my colleague for bringing this nice twist. So it's not a boring document but it's a more comic style UI.

&gt;&gt; Thank you very much. Thank you very much ma'am. Thank you sir. One more volunteer please. That table &gt;&gt; come on please.

&gt;&gt; Yes. Okay. I'm Grio. I'm special DGP from Punjab Kada and I'm looking after community affairs division there. So, uh we were looking we we were we had to

like I'm an income tax officer and I have to draft these uh assessment appeals and so I have to to have a kind of a system where uh I can uh actually uh look at the legal uh framework in

which the order has to be made. So if there is a you know uh assessment which is made by the uh by the uh assesse so whether it uh you know uh is is in accord with the latest judicial

pronouncements and uh and also with the amendments which have happened in the IT act and uh the idea is to have a app will which will assist you. So you just give the

problem statement that some person like the TCS has a you know 20 million uh you know bank balance the statement uh uh claims and uh but when you actually test it out uh I feel that it is not correct.

So then uh that problem statement will be put into the app and then the app will come out with the uh it will go to the various um uh judicial decisions and the acts and uh

take out assessment order and that assessment order can be heard my by me and so we found that while we were doing this that the assessment order so I told I mean I asked him that if the uh there

is some correction and I want to change it so he said that we have not factored it in so we trying to do that. So uh menu this I'm doing in Punjab. million balance sheet.

So assment This is indigenous. now we want to change that. No &gt;&gt; we can they can also listen. &gt;&gt; So just we listen to it. So now if you

want to correct it so then I is it &gt;&gt; it's not playing. Okay. So basically the person who is making the draft he can hear hear it instead of reading the entire 10 pages.

&gt;&gt; So I said then we have to correct it. So for that the app should be Now, I know that we are at the border of time, but I particularly wanted this demo to come in because it's a challenge

that they brought onto the table themselves for the education department. So, it was very unique. Um very good afternoon to all of you and I'm representing my team. Uh I come from

the directorate of higher education government of Goa and um indeed u um thank you to the organizers for setting this vibrant uh room on the real impactful experience. We were very

excited to build this application and this application basically is uh related to the domain of education. Uh so the problem which we are addressing here is uh we are trying to use the classroom

environment as our ground of experiment. We are trying to use the teachers to solve their own problems. Uh that's because uh there is a problem in the schools. So um in the state of Goa I

mean we are trying to uh address to the scenario where we have seen that the schools in south Goa they have uh different nutritionbased problems like day meals which have been provided

across the state are of the same type. However, based on the nutrition patterns and the consumption of food in the different districts, uh the uh health conditions vary. So what we are trying

to do is we are trying to use the teachers to gather the data uh from their classrooms uh the data about the students. So this data is about the height uh weight height weight and BMI

uh parameters of the students with the teacher along with the attendants will be gathering the data about the height and the BMI of the student and in the process we'll be creating the data

corpus. Uh so I would like to specifically mention that this was not the problem statement on the static list which actually TCS had provided and we requested to have this dynamic

problem been added. They were kind enough they said okay let's solve this problem because it's about dynamic solutions. So let's try a dynamic problem. And uh that's how we took it

up. And um further uh we have this particular uh application which was been built through the process which was been guided uh by the team. Uh so we have a overview here as you can see uh there

are there is data which has been inputed for seven students. Uh it shows that the health ratio ratio is 29% action needed. there are three students who are under nutrition and uh the action is needed

towards them. Uh the impact which was asked or the outcome which was asked was that the same day meal should not be provided to the schools because the nutrition conditions vary based on the

nutrition patterns in the c in certain areas of the state. So we can clearly see that uh there are three students who need action and here we are able to see the BMI distribution as well. So we see

that there are uh uh two students who are healthy, there are three who are underweight and so on. So it is giving this analytics. Uh this application is also able to record the data. So I can

simply go here. Well, serum.ai has been used here. uh which allows us to do this in vernacular 22 options. Uh let us try it in Hindi language. Rahul Ka Vajan

Rahul Vanra BMI T. So it's able to record the data here and it's able to give this analysis. Uh it's also able to create the analytics for

the kitchen staff. So because our teachers are helping in a major way in providing uh very useful data to the kitchen and here uh the weight management statistics and the

statistics with regard to certain parameters like ironrich plates should be basically uh curated for this particular scenario and uh this is the data about the students. Well, one of

the stakeholders here is government as well. So uh we can see here that u uh this is the analytics for the government that in this particular school in the month of this is monthly data 50% are

healthy students 40% are underweight students who need attention. So accordingly government can have uh the decision making and solution. Thank you so much.

&gt;&gt; Thank you so much. I'm so sorry. Thank you so much. I will appreciate the TCS for the uh for uh uh for this uh session and the time is very limited 2 minutes. We'll take

two minutes. Uh we have a problem related to the remote village where the nurse is there and the snake bite happens to a kid and how to handle the situation and

for that we have created the AI software. Just go ahead. So what we could see that the solution has been uh received from one language in any language which

can be assessed by the nurse whether from any state. So it will give the SOP and what she has to do and it gives the details how to handle that snake bite and the type of

medication she has to give. &gt;&gt; So otherwise he she he or she has to go the different documents they they don't have the time to assess that this give a very handy solution for them.

&gt;&gt; Thank you very much. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you everyone. I &gt;&gt; Hello. Yeah, thanks everyone. I think uh I could see sense the energy in the room. Uh just wanted to wrap up this

session in one minute. So uh let the slide come. So there are three t key takeaways I would want you to take it up. Number one, first of all, as you have experienced how AI can compress the

time from the idea or the problem to take it to a prototype can be done in the minutes. That's one. Number two, because you can experiment more because the cost of uh you know losing any money

to make a prototype or something is very very low. You can reiterate again and again and again. So AI gives you that power to do more and more experiment. And the last third third thing very

important that's a cultural shift is happening. AI is no more a tech skill. It is a workplace skill just like you understand the PowerPoint uh Excel etc. That's the way the AI has to happen. So

I know that many of you have done it uh completed and somebody really wants to do it again. Uh but it's not the end of this master class or it's actually the start of an AI first nation build

journey right and TCS team is with you. So thank you so much for everyone to take out your time here and work with us and build with us. Thank you everyone. Thank you.

So with this we wrap up our session. Thank you. You could have our email ids and if you want to reach out to us for any help and support we are always there.
