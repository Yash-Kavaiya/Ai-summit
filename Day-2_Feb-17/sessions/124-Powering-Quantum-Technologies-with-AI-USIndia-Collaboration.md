## 📝 Transcript

technology. I would requesting the speakers to come at the front for a for a group photograph. Thank you. Got it.

That means that means I don't have to speak very much. Okay. Uh good afternoon everyone. Uh very interesting to see all this uh interest in the quantum computing

session. So again a very warm welcome to all of you in this um session titled powering computer uh quantum computing with AI. So I'm going to largely read from my notes as the scene setter I've

been given five to seven minutes to speak and uh you know it's a huge topic as I started preparing I realized that you know uh I mean we are um as uh industry practitioners we are barely

scratching the surface. I mean when we go deep into the immense possibilities it's you know this is this is a subject that can you know people can go deep u you know uh do deep research in this and

I believe you know in various corners of the world it's all already happening. So um let me uh set the scene of or the context for the panel discussion that will follow. Um so um I believe that AI

India summit it's a great platform to you know discuss this much needed dialogue on um uh on AI and the potential or the possibilities that it offers to accelerate quantum computing.

Before I dive into this, let me confess that you know I'm not a quantum scientist as such. I mean I read about quantum computing many years ago. uh I'm not going to say how many years back but

enough to you know let you know that I have uh you know over the years acknowledged and observed the pace at which technology has accelerated. Um so in the 1940s when Claude Shannon,

father of uh information theory was asked how computers might one day play chess, he explained that the number of possible moves were was so astronomical in number that no classical computer

could have actually cracked it. But today here in 2026, we know what AI has been able to do. Not only are we playing chess with computers, but AI has been able to create strategies that are

beyond, you know, human comprehension at times. So now marry this possibility that AI has created with the experiment. In fact, I you know when I was reading, I thought I'll correlate with Shinger's

experiment where you know the cat experiment, it is either this or that. And that's exactly what you know quantum offers. It is either zero or one. It could be zero and one at the you know at

the same time. And together AI and quantum then offer this you know possibility of uh you know creating 01 and 0 and one together also. So on one side quantum can give AI a

faster smarter engine for the hardest problems like for example I think huge possibilities I uh I was reading in particularly in the area of drug discovery also you know solving complex

logistic issues or you know construction uh challenges construction designs now in practice what it means is routing and shoulduling across complex supply chains across complex uh formulas in drug

discovery uh exploring larger design spaces and fishing out also frauds as well as anomalies in u you know data [clears throat] on the other side AI also helps us balance quantum hardware

to a large extent by reducing the errors fine-tuning the controls and getting more out of today's imperfect machines if I can call them therefore uh you know AI also acts both as the codes for

quantum as well as conductor for quantum. Uh it learns a devices noise and calibrations and decodes and corrects the errors on the fly and it orchestrates hybrid workflow so that you

know toughest issues can also be resolved um uh by sending it to a you know a very fast complex quantum processor. Now so to put it simply quantum makes you know AI bolder and AI

makes quantum steadier. So they are you know complimentary to each other in my view. Now with that uh I think there are five takeaways that I'm going to of course you know it's a huge subject but

I thought for today's session there are five key takeaways I would like to put on the table for us to discuss and perhaps our panelists also to touch upon.

speed for the heavy lifts. For example, you know, some jobs, some AI jobs, I mean, we know that AI has huge GPU requirement. So, AI jobs take forever because they depend on sampling and

research and on compute and quantum, you know, in terms of its cubits and the other possibilities. It gives us new shortcuts. Uh so certain tasks could move from you know months to hours also

if you use quantum better optimization whether moving goods across one location between locations uh pricing a portfolio or designing a new drug for that matter. Quantum can explore the whatifs more

efficiently as I said you know zero and one and both at the same time. The sweet spot today is hybrid of course lets you know AI manage the workflow and send the highest sub problems to quantum and it

helps uh fresh eyes on uh complex data. It can project uh data into shapes that classical systems can't easily see. Uh that can reveal patterns we've been missing in you know particularly in

fraud and uh anomaly detection. Also AI keeps quantum on track. So think of deep learning as you know the pilot for today's quantum devices. So detecting correcting preventing and then

correcting and preventing correcting and preventing and so on so forth so that we get more reliable answers at the end of it and u generative power. So obviously you know quantum uh the you know the

potential of quantum is in its randomness and AI also I think thrives on the randomness. So together they offer that uh potential. Now uh this uh dialogue is also very relevant and

opportune because we are having this in the AI summit today and US India collaboration has uh made it possible for us to have this uh much neededed dialogue. So we are aligned on this

direction and in recent years I believe US and um India have built a shared tech agenda that explicitly names AI and quantum as joint priorities. uh US brings cutting edge hardware, cloud,

access to quantum systems and a deep research and algorithms. India has of course a huge demographic dividend and an extraordinary talent base that we offer a vibrant startup scene and a

national quantum mission with hubs at premium instit institutions like IAS and IITs. We can also do this at uh scale networks like USIBC and uh quadlink investor platforms are finally set up to

move into uh real pilots and procurement. So let's dive also into what we can do perhaps you know after the u summit couple of goals maybe we could take um you know for for uh maybe

the next uh until the next time we meet. So uh we could lead industry uh you know uh industry could lead with some real pilots. So there could be pilots around uh drug discovery or around financial

risk optimization or logistics routing. Uh set up uh quantum and AI center of excellence. Uh we could look at uh you know pairing a US national lab or a university with NQM hub and premium

institutions in India. This can also focus on hybrid algorithms and AI assisted error correction uh methods. Build these supply chains together. So quantum you know it's it isn't just a

you know processor it's also control electronics photonics and lot of tongue twisting terminology that I'll skip u it also u uh so India's semiconductor push here can diversify these components US

can US can partner and it can bring in the tool chains and the standards for us to jointly work on this agenda co-und a line or two that are quantum grade uh launch

uh skilling programs, fellowships on quantum and AI uh you know uh create a rotating exchange for our PhD students. foster research in this area. Uh also you know uh maybe uh embed this into the

curriculum have early career engineers across national quantum mission hubs your slabs and hypers scale AI teams and there are there is you know there is much more uh which I think the panel

will also delve into for the u for the uh for the maybe you know for the concrete goals for next couple of months. I think two key takeaways for me would be to focus on skilling you know

with particularly if we are able to sort of set up the center of excellence and also uh on the technology transfer particularly for the semiconductor India semiconductor mission. So therefore I

believe that the promise is there but it's uh about how we leverage this collaboration also between us and India to co-create trustworthy secure technology that serves people at scale

and we have the frameworks the talent the market and the will to uh dive further in into this. So uh with this um thank you so much for your attention and uh you know welcome you all again to

this session and uh I think with this now we'll move into the panel discussions. Thank you once again. [applause] &gt;&gt; Well thank you for that. Um well first

of all I think you see two Brandon Peters up there. One is the real Brandon Peter, the other is a deep fake. So I'll let you all guess which. Um anyway, no, I'm I'm Jordan Krenshaw.

I'm senior vice president at the US Chamber of Commerce's technology engagement center. Uh the chamber is the world's largest business federation representing uh small all the way up to

to large companies uh that operate globally. Um and so we've got an action-packed panel here to talk about uh quantum and marrying it up with artificial intelligence. Um you know, I

think a couple things to know about what we've done at the chamber. uh actually last year uh in Feb as uh we deal with issues around encryption which we'll get into a little

bit later as well really getting into internal uh international cooperation uh expanding research and development much like we heard uh India is doing as well too and really taking a riskbased

regulatory approach approach when it comes to quantum. Um, you know, other other things that are obviously key in this issue area are uh supply chain resilience. So, it's going to have

everything from needing the right cooling equipment to uh the right uh semiconductors in place uh for us to get to that point where quantum is is ubiquitous. Uh and but at the same time,

we've been pursuing legislation in the United States as well. there was the national quantum initiative act that has lapsed that we continue to support its reauthorization uh to really advance

research and development uh in this field. So a lot is going on the chamber u really believes this is going to be a gamechanging technology when you marry that up especially with AI. Um but what

I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead and uh kind of start with a lightning round and a little bit of intros uh for folks just so they can introduce themselves uh on the panel. Uh so

Brandon, I'm going to start with you. Uh, I'm going to ask you to introduce yourself and then I'm going to ask a question to every panelist. What is your favorite sci-fi or science show uh that

you watch on television? &gt;&gt; Yeah. First off, I first off, I'll take the Brendan on the left from the hair perspective. So, uh, thank you for whoever did that. Uh, I may I may

appropriate that. I'm Brendan Peter. I lead global public policy and government affairs for Zcaler. Zcaler is a uh, zerorust network architecture cyber security company. We secure 500 billion

transactions a day uh and pioneered really reimagining of zero trust network architectures. I don't have a show per se, but I I'll I'll make a very weird uh sort of example. So, uh one of my

favorite bands is a Canadian band called Rush. They have a dystopian song called 2112 which is set about the the the the uh uh killing of music in a future society that's run by great computers.

So that's what I think about sometimes when it comes to this topic. &gt;&gt; Okay. Hello everyone. uh Amit Singhi I am director of IBM research in India which includes work we do both on the AI

side and on quantum for IBM um and uh in terms of my favorite sci-fi show it doesn't exist but I wish someone would make it which is take the Isaac Asimov series and convert it into a series

right &gt;&gt; maybe we can use AI to make one &gt;&gt; maybe there you go &gt;&gt; I'm Sep Kumar Uh I am the CEO of LNT semiconductor.

Uh I've been there two years. I've spent 42 years in this industry started back in 84 when the first computers were built.

And interestingly, sci-fi, the first landing on the moon. Also, there was a movie that came out called Space Odyssey 2001. And the Space Odyssey 2001 was more

exciting than the actual landing on the moon, [laughter] &gt;&gt; more dramatic. Thank you Sep. Good afternoon everyone. It's great to be here. I'm Gopal

Ranganatan. Uh I'm the CEO of a startup company based in Chicago uh Quad Optima. Uh I also have u an advisory company Quad. Um we are focused on

um building numerical uh large and small language models uh distinct from uh language models like chat GPT and all works mostly on numerical data but I'll talk about that

later if the topic arises but um in terms of science fiction uh I must say my favorite science fiction show has always been Star Trek Um,

but more recently I've I've been a fan of uh Carl Sean's Cosmos. It's a fantastic series. Uh, and also lately I've been uh quite a big fan of Jim Khalili who's a

professor at uh University of Sari. He makes some fantastic uh podcasts and shows. recommend anyone wants to get to know more about consciousness or uh quantum mechanics and things, try to

follow him. Yeah. Thanks. &gt;&gt; Um and I'll actually open up with mine, too. Um how many of you actually watch Star Trek the Next Generation? Any of you? Hands up. All right, we got a few.

All right. Um and I think it kind of pairs well with what we're talking about. Um you know, we had Lieutenant Commander Data. He was an artificial intelligence. uh uh he was an android

but then sometimes he had to plug into the enterprise to the ship which was kind of the supercomputer and and that's kind of like quantum is today and and so you know I think as we look at this

issue here we see the merging of these two different technologies I think we see a lot of of of really optimal potential that's going to come from that so I mean I I wanted to to kind of start

with you I IBM has been a big proponent of of quantum centric computing um can you talk a little bit about how how you're merging uh AI AI uh into quantum processing uh and and some some notes

you want the audience to know about that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Hello. Yeah, that works. Uh so quantum centric supercomputing what first maybe

it's worth just taking 10 seconds. What what is that? Uh I think everyone knows what supercomputing is or high performance computing you know where you have a lot of processes tied together in

an architecture that allows you to run these extremely complex computational problems in some kind of tractable time. Uh and one of the applications of quantum is to accelerate that kind of

workload. uh because HPC in supercomputing is trying to approximate nature with u some kind of approximate numerical methods and um there's a promise of quantum that you may not have

to approximate you can actually run the same quantum states uh on the machine using cubits which would take that approximation away and scale better right so

that linkage leads to this supercomputing concept and quantum centric because uh we we do see that it's not going to be just quantum it's going to be a combination of quantum and

classical very likely classical will be using GPU or other kinds of accelerators because the you know a part of the classical part will be also HPC kind of workload um so that's what quantum

supercomputing is about and when we talk about leveraging AI and quantum um you know it it comes comes in at different layers. I talked about GPUs and QPUs working together for these hybrid

workloads. Um that involves accelerating the stack that lets you program both, right? So where it starts with is things like PyTorch and Kiskit. So you need to make sure that the machine runs fast and

the workloads run fast because if you're going to use it for accelerating uh supercomputing workloads, then you cannot have slow uh foundations. We do a lot of work on both sides on improving

Kiskit as a programming SDK for quantum and also on PyTorch working closely with the broader PyTorch ecosystem to u make it better generalize it as new hardware and new models AI models emerge. So that

sets the foundation you know that programming layer sets the foundation for innovating at the intersection of quantum and AI. Uh another piece that's important is the middleware. Uh because

if you leave it all to the developer to figure out how to program the quantum separately and the AI separately, you know, that that will not lead to scaling and innovation and for running workloads

uh that actually leverage both sides optimally. So there's a lot of work happening on creating that middleware connection between the classical and the quantum uh so that you can program at a

more abstract level and then the middleware takes care of distributing the workload choosing the right venue for it whether it's the GPU side or the QPU side

&gt;&gt; and then of course &gt;&gt; okay I'll close it out quickly with uh Uh the most uh obvious one is of course the use cases and uh there um you know you can have quantum being used to make

AI better. Uh either as uh you know for example recently there was some early work from HSBC showing how you can use uh quantum computers to map bond trading data into a into a latent space where

classical machine learning did a better job. Right? Or you could go deeper and you say okay instead of using classical neural networks I'll use quantum neural networks or you know quantum kernels as

part of the actual AI. Um but then there's the flip side where using AI to make quantum better and there's a lot of interesting work there because quantum itself quantum computing for example you

write a you have a problem you want to map map it into a quantum circuit that's a non-trivial task and if you can train an AI with reinforcement learning techniques or other techniques to do

that mapping better so you get a more optimal mapping of your problem statement onto the quantum hardware that's an improvement of quantum with AI Right. Um so there are all of these

interesting synergies that remain to be explored and we're very active in that. &gt;&gt; Uh Kabal I have a question for you. I I think obviously as we look at the the Indian enterprise sector which is very

costconcious and results driven um I think it's important that we look at the commercialization uh piece of this and and when it comes to quantum where do you see the lowhanging fruit you know is

it the financial sector is it uh other sectors or other use cases that we're not thinking about like where do where do you see that we initially start to get that ROI for quantum

&gt;&gt; yeah that's u that's a really interesting question Peter Um quantum is still uh sorry [laughter] quantum is still a few years away in terms of the hardware

uh being able to allow most of the uh even quantum inspired algorithms to work to deliver ROI. So I would say there is a three-pronged layer that I would like to

think of it in terms of a short-term, medium-term, long-term for the quantum road map. The short term would be problem sets like in supply chain analytics or in portfolio optimization

where pairing um and variables that are um binomial in nature uh either you're in or you're out type of thing. Those kinds of problem sets are today easily encoded uh and

solved to some extent with about 50 to max 100 uh cubit computers still and those can be solved on digital computers today with efficient hardware. So that's the short-term road map. Uh significant

improvement in network routting or supply chain logistics types of applications. The medium term I would say uh you would have applications which begin to get more complex uh like uh

quantum approximate optimization which require uh a full set of uh like what Amit was talking about uh a quantum circuitry with the help of AI you kind of calibrate all the parameters and you

start improving the performance you reduce the errors the the latency and things like that and you get much more accurate answers out of the quantum system. That's medium-term and for that

I would say most of the uh generic applications in in businesses could be the medium-term. The large term I would say is really high performance quantum computing. That's still a few years

away. We're talking about thousand and much higher cubit machines with quantum algorithms that are significantly improved by then. Those would be um large macroeconomic problems, you know,

uh global problems, uh things like um weather, climate control, uh those kinds of things. I think they are a bit farther away for quantum computing to solve today, but it's the longer term. I

would say between 5 to 10 year time frame. &gt;&gt; Cindy, question for you. I think one of the things we talk about in the quantum side, you know, obviously there's a

software piece, but there's a hardware piece to this as well. And uh quantum is going to require more specialized, you know, silicon and control uh equipment. Where do you see India playing a role in

the supply chain for quantum? &gt;&gt; Quantum is actually quite interesting. Why the actual silicon is not very

complicated. uh controlling that silicon, moving the data from that silicon in and out and maintaining the error rate which requires

operating it at 2° Kelvin uh which is where you can have these quantum states still be in a somewhat predictable form. So the cooling systems if you look at it

are the size of this room. Well maybe not but very large and the quantum cubit is you know small little chip inside. So the cooling systems are difficult but not very complicated in the end in the

bigger picture. uh and therefore India has a big uh opportunity in creating quantum machines. Uh as far as the hardware is concerned uh quantum is actually people say

quantum computers but the IBM quantum computer operates differently than the Google and that operates differently than the Microsoft. Each one is using a different uh

atomic physics uh spin or shingers or the Neil Boore's atom physics. So the question here is you know which path to take actually and that's more of a uh some things will

operate at 2° Kelvin and some things in theory are saying we can go up to liquid nitrogen which is 77 Kelvin. there's very few if any research even on materials that allows it to operate at

room temperature. Uh because the noise in the system is higher than whatever the statistical variation you're trying to find out. So that's kind of so India does have a big play but it's at the I

would say a very early stage in the process. One thing I would like to kind of sometimes we get uh maybe

quantum and AI and this recent AI buzz. the way to think of it is all this AI that is happening today running on these GPUs consuming now 10% of the energy of the

world. is about the same as probably a 100 human beings and what quantum offers is how the brain works achieving that kind of performance

at a power that is I mean how much power do you consume and that's the beauty it's a statistical approach versus a 01 and a brute force approach where I have to convert everything one and then

figure out from there. &gt;&gt; Fascinating. Um, next question is from my fellow uh Brendan. Um, going back to my favorite show Star Trek, there was a character named Q.

And, uh, he was viewed as a super intelligent being. He was always kind of feared with trepidation. A little bit kind of similar with Qday, which is a term uh, that is the day we hit quantum

and and and hit the potential security threats that could come with that. So, so Brendon, as as as Qday approaches, um, what should US and Indian companies be thinking as they're trying to to

integrate things like proquantum cryptography uh into their business plans? Well, I mean it's we've been talking about quantum for decades and the reality is from a a threat actor

perspective, you know, the the understood notion of harvest now, decrypt later continues to be an exceedingly difficult challenge because adversaries globally have been actively

harvesting information from enterprises for decades in anticipation of a true quantum computer and the stress and the need from government standardization bodies. Uh I would say in particular

NIST in the US has obviously begun to approve PQC algorithms. Um the business imperative and the security imperative is real and it's now uh I would say an admonition to every enterprise around

the globe really is they must begin their journey to postquantum cryptography in haste. Um you know and from our perspective at Cscaler you know there are things that you can do as

you're navigating that transition which can help do proper network segmentation but the underlying peril and promise of of quantum is is really security and so the velocity with which those threats

are going to continue to accelerate I think is something that often is understood in the abstract but not in in the tactical and operational side of things. And so um it's fundamentally

imperative to the success of your business, your enterprise to national governments to safeguard confidential, proprietary, sensitive data today by beginning your migration as quickly as

possible. &gt;&gt; And you know, I think it's it's an area I think people need to look at. I mean, we've seen really fascinating numbers, particularly even like with the

financial services sector, the projections of how much financial loss could happen uh if once we get to that point, if if companies aren't ready. Um, all right. A little bit of a speed round

uh before we kick off to our next round of questions and and Brendon, I'll start with you. Uh, how long, if you were to, if you're betting here, do you think before we actually get to uh, ubiquitous

quantum and quantum and and where we're looking at it going? &gt;&gt; I would ask my IBM colleague here on the panel to make a better predict. I mean, there are different different Qday

models around the globe. I think I'm not expert enough to say from a technical side when we reach that point but you know the window continues to narrow and that means that the preparations and the

defenses that organizations are putting in place have to accelerate at a commensurate pace. So I can't say with any certainty of a date but the you know the reality and the risks are quite

clear and we all need to be doing more to migrate today. &gt;&gt; Same question. Yes. &gt;&gt; Okay. Uh oh, you're taking like a poll, I guess. [laughter]

&gt;&gt; Quick quick lightning round. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, I mean, uh I would reason through it a bit in the quickly is that 2029 is when IBM expects to have our first fault tolerant machines, which

means they will be hardly susceptible to noise and so you can actually start implementing real quantum information science algorithms on them. But those will be in the range of a few hundred

logical cubits. 20 33 34 is when we expect getting into the 100,000 logical cubit range. That starts getting interesting. But that's IBM. We don't know where China

is. So I would say sometime in the 2030s is what we're saying. pass &gt;&gt; uh quantum compute I think he both of them answered the question

but there's something side quantum is quantum sensing quantum in cryptography quantum compute quantum communications and compute is talked about but actually

cryptography we had this earlier conversation. The threat is coming in 2 3 years and it is reverse. Meaning any system I have today,

if I build a passport that will ations which is a little bit of uh how do I transmit this information from A to B because I can compute but if I can't

move that data and I can't move that volume of data my bottleneck in the system will be the data movement and I think that will get solved before the quantum compute problem gets solved

&gt;&gt; question Yes. &gt;&gt; So, uh my take is more or less along the lines of what the rest of the panelists have said about in terms of quantum computer and and a time

period for which uh of one of significant cubit capability is there for us to solve the problems. But I think there is another path that quantum inspired and quantum algorithms will

start taking in I think in the near future in about 2 to three years you'll start seeing that my view is that um just like there was a reinterpretation that happened in the 1920s about uh the

Schroinger wave function was explained in a different way by Heisenberg and the whole quantum mechanics took uh different view of it. I think there is a

there is a much uh needed requirement for the businesses, the governments and everybody to start understanding that we live about the algorithms that are required

which you which are classified today as NP hard and difficult problems. to solve could be solved in a different paradigm. So I think a design approach and an algorithmic approach and a software

enabling all that on today type of compute is also an alternative possibility of the route. So I think that might yield results in the in the near term but if we if that doesn't

transpire then probably you know as the panel said mid 2030s. Uh Amit a question for you. Um you know there's been a lot of talk about first

of all on the AI side access to AI and access to to learning about it. But that question also now comes up in quantum. So how do we go about ensuring in particular that Indian startups and

universities get their hands on this tech and actually uh use it and and play around with it as opposed to just having it be theoretical. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a good point. Um well at

IBM we put our first quantum computers on the cloud 10 years ago 2016 that was a small machine 5 cubits. Uh today all the machines are 100 plus cubits. All of the older ones are retired because below

100 plus cubits it's not quantum computing anymore. Um and for years we've had a free tier and actually the second highest unique user base out of all countries is from India using the

free tier. So there's a tremendous amount of hunger in the learner ecosystem in India. These are you know college students, school students, professionals who are already

programming quantum computers uh for real. But of course in a learning setting these are not like papers. they're not writing papers. That needs more sustained access and that of course

needs a commercial arrangement. Um that's one thing. Now what what we're also trying to do more specifically in India is trying to increase um indigenous access by working with um the

center working with the state. For example, we have a great collaboration shaping up with the Andhra Pradesh government uh where uh the government wants to establish what they're calling

as a quantum valley uh at Amraati the capital of the state and uh we are partnering to bring the IBM quantum machine the system to there so that it's locally deployed in the country and can

support um a lot of the algorithmic research that will probably be funded by the national quantum mission or by other initiatives in the country keeping the data keeping the IP keeping all the

expertise within the country. Uh and through that we are enabling more seamless access uh where local partners such as uh TCS has partnered to enhance the cloud access that we provide to make

you know to have more outreach within um the Indian ecosystem. So the more we see these things happening I think uh we we we'll see I think access is not the hard problem today uh I think the

harder problem in India today is building the capacity to utilize the access for the uh you know kind of more expertise levels um and that's where I think where as governments are putting

in more funding to catalyze that kind of uh research because today most of the workload is research uh right algorithmic research and as that happens I think the access will just follow.

Yeah. &gt;&gt; Kapal um question for you is as we're looking at um US India collaboration on quantum do you believe that should be driven by government to government or

businessto business uh partnerships? um frankly um innovation u like AI innovation and and now we're talking about quantum and quantum and AI

innovation in the future is uh is primarily going to come from um lot of small businesses medium and large businesses driving that

innovation &gt;&gt; and governments uh backing them up uh in terms of uh lot of uh capital allocation uh special impetus being given for

startups and things like that. So it's it's definitely a hybrid. It is not government to government interactions or businessto business interactions but a lot of the innovation will come from

businesses working with other businesses and working with the government. So instead of just two lines saying it's business to business or government to government, I think we have a multi-

um quadilateral type of thing where all the diagonals are also connected and so literally it's multinational and uh startups in one country will be working with

businesses in other countries and also with governments possibly in other countries. So while the idea of sovereign uh AI and things like that are gaining currency, I I believe that for

true innovation is crossborder and like someone said in one of the panels that I saw today, intelligence uh you know does not stop at the border. So everything is going to be global and uh the backing

should come from government. It should come from large enterprises and innovation which is largely going to happen on the private sector side should be encouraged wholesale. That's an

excellent point you brought about uh even the small business side uh benefiting from quantum. We've even heard that from some of the uh uh startups uh particularly in the Bay Area

that they're really excited about small business use of quantum. Um on the AI side, we've also seen this as well too where we've seen that 60% of small businesses in the US are using AI and

80% of those are actually increasing their workforce the ones who are incorporating artificial intelligence. So you know you start adding something like quantum to the mix you know it can

be a gamecher um seep obviously there's going to be a difference in quantum data centers than we've seen in other uh technologies. Do you think that the the manufacturing base is ready and is

preparing for quantum computing at this point? &gt;&gt; I think too early for them to be ready, right? So we do have we are putting a quantum computer in our data center for

hybrid workloads but reality is uh and this is at L&amp;T but the reality is the quantum work is still at a research level on the software right algorithmic kind of sidetrack to my question but the

relationship that is most important today is university to university. Uh if you look at you know the early generation uh of India back in the 80s when the

computers and the machines were coming in IBM put their machine you know the first m computer which was the size of this room at the universe IIIT Delhi and then at IIT Kpur

they had a difference. So that is the relationship required to build the workforce to build that intelligent uh you know people who can program quantum machines because that program is very

different than programming a CPU and create the right algorithms to leverage and they will come out of college and they will create the real uh future. I think that relationship is

[snorts] very critical and then yes to answer your other question 2030 is when the data centers are coming that's this is the holy grail right the same data center that you are talking about I need

a gawatt of power or however you want to move it with a quantum machine you are running it like a PC that same power that is the scale of quantum compute uh you're bringing a data just like 84 IBM

machine like the size of this room came into my PC by 2000 same way the quantum computer which is if you were to conceptualize a million bit cubit machine would be the

size of this room in 20 years it will be on my PC that's the com that's the power right so that's &gt;&gt; good point

&gt;&gt; Brendan I I think one of The other big pieces, you know, we've talked about some of the risks that come with with quantum. Um, obviously we have to have a public policy perspective when it comes

to the regulatory environment. How how do we uh either in the US or in India navigate the the regulatory challenges in the regulatory environment, things like export controls, uh, sovereignty

um, what are your thoughts and suggestions around that? &gt;&gt; Well, uh, you know, I would say two things. Obviously, you know, critical for quantum uptake globally is going to

be uh an issue largely focused on talent as well. And we're at an inflection point obviously with some significant disagreements between our two countries on immigration related matters. Um, one

thing I would say that, you know, perhaps doesn't get as as much attention, which I take as a bit of a a positive development and something that must be really feverishly preserved is,

you know, when when the US Bureau of Industry and Security, which is our export control agency, set rules for quantum in 2024, they created something under export control law, which is uh

ancept exception to a deemed exports. And so in in the export world under US control systems, a BIS would consider an export to be deemed when a foreign national accessed a techn sensitive

technology that was covered by export control regulations. Um when they promulgated some policies in 2024, they created an exception to this process in recognition of the fact that while in

much of technology access to shared talent was critical, perhaps that's nowhere as as much pronounced as it comes to quantum technologies. And so I think one of the things frankly from our

side in the US that you we really have to be sure that that deemed export exception is preserved to facilitate constant sharing and access to knowledge and resources that will advance our

capabilities in quantum. &gt;&gt; Um I think we have now enough time I think where I want to have kind of a final question. Um a minute each um and I'll start with you Brendan. Um where do

you think the biggest bottlenecks are and do you have any parting words? Uh well, I mean I I think talent certainly is one as I just mentioned. Pardon me. Um you know I I believe in time that

that will be something that we hopefully see will continue to be addressed in a positive fashion. I do think in the policy side as well as I was just discussing when it comes to export

controls that's a critical area. Um you know the the other is you know I would say from our perspective obviously as a cyber security company that you know we're at a bottleneck now in terms of

organizations embrace of PQC and we have to change understanding and urgency in businesses to prepare for the inevitable. &gt;&gt; Same question.

&gt;&gt; Yes. Uh and I guess bottlenecks for India is &gt;&gt; uh India or US you pick. &gt;&gt; I see. Okay. U maybe I'll take India because I spend more time here. Um is uh

and and some of this is actually captured in this uh report that we did with NITIO on uh quantum road map for India and uh talent is one. Um the other two big areas are private industry

involvement and investment. Um the actual users and the use case owners are private industry. You know the chemical companies, the healthcare companies, the logistics companies. Um

I don't think they understand what quantum means for their business in India and you know engaging and investing unless that happens the demand won't realize to actually create the

pull. um make our lab to market and our innovation you know scientific research and lab tomarket machinery much more efficient so that we can you know

accelerate that process of um with sort of advanced scientific breakthroughs. Sadep &gt;&gt; I think the biggest bottleneck to

quantum is that today if I want to program a IBM machine it is different than how to program a Google machine it is different than how to program a Amazon machine and until it comes into a

common framework that every application software developer at the middleware and upper layer is able to forget the abstraction ction at the low level it will not take off because I it's kind of

like until the Android came the application market did not take off because everybody had to go into the operating system of the phone to figure out how to build an app once Android

came everybody was an app developer and so that's what is needed and that's missing right now &gt;&gt; I'll let you bring it home Kapal uh your thoughts on the bottlenecks and any f

final words. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Um, well, I I feel that the bottleneck really is the fact that quantum is very physics oriented today and it's likely

going to be in the next few years. Uh, it's like a black box. You take real world problems, real world understanding and you give it to a physics machine to to do something as solderic and bring it

back to you. So I think the bottleneck is in realizing that everything is quantum. Uh you you start making the data and the world processing in quantum ways and I think B

theorem was pivotal. um B rule and B theorem and B reasoning was pivotal in changing AI and I think B rule is again going to be very pivotal in changing quantum to to bringing it out of the

physics realm and into the you know every &gt;&gt; give a round of applause I think for our panelists right here as &gt;&gt; [applause]

[cheering] &gt;&gt; Hi, I would requesting the speakers to just come forward for another picture please. &gt;&gt; It needs a new setting.

&gt;&gt; You have to [snorts] come on this side. You're coming. Yes.
