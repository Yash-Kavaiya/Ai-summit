## 📝 Transcript

I'm Gopal Jen. Uh I am one of the co-founders of Gaja Capital. Gaja Capital is a homegrown firm with 27 years of history of investing in [clears throat] Indian startups and

growth capital and growth stage firms. I went to I uh went to IT Delhi for an education at an early age. I grew an interest in investing and technology. uh at Gaja Capital uh we are one of the

founding members of IDTA which is the Indian deep tech investors association and we as a group are also committed to fostering deep tech investing in India and we along with the others have

committed we have made some deep tech investments we've committed to make more deep tech investments what are the other ways in which we connect with deep tech it's through our giving program we have

a giving program called gaja gives and through that we've supported we'll talk about it to universities ities and um I'm very excited to be here. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you.

&gt;&gt; My name is Sat Pai. I'm the founding partner, CFO and ESU officer of 314 Capital. We're a homegrown VC fund that invests into technology and technology enabled companies with a special focus

on deep tech as well. In addition to that, I do a fair amount of work when it comes to leasing with the regulators and the government when it comes to public policy. Uh I'm an executive committee

chair of the committee member of the Indian venture capital association. I'm also the co-chair of regulatory affairs and sit on the apex uh the policy formation body by sebi when it comes to

alternative investments in the country. So I think deep tech is one of those areas that's truly been the alternative of alternatives where it be fantastic to see it get mainstream as of now. I would

love to actually speak more about what that means what the policy scaffolding and regulatory architecture should look like and how we can end up taking the handbreaks on Indian innovation and

truly allow entrepreneurs spirits to end up actually being unleashed. &gt;&gt; Thank you Sudat. We just have Nishad joined us. Nishad please. &gt;&gt; Yeah, thank you so much. Sorry for the

chaos. Uh looks like we are celebrating here. Thank you so much for being present. So much numbers here. My name is Nishid Desai. I happen to be founder of Nishid Desai Associate Indiacentric

Global Law Firm. So we focus on futuristic technologies. look 10 to 20 years from now and try to see what new things will be happening and what would be the future strategic legal tax

ethical issues. So more on that side. So we try to shape the future of law. Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; Thank you Nishidai. Uh we also have as Gopal mentioned uh this program was

organized along with Matei by IDTA Indian Deep Tech Association. Uh we have uh Shiram and Arun here from IDTA and Celeste. Um thank you and &gt;&gt; [applause]

&gt;&gt; um I want to say a few words &gt;&gt; and sh &gt;&gt; and sh sorry and shiv &gt;&gt; chief architect. &gt;&gt; It's great to see all of you here and

this is really interesting to have all our IDM members of many of the executive committee members coming together on this panel. I want to particularly thank Chris for lending his time and for all

his encouragement to what we're all trying to accomplish. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Um my name is Sudhi. I am from Chirat Ventures. We've been investing in India for actually this is

our 20th year and u apart from normal investments we do deep tech investments also. We've done about $300 million worth of deep tech investments in the last 10 years uh and very proud to be

here uh intermingling with yourself. uh before I start the session there's a lot of people at the back now because deep tech is very young and we have a lot of young founders here and young uh

investors and ecosystem players maybe and I overheard Gopal say this the younger people maybe want to sit down in the front &gt;&gt; it's not a bad idea right though it

means but that's normal in a startup right [laughter] so if you're okay some of the younger members maybe 20 of you can come here so that we can interact more at the front.

&gt;&gt; This will be the only session in the whole of AI summit where people were sitting on the floor. &gt;&gt; We're used to sitting on &gt;&gt; Yeah. [laughter]

Thank you very much. &gt;&gt; Excellent. &gt;&gt; Yeah, if the doors can close that'll be helpful. Okay, while people settle down um again

so let me start we are talking about deep tech we'll be talking about the three areas the capital reality check the AI and beyond thesis I think in India deep AI is a very big theme right

now of the conference but we are talking about beyond thesis in robotics in space and other places also um policy framework and last but not the least the role of academic institution initutions

as innovations uh engines in the country. As a prelude to our discussion, let me give you some numbers. UTA has tied up with venture intelligence and we have somebody from venture intelligence

here. &gt;&gt; Yes. Um &gt;&gt; we are releasing India's first um uh uh deep tech report at 3 p.m. uh which is in collaboration with uh venture

indulgence uh NDA uh as such and you'll find that's very very interesting what's coming out as such but let me give you some highlights not to steal away the thunder uh as such deep tech investments

in India since 2015 have covered over 1,200 companies about 28 billion worth of investment so it's not that small for India and if we look at just AI and again some of these definitions because

they were they were in the past years may vary a little bit from current definitions but leaving aside those uh you know corrections which have to be made uh 12 billion have been in AI. This

includes native AI. This includes all the six seven layers of AI and also the enablement of lei in perhaps you know as RDF defines it in in companies which are in agriculture and so on so forth and

only in 2025 DPEG investments were about 5 billion uh and in AI was half that about two and a half so it's not small for India it's actually pretty big uh overall and by stage interestingly

70% was in growth and late stage. So I think there are many initiatives which have been taken in the country and we'll discuss some of those initiatives today

as how early stage can also become a much much bigger allocation uh overall. So with that let me start off and as you know I have to change from paper to digital

u the conference [clears throat] the first session is on capital reality check uh and I'm going to address u this question uh to Sadhart how do you Sedhart Gopal and uh um uh

Wardan how do you think Siddhart about capital formation in India as it exists today and specifically if you could comment on the RDIF intervention and the impact of that and then I'll go

to the next panelist. So deep tech has always been one of the it's always been a focus sector for a number of Indian investors but I don't think it's been the primary bulwark or the nucleus of

their entire portfolio because what happens a number of deep tech companies as you know very long gestation periods higher risk much higher risk that ends up actually entailing there's single

product rates or single feature risk that's actually inherent in the business model itself and even when it comes to the acquisition framework I don't think we have as many active acquirers of IP

in those particular areas of what existed compared to what we're seeing as of now so what we have actually seen especially of the of recent times is three broad changes. One is the LP

appetite which has now actually become a lot stronger for longer gestation products for fund managers who don't mind actually spending 15 20 years because the biggest issue that people

had with Indian venture and Indian VC was the fact that exist the mistransation of paper gains to actual hard cash. I think what we've seen in the IPO market as of now has actually

shown that Indian assets can find buyers in the public market as well. They can perform exceptionally well over there. Therefore, if they've actually seen this happen with the initial thrust of techn

technology-led [snorts] companies, there's a lot more appetite to end up actually going deeper into the entire stack as of now. That's number one. The second thing we've also seen

and this is something that the RDI fund has actually done. The bridge between research to actual development and commercialization I think has actually become a lot stronger as of now.

Previously a large amount of intellectual research would actually be done over here but developed and actually research out in the west. We we will talk about the university systems

the endowments and what that entire ecosystem ends up actually looking like also over there that research part has now actually gotten become a lot stronger because funds like the RDI

initiatives by departments like DST and matey Harach actually allow these research to start commercialization of their structures and of their structures and to actually give them the support

that they need. The third is actually the maturity of the the entire Indian startup ecosystem. Previously the founder was a jack of all trades where they would have to end up actually being

the chief scientist, the product, the CEO, the product engineer, the chief compliance officer, the chief accountant, the chief hiring officer, the chief marketing guy, everything

needs to end up actually happening. But now we've seen a lot more bench strength where quality talent can end up actually going far deeper into what they have to and the support system actually exists

and even the VCs as well are no longer just a providers of capital. Each of them have as a platform team. They give a large amount of support. They help you to end up actually solving those

problems. So those are the three changes we've seen from the last 10 years till now and the RDI has now become a nucleus around which a large amount of capital formation can happen by being up to 50%

of the funds by giving grants over to research to development across the various TRL stages that actually exist. We've actually seen a government program that is acting far more far more like

the private sector than the private sector ended up actually envisioning. And I think that is something that we're grateful for. But as usual because this is deep tech. It's a long gestation

period. I think everyone's just waiting for the one lakh cr to get spent in like a year and a half is not going to happen. It will take five, six, seven years to happen and results will take

another decade after that to come. But I think this initial enthusiasm translating to actual investments and then translate to exits and outcomes that is something that I'm actually

looking forward to the most. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Um maybe I can ask a different question to um Gopal. Gopal [clears throat] uh two questions to you. one what do you see the role of domestic

capital uh non RDF and how do you think that is propelling itself in the country and second is RDF is 1 lakh crores which in today's currency is about 11 billion and as I think Saddat mentioned we are

talking about 50% coming from private capital to supplement that that's an essential uh key u uh regulatory uh requirement which basically means that whether it is a 10ear cycle for

disbbursement or a 15ear cycle and deep tech requires that long cycle. Um private capital needs to be raised by fund managers and companies about $22 billion. How do you see that happening

in the country? Over to Gopal. Just to give some perspective, I mean about say 25 years ago, Indian venture capital and private equity was about a billion dollars a year. Uh everybody

still talks in billions. So I'm going to stick to that. And today the industry has grown to about $40 billion. So for the entrepreneurs in this room, there's $40 billion annually that investors

invest in uh say the startup ecosystem. Um India's deep tech investing is what roughly about $2 billion a year now, right? So we are where it it's a very good number. You know, we are where uh

uh the entire venture capital and private equity ecosystem was say 20 years ago. We have a long way to go. uh you know China is at about order of magnitude say 100 billion 80 to be exact

the US is at 150 billion so how do we get to those numbers and the framework is private sector public sector public sector and policy have a huge role to play especially in the initial stages of

any sector when there is market failure so right now the market isn't there to support deep tech investing that is the long and short of the answer it has to be developed but some very useful

initiatives very important pathbreaking initiatives ives. These remind me of what has happened in other countries like the US and China. And also what happened in India in the when you know

in the early years of the republic these initiatives like RDIF, National Semiconductor Mission, the funding for uh you know the Anosandhan Foundation uh the quantum mission all of these are

very important uh uh initiatives which are looking to address market failure. They are looking to provide a source of capital both uh profit seeking and grant-based uh source of capital to fund

deep tech investing either directly or through managers. Um you have to make a start. We we now have the the catalyst in place. Governmental capital is not a substitute. It's meant to be a

substitute. I think it is upon us now to raise this money from u uh from the Indian private sector globally. India lacks a poster child for innovation. So you know unlike China, we don't have the

I mean the the global image, it's very difficult to sell India. It's even tougher to sell Indian innovation and deep tech investing to global investors. Coming to Indian investors again we have

our task cut out but but you know these initiatives are a starting point. We we have to we'll have to work harder. This is not capital that distributors can find for us. We'll have to come up with

structures. We'll have to first of all success stories to start the virtuous cycle because nothing succeeds greed. Greed is good, right? So nothing succeeds like greed. And then we have to

find those pools of capital in the private sector. We have to find them from the public sector. There is a lot of headroom there. A lot of public sector entities haven't used used up

their headroom for alternative investing. But it's going to take a few years for us to be able to say that listen if RDIF actually what I'd like to say is if RDIF is doing say 20,000

crores a year then ideally the private sector should be doing at least 80,000 crores a year right for us to get to that level it's going to take a few years for us to find that capital it's

going to be a lot of hard work &gt;&gt; thank you Kopal I'm going to ask the next two questions uh Chris if I may ask because you've been a mover and shaker in deploying Indian capital and then I'm

going to go to Snay and then come to Ravi is that okay uh Chris any thoughts on Indian capital because that's very key so far and how do you supplement uh how do you get Indian capital to come in

at a bigger scale so um the good thing is the money is there the wealth is there it's just that it is not coming into the startup ecosystem But over the last four five years I have

seen lot more family offices lot more high net individuals starting to invest in the startup ecosystem. I think the push was too hard because they all set up their own small small AFS. What we

want now is actually larger AFS which can do bigger checks uh later stage etc. Hopefully that will happen. And the RDF um so you know the the backstory of RDF is you know we were all many of us uh

you see here were trying to create a billion dollar VC fund in India. We don't have a billion dollar Indian capital VC fund [clears throat] and then we approached the government to set up a

billion dollar VC fund. They surprised us by saying, "Why stop at a billion? Here's a 12 billion VC fund, right? So the government actually took a big step in setting up the RDI fund. Now they

didn't start small. They started with a bank. Now the challenge is as both Gopal and uh Sudhir has said and and Sid is also part of the you know com different groups which are working to streamline

this absorption capacity 20,000 crores if RDF has to invest in a year because this fund has to be deployed over six period six years one year is over so only five years is left then means

20,000 every year has have to be deployed there there has to be an equivalent at least an equivalent private capital coming in otherwise that can't be deployed so absorption capacity

and that's why we need um larger funds India based and it need not be 100% India based the only thing is the AF has to be registered in India the source of funding can be anywhere and then we need

to find good deep tech companies this only can be invested in deep tech companies dip the companies to actually absorb this in investment. So I hope that it's possible. Uh I'm optimistic

because I have seen in the last 3 months tremendous enthusiasm, momentum. Government is moving very fast. Okay. Um July

2025 was when it was announced. They formulated all the rules regulations regarding that. They called for um startup funds to apply already opened and closed. This is just the first

close. There will be more rounds of that. And the call for startups to apply is already open. Right. So and and we are hoping that within a period of 3 months the money

will dis be dispersed. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Once the application is accepted. So I'm hopeful and I'm hoping that this will probably catalyze a deep tech revolution

in India. &gt;&gt; Thank you Gopal. I forgot to mention that perhaps the most concrete evidence of capital formation in the private sector has been the initiative by IDTA

and IDTA members have collectively committed $2 billion which is not a small amount to deep tech investing from their existing funds &gt;&gt; in a three-ear time frame

&gt;&gt; in a three-year time frame and you have to start somewhere. So there is some capital formation starting to happen even in the private sector that is heartening. Yeah. No, thank you. And you

know if you look at the US uh deep technology investing was in a environment of capital abundance. China was capital abundance. India so far had been capital posit. I think we are the

message which is coming up is there's a lot of money which is available even today not going to be available. That's a big change which is happening uh as such. I just want to take the experience

before I come to you Ravi of SNE. Now we are all investors and we talking about capital. Sn has uh started a company along with his co-founders called Miko. What has been your experience uh both

raising domestic and Indian capital? What are the uh ease of stuff which you think or ease of uh raising capital now do you see compared to the last five years?

&gt;&gt; Thank you so much. U I will I have as I'd said we started almost 10 years ago. We start in 2015 and we've seen multiple weathers of this funding cycle. So 2015 I think I heard no from almost 500

investors and every VC would say uh once you get your first revenue then you then we talk and we were building a deep technology product we built our own AI models over the past 10 years when AI

was not heard of at that point of time and so we spent two and a half years building product with zero revenue like the first 25% of our journey was like this so most VCs said no we said we'll

build a companion for a trend which will teach a child. He said build it, sell it, then you come. So those days were there. Then we saw a whole wave of massive funding up to 2021 with all

investors funding front left and center [clears throat] consumer internet funding boom. And then of course the deep tech startups were beneficiaries not direct beneficiaries but okay we're

putting so much in A why not let's diversify and put some in B. We were not the prime targets of most institutional venture money at that point of time. Then uh when the US started collapsing a

bit uh then after that uh growth capital started drying up after 2022 as we all know but then the good thing that has happened in the past 2 three years is Indian family office capital has stepped

up in a very big way on our cap table you'll see half of it coming in from institutions half of it coming in from family offices and for me personally uh more than the capital what I really

enjoy is I interact with every promoter of that family getting experience the see Indian families have built their businesses over 50 years with a lot of learnings how to navigate India how to

navigate the world and someone who has a wealth of experience of running a business for 20 years when he's spending time with you and he knows that there's a genuine direction that you're trying

to take a quantum leap which is unheard of we are 95% of our business is outside of India we sell in the US this is not made in India alone this is made in India intelligence selling

globally so when They connect with you at a very good level. Decisions are faster. They the the investment cycles they are willing willing to support with follow on capital. We've had family

offices come for unheard of before family officer come forward and said we will price the round and we will we are there to back you for the long term and my 2015 16 17 18 investors who came in

as families they say no no we don't want exit. We'll take it in IPO and we'll be with the company for the next 10 20 years. So the family office ecosystem has come up in a very big manner in

India which has supported I know because I'm part of a lot of deep tech forums and I'm speaking on behalf of a lot of founders. This is when when institutional capital is not available

at growth stage all of them have got very good access to family office capital in the past two three years which is just excellent. Indian in Indian companies raising money in the US

the shifts have changed significantly and the tone has changed significantly in the past one year since the news of public market exits if you see the kind of exits that a US company would do they

say they have to scale to 350 million and that's a much longer cycle to be qualified at a decent IPO here at $und00 million of revenue companies are taking exit at 10x revenue multiples equivalent

companies valuation multiples are much better so people are preferring ing Indian businesses from the US. US investors are opening up to to invest. This is this is our we've looked at the

data. We've seen the sentiments of interactions and now equivalent investors coming in from US investors coming into Indian capital has opened up because of public market boom which has

happened. &gt;&gt; So um just a question um or not a statement um out of your 60 million raised the first 50 was from Indian investors. Oh, in fact uh I would say um

out of 80 million raised 70 was from Indian. &gt;&gt; Okay. So that's a very interesting thing because I know we as investors invest in deep tech 75% of the companies were

supported in seed and series A round by Indian investors including institution uh uh funds and family offices. That's a very big thing. And now with that statement uh I come to Ravi. Rabi, you

PremG is an investor in India and outside India, right? How do you view and most of your deep tech investing is outside the country. How do you view view investing in India difference from

US and how do you think we can get global investors to come into India uh into this deep technology and do you think that will become a tsunami over a period of time because we still have to

raise another 11 billion in the next 6 to 7 years to to do the 50% of RDF. &gt;&gt; Thanks Sudi. So um let me just kind of introduce PremG invest. We are a family office. So what people are saying or

talking about family offices we are a large Indian family officiven investor of you must have heard about our promoter Mr. Prem gi. So yes, family offices are now uh starting to uh look

actively in the deep tech space. But before I get specifically into Sudhi's question, I see a lot of young faces here. I want to just introduce the thought framework as I was coming here

for deep tech. Why is deep tech important? And how do I think about deep tech when I am talking to regulators, government, policy makers? And the first thought that came

to me was that it is like infrastructure. It is like a horizontal positive or a negative externality that you will have in every sector of your

economy going forward. What does that mean? That means that how your deep tech sector is, it will determine the cars you drive, the phones you use, the laptop that you have, how fast is it,

what sort of buffering speeds you have. All of those things are you know related to the health of your deep tech sector. Right? Now with that as the framework take a step back and

think how has the government gone about building infrastructure. Now without getting into technicalities I can tell you that a lot of push came from the government from the lending

side from the equity side to relax and infuse capital into infrastructure build roads build dams you know give all sorts of incentives. Now in the context of RDIF what has the government done?

Government has said that okay if something is ready for out of lab but is having a funding gap from getting out of lab to the market that is where the government wants to infuse capital and

what does RDF say RDF says that 50% will be by the government and 50% is by the LP so that is the Indian story that the government is doing now right now how is the US different from India it's a very

long sort of an answer I'll just sort of give you two three uh tidbits right to think about in the US of course $30 trillion economy very mature deep ecosystem where the

academia is interlin with the industry with the government meaning what we are talking about a jurisdiction which invented the internet which came up with GPS right and all of this came up

through either defense government funding or some other means of academia right so very different ecosystem when you come into India and so the startup s are very different, right? So the the

the kind of innovation that happens there is very different which is what we see. So it is not only about the capital or it is not only about the talent, it is an ecosystem where in an un in an

informal setting expertise is exchanged. Sudhi Rifi that would be the I would say what catalyzes US investments &gt;&gt; I was reading 40% of US family offices invest in deep tech or in related in if

if they if they deploy 100 dollars 40% would be within these sectors India is different like like uh my colleague said that where is your ARR where is if if you go market first

Indians talk about is there a revenue stream. So that I think is the difference. But RDIFs and various of our VCs and family offices are now stepping into this space because we see an

opportunity in India because talent is there, capital is coming and we see that this now of course we'll discuss the other questions later how policy incentives and other things

&gt;&gt; can develop that architecture and that ecosystem. That's the way I would put it. Just one more thing I'll just add. Kalpers is the California pension fund. Again I [clears throat] was seeing about

15 to 20% of Kalpers money goes into private equity and venture capital India and this is sitai is one of uh one of his topics and I've seen him argue this very passionately before the government

that imagine if your provident fund or you know your LIC type of money starts coming into this sector. &gt;&gt; It's huge. &gt;&gt; It's huge and it's hopefully about to

happen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So that's that that's where I would draw the sort of uh when we look at both India US this is what we see but we see a lot of opportunity in India

because of the talent. &gt;&gt; So do we get it that now Premi will start investing in deep tech in India? &gt;&gt; Yes. Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Absolutely.

&gt;&gt; Absolutely. [laughter] That's why we are here and that's why we are also founding members of IDTA. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Gopal you wanted to make a point. I just wanted to say that

listen coming back to India all of you are here. I just want uh India's innovation moment is here. Innovation requires a long time like one of the companies in our portfolio

started 25 years ago out of Ahmedabad right and so innovation [clears throat] requires a long time to achieve it also therefore requires patient capital long-term capital to support it.

Many things are happening here which will completely change the availability of capital for innovation. Therefore and in this in this room are potential innovators.

And what I'm saying is that yes there are many parts of the ecosystem how universities behave how investors behave and we are we are at that moment of innovation reminds me I was there in IIT

in ' 91 when India changed and we took the initial steps in this country to open up entrepreneurship to every Indian and I think what's happening around us right now reminds me of that moment that

we are opening up innovation to every Indian. It's now no longer around workarounds which is jugar. It is about boring through to create fresh technologies and the longest distance

between two dots is a straight line but you know workarounds are always faster. So this is the time for boring through and finding innovation. There is a sea change in the amount of capital

available. We can always say it is less compared to where it is in China and the US but compared to where it was 2 or 3 years ago it's a ground swell. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Absolutely. Can I just add one

thing to that just very quickly? I think uh during the entire summit a large number of people have heard you know what the US is doing this China is doing this what they're doing etc. I think

here's the most important part. The US is the largest developed nation. So the different league China had spent 30 years learning from the best doing a whole bunch of policy changes building

up their kind of asset base and the show base to end up actually doing that. I think in going back to the cold war you had these two large elephants that end up actually fighting. India actually

truly represents a nonline movement. We are actually the middle path and as India's Indians have always proclaimed that we are the middle path that the rest of the world will end up actually

following. I think the chaos that's actually inherent in India and the frugality that's actually there breeds innovation. I think the moment you have a large amount of surplus we never look

at optimization you never look at how things can actually be better. It's like let's just throw let's throw cash at it something end up actually managing it doesn't happen that way. The greatest

deep tech innovations across the world have always happened from a place of frugality when they had to end up actually making something better. And that's actually inherent to what a large

number of people here end up actually doing. And some of the larger problems that people faced 10 15 25 years ago have actually been solved. We have capital. We do have a government that's

not looking at deep tech and trying to figure out what there's a joke that some of the ministers have actually cracked when they pack it publicly. So we can actually say it that the reason why the

IT revolution happened in Bangalore is Bangalore was so far from Delhi. Delhi had no idea what's actually happening in Bangalore. That's how could actually get incubated and that's how it ended up

actually building up. But now in deep tech they're no longer looking at a handbrake to end up actually stopping it. So we can't speak about capital. We can speak of policy. But I think the

most important part of that is actually the assets. Unless we actually see people get off the get off the fence, end up actually starting up. We're never going to end up seeing it. And as think

as we as people we look at failure and like failure is like failing an exam in school or something. It's something bad. It's something you're ashamed about. It's not. The whole process of

entrepreneurship is iterative. For every way you find that doesn't work, you've actually learned. You can end up actually applying that knowledge to something else. So I think the biggest

takeaway for anyone over here is it is a lot more fun to end up actually building when there's chaos than to go to some place where everything works and just being another cog in that machine.

Become a builder. You don't have to end up actually becoming a cog. &gt;&gt; Chris and then Nishad back. &gt;&gt; So you know I have been working with the research ecosystem and the startup

ecosystem over the last 10 years and I [clears throat] can tell you with confidence that um what is required is to think big. What is required is to actually uh nudge these initiatives a

little bit and know u we have examples of um uh technology from India going global. global. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Okay. Um I will give you another example of technology from India that's gone

global. Of course, all of you have heard of UIDI. But how how many of you have heard of Mossip? Mossip. One hand partly raised. [laughter]

There's one hand. That's model opensource identity program. It's running in 29 countries across the world. um um 300 million people have got IDs

with that and pretty soon a billion people will get ID from that and on top of that citizen services are being delivered our dika which is a uh education uh uh system that again

developed through philanthropy running in many schools in India it's actually running in many schools in a Africa and many of these are now moving to developed countries is so technology

from India from a developing country going across the world you will see now more and more examples of that coming down the line I can tell you 2D materials which are the next promising

materials for semiconductors because we need to reduce the power required for AI right we need green AI so 2D materials analog computing okay u developing the entire software to a stack on analog

computing. Uh quantum of course there are many startups which are already now uh getting commercial in India. You may have seen Baraj's presentation today morning at 11:30. But what you didn't

realize or what you may not have fully realized is today when you actually use voice translation using AI your u your language is translated and the LLM is in English.

It's not native in our language. &gt;&gt; Okay. So there is an opportunity to develop multimodel multilinguistic AI which is what Baraj is doing right

now. Right? These are all I would say the next round of innovation which will all now go from India to the world because very few countries are just monolingual and even US is now

multilingual. they will require a new set of LLMs if you want they want to do native AI. &gt;&gt; Thank you Chris. My uh one statement and then I'll come to Nishad. I think

fundamentally one message which is perhaps underlying in this discussion so far is deep tech requires longer periods of gueststation. Uh investors have to ask the right questions not just after

one year what's your revenue model and profit model. And I think investors have to change themselves because investors in India have been asking the same question because of obviously you know

uh return uh related issues and I think the the RDF effort along with the private effort is going to change that because investors will not be able to survive if they don't ask the right

question. So with that statement there are many policy frameworks and why this question is to you. There are many policy frameworks which are undergoing change in the country for enabling deep

tech investing. Could you highlight the top two which you think are important to be done in the next six to 6 months to 12 months? &gt;&gt; U

thank you very much. What I see is that let let me just give my work significantly in the US as well. I think time has come to do look at innovation in all sectors. One side is

technology side but second thing is policy side. A lot of innovations are needed in policy side and I think lot of benchmarks are also available around the world. Um so the way in which we look at

is this that whenever new technology comes and new product comes one side the industry wants to promote and grow government's concern is to contain the bad actors. Okay. So

balancing the two is a very strategic important task. This is one part of the game. Second that even in the in terms of focus on one's there are two stacks one is a foundational technologies

whether it is AI whether robotics whether it's quantum whether it's other photonics and so on and so forth lot of time and investment is required in the foundational technology but then the

application side is where we have great opportunity for example you converge AI with crisper and robotics. Okay, that would lead you to cyborgs, cyber organs, right? Ambiance intelligence, do digital

twins. There are so many things that you can do beyond normal AI. Second thing I find here slight difference when in China or in the US I see entrepreneurs when they think of a market they think

global market. How big is a global market? In India most of the time I feel oh India is a big market okay immediate low hanging fruit India [clears throat] is a great laboratory I say is a great

laboratory because the cost of experimentation is low scalability is high so you have great opportunity Trump has helped us to some extent to retain talent here so uh you know you've got

talent set all that we need to do is how do you tap the capital today local capital is which is a great thing but I believe that we really need significantly large capital if you see

the foundational technology otherwise when and in fact we have to learn how to play musical chair why I'm telling this is that first [clears throat] of all if you look at open AI $und00 billion right

now we are talking at a very different level today and the needs are very large okay so when you think of global markets and global products That is where really and secondly that when you get

investment typically what would happen people investment also is a function of of capital is of a function of exits there is long-term which we are all agreed that but at the same time we can

find mechanisms and innovate mechanism so that after four five six years there is a somebody else comes in then there is somebody else comes in so startup early stage funding to growth equity to

private equity to IPO maybe 10 15 years from now who knows but and for 10 years IPO market was in dumps right so suddenly at the moment is going on everybody wants to ride on that but you

don't know how long it lasts I'm not saying it should not last please don't get me wrong but at the same time we [clears throat] have to have a mechanism both in terms of policy framework for

example today our company's act 9 2013 Okay, it's still old wine in new bottle with respect. Okay, the good attempt made income tax new act is coming. It's still somewhat similar. Okay, so there

are major innovations required because when I go around the world, you can have so many different instruments and you can structure because instruments are nothing else but risk management tools.

So you have different sets of risk. uh you know third thing I find in policy particularly grants are very important now again tax is a big problem whe the grant is in income or not you must have

experienced that correct &gt;&gt; and it's a big lawyers take up half the grants in [laughter] our accountants take remaining 50% entrepreneur is very happy because we

are also entrepreneurs so please and so but I'm saying that but if you treat grant as a taxable income you know you have to go around with this kind of things so much so there is lot of need

for innovation one point which uh my friend made the grid is good he talked in a constructive sense please don't take it negatively it's constructive sense because grid could be bad okay

Michael Douglas taught us that lesson But it has been taken to a different level. Now I would suggest that most important thing after building great companies governance

okay and ethics organizational behavior these are the subjects you cannot miss out you know while you're building a business be very careful one of the other thing I'm sorry I'm going a little

long is that when early stage people start working on that when they start doing plans because they want money so it's there is lot of temptation to fudge numbers numbers, estimate numbers. Okay.

And after the it starts doing good business, good funding, the next thing is you fudge accounts and financial. Okay. I tell you this is what is the biggest killer. Just be very careful, be

patient and those who are patient that kind of money you want it. You don't want people to pressurize you to just create revenue and you know especially in deep tech. So I'm sorry I'm I went on

too long but as a lawyer what else can I do? Yeah, [laughter] I don't make money the way Vishu guys make it. So, but if he would have come to me, I would have done one cent.

&gt;&gt; No, thank you Rishad. This is very I have just two more questions. I know we are running short of time. So, if two questions short answers then I'd like to for five minutes open to the audience.

Okay. Uh Arun exit Nishad in fact alluded to that exits are very important uh history of exits in India. uh secondaries, IPOs, M&amp;A, M&amp;A is very very weak in India do you think M&amp;A will

become very important in technology divesting uh if so what do you think is happening today and what do you think is happening in the future and then I'll come to the question with for Chris

&gt;&gt; no I think on M&amp;A as we see more deep tech companies coming out of India certainly we will see global M&amp;As from India we've already seen that in smaller ways but I would expect to see more

second I think the Indian [clears throat] companies too We'll start looking at that today. Again, we're seeing them in small ways, but I would expect that M&amp;A will be a major

source of exit going forward. &gt;&gt; Okay. Thank you, Chris. Uh, last question. Um, deep tech and AI. Everybody is talking about how global

markets are opening up, but there are challenges in India. Uh, how do you improve farm productivity on a halfacre average land size? uh how do you remove grain storage losses? There are many

Indian problems to be solved. Do you think that is are you seeing some green shoots or a tsunami of those deep tech entrepreneurs who are addressing Indian challenges at scale? Okay. And do you

think that's going to be very important not just a global solution? In fact um you know I would say that yes you know we are all talking about LLMs and you know um

voice response systems and things like that. The opportunity is actually application of AI in agriculture in healthcare in education in automotive systems you know all the cars will have

now AI enabled uh &gt;&gt; uh you know even u uh GPS systems and things like that. So if if if it if the opportunity in the foundational layer uh which is the deep tech layer is about

let's say 100 million the opportunity in the application layer is probably 1 billion 10 times that &gt;&gt; so that's the opportunity and then from India to the world uh I don't remember

now who said this uh where the cost of doing innovation in India is one the cost right so you have 1/5if the cost and the market is the entire world that opportunity is significant in India and

I'm seeing now I met um you know every day I meet um entrepreneurs startup founders etc and the kind of problems they're actually attempting to solve is very exciting and very inspiring

actually so I with this money and that's the reason Why I'm extremely glad all these people are sitting in front of you and saying that we're going to fund all of you right so it's a very exciting

period and I'm also glad because then RDI will get deployed RDF fund will get deployed so I'm hopeful that um the next 10 years India will become the deep tech capital of the world I believe.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you. Very nice. So I know there's a lot of questions. We have actually five minutes to the end of this and as a sutrahar I may have to &gt;&gt; I just wanted to say that we have Anan

Kaluma from materials who's joined was a big supporter of the IDTA and I thought I want to welcome him and okay thank you &gt;&gt; thank you Arunish for inviting applied materials to be part of IDA I think two

observations here right from the discussion I think it'll be useful to think less about what the stock markets are M&amp;A my view of it is you build great companies exits will take care of

himself, right? And the question is given the talent here in the room and outside the room, right? How do you build the next NVDI? How do you build the next SpaceX? How do you build the

next Grock or Labs or and so on, right? Because I don't see that discussion happening, right? Everybody's like, "Oh, the stock market is X. I'm going to do Y and I'm going to make Z money." If you

see, we have been investing in deep tech, right? And I don't see that discussion happening in the companies uh in Israel for example. Nobody is building a company saying that I'll I'll

sell it I'll do right. They're starting and saying is can I build a big company because I'm solving a big problem. I would encourage that level of discussion there and the second thing on the deep

tech somebody mentioned we have been investing company for 25 years also figure out how you can reduce the risk right because we have seen the cycles like in clean techch people came and

went out in internet people came in came out so I'm just worried like two years from now we shouldn't have tourist leaving part and there's going to be a death of the deep tech sector right so

just observation is like one is I think the boundaries of what to think about is not a billion exit like you know companies are now exiting at a trillion plus right how do you build that

trillion plus company because you're solving a trillion plus value thing right that's what I encourage but great uh great great team and look forward to being part of

&gt;&gt; thank you I'm going to open this to I think we have time for three questions please name yourself please address the question to one of us here and then we'll answer and then we

go to second and third yes please &gt;&gt; question &gt;&gt; yeah question. &gt;&gt; Big question or a long question.

&gt;&gt; Long question. &gt;&gt; Long question. I'll make it in 30 seconds. &gt;&gt; Yeah. 30 seconds to ask the question. &gt;&gt; So, okay. Rather than asking these many

questions straight forward, I'm asking question. Uh yeah, right now just like a rapid fire who are ready for a 10c investment without seeing the pitch deck because there are many startup who

cannot uh express themsel if you say about bat edge and all. I would like to compare it with Google and Meta but when it comes to same for us startups they are going to compare it with Saramea and

Bash and say that uh uh how are you different and we are not going to invest and as sir said they are going to of course reject for the first investing for gambling I think that's number one

and as nish as nish nishai also said investors have to do their diligence third there are enough LLMs that are very articulate I'm fairly certain you can put in what you want and make

something articulate the hygiene is crucial &gt;&gt; there is there is a way there is a way to prepare for funding without a deck. Your caliber and your credentials must

be outstanding. In our world, it happens all the time. We meet people, we commit funding without seeing a business plan. This happens in the US. This happens to some

extent in India. But please understand for that you have to be like a five. &gt;&gt; Listen to me. Listen to me. It has to be a two you have to be three standard or four standard deviations better than the

normal. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; So if you are three or four standard deviations exceptional you don't need a business plan. You just need to announce

to the world I want to be an innovator. They'll be capital. &gt;&gt; So I think the answer to that is very simple. You would like any investor including

this room to listen to you. I think without hesitation I can speak on behalf of all investors. They will listen to you. write to the investors. Somebody will listen to you in each firm. Okay,

there's a lady here up front. &gt;&gt; One minute please. There's a lady here up front. &gt;&gt; Hello panel. I'm Pankuri. Uh I'm building AI as well. Uh my question

right now is actually to Sid Pai as everyone calls you. Um you mentioned frugality in investment, right? I absolutely understand it actually helps it promotes cost effective solutions.

However, when the similar kind of ideas at least like at the early stage in India receive say a one two CR check right and in at a certain dilution and in the US um they do receive a huge

amount which is 4x five times right uh the kind of amount that we're talking about do you think Indian startups will be able to scale at global will be able to build for globe

&gt;&gt; we will because I think see the important part is investor tors end up funding it bases what the entrepreneur wants. Indian entrepreneurs come and say I will do this in 50 lakhs. I will do

this in a cr. An American entrepreneur says I need I need 15 million ends up actually raising seven. I think increase your ambitions. I think that most part frugality doesn't mean that you end up

putting handcuffs on yourself. Frugality means you have a large pool that you don't have to dip into whenever you need to but you end up optimizing at the edge. I think that optimization is

what's more important not the fact that you end up putting handcuffs on yourself and then cry about the fact that you can't compete with the rest of the world. Yeah, I think the answer to that

is very simple. Ask for more but prove that or talk about the fact that this is deserved from a point of view of where you will spend that money. Many of the investments we made are in the range of

7 to 14 crores at the day one. Okay. Uh such uh third question please. Yes, &gt;&gt; I'm I'm pointing at him please. &gt;&gt; Yeah, there is a sequence in my head right now. Okay. Yes, please. You can be

loud. You will be loud. &gt;&gt; Just a quick question. In 2026 or 2027, if you have to evaluate a startup, would you look I mean would you look at their team size or if a startup makes use of

only AI and AI agents to solve a problem that would cut the bill? Thank you. I think uh see what I size really doesn't end up mattering I think in a large number of these things I think

what's actually important is the competence of the entrepreneur and the team they end up actually bringing in whether you are using AI whether you're using a large number of people sitting

over there for that matter those are choices of yours there are pros and cons that end up actually coming in but VC investing can't be boiled down to a set of five rubrics and hacks unlike what

the LLM end up actually generating so it depends on what you're actually building how much cash need to end up building it what the chances of success are what are you bringing to the table? If you're pre

integrator of other people's ideas and intermediary, there's really not much value that ends up getting added. So look at value added, not how not the ingredients that go into it.

&gt;&gt; Um we have one more question this gentleman here. &gt;&gt; You just need four good people. One more sorry I just wanted to say that listen [clears throat] four is a magical number

&gt;&gt; right uh at a startup stage most startups just you you need four good people so you you can enhance yourself with AI and all this is not about 40 people as you are looking to build a

team it's not about tens of people it's about two three four good people &gt;&gt; we have one more question can you please Write to all of them.

&gt;&gt; Who gives you the best deal? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay, that's it. &gt;&gt; Write to all of us. &gt;&gt; How do I decide? &gt;&gt; Write to all of us. Find out offline.

&gt;&gt; One of them one of them will say yes or no. Okay. &gt;&gt; The best deal. &gt;&gt; I think I think I'm going to halt all the questions right now.

&gt;&gt; I'm going to halt all the questions right now because all of us will be available outside after this session. I know we are ending at this uh again uh thank you to matey and ITA for

organizing this function and thank you I also want to say a few Yeah, I
