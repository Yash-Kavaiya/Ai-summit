## 📝 Transcript

Hello everyone. Uh welcoming you to the uh AI the future of creativity session. I request all the session speakers to please uh be seated on the stage. &gt;&gt; Uh so uh we want a picture of all of

you. Uh first requesting you to please just come in front of the dice to get a picture. Good afternoon. Uh hello everyone. Uh good afternoon. Uh

we are going to start the session on uh AI and the future of creativity here organized by Mozilla Foundation and G5A. uh I will hand over to uh Diva who will be moderating the session and thank you

for joining us. [applause] &gt;&gt; Um great thank you all so much for being here. We have uh an incredible group of panelists to talk about AI and the

future of creativity. Um, with us today is Zad Borat, uh, the vice president of, uh, imagination and strategic growth at Mosilla, which is one of the coolest titles I've ever heard. Um,

we have Nikl Advani, filmmaker and advisory council member of G5A. Uh, he's directed some of my favorite, uh, movies, definitely. And uh we have Saran uh Vigraham uh

director of engineering at Meta who has built many incredible uh and I think very imaginative AI tools. So I imagine they all have a lot to say about this topic. I'm Diva. I'm the founder and

executive director of a nonprofit called the Collective Intelligence Project and we work on global democratic input into AI systems. So today we're here to talk about AI and

creativity. And I think we're all invested in what the future of art and creativity look like. This is a core part of what it means to build anything, to be human, to build culture, to build

society and I at least think AI will make huge differences in this space and it's unclear uh you know what impact that they'll have. And so my first question for my panelists um starting

with Zad is you know Mozilla has thought a lot about the open internet about open technologies uh the open internet gave us incredible things uh flowering of creativity Wikipedia creative commons um

made creators out of billions of people around the world. It has also led to, you know, a lot of cheapening of individual labor, uh, complications, copyright issues, participation issues.

Uh, what have we learned from Mosilla's work and thinking about the open internet that we can bring into thinking about AI? &gt;&gt; Thanks, Divia. Um, I think you put it

quite acutely. I think um this is a topic that we really as a group as a society need to wrap our heads around because it is pressing and urgent even if it might not feel like it sometimes

uh to policy makers and and the reason is simple. We are at a juncture. This has happened in the past as you correctly note with the advent of the free and open internet where um we've

had a fork in the road, right? We've had uh Wikipedia emerge out of the amazing amazing work that folk have done to share knowledge online. At the same time, we've seen extractive practices uh

almost as a dual use case in in this in this um environment. And so generative AI offers some of the same questions. And I want to start by acknowledging that it may be a fork in the road, but I

think there's something much deeper here. You'll hear a lot if you're around the summit this week about the AI stack, about hardware, compute, model layers, application layers, data, etc. But I

think the core of what we're facing right now is that we need to make and what we have learned is that we need to make the invisible visible. Imagination is an infrastructure

in the AI ecosystem that is currently not being realized to its full potential as such. it is being extracted from and we absolutely as a community need to make sure that does not happen. We've

learned this in the past. We've learned this with the advent as mentioned with the open internet but now we can actually see the structural stacking of all of these layers together and we have

a foundation on which to base interventions. And so for me when thinking about this as a fork in the road possibly I actually think it's more than that. I think that we have a tunnel

underneath a stack that we need to break open, right? And that's why I love open source and open AI, not the company per se, but open-source AI, it is because it forces us to think about transparency

and about consent, and we have learned these lessons before, but now we have the structural tools to address it. I'm actually curious for both of your because Zad's uh laid out so beautifully

why does imagination matter? You know, it is easy to talk about some of the more visible aspects of AI. I think it's important to talk about things like economic impacts and impacts on

governance and education, but we also do care about imagination and culture. Um yeah, why do you think that this part of the conversation is important? &gt;&gt; All right. So,

as Zad's talking I'm I'm I'm thinking about the products you mentioned, right? You you talked about Wikipedia, you talked about creative comments, you talked about uh

cultural remixes. It's it's very interesting, right? If you look at all those three, they have some tenets in common, right? Wikipedia had collective intelligence. It had

governance by the community. uh it it allowed it it's like it it allowed things to naturally organically form together in the ways it mattered for communities. Uh

multilingual beca became natural. So a lot of tenets of how Wikipedia evolved came because people made it what it is right similarly if you look at creative comments it has legal framework embedded

in the design itself. It's and legal framework by choice. I can control what I want to share. I can say what I don't want to share. Right? And that was respected.

And similarly, the the remixes is essentially when we create a new meme, uh when we create we we create anything that becomes viral these days, right? We are building upon culture that already

exists to add more more texture to it and it propagates forward in time, right? So we are leaving these traces in time of how culture evolved and internet was always about that uh about about

that openness about that democratization of how we can get these ideas across how discovery becomes seamless and possible. Now there is the other side of it where we have these content forms right and it

it is uh then you have platforms taking over you have creatives or artists experiencing that their work is not well represented and it's it is it is um it is cannibalized and all these things

happen when algorithms take over right you have because now you are farming for engagement you're farming for revenue right your incentives change drastically across the board. So it's the two sides

of internet. One is open and one is not. Uh and I think those tenets essentially are what we see right now. And AI is so nent in a way, right? We can talk about AI is the talk of the town for sure but

it is still very nent. It is in phase one where everybody has decided that we we no longer need Google. We can go to chat GPT or anthropic or Gemini. Uh we can use uh AI for search. We can use it

for discovery. now which means that it is at that phase one where people want to use AI for everything but it has not reached the stage where uh we we have not figured out any anything around what

the legal framework are is going to be uh what how how we are going to truly represent artists how can we make u compensation part of the infrastructure itself uh none of these things have been

figured out yet so the fork in the road is is real I think where what we have learned from We don't know yet. uh we maybe in 5 years we might have as a community we'll show that we have

learned astoundingly well and uh every it the world is equitable and fair or it's very lopsided and we have not learned anything and we're going to make the same mistakes right and so I think I

think time will tell but I think we have the opportunity to reshape uh the the AI infrastructure with these tenets around uh you talked about transparency for sure uh legal framework compensation

fair use um and and and humans building stuff and not algorithms deciding I think will be very important. &gt;&gt; Yeah. [clears throat] So I I'm going to talk about imagination,

right? I mean that was the question. Why is imagination so important? Um so firstly I just want to put a like a kind of dis disclaimer out there. Um, I think Obama quoted somebody saying that uh um

if you're the most uh if you're the most clever person in the room, then you're in the wrong room. That's the reason why I'm in this room, right? I don't know anything about AI. I have no idea AI

when AI when they start talking about AI in my office, I leave the room and go away. Um I told them they couldn't believe it. I don't have Swiggy. I don't have Uber. I don't have I don't have

anything on my phone. Nothing. Zomato, Formato, nothing. I don't have My assistant is my AI. I call him and tell him do this. He does it, it gets done, right? So I don't have I don't know I

don't know what all this is. Um but if somebody tell somebody told me that you can actually um a a boy in Chhattisgarh I mean I can actually make a film without bothering about uh seven vanity

vans and 27 people around them and an actor's dates. I'm happy I'll make it very good. Um somebody told me that I can actually a boy in Chhattisgarh or or or a student in u Jarrand or some remote

part of Kashmir or in Kerala or somebody can actually um create an entire film. Wow. Incredible. That's really democratiz democratization, right?

But here's what the thing is, right? in the sense that um it's I I I of course it's about imagination but it's also about artistic intention. Yeah,

&gt;&gt; it's very important, right? Most art students, most art students can draw a shoe. It's only Van Goore who will tell you the story of the farmer through that shoe.

&gt;&gt; Right? Most uh um I don't know um why does Ari Singh decide to sing that particular rag in that morning, right? Something that he woke up and

something that he chose to do. So if people just keep making the uh films the way I mean by using AI tools which they should and that's the reason why year by year um but if there is no originality

right in the sense and what is original is we'll come to that later but the the point is then it'll always be like what most of Bollywood is which is a 90% rubbish

right it just be that where what separates the 10% % from the 90% is artistic intention is what did Anura Kashab intend to say with that particular shot

I don't think anybody can get that for me that's the most important thing that's what I see when I am uh making my own films and when I'm reading other scripts and that's that's what I don't

know if AI can do that then we we're in possibly in a very good good place we get better films So when we were talking uh outside the session, I think you had mentioned

something about how the economics of AI is likely to set the direction of where things go, right? It'll trump ethics. It'll trump law. It's likely that uh the incentives behind the people who are

building these technologies are going to set the direction of of how they proceed. I'm curious, I think for all the panelists, what that looks like in the space of creativity and in

particular, what levers do we have to align those incentives with things like we want human flourishing, we want culture, we want artistic intention. What can we do about aligning the

economic incentives to the things that we think would be positive for society? Zad, if you want to start. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I I think it's a structural problem and it's not being considered as

such. And that's that's that's what I just want to keep repeating. I think there is a a a a lot of intervention focused on okay uh we see the after effects of AI let's try and mitigate

against it we see loss of livelihoods occurring let's let's try and mitigate it but there's not enough of a structural intervention to say well no actually how do we instead of creating

um fear-based approaches how do we create further opportunities right how do we look at generative AI and the advent of this technology and realign the ascent incentives structurally. And

that's not just only an intellectual property, right? Often it's very quick uh for folk to think let's let's let's just wait until the courts figure it out, right? Or let's let's let's just go

to our IP regimes and and think that that's that's where the the majority of the case will be. No, it's not. If it's a structural intervention, you're going to look at intellectual property. You're

going to look at labor, right? Creative labor. You're going to look at tax incentives as well. You're going to think how are artists actually being funded? How are cultural institutions

being funded? That implicates tax policy as well. But we're not seeing that in a fundamentally structural sense because this layer is not visible, right? It is not visible in geopolitical discussions.

The imaginative layer is a kind of substrate as a resource for everybody to exploit. It's ambient. It's envelops the entire AI stack. And so artistic intent it it becomes invisible in that system.

And that's what we need to actually make sure that we address because if we create those ripe conditions where communities are in control of their data. They're are imagining as

independent creators. They have the incentive structures in place. Um we have licensing regimes, labor regimes and tax regimes that support independent creators. then that intent can flourish.

But at the moment, we're fixated on chips, hardware, etc. These are immediate priorities, right? But we haven't thought about the long run. We haven't thought about, okay, well, what

happens in a world where we have completely flattened out this substrate because we have um a monoculture, right? Or to put it bluntly, we're net receivers of other people's imagination,

right? So, it's so important to get this right and people are doing that. This work is being done. It's just not as visible and communities need to be at the forefront of that. I think it's it's

a groundswell movement to assert ourselves to structurally realign these incentives um and to get it taken seriously. &gt;&gt; Oh, um lot of things to unpack here.

Um so I I think incentives is one thing. Uh I think you touched also touched upon conversations. Um whether whether the whether the right uh outcomes are factored in the conversations that we

are doing when we are designing these systems right um there's also artistic intent that that Nicl touched upon. So let me let me tackle the so being an engineer at least I can uh I can tell

you how these systems are designed and what what is the what are the incentives the biggest problems problem is incentives don't get lined up well they are not they're they're very misaligned

as engineers engineers are creatives too right so what they do is they solve a problem with constraints and and there is a specific goal that you're trying to meet right now the goal that everybody

wants is we want to get these systems to do incredible things right that and and and we have shown that right these like these AI models that that are in the world right now they can do some

phenomenal things and every update only makes them better in terms of their capability but so in in the internet era what happened

is we had lot of time as we built these systems as we saw the side effects of what we built uh engagement farming came in we were able to respond to it well people had solutions the democratization

did exist With AI, it is 100x more challenging. It's more powerful with 10x less time to figure out the solutions. And that is incredibly hard. So lot of companies

like even collective intelligence that Diva is part of, they run evaluations. They say that you know we can probably not catch them on the fly as they design, but what do we want these models

to do in the real world when they come out? Can we bring a community of people together to define the local context on whether this model is representing them accurately and can we design evaluations

in such a way that we can give feedback to the model to the designers so that they can they can be on track. How fast can we do it? How how can we scale that? That's a that's a really good question.

I do not know the answer to it. So, so I think the when when people design these systems today, uh, Zaz is right. It's it's about chips. It's about how fast the

inferencing is, how fast we can deploy these models, what what are the use cases for them because that is that seems to be the only thing that is visible. That is the only thing that's

tangible. That's the only thing you can conquer. But the what it does to people who are using AI, how it changes behaviors, we are just learning about it. Now the question is how do we bake

these things in the design now that we have released four versions of uh the the prominent frontier models can we take a step back and like know understand what we learned and can that

become part of the design I think that needs to happen right um so so it is happening in pockets I think but it is not and also also I I think co-creating is important in AI uh it doesn't happen

that often it is again engineers solving a specific set of problems. If somebody like Nickel is in the room, I'm pretty sure he will have different perspectives on on what the impact is going to be,

what things should be uh organically part of the infrastructure that we are building. I think those conversations also need to happen. I think and and that is not happening enough. I guess

&gt;&gt; is that what I was saying inside there &gt;&gt; something like that. I mean we were talking about also you know is the default path that AI does help let's say the boy in Chandigar or Jatisar to

create something or is it going to help the already large institutional players you know let go of all of the people that they tend to work with and will it you know will it be democratizing or

will it be top down &gt;&gt; both? &gt;&gt; Yeah. So I think &gt;&gt; that's why it's on the fork right I mean yeah both very much there's no question

about it right if if we are saying that it's not going to uh mean there's going to be a culling of uh uh creativity it's going to be there's no question about it &gt;&gt; uh is the boy and chandigar going to be

able to make the film I was not I I had to actually go through a lot of uh steps right I mean assistant and associate get shahuk's attention &gt;&gt; pitch him a script you know I I mean and

and I tell that to so many people that there there are a million like that kids in Bombay right a million of them only one of them got recognized by Shah Rukin so the luck the luck factor is huge now

what happens is is that if you can take that luck factor out out of the way and you just have an incredible script that nobody's actually going to be looking at and willing to allow you to make it but

you can make it because you have you have some wonderful tools at your disposal why not but yeah it's going to be it's It's it I think that maybe a year ago that's what I was saying the

year ago there was there was conver conversations about in in in Amazon's and Netflix's and Apple and and the places that I work with oh no we can't do it you cannot do you have to let us

know are you are you doing are you going to take this shot in with using an AI tool etc etc now they all have departments on their own organizations that are actually registering AI tools

and they actually they working with companies to create AI tools which they can basically then give their makers &gt;&gt; to say hello you can do this why not because at the end of the day see

everything is about the budget right you can have an incredible script you can have an incredible uh uh piece of storytelling but but if the budget doesn't work the budget doesn't work

it's out of the window &gt;&gt; right so if the budget can be brought down by just making sure that you don't have to take 400 people with you to take that particular shot at early in at 2:00

and you who are waking up at 2:00 in the night to take a shot at 6:00 in the morning when actually what possibly also happened the actor did not wake up in time and did not come

right oh I don't need it &gt;&gt; I'll sit in I'll sit in andhi somewhere in Bombay and I'll create it so there you know what I'm saying so it it it there are there are advantages and there

are huge disadvantages also but it's just that I think that we have to be cognizant of that &gt;&gt; and not be blind to it that's it And back to our macro question that you

actually brought up around well what is originality in the age of AI? And of course we as human society don't have that clear of a definition of originality anyway, right? Like we all

pull from ancient stories. We learn from each other. It's not that anyone kind of creates something in a vacuum. But at the same time, I think it is the case that these tools change a little bit of

how remixing works currently and in the future. So I'm wondering what the impact is you think it'll have on what it means to create something original, what it means to have kind of authoral intent.

[clears throat] &gt;&gt; So what is original originality? Uh that's a very good question for Bollywood, [laughter] &gt;&gt; right?

&gt;&gt; That's why I asked you first. &gt;&gt; That's a very very good question. That's an excellent question and most people in in my in my film industry will not be able to answer it. They they're

celebrating right now. Wow. Wow. We don't have to look at DVDs and references and all. We just have a to do this and it'll do it right. So, uh there what is there are two stories that

actually um that actually I was thinking about when we were uh when I was driving up over here. Suppose I give a script which says that there is a uh small sleepy town um uh upstate New York with

a police officer um you know and he's dealing with his own uh uh marital issues and it's it's going to be summer and people are going to come to the beach and the night before a girl goes

into the into the water and she's she's just had a she's just come from a party she's enjoying the boys running after her and there's There's a shark. Suppose I give this to AI,

right? You'll see the shark in the first 5 minutes. In Spielberg's jaws, the shark kept sinking. It just sank 32 times. You never saw the shark, right? So, what did

he do? He turned the camera around and he said, "Let me put it make it the point of view of the shark." Right? He made it the point of view of a shark. He put some music to it

and you were scared. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; that's original. It happens right then and there. The the thing about a original film is it has mistakes. It has

human error, right? A a good film is a series of mistakes. A great film celebrates the mistake. What AI will all constantly do, I mean

there's another incredible story of Stanley Cubri. Tom Cruz went was shooting eyes wide shut and he called up Steven Spielberg after day one and he said, "Hey, you you you scared me. You

told me that he's a terrible director. He doesn't he just goes on and on and on. He harasses you and we finished we finished 3 minutes of of of three pages of a scene and we just have a shot of me

coming in which we are doing tomorrow." The next day he did 52 takes coming in, going out, coming in, going out, coming in, going out. And after that the 52nd take he asked

cubri what was I doing wrong he said I don't know but you were not doing it right that is film making that's the magic that you can't get in any

so I have a I have an interesting story here okay so I was just telling Nicl so I have a 11year-old who loves making films. He has decided that he's going to make he's going to become a film

director. Okay. And at some point um he was very shy to go he's like you know I cannot just go talk to people. My kids in kids in my school are very mean. I cannot ask them to act in my films. So

I'm going to use AI to just do it. Right. And we experimented for a week using an AI model that's very very popular for making movies that I cannot name. Um and we did

&gt;&gt; tell me I don't know it. something that I'll tell you right after this. Okay. &gt;&gt; And and we and he had his we we take we took snippets from his stories and we

tried to create it. It was horrible. And and and the the frustrating thing for him was not that they didn't generate relevant uh imagery and stuff from the description, but that it's it didn't

match it doesn't match what I have in my head. This is the artistic intention he was talking about, right? tools cannot understand what you're seeing, right? And and and a human language is not very

good at translating it also. Uh and and now the challenge also with these models is look at how they are trained, right? You your models are trained on publicly available data sets. Legally or not is a

different story, but it is it is found on the internet, right? It's it is data that people have decided to put up. It's data that they want to show in some good light, right? But what about all the

things that people have not shared where the real values is? What about the stories that my grandmother told me? What about the cultural tapestry that that we we all know but we have never

translated it. So things it the data is very incomplete and very bias biased in the sense that it represents a a select few they might not be representative of the entire world right and now when we

generalize uh when we generalize AI through what it can do today we are also normalizing and we are flattening the world and that is the worry right and if if people start

believing and we are going to rely on AI for everything that we are doing eventually you're going to lose your originality. Everything is going to be flat and uniform and it is good. It's

good for the AI models. It's good for the companies, right? But I think I I think that's the problem I feel with originality and the representation does not exist um on things that really uh

matter really that that adds the texture to culture and it captures how how we all evolved as human being, how culture evolved. uh and until that becomes part of it and then the question then is do

we even want to capture all this thing do we want to capture really this in AI right what does it what does it mean to be human then right so I think those are the questions that we need to understand

uh otherwise it's just going to be super hard right yeah &gt;&gt; um I'll add to that first of the question I I want to know which actor was late on set Nikil [laughter] to tell

me that at some point &gt;&gt; every actor you know sense that there are some actors who will say that you or people will tell me that oh that actor is so

good now he comes on time he comes on time you better come on time boss [laughter] what do you mean that's not a that's not a virtue you got to come on time 400

other people have come on time yeah um but I think it speaks you know the the question of originality is one that it's it's it vexes me um the story that I have to share is very recently I think

this captures like the pain in my heart about it. I saw this video online and it was a split screen and on one part of the screen AI systems were prompted various things. Draw a lion, draw a

phoenix, whatever it was, right? Various descriptions of a prompt. The same prompts were given to children, right? And on one hand, on one part of the screen, you saw these fantastic, very

overproduced, beautiful phoenixes and whatnot. Other hand, you saw children's representations of what they believed. And it was weird and it was wonderful. And the juxtaposition of the two still

pains me to see. It's like exactly that that that learning process that um that error that that imaginative thinking in a flattened world is something that we really ought to pay attention to cuz we

we can really flatten it. It's it's it's there. We we're seeing it. So for for me it's existential. I really really do feel it is existential. It is important for us to recognize that. And um to take

that question of originality again to more structural terms as well. We have current we have current systems where as you quite well put it Diva um we have collective social imaginary like

originality is not one great genius. We stand on the shoulders of giants we also as we're standing on these shoulders we are holding on to future generations and the future before us. Right? It's not

we're looking backward and forward etc. as we imagine the future um and as we are thinking about what is new and what is wonderful and what is imaginative in this world and for us to do so it is a

collective project but we do not have collective consent. We do not have collective compensation. We do not have collective control mechanisms to return that imagination to the communities on

which it is built. And that for me is the problem that originality is currently very much so and has remained so a community a collective human

human very human community um identity formation that um is extremely important to us but it is not captured in the way that our economic incentives have been structured and and that's a mismatch.

So I mean here we are at the summit. Um you know we allegedly will be producing sets of principles uh ways that we want companies to behave, governments policy, all of these kinds of things are

supposed to be outcomes of this uh event. If we had a lot of let's say the three of you had a lot of control over what that looked like and we're all worried about originality. We want to

preserve creativity. We want to uplift the collective imagination, avoid flattening, give people tools to democratize. What are ways that you would add to the policy, the principles,

the technology? Let's say you could control it uh to make that more possible. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm going first. Okay. Um &gt;&gt; nicely played. Um I I think I think few

things. Uh I do think transparency is the key. Uh you need to know what you're training on. uh you need to figure out a way to uh attribute uh one attribute training

and correlate the model outputs with what's trained on uh that will allow for the compensation structure figuring out what is the right uh right incentives because take an example of Spotify right

when Spotify came came in artists sued the company left and right because because of rights they didn't want uh there their tracks to be there they didn't they wanted fair compensation uh

there were there questions of piracy or of consent. I think we have to figure that piece out. I feel that comes from transparency. Second, I think is uh infra should be

open. Uh we people should build for their own problems. Uh this this AI should be the AI infrastructure should be a civic infrastructure. It cannot be uh exclusively accessed by few for

people who have the money who can who are who can who have the privilege to uh to to buy to purchase compute that's very expensive. Uh I think I think there needs to be a collective commons where

uh infra is available for everyone and with with good ideas uh and and problems that are meaningful to to solve local community needs those things have to come. So open infra and transparency

would be the two things that I would currently focus on. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So um &gt;&gt; time to think. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I thought I was uh

you know I'm u I'm a little concerned about the fact that we do we will not more and more it will become bit difficult to understand what is real and what is not real.

&gt;&gt; Yes. And uh we tend to do that very very effectively in in the news today right it's just so we don't know what is happening what is real what is not real do you have how can you actually um and

and you know the way um young children and and and women are portrayed on you know with with various tools etc but at the same time I'm I'm a huge believer of voltaire who says that I dis I may

disagree with what you have but I will go to my debt to try and defend for [snorts] your right to say it. Um so I don't have I don't have those I think that there are more powerful

people who are who are dealing with these things. But if tomorrow anything that is uh impinging on uh privacy rights, human rights, child rights, I think those are very important uh

conversations to be had to have uh when you are uh advocating the the kind of tools that everybody's talking about at the summit, you know. &gt;&gt; Yeah.

&gt;&gt; I have um maybe two things to add. We win if we are able to look power in the face and say in these rooms where AI policies are being developed, AI tooling systems, protocols are being

developed, we say you are missing the imagination layer. you are missing a huge component of the so-called stack that is invisible but drives everything. When we insist on that on that when we

call out policy makers, leaders, when we call them out to say you are being shortsighted, we win by insisting on that reality over and over again. And so I think that's

what's missing. That's what I would hope that we can take away is to insist upon that because it's important. And then the second thing I have to say is on the individual level the boy or girl whoever

who is who's dreaming to create keep doing that. That's critical especially now more so than ever. Keep dreaming and keep creating. &gt;&gt; Beautiful. I think we have uh a few

minutes left for uh questions from the audience if anyone wants to ask a question. Juu, do you want to? &gt;&gt; Yeah, we can take up questions. &gt;&gt; You can make the pick as a moderator.

&gt;&gt; Uh I think it might be easier if you pick someone you can walk to. But then what about our authoral intent? &gt;&gt; Hello. Um, thank you for this talk. Very informative and motivating for sure. Um,

I wanted to ask you all being you know from creative fields and especially Nikil. What do you do and how do you deal with you know not getting the outcome of your creativity? Sometimes

you really want to be appreciated or even understood. For example, if you're a writer, right, or a painter, you really want the person to understand. And in this current generation where

following and likes are everything, how do you just keep going on when you know you have something that you can bring out to the world? That's important. And you you know it's important because you

felt through the bad stuff and you want to give this out what you've learned. Am I making sense at this point? because I'm no &gt;&gt; I mean I stop talking to that person who

doesn't understand me. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I I I mean yeah no I'm just joking. Um personally what I do and I it it's uh uh

I never see anything I make again once I make it and once I put it out into the world &gt;&gt; uh I never see it. uh so when somebody comes to me and says I don't like it

they didn't like it but you know so uh uh whether it's a script whether it's whether it's something that I made a feature or a film or a show or whatever uh I've never seen it I've not seen kona

I've not seen D-Day I've not seen airlift I've not I've not seen any of those films uh it helps because once it's out in the world it's no longer mine right I want you to actually

watch it in the most uh or hear it or be with when I am narrating it to you or in the most optimum place with a great sound and great picture and great this and great that it's never going to

happen. You've had a fight with your boyfriend or you had a fight with your mom or your father or you've had it's a very good day. Your boss has given you. So you you've come into that into that

that room with possibly with not the way I want you to uh see. So that so uh I don't actually uh sorry I mean I don't care. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. No that that makes sense. I think

that's important for us to understand. &gt;&gt; And you have to make yourself very hard. You have to make yourself very because everybody has an opinion right. &gt;&gt; Everybody has an opinion. So as if if

you are writing then just basically have a thick skin. Surround yourself with a group of people who you think are important and whose m opinion matters to you. If they are okay everything is

okay. helps. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Uh hi guys. Uh Nicholson, I'm a big fan of your work. I also work at a uh film production company in Bombay. It's

called Atomic Films. &gt;&gt; All what? &gt;&gt; Atomic Films with Karan Numan. Uh and we have been experimenting with the use of AI for the last 6 months, ever since we

dropped really. Um and I know there were calls for transparency on this panel. I just wanted to speak about the nature of the beast and and understand your take on is transparency really possible. Um

especially in a world where we have opensource versus closed source models. Um even if you have some content guidelines. &gt;&gt; So when you say transparency what do you

mean? &gt;&gt; I mean like controlling what these models train on. um now that they're already trained now that we have three four generations of these models and the

way I understand it is it's kind of a black box um and you can you know put content flags &gt;&gt; but then there'll always be a Chinese model that comes out and gives you full

access right like that's what's happening in the last few months &gt;&gt; um so how do you &gt;&gt; you know I I see that you brought up Spotify as well and that was interesting

because they they sort of changed copyright laws to evolve for the streaming era do you see something similar happening in the film and TV space.

&gt;&gt; It'll happen everywhere. &gt;&gt; It will happen everywhere. Once one year ago, everybody was talking about ethics and legality and legal and we won't do this and we won't won't do that. Now

they're not going to talk about it. Then now now still they asking you for to be transparent after a while when they realize that hey we saved we made this particular feature film at 50 50% of the

cost. Boom everything is out of the window. Uh yeah. So uh it'll happen everywhere there there there is a right now they every speaking the language that they are supposed to speak which is

hey we need to be you need to be transparent you need to let us know where have you got it when have you got it I think in 6 months time they're not even going to bother about that 6 months

I'm not even saying 5 years and 4 years and 1 year 6 months they're not going to bother &gt;&gt; is that a future without copyright or at least without how we understand

&gt;&gt; India copyright what you're talking about yeah &gt;&gt; India Yeah. Come on. Yeah. The gland of papillary for God's sake. Yeah. There's nothing.

There is no there is no copyright. Oh yeah. Yeah. You know, uh I read somewhere a statistic which is incredible that Bollywood has spent 129 crores last year on just legal fees.

&gt;&gt; That's crazy. &gt;&gt; Those guys are making money. &gt;&gt; There's no I mean come on. Yeah. If somebody wants to I I I made a film called Salameish.

&gt;&gt; Music is great. not seen one rupee, no royalties, all that is for the US. &gt;&gt; Um, so and I'm wondering if you have thoughts on the transparency question.

&gt;&gt; Um, I I think the I do not I I do not understand the movie industry as much so I cannot speak to it but I can talk about the model transparency that you're talking about.

Right. I think it is possible. It's a it's it's a policy thing as well, right? How much do you really want to reveal? And sometimes it's very hard to technically

it's very hard to correlate what you train on versus what the output is. How do you say that I showed you this image and you're using that image when you're generating that model output, right?

It's a technically almost an infeasible problem today. I think we have to evolve and we will evolve and learn and there will be new laws that will form around this one. Uh just recognizing that

recognizing the intent is important. uh I feel and uh the outcome is like like Nicl said it will be outcome driven like where if you can make something for a quarter of the cost with like onetenth

of the people I mean I think I think there is incentive to get your ideas out really really fast isn't it and so it it it can be used as that leverage as well and eventually we will figure out as

collectively what does it really mean how do we and so but we it's important to have these conversations though uh I think that's probably how I see I will add that yes I think it's very

possible. I think it's a choice to create black boxes and not something that we should continue to do. It is however I want to recognize you know we are on a certain path where that is

almost the default but the default needs to change and I do see movement towards that right as soon as independent creators are able to control their works their content and it's not only

necessarily through intellectual property it's through gated mechanisms for their data right uh data infrastructure in particular um as soon as they're able to do that and there are

folks who are working on doing so you change you you change the power dynamics, right? You might push the costs up for models to, you know, use those data sources and the as a result,

yes, it's been some of those um those frontier models u video video generation AI systems and platforms have expressed, oh, it's too expensive to get all of this content, right? But those costs can

come down over time, right? Um and and more importantly, the incentive structure is completely different. So I believe in that in that world where you do have created agency where data

belongs to independent creators. Um and I think it's it's quite realistic to be able to insist upon that. &gt;&gt; We can take two more questions. Diva make your pick that side. We haven't

given any representation. &gt;&gt; How about this? Um okay in the front. &gt;&gt; Thanks. Hi everyone. Thank you for such an enriching session. Uh I just want to know like Nichols sir you just said that

you know originality is something that actors do have. AI is going to give you it is going to come in. It is going to give you better scenes at better cost. The budget is going to get saved. How do

you put a hard stop to it? Because there are people who are uh surviving over this film industry. They have there are daily wage workers. There are a lot of people who are surviving on it. How do

you put in hard stop that you know uh we don't have to go to the AI route we need to bring our own originality back because there will be actors who will be there so how do you uh you know bridge

that gap &gt;&gt; you know the irrespective of everything uh fast fashion and everything you still have uh handiccrafts and hand loom right you still have that right you still have

things that are being made by the hand and those things are today of of high value Uh I think that more and more and I and I I have a uh I'm pretty optimistic about um

us as a community that um yeah we reject things that have manufactured at the end of the day right we reject things that we know that has been easily

done right there's a value to this guy who's basically you know in some village doing block printing and something like that and all so I think that that that will constantly happening there and

there will be what what is the independent cinema never needed budget. It needed heart, right? It just needs heart, right? It didn't need a budget. And my um

my uh hope is that with with is the with the advent of lots of lots of big budget films and big budget uh and commercial and mainstream cinema using going they will they will move totally towards AI

right because at the end of the day their intent like I said right in the beginning is the is the Friday Saturday Sunday box office right it's that's not there no there's no other intent as a

result of which I feel the independent cinema the interesting storytelling the original storytelling will really really get a flip right and yeah so uh and it's you can already see it you can already

see it in the in the live shows and the live performances that that have gone up I don't know there there's I mean sitting over there she'll give you a statistic of how live shows have just

gone out of the roof right you want to go and see a great standup you want to go and for a great performance but because there is a connection that connection is not going anywhere I don't

think that's going to go anywhere okay one last question Dia make your pick &gt;&gt; um so in the yellow shirt in the back &gt;&gt; yes I was &gt;&gt; thank you so much ma'am first I have to

thank you you allowed me uh my question is uh to uh Mr. Nikl uh by the way I'm the founder CEO of a company called Cartoon Movie. Our website is cartoon.ov and uh we are working on democratizing

animation to everybody. We have envisioned this three years ago and we are making a one largest ecosystem for both production and consumption. Uh sir in in this kind of a generative AI era

by the way I'm a technologist. I'm I'm working towards democratization of technology. So if we want to flourish in this such a disruptive space for creators and global economies as well, I

would like to take one piece of your advice/gan so that we would be able to implement that and flourish uh you know as a win-win situation for creators and also

technologist like us. I don't know whether I'm flourishing myself. Yeah, I don't know. I don't know. I think that um my my Gan might I don't know hire the

guy the the kids that he was who were drawing uh you know I think that's that's what what what possibly I I I you possib you know generative AI I had to read up before coming over here I didn't

even know what it was so uh I it has to you it has to be uh original storytelling in my mind right at the end of the way when you are prompting there are so many things that I I think right

that's how it works right it it it it gathers information from and then it creates um most of the stuff and and and I'm only talking about the the Indian film

industry right most of the stuff that we we celebrate mediocrity right we celebrate it right wow superb Friday Saturday you know how we make films we make films because Friday

Oh, that kind of thing. So, we don't care about it. But then there are those thing that you guys go for and you go over and over again because there's a connection.

I think that's the most important thing. If if AI can give you that, great. If a kid can give you that, great. If a story can give you that, connection is very important. Without that, it's never

going to work in my opinion. I just want to add to that as well which is as Nikquille was saying the artist's intent extremely important the originality learning from mistakes

making mistakes extremely important this is not anti- AI I have seen incredible artists working with AI iterating on their work going through multi-step processes not it's not just a prompt

right sometimes we just think it's just a prompt at the end of you know a chat GPT or a new video creation tool etc. there's a whole process. It takes a very long time to do some of the work that um

that folk are are learning how to do and that's very exciting, right? It's extremely exciting. So all of the things that we mentioned, they can apply to AI generated work, right? There's the

structural reasons we all talked about, the incentives, the geopolitics, all of that remains in in in in the forefront as well. Um, but I would say to you experiment with it, but do so

responsibly, right? Do so with your community and think through is this the version of creativity I want to put out into the world that makes me and my community feel like we have done

something original that has returned value to us and I think you can't go wrong there. &gt;&gt; What a great place to end. Thank you everyone so much for

&gt;&gt; Thank you everyone for uh joining this panel. the organizers who will will give a moment to the speakers. And uh thank you everyone. Please make way for uh next session

speakers please. Heat. Heat. Here I am.
