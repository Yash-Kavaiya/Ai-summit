## 📝 Summary

As AI reshapes global security faster than treaties can anticipate, traditional governance is falling behind. This session proposes "AI Diplomacy"—shifting the focus from rigid harmonization to establishing operational "fire-breaks" for immediate risks. Convening ministers and experts, we explore how Asian leadership can secure trusted lines of communication in a fragmented world. Join this high-level dialogue to transition from abstract ethics to durable, cross-border crisis mechanisms.
