## 📝 Summary

Over the past decade, digital platforms and AI have transformed how children learn, socialise, and access information, including within schools.

This panel explores global policy approaches—duty-of-care, age-appropriate design, age assurance, recommender governance, and education safeguards—to balance innovation with stronger online safety for children.
