## 📝 Transcript

And I now like to invite Mr. Rohan Chhatwal, Vice President Innovation and Governance Excellence Marauti Suzuki to deliver the welcome note. [applause]

&gt;&gt; Hi, good afternoon everyone. I am so happy the house is full. Few minutes back I was just wondering how many people would fill in this hall but I'm so glad there are people s standing at

the back as well. So once again Dishi has already welcomed you but on behalf of the Marauti Suzuki innovation team and Marauti Suzuki family we welcome you all to this wonderful AI summit

organized by of course India AI mission and the government of India and uh such a wonderful theme happiness for all welfare for all because the end of the day it boils down to happiness and

welfare no matter how much money you make whether you do series A series B series the whether you become CIO, CEO or whatever end of the day if you're not happy is it even really worth it and uh

our prime minister has chosen such a wonderful theme that it connects with everyone whether you are in tech or non- tech because happiness is something which we all look for

and a perfect theme of aspiring India aspirational India and abundant India And I would say that with AI what has

happened we have learned a lot of lot from so many speakers because I can see Akilleshan here he's he has taken a couple of master classes for us. AI is such a great leveler because it

has kind of reset the entire world. If you were to imagine and visualize somebody has pressed the button reset because after a long time there is something which no one can claim that he

or she is a master of. No one big company or a startup or a consultant or any individual can say he or she has mastered AI. AI is such a new field and all of us are together trying to learn

this. At times during our internal discussions with Tapans and other senior colleagues at Maruti, I won't say we get confused but uh we wonder what should be our playbook, what

should we do because there's so much of noise and there's so much of information and almost every given day you have a new news and that news is about AI or something related to AI.

So we can't be always in a hustle mode because we are a corporate. So the playbook which tapans always says let's collaborate because we cannot depend on one party whether a big tech firm or a

small tech firm we can't depend on one individual so we work with practically all consultants all big tech companies and also startups that is precisely one of the reasons we we are organizing this

under the India AI mission and startups bring a lot of agility to Marauti's ecosystem startups bring a lot of fresh perspective to Maruti Suzuki And that's what we have learned the last five years

or so. Another interesting uh Tapansan is looking at a time. I have five minutes. I still have three minutes. So another interesting point here is instead of

questioning the capabilities of AI, we're trying to embrace it in letter and spirit. I have lot of colleagues of mine here. I can see Raja Abilasha San Utam San who are actually driving a lot of AI

transformation within the company including san I remember few weeks back one of my colleague Rahul said there's too much of hype about AI is it really worth it because there are

some concepts probably he might have uh read it or learned it during his college days as well but then I gave the example from one of the master classes taken by Akillesh

that don't question if you were to compare AI, compare it like it's a refrigerator. I'm sure now you're able to uh think what I'm just going to say. So think of

AI as a refrigerator. So instead of wasting your time on building another refrigerator, think of what we can put inside that refrigerator. Because if you plot the

data of the last 20, 30, 40 years, it's the beverage companies who have made more money than the refrigerator companies. If you look at the top 10, 20, 30 brands globally, beverage

companies are actually in that top 10 20. I'm not saying we start manufacturing cola, but the analogy here is let's not waste time in questioning the capabilities of AI. Let's embrace it

in letter and spirit. And that's what we all are trying to do at Marauti Suzuki Innovation. Instead of spending too much time on uh on scale deployments, what we are doing is collaborate with startups

and do quick pilots and move ahead. On that note, let's spend next 40 45 minutes together to learn what new we can do in this field of AI and do something which is relevant for a coder

in Bengaluru, a startup in Hyderabad or a professional here in Gura or a farmer in Punjab or anyone who is actually breathing because AI is going to be that thread which is going to connect all of

us. But somebody said resources are not unlimited. So time and money is limited and time is of essence here and speed is something which can be of our strategic advantage because speed as part of your

strategy was not thought about before but now speed can actually be your strategy and we don't have time to land a Boeing 737 on a kilometer long runway. It's actually about landing a fighter

aircraft on a aircraft carrier. That's the kind of speed. That's the kind of precision we all are looking for and we believe AI can help us solve this. On that note, I once again welcome you all

and let's open this wonderful 40 45 minutes of discussion on AI. Thank you so much for coming. [applause] &gt;&gt; Thank you sir for setting the tone so thoughtfully. Let us now watch an AV

showcasing Maruti Suzuki's innovation journey. In [music] 1956, Alan Turing presented a bold idea that machines could learn, reason, and assist human intelligence

called AI. For decades, [music] AI evolved through research and experimentation. Today, it has moved beyond laboratories to become a catalyst for global

progress. From navigating our journeys to understanding [music] our languages. From smarter healthcare to seamless digital services, AI is now [music] part of everyday life. India is

emerging as a global leader in this transformation by becoming one of the fastest countries [music] to learn, upskill and adopt AI. The India [music] AI mission is building

AI as a national capability with more than 10,300 [music] cr rupees public funding to strengthen national GPU computing infrastructure startup [music] financing data sets

platforms and indigenous foundation models. Aligned with this national [music] vision, Marauti Suzuki is leveraging AI across its value chain to redefine mobility.

From intelligent manufacturing [music] systems that predict faults to AI powered quality inspections that enhance safety and precision, AI [music] works alongside our people, helping them make

better, faster decisions. AI also helps us understand our [music] customers better by anticipating their service needs, personalizing [music] experiences and strengthening trust

across every touch point. As India moves towards [music] becoming the largest AI hub under the leadership of our Prime Minister Marauti Suzuki remains committed to using AI [music] to

bring you the joy of mobility. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; It is now my pleasure to invite a visionary leader whose work has significantly shaped innovation in the

automotive sector. Dr. The Tapan Sahu Executive Officer Digital Enterprise and Information and Cyber Security Marauti Suzuki has been a strong advocate of technology-led transformation and future

mobility solutions. Sir, may I please request you to deliver the leadership address. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much. Thank you everyone for joining here. Anamans, Aklesan, all

our panelists, thank you very much for joining us in this session. I'll take about 10 minutes now to talk about our journey and our journey is embedded in India's journey.

If you look at the evolution of Marauti Suzuki and the evolution of Indian automobile growth story, it's clearly deeply embedded. The transformation of the supplier ecosystem, the value chain,

the development of local enthusiasm and uh you know entrepreneurs in the automotive component sector is a testimony of that. And uh as India is poised to grow to

2047 you know set up by our honorable prime minister about the Amrit Khal I think that's the journey India is taking and we are taking our own journey in this

context. Uh these are some of the figures from McKenzie report which talks about India growth story. The GDP growth which is there being the third largest

expected to be the third largest by 2030 and with the highest GDP growth and in this context this is a report recent report about a week back from NITIO which talks about India's carbon

neutrality journey for 2017. So in that context I think the impact on mobility sector is going to be profound. If you look at the kind of uh growth which is expected in terms of kilometer traveled

both in terms of passenger and uh goods transport as well as the transformation of the power trains and the related ecosystem is tremendous. If you look at the figures uh at the bottom chart, I

think there is going to be huge transformation both in terms of infusion of technology as well as the powertrain electrified electrified vehicle penetration by70.

So from a ais from a current scenario, it's expected to grow up to 100% in some of the segments. So that's the real transformation which is happening there. And in this question is how can we

accelerate this without slowing down. So why slowing down? Because India today automotive sector today contributes about 7.1% to the GDP 49% of manufacturing GDP and aspiration is to

double it by 2030. So when we want to do that and if you look at the numbers projections I have not put any number because the numbers are confidential. DM is still in the working but what is

expected is that what happened in the last 42 years in terms of volume is going to grow 6x in next 21 years. Half of the time but six times growth. Today we are producing

about 4 million vehicles in India today. passenger vehicles likely to be about 24 to 30 million vehicles. Is it a manageable growth? the kind of space that is required, the kind of people

that is required, the kind of transformation that is required, how do you connect so many organizations, so many plants, so much of operations, so many consumers at scale and that's where

probably the role of AI comes in as a technology and at misuki digital enterprise uh we are driving digital innovation and transformation across the valuation in the organization. This is

our journey. All of you know like I said but our journey is also ambitious. What we did in 42 years we want to do do in six years. So two zero to 2 million in 42 years but 2 to 4 million in next 6

years. That's our plan about 4 million production you know five plant locations probably 67,000 number of touch points customer touch points and about by that time

would be about 40 plus or 45 plus million of customers so that's the kind of scale that we have and you know to transform that it becomes extremely important that we adopt technology and

use technology. So in this context if you look at it what are we trying to do at digital enterprise we are trying to move the organization the move is that we provide joy of

mobility to our consumers we create a culture of open innovation make sure that we're creating value with adoption of technology and empower our employees which is in order to make decisions at

the age and for this how do how are you adopting AI I mean I think first is responsible AI making sure that we we have a responsible AI framework already in

place which is implemented and also making authentic impact. We are not looking AI as hype. We are looking at how we can actually use AI to make authentic impact. Two examples I'll give

first with customer. If you look at the customer's journey today I think customers are highly highly digital savvy and there are various touch points except two which are digitized. However,

there are multiple apps which are you know joining these customers today and uh what we're doing is we're trying to create a solution for the consumers so that they have a seamless journey.

Clicker is not working. So, so, so that they have a very very similar journey. And in this context, next slide. Sorry, back.

What's happening? Previous slide. Just check if the battery is low in this clicker. Yeah. So we are trying to create a seamless

journey for the consumers and this is not only to look at their journey with the vehicle. We are looking at mobility at large. So the mobility plate includes your place for parking.

When you have gone to a party and you are drunk or you don't want to drive, you get a driver on demand. And when you're traveling with family, you want to find a clean washroom, you can do

that. So that's the kind of vision we have to provide joy of mobility across the lifetime of our consumers. And the next one is IoT connected factories making sure that all our

plants are connected and we have a very well integrated factory setup which gives real-time visibility insights alarms and automated. So we are getting into a smart factory concept as far as

Martuki is concerned and in this journey what is helping us like Rohan said is our innovation program our work with startups and our ecosystem partners. So we have four streams of startup programs

starting with incubation uh the nurture program with IM Kolkata the incubation program with IM Bangalore our own accelerator and then the mobility challenge with Ghub and we have

also created a program of fund raise for our startup founders and so far we have looked at about 6,200 plus startups 200 plus of them are engaged with us 60 are doing paid PC's and 32 have become our

business partners we provide the scale to name Marauti is the market. Few days back I was uh I met met Tom Chij right who had written about the high frequency change and this uh slide

caught my attention. Tech change is happening at such a such a fast pace. If you compare that with human body or organizations in that sense we are not able to adapt to it. So

therefore what how can organizations evolve that can only happen through entrepreneurs and you know people enthusiastic people like startups. So

the for managing high frequency change as organizations we need to be agile we need to adapt to that change because we can change ourselves quickly and therefore the adoption of startups

becomes a very very key enabler as far as Marushuki innovation program is concerned and in this it's not only the startups our ecosystem partners we are partnering with government bodies

industry the whole tech partners and that's what is driving our innovation and we hope that all of us together can democratize AI solutions for mobility in India going forward. Thank you very

much. &gt;&gt; Thank you sir for those inspiring insights. Our next speakers bring deep expertise at the intersection of technology policy and enterprise

transformation. Please join me in welcoming Mr. Akillesha partner and national leader clients and markets KPMG. [applause] Thank you. Thank you very much.

&gt;&gt; Okay. Good afternoon everyone. I can't tell you how inspired I am to be in front of you here and talk about it. Uh wonderful opening by uh Rohan and uh wonderful opening by uh and great

statistics uh from Tapan. Especially the lot of people who don't work with Marauti do not realize that it slowly is a tech company also selling cars and I think that's a big change which I'm

seeing and the amount of uh ecosystem based innovation you're driving is uh absolutely amazing. Uh I know every minute I take uh we'll be away from these five wonderful speakers so I'll

try and be fast. Uh but I did make the mistake of making some slides. So when consultant they get uh committed to their slides. So unfortunately I am. So I'm emotionally tied but I've got 10

minutes and I'll try and finish in 10 minutes. Can you get the timer on and when I request Punea you can go to the next slide because I don't have a clicker. So um somebody told me that we

are at the edge of innovation. This is the time when all the innovations are happening. But if you click on the next slide Punea I'll ask you a question to all of you is when do you think the

first aviation autopilot technology was built? Any guesses when was the first autopilot built? 1940 &gt;&gt; 1940 okay uh you click and you'll get

the answer uh Lawrence just go back Lawrence Perry was the guy who actually go back to the pre just he was the guy who demonstrated an autopilot on 18th of June 1914 this is actually a picture of

that time this is less than 10 years since the time the right brothers had taken the first flight out so imagine all of us think that you know we are living in a world change where change is

happening but Actually a lot of change has been happening for a very very long time. The problem is that some of these changes ahead of its time and he actually demonstrated this walking onto

the flap that he he could have the the flight balance through an autopilot which was built at that point time. Get to the next slide. And then a lot of people tell me saying that mm-m if that

was built in 1914 which means that everything that could have been invented has already been invented. So why are we in this room? And next click will tell you that uh the wheel was invented about

4th millennium BC. And the luggage for people to carry luggage when they come to this place was built about 200 250 years ago. But it took nearly 170 years for people to figure out that they can

put a wheel under the the luggage to actually make it like a trolley. So all of you who believe that a lot of innovation has happened, I can tell you there is innovation which happens enough

every number of time and therefore I think that innovation is anything but unpredictable but predictable. So it is anything but predictable. You can call anything innovation but if it is

predictable it certainly is not the innovation. So I do believe that while we are not living on the edge but we are lucky to be alive in this AI era. Any guesses on what was uh Collins

dictionary's 2025 word of the year. Every year they add so many words to the dictionary and they say pick one word which has changed the game for 2025. Any guesses what that word was?

AI? No. AI is a very old word. Maybe in 1940s they added AI. Uh next click will tell you the word was vibe coding. the vibe coding changed the game and there we said that you don't need to be

a programmer to create a code you don't need to be a programmer to write software you just need to have the right vibe and once you have the right vibe AI will write the code so that I think is a

true inflection point where the general understanding of technology goes to everybody through a dictionary to say that wbe coding is the way of life for us to see so how do we envision 2047

which is a hard task for me in front of you here so uh tapans actually did a better job than I'm going to do here. He talked about saying all the changes that happened in 44 years and in 21 years

we'll have much much more. So I looked at what the world so if you to see 21 years hence bad idea go back 20 21 years. Maybe we should go back 500 years but let's say 20 years back. So 20 years

back we had about 21 million uh internet users. We had about a million or less smartphone. Today we got nearly a billion or them. Digital economy was 2% of the GDP. Today the digital economy by

any stretch of imagination is at least 12 to 15%. And if you look at the energy which is the lowest bottom layer of the AI life cycle the energy at that point was just about 6 gawatt. Today we are

talking about 270 gawatt of non fossil energy. So let's quickly tell you saying what the 2047 could look like and my answer is that the the next 2047 will look like as much as your imagination.

It's not anything our imagination will drive. But when I think about that optimism, I get reminded by that quote from the movie Chennai Express which says that do not underestimate the power

of a common man. And I said, do not estimate the power of a common engineer who's sitting behind an AI engine and has the w coding capabilities and what that engineer could do. So I just

thought that rather than talking about what the future could look like, I wanted to talk to all of you to say that what the future shouldn't look like and that might be one way for us to go

through some of these stories. And I said I learned from three stories. I've got about six minutes to go and I'll try and run run three stories in that time. These are the three stories which I've

learned. So the first story if you go further down is the story which I will hear from the remote control. You'll have to keep clicking till this slide comes up. I grew up learning that

necessity is the mother of invention. We all know that right? But the next league will tell you that possibility is also the father of invention. Can you just keep clicking porn? I think just just

fill the whole slide up. Yeah, that's just go back here. So, while the necessity is the mother of invention, just because something is possible, that becomes another reason to innovate. And

that's a great thing about this remote control, which I call the ignored device in all our homes. On an average, a remote control of a television has about 35 buttons.

&gt;&gt; And how many buttons do we all need? I don't know how many do I need, but I actually don't use the remote control because these days I can speak to my TV and it does it. But on a real basis

about maybe 3 to five buttons what we need. Then why does the remote control of a television has 35 buttons the reality is that the incremental cost of adding a feature is nearly zero. Once

you've built the base technology you can just keep adding the features and then what my friend Ross Anderson says that at equilibrium a computer phone or anything programmable will reach the

level of unacceptability for most user and that's the reality. I see a lot of AI development which is happening in this world today which nobody needs, nobody buys and nobody actually deploys.

And the reality is that we say we have got a base model and then let's put everything because the incremental cost of adding anything is nearly zero. When you keep adding lots of things with an

incremental cost of zero, it becomes absolutely useless because for me to find those three buttons, I have to go through those 35 buttons all being programmable. So a lot of innovation is

being edged saying you got four things, I'll make five. I got five, you add six. And that is a one big challenge which the innovation fraternity has to deal with. Let's click on the next one. And

this is my next story about Panchayad. A Graham Punchayad. This story goes like this that uh a serpunch is elected and uh he's been asked question like for things about who

should be punished, who should this thing. So one fine day a villager asked and this is a village somewhere in Hana where I live quite developed part of North America. Uh and uh says you know

serp I'll talk in Hindi. Serpent is and the serpent says that the last time the guy predicted wrong and he was actually pushed out. So if anything else I should play safe and he says this year

will be very cold. So make sure that you got enough sweaters, enough blankets and enough firewood to make sure that you don't die of cold. He says I hope that this year is cold because otherwise

people will be fine. Just go back to the previous one. And then he's always worried whether the cold will there. So he calls up the weather station in Delhi and says you know can you tell me how

cold this year it'll be and they say yeah this year will be quite cold my prediction is going to be right and then another two weeks later which is just the a week before the onset of January

he says you know can you tell me how cold will it be this time and they said this time it'll be super cold the coldest January weekend. He says why do you think it'll be so cold? He says

because we also have other data we collect through our AI and a lot of people are buying sweaters and blankets and all that which they never bought in the past.

So a lot of time we are seeing that what I call the echo chamber AI. There's a lot of AI which is listening from one data amplifies to another amplifies to another. That's what you see when you

start to see your Instagram res look like the same every time. So there's a lot of innovation. Please don't build innovation which is fake data multiplying fake data. Let's go to the

third story. This is a story which I learned yesterday. So this is my experience. Yesterday I was at the Bhat Mandapam. For those of you who really want to listen to the content, come to

this center. Okay. And I thank uh Tapans for hosting it there. Anybody who's at Bhat Mandapam has been tortured by the long cues. No water whatsoever. I have tortured it myself. And I was standing

there. There were three people. Uh there's an American, a British, sorry, a German and an Indian person. The person on the left side is that's an American, the German lady and and Indian. So they

say you know which why are we doing AI summit in India? And this guy says we are doing AI summit in India because AI is ahead. AI India is the AI capital of the world. This is why you've seen this.

I can prove it to you. So American says no no we are far ahead. I can tell you we went to Washington DC and we started to dig under the ground and after we dug for about 100 meters we found copper

wire and we can say with huge amount of confidence that 100 years ago our ancestors were using copper network. This lady from Germany says you know that doesn't sound good. We actually

went to Berlin and we started to dig. We kept digging at 200 meter we found lots of glass shells. And I can say with confidence that 200 years ago our ancestors are already on the optical

fiber network. And this guy is me and says hm okay [clears throat] we actually went to Delhi we started digging 100 m we found nothing. We went further digging 200 m found nothing. We actually

kept digging 500 m and we found absolutely nothing. So we can say with huge confidence that 500 years ago our ancestors are already on wireless networks.

So a lot of time and I'll give you the example one of the AI company which came to me they said that you know they have got 100% accuracy rate of all the implementations they've done. I said how

many? Three. So there's a lot of wireless networks. So three stories I've told you that don't build remote control which nobody needs. Don't create fake data which will amplify. And the third

one is that don't create an AI which is so fake that it just picks up the data which not the absence of evidence doesn't make it proven right. So with that I've got about 26 second and I'll

try and wrap it. If you go go to the next one keep going fast. What could be a good success strategy in today's world your idea plus AI can just be your product. Keep going. And this is what

the equation I used to say many years ago. Progress was equal to skill set and mindset. In today's world, thanks to AI and VIP coding, the skill set, the value of skill set has come down, but the

value of mindset has emerged even more. I don't have a time to tell you, but there's an experiment which was done in Wharton just about a few months ago where they proved that it's no longer

the technological capability of a human being, but about the domain expertise and a mindset of a human being which can beat a common engineer 500 times in terms of the speed of development of a

product. Now I don't have time to tell you this but there are many ways to solve a problem and there are two ways which is analysis and synthesis keep going fast and I'll just leave you with

this thought from Deep Nishar a great visionary and he said that to be a good product manager you need the brain of an engineer the heart of a designer and the speech of a diplomat. So with that

ladies and gentlemen thank you very much for having me here and I hope you get to that level very fast. Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; Thank you sir. We now move to the panel discussion on the topic accelerated

innovation for nation building the role of AI startups in India's growth story for Vix Bharat by 2047. To explore this further we have an exceptional panel with us today which will be moderated by

Mr. Dr. Rohan Chhatwal, Vice President, Innovation and Governance Excellence, Marauti Suzuki. Let me introduce our esteemed panelist, Miss Anisha Singh, founder and managing partner, Shi

Capital, [applause] Mr. Akel Gupta, founder Nobroker.com and Converen AI, Mr. Kavikrut, CEO Thub, Mr. Abhilash Tander Rajan, founder Privac Sapion.

So you have precisely 16 minutes. Thank you Akilleshan that was brilliant. I mean you are always actually you should start taking more master classes and get royalty from ET as well because

they do lovely master classes and uh I don't know whether you read it or not but the topic for today's fantastic panel discussion we have about 15 minutes I've kept a margin of a

minute is accelerated innovation for nation building of course everybody's doing nation building but we want to kind of doubleclick on the role of AI startups how can we

accelerate the pace of innovation uh in India for a Vikid Bhara 2047. Of course, we would love to be as young as what we are today by 2047 but still let's celebrate more on this. I have uh Anisha

son of course we say to all Japanese &gt;&gt; yes thank you so much. So Anisha San you've been leading uh this venture she capital and uh that is why this question is for you that over the last five seven

years in India I think system is now able to crack the startup startup kit I mean there's been a accelerated pace of startups getting started in India with a lot of support of incubators

accelerators lot of capital also going here but if you double click on this still 75% is for early stage stage and seed stage startups. Where is the follow-up capital? How will startups

actually scale up if they are stuck at se seed stage? Because the data also says 80% of the startups after 5 years do not reach series A series B. So how can we solve this? Because if we were to

have a big Sid Bat by 2047 and we want more and more startups to reach series A, B, C, make more money and of course create more value for all the ecosystem players and including you.

&gt;&gt; Well, I think one thing we've got to be aware of um we don't give ourselves enough credit. Unlike the US ecosystem that's been around for over 50 years now, the you know the Silicon Valley of

the world, we've only been around since 20089. And I know this because literally that's when I started raising funding for my startup. So I think we've come a long way. If you look at it, our

startups have graduated. We got over, you know, 200,000 startups. So we've seen the density. That's great. We've gotten there. Um it's a matter of them graduating and getting to where you feel

stable. And I think we're already seeing that. It's not like you're not. We're seeing a lot of startups that have built for scale. Um they are now going IPO. Are they in the deep tech space? No.

&gt;&gt; We are seeing that in consumer and we're seeing a lot of capital chasing them also. You're seeing a lot of mega hit um IPOs happen now. A lot of IPOs are getting overs subscribed. So we're

seeing that. I think where we're seeing this discrepancy is only in um what I'd say is emerging tech and deep tech which we also do. I think the capital needs to be a little more patient but that comes

with comfort, right? You see that happen when um investors have seen some success and then when the other investors join that they're like acha there's light at the end of the tunnel. I think we're

going to start seeing that when we see a lot of deep tech. &gt;&gt; How can VCs like you be more liberal in more follow-up rounds. &gt;&gt; Well I think it's the we are uh by the

way very liberal but I think the great thing that's happened now is a recalibration where it's realistically liberal. And so you're seeing that um you know people are actually looking at

where are you at series A you better be performing you better be you know people are not selling an idea they're selling performance and that is the only difference that series A

&gt;&gt; wonderful takeaway you're selling performance you're actually not selling idea at a series A how many startup founders here with a raise of hands &gt;&gt; we have few how many who wants to be a

startup founder someday I want to be &gt;&gt; who would not I want to go back to the founding world is so much better. But uh at that point, you just have to be mindful of that. I think VCs are now

coming to that. I think the the government and the we're all now starting to put rails uh create things around deep tech and I think we're at that basically the the helm of the chasm

where if we cross it, India is just sorted. We're going to do the same thing we've done with consumer tech companies with deep tech companies. We just as investors also have a responsibility to

our LPS to give back the money, right? And so as long as you see that there's this great play box and this great playbook, we're going to see that we want to be able to back category

creators. &gt;&gt; We have to sell performance. Now I will quickly jump to Kavikan. You have worked with a wonderful startup yourself before scale it up IPO. You made lots and lots

of money. You have Lamborghini with you. So uh the question is you are based out of T-hub Hyderabad and you because by T-Hub I I consider one of the best and one of the biggest uh ecosystem players

in India and you are surrounded by wonderful engineers and the set of very young founders. Again I will come back to scale. Is the purpose of starting a startup is

just uh just survive on three four years or is it about commercially viable for the next 15 20 30 40 50 years like Suzuki was also once a startup and now it's been more than 100 years the

company is surviving so how can we instill this in the young founders who sit out of T-Hub and the ecosystem you have created there &gt;&gt; no fantastic question uh thank you for

having me Ronan I think um I haven't met a single founder who doesn't want to build big right in fact then they are not founders right uh you can define them in some other way so most founders

want to build big people don't realize that it takes time to build companies especially in India even the biggest IPO stories of today started 15 10 12 years ago right so most founders um who may

not have aspiration for 2 or 3 hours are looking at shorter exit cycles at the end of the day now to your question of saying um you know how do we change that survival rate uh I think first of all we

have to look at the signal versus the noise. There's a lot of noise in the startup ecosystem. Uh 10 years ago, you know, it wasn't cool to start up. The first thing people would say is that you

didn't get placed, you know, in a company after your engineering or whatever. Now, it's the coolest thing to do. So, a lot of people on LinkedIn are stealth founders of stealth startups.

And I think there's a lot of noise there. So, as T-Hub, as incubators, as people who are trying to help founders, uh we usually focus on cutting signal from the noise. And I think at the first

two levels which is you have an idea and you have gotten to a prototype of some form or you know an MVP of some form there is a massive lack of intellectual honesty about product market fit right

so that's the first piece where I think survival needs to happen because even if you raise your first check it could be angel it could be institutional you have to get to product market fit if you go

out and ask founders what product market fit means you will get a very mixed definition uh there's a there's a nice definition that I like that Sequoa had you know put together Rajan told me

about it it's basically you should have insane customer love you should have found a distribution channel and you should have some form of margin or profit economics if you have those three

then that means you have so I think that's the first place and the second is what you were talking to Anisha also about is I think early stage risk capital still does not exist in the

country uh this is when a great founder has a good idea but doesn't know which way to go I think that's where uh massive amounts of capital needs to come in I think if you're able to do do those

two things you know early on then the so-called funnel the survival rate uh you know will change uh but I think right now we just have to find signals uh in the noise that's what we seeing as

tub I'll just add one last bit Rohansan is that given everything and you know Akilles G was talking about it you know a few minutes ago he by the way you almost sounded like a founder doing an

elevator pitch the the energy and the pace and the clarity with which you pitched but um now we are in a the entire startup ecosystem system as we know it, foundership as a science or a

art, everything is getting disrupted. Funds that raised 100 mil or 200 mil as a fund size, you know, 10 years ago now want to raise a billion or three billion. Yeah, Lightseed just did. So, I

think everything is getting disrupted and as an incubator or as a, you know, ecosystem builder, uh, if you think about what's happening in the space, you know, think of it like a watchtower in a

forest. We don't know what the jungle looks like anymore. The food pyramid is changing, the tweeting of the birds is changing, the flora and fauna is changing. as a watchtower you can go up

you can see what's happening come back down and I can tell you that with everything that's happening in AI on and how everything is getting disrupted the world is a whole new place so all the

questions that we are answering you know on what is product market fit &gt;&gt; may change &gt;&gt; yes we we have to now keep continuously evolving and you can't wait for it to

happen you have to build the plane while you're in the air right as you fly &gt;&gt; and I think that's what I would seek you know for founders to do to survive the funnel be intellectually honest to

yourself uh raise risk capital as early as you can and try to achieve product market fit as soon as possible. &gt;&gt; I'll come to the risk capital later on in the second question. Uh uh Mr. Akil u

just to put some numbers here in about 2021 about eight tech companies went for IPO in 2024 about 27 tech companies went for IPO in 2025 it's about 41 number could be we can 41 could be 42 or 39 but

it's 41. Do you think with the with the support of AI this number can actually scale up and AI can actually support startups from series A to now scale it up to B C and then eventually IPO

&gt;&gt; for sure. So basically if if you talk about us it's 12 years since we started doing business and uh the time it has taken us to be where we are right now in terms of the revenue in terms of the

size uh I keep telling my team with AI anybody can come and disrupt you uh if we don't change whatever somebody has achieved in 8 10 12 years it can easily be done in two three years because as uh

Akles was talking about w coding as more and more people are coming without having to learn a specific skill set and they can leverage AI to learn at a very very fast pace and deliver at even

faster pace. Uh it's insane. So uh I feel in next 5 10 years you'll see many more IPOs and uh it will be a very very critical part of uh 2047 uh mission bharat where we'll be a developed

country. uh there will be thousands of companies, thousands of new entrepreneurs, big companies which which would have been created out of India and AI would have played a extremely

critical role in that. &gt;&gt; Thanks. Thanks Akish. I'll come to Abilash. Abilash is a is a startup founder again private sapian. Abilash of course you're a super talented guy. I'm

not taking any credit for that but I believe you are one of the beneficiaries of the action happening in India in the last 3 to four years. whatever I mean the government is doing, ecosystem is

doing, corporates are doing and whether the support of VCs, I mean practically everything which is which is right in India probably you are you are one of the beneficiaries of this. So how do you

what's your take on how the ecosystem can support more players like you and we can have more previs than just 10 20 30%. &gt;&gt; Uh that's a great question. First of

all, thank you for having me and uh Marati is like our home. This is the first paying customer we won in 2023 uh the mail program, right? [clears throat] Um so what is needed in the ecosystem is

like companies I'm not saying for the sake of saying but corporates willing to work with companies startups and paying them the P paying for the P giving them the business use case more importantly

right actual problem on the ground because what you think we were speaking about the product market fit right but for somebody to understand what is a product market fit they need to

understand the actual requirement from ground and that is something generally is not available. Startups think something but when they go to the ground it is something different. Do they have

the agility to connect to the business requirement solve the requirement while whether it is being paid or not being paid and accelerate it build the narrative connect with there are

different dimensions to it. It can be technical, it can be legal. Now lot of things on the AI side of things. Building a ecosystem community all these things are critical if they can do it

and work with stakeholders not just customers for example ecosystems like Marati or NASCOM or DSCI work with those ecosystems communicate the message when this happens then subsequent things

happen like you get to be noticed and typically they say do don't chase the money chase the solution and then the money will chase you. So when these things are done what we are seeing from

our lens is that when these things happen then naturally the the value proposition side things happen but the foundation thing is chase the use case be agile to solve the problem once you

do this then everything else follows &gt;&gt; thanks thanks Abilash I it's only three and a half minutes left I'll quickly come to Anisha again uh you're representing an organization

organization called as she capital so it's you only fund women led startups or it's it's open to And how do we differentiate between a women led startup team or a guy like Travis AP and

fantastic uh &gt;&gt; no we broadly do women led women focused uh so it's a big ecosystem now the consumerbased buying is basically women so it's a broad thing we would look at

his company if it's interesting so we do have a carve out for that uh and I just googled you by the way uh that being said I just want to say something about the ecosystem I think AI is very similar

to where we were with the internet and you know the internet boom um and I've been a founder in the Indian ecosystem since 2004 2009 is when I did my internet company I think there's a lot

of hype I'd like to say one thing I've you know I go to the US often I consult here there everywhere I just if you can start up in India know this and there are a lot of founders here trust me you

can start up anywhere it's like driving if you can drive in India you can drive anywhere in the world and starting up is basically like that. If you can start here and make it through, it's really

about perseverance. If you can do that here, trust me, anywhere in the world after this is a cakewalk. So, don't get discouraged. Stay on your journey. This AI, yes, enhance it with that, but don't

let it get to you and bog you down and be like, "Oh my god, I'm behind the, you know, arc. You're not." &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Wonderful. So, performance selling and you can do, you can start

your own startup because she says she has the money to fund you. Okay. So, we quickly move to Kavi. Kavi talked about risk capital. Kavi I don't think we have dedicated funds which announce that okay

it's a risky fund. Do you think time has come that say okay you can be one of the LPs but it's a risky fund because I'll do a lot of followup follow on rounds and your money can go x to 100x or maybe

zero. &gt;&gt; No funds are here to make money. So it won't come from there. It'll have to come from like the recently announced 10,000 cr second SISF fund that the

government's announced which is amazing. So it'll have to come from in the form of grants. It'll have to come in the form of small checks and angel capital. If you can organize LPS, we are trying

to do this in Hyderabad now. Okay. &gt;&gt; To do like you know small checks together, it'll have to come from angel funds &gt;&gt; for an aggregation of of all these small

uh angel angel. &gt;&gt; It'll have to come from that unfortunately. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you so much. Akil very one thing unique about you here on this

panel is you are a repeat founder. You you've not only built one company but I think two or three successful startup companies. So are you also giving back to the startup ecosystem by by

supporting other young startups? &gt;&gt; Yeah, a lot. Uh so I think I would have invested in around 20 companies. A lot of companies have &gt;&gt; How many companies?

&gt;&gt; 20 companies. &gt;&gt; 20 companies. Wonderful. &gt;&gt; And many of them as you were saying are already 70 80x of what I had made uh investment on and many of them no longer

exist. So I think that's a part and as Kavi was saying this risk capital has to come from angels. It has to come from HNI. It has to come from early ecosystem then only a lot of new companies can

grow up. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thanks Akdan. Last 20 seconds Abilash anything you would like the ecosystem to change to make another Abilash.

&gt;&gt; I'm not that successful yet just starting. Um I think focusing on the problem and delivering value for the customer. I think that is the single most important thing. We focus on that

then everything else follows. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. On time. Thanks Anisha. Thanks Kavisan. Thank Akil and thanks Abilash. So we have learned some new stuff today. Patient capital

performance selling and of course he's giving back 80x returns. Akil is giving 80x returns and Abilash is going Akilan you can actually invest in privacy if any you want you have lots of money.

Okay with this thank you so much. Thanks all of you for coming in joining us and I think we have one small ceremony left and then we close. Okay. Thank you. Thanks everyone. Thank you.
