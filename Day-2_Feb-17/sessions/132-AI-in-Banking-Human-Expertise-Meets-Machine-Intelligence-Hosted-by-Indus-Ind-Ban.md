## 📝 Summary

AI in Banking: Human Expertise Meets Machine Intelligence
As banks accelerate their digital transformation, Artificial Intelligence is reshaping everything from customer engagement and credit underwriting to fraud detection and operational efficiency. Yet, the most impactful outcomes emerge not from automation alone — but from the synergy between human judgment and machine intelligence.
This panel brings together senior leaders from leading banks to explore how AI is being practically deployed across core banking functions, while ensuring trust, transparency, and regulatory compliance. The discussion will spotlight real-world use cases, lessons from implementation, and how human expertise continues to play a critical role in guiding AI-driven decisions.
Key themes include:
•	Augmenting bankers with AI for smarter risk assessment, personalization, and faster decision-making
•	Balancing automation with human oversight in high-stakes financial workflows
•	Responsible AI in banking: governance, ethics, data privacy, and regulatory readiness
•	Building future-ready teams by upskilling talent alongside AI adoption
•	What's next: agentic AI, real-time intelligence, and the evolving role of bankers
The session aims to offer a practical, leadership-level perspective on how banks can harness AI not just as a technology upgrade — but as a strategic partner — delivering secure, inclusive, and intelligent financial services at scale.
