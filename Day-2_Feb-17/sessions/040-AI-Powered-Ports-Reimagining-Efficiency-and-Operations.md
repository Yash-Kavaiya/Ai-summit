## 📝 Transcript

Middle East China. Excellent. &gt;&gt; He's gone as I can. Last

bitm Africa of Africa. I think you start off with your final time being

hello and welcome to all of you uh to this panel on reimagining ports which is like AI powered ports. reimagining efficiency uh of the ports and how these things are

going to change in these times. Uh I know like you know we are standing at a place where we are in between the AI and uh I would say human technology or human imagination.

So uh we are talking about AI but uh we are stuck in this whole jam and the chaos because of the kind of you know things which we are working around. So uh I sincerely thank you all for bearing

with us and particularly uh our panelists who have taken time out and then who have come somehow reached on time and uh people who could not I think it was also not in their own control.

The things are really chaotic at this moment but thank you so much. I must u thank the uh VO Chadam Port Authority to uh convene this session and I am uh with the IGP. I'm director of institute for

governance policies and politics and we work around the tech policy space uh with the port also. So uh that is first thing. Second thing is I must uh welcome the panelists who are here. We have uh

Shri uh TK Ramchandranji, former secretary shipping and uh he has been kind enough to be here much before time and he listened to our previous session also and uh I sincerely thank sir for

kind of you know to come to this event and uh would be contributing his valuable thoughts for this. Uh we have uh uh Shir Subraati GI um who is the adviser with the Adani ports and uh has

been uh in this industry for a long time and has been a mentor to us for uh this session and overall on our policy space. We have uh Miss Aparajit Tarana who is partner with the u it's a ZB uh

partners. She's an advocate working in this space and uh we have Mr. Barish Jaswal who is heading the IT uh for the JMB seat ports. Uh along with them we will be having uh Shri Goraval Sharma uh

who is uh the adviser to the PM economic council and uh Mr. Puroit has just entered in time and uh uh welcome sir. Um &gt;&gt; and you uh you straight away you sir you

straight away have to come to the podium to deliver your welcome remarks and set the context and then we will take it forward from here. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much sir.

Good morning uh one and all. Good morning uh to our distinguished guests, esteemed policy makers, leaders of the maritime industry. It's my proud privilege to welcome you

to this to this vital panel discussion AI powered ports reimagining efficiency and operations organized by our port biochar port authority in collaboration with of course institute for governance

policies and uh politics there is IGP in a world of supply chain disruptions ports are no longer just standalone logistics assets they are central to nation's economic resilience and

industrial competitiveness to realize our honorable prime minister's Sri Narendra Modi's vision for worldclass future ready infrastructure

our maritime sector undergo structural evolution we are modernizing at historic speeds but physical in infrastructure alone is no longer enough

just Last week on February 9th, Biojin Navanar Port convened a pre-event at Tuturin where we brought together track innovators, our port administrators to stress test our digital readiness.

The consensus was clear. The appetite for transformation is strong, but we need decisive national direction. That is why we are here today.

Our mandate is to recognize that artificial intelligence is not simply a software upgrade, a dashboard or a new set of sensors. It is a profound governance and decision-m capability

to guide us through this paradigm shift and to explore how AI can facilitate faster trade, environmental sustainability and workforce adaptation. We are joined

by an extraordinary panel today. Uh uh Dr. Gorab Balab sir is expecting &gt;&gt; yeah Dr. Gorab Balab member economic advisory council to honorable prime minister

Sri Tikk Ramchandraan sir uh our former secretary ministry port shipping and waterways Mr. Subati sir President Business development APSC limited

uh Mr. Mr. Manish uh chief technology officer of Jaki group and madameana partner AZV and partners. Our objective for the next 45 minutes is

to establish a clear national narrative on AI's role in maritime governance ensuring we contribute to forward-looking policy design rather than mere technological compliance.

I extend my deepest gratitude to our imminent speakers for joining us. I will now hand over the floor to our moderator Dr. Manishari uh director IGVP to steer this vital conversation. Thank you and I

look forward to the brilliant brilliant ideas that will emerge today. Thank you very much. Thanks. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much sir. uh because of the uh lastm minute changes in our schedule

and like would say arrivals uh I would like to kind of you know uh that we have around 30 minutes with us minimum which we can extend maybe by 5 minutes at the most probably. So uh I would first uh

want to kind of you know uh just want all the speakers to put in their perspective about two particular things. The topic which we are dealing with how the sufficiency of ports. Oh sorry we

have uh uh professor Goraval Agraal also uh Goraval Sharma GI uh so please so uh the digital readiness

and the uh AI's uh capacities or AI AI's possibilities to make change in trade and how do we conceive keep the changes for the port operations. That is a major question we

are dealing with today. And this question is also important for two reasons. Because the change in this po at this point of time in terms of uh the technology is also as important because

of its human factor involved. So I would like to begin with uh uh sir TK Ram Chandran Gj uh to kind of you know put in his remarks on this subject for maybe in 3 minutes the maybe in the beginning

please sir. [clears throat] So anyway since the time is short just like to say that firstly let me thank VC port for this

opportunity though I think now we have gone down by I think half the time waves are not new to ports right what is a wave to a port so this is a

new wave the AI wave and uh it'll take the wave in its stride. Now for the AI wave to succeed, there has to be something already

existent. You need digital infrastructure, digital public infrastructure and you need data infrastructure and you need a set of

operationally viable software packages already in place. Without all this, you can't have AI built on this.

Now Manish Tari told me that you must talk of what already has happened in this sphere and therefore I will touch upon some of them because in the last few years

a lot of developments have happened in this sphere. Just doing things by on manually on paper is not going to help AI. You need

things to be converted to the digital sphere and unless you do that the next layer is not going to happen. But even there as long as you have silos

software working in their respective silos where there is no data integration where there are no common frameworks common standards there is no interoperability and so on is not going

to be possible to build an AI layer. Therefore, these projects which have already been implemented like many of you might be aware of these projects the enterprise business system

in some half a dozen ports the NLP marine the saga setu the e samudra in the DGS office and most important these are all the software aspects of it but the one

nation one port process is very important most people don't understand that unless the process is common, it is standardized, you cannot have a layer of AI built on top. Now, one nation one

process which was launched last year sometime in March. We like just looked at the documents. You'll be flabbergasted to know that not less than 800 different documents in

each port in different ports. That is a sum total of all the documents. So when we looked at what was redundant, what had to be taken out, then we came to a core of about 200 documents and this one

and then the process different processes, customs, um, health and of course port processes, different processes. Now again when we standardized them, brought them to one

core set of processes, we found that just about uh, you know, about 50 60 processes that we could identify and which could become the core. So this process standardization, document

standardization and building the layer on AI layer on top is how we should be proceeding. Now what are the areas in which we can do AI? Of course the whether it is operations or environment

or planning. Planning is very important. Predictive planning very important like you have just in time systems all this can happen. You can do monitoring and of course safety, compliance, those kind of

things. Now there are a lot of challenges. I'm just rushing through this because there's not much time. There will be a lot of challenges. Now multiple like I said multiple

silos you'll have to integrate all of them. So there there is data fragmentation. You'll need to have repositories data repositories which are common. Then there is vendor lockin. You

have certain vendors doing certain things. you'll have to ensure that each vendor you know maybe we should shift to open source so that vendor lockin is prevented then the uh SOPs the process

like I said the integration of IT with the physical process that is important and standardization of those operations and at present you're just using AI as an advisory kind of uh it has an

advisory kind of role and you need to take it to a much more uh operation ally integrated role so that it can actually take part in decision making delivering decisions as opposed to just giving you

uh data and then accountability where will you fix accountability once AI starts taking decisions and where is the capacity are you looking at HR capacity to deliver all this and finally like I

said shared framework a common integrated framework to deliver all of this so the other portion that we were looking at was smart ports versus thinking ports. Just a few points for

you know uh for takeaways in this smart port that we already have in a lot of uh our in the realm of the major ports at least we are talking of techled development techled operations

but in AI ports thinking port you will have what is called a decision le decision-led operations then you have a focus on automation that has to be shift that has

to shift to judgment Similarly real time everything is now happening real time. So from real time visibility you need need to become anticipatory. You need to look at

predictive visibility. Silo based systems you need to have systemwide across system you know frameworks. Then instead of being reactive you need to become predictive. You need to be able

to plan. And instead of being repetitive a present day operation you get some data from some system it's all repetitive. So from that you need to uh shift to a system which learns. So AI

will not just AI is not just about adding more technology. It is about embedding that technology in decision systems. What will happen? What should we do? What is the right choice? Those

kind of things. Now for instance you might be doing a lot of even birthing happens in ports using AI automation there are uh AGVs uh there are uh drones all that technology is there but putting

it all together ensuring that you are able to put this data together so that you can plan for the future future predict the future analyze the future and give you choice the decision choices

I think that is going to be the challenge and that is going to be the thinking port of the future thank you so &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Thank you so much sir. I think you have

very uh precisely and very beautifully uh carved out the challenges we are facing and also the kind of you know issues we have to tackle in the near future around the uh and what exactly

has been happening. So what has happened uh you have explained very well and I would like to uh request uh Shri Sudati to uh let us know what exactly how these challenges have been I would say uh been

met like uh in this space because he's heading something uh where they have large number of these operations over there please sir thank you [applause] uh thank you man G I I think after Sri

Ram Chandran has spoken that's really not much to add. So thank you that was very inspiring. But before we start a warm good morning to fellow panelist to Goraval GI panelist Ramanji chairman

VOCC and all of us. I think I was just telling Manish G before we proceed we certainly need an algo to set things right in Bharat Mandapam about a punctuality and b the chaotic systems in

which people come in and get out. A small algo would make things very very easy. But then sitting on top of an algo is a sensitive human being you know who has to be more as sir said predictive

reliable and outcome based. Anyway nonetheless in the very in the positive of time the tone has been set by Sri Ram Chandran. Let me tell you a port or the maritime

industry is extremely complex and therefore the recognition and awareness of this is not limited to being a transport or a logistics sector only. when you look at the world's

contribution that nearly 85% of the world's trade moves on maritime you know avenues and the fact that India's trade is nearly 95% by volume and close to about 70% by value by the maritime

industry or the maritime waves you can recognize as to what is the importance while the larger contour has been set where do we bring in a port and its anticedants are a complex systems of

which the overall connecting recognition is either inadequate or is very aminable to introduction to a event like the AI. Let me begin. I have five themes on which I say as to how AI could be

introduced. But when I was coming to that I was wondering when you look at a the IMEC on one side what could it happen when it opens up trade of India to the world and India's aspirations and

one or two events such as what happened on the coast of India very recently we had container vessels which kind of toppled because of various reasons of inadequate storage they also because of

inadequate prediction about the marine in suitability. We've also had events of weather related where unpredictable weather conditions determine as to how a port would operate. But more

importantly, when I was walking in and I was thinking, I looked at the event that happened in Swiss Canal and Evergreen, a vessel, which was, you know, it led to something like a few billion dollars of

losses to the world and a disruption. So look at the sensitivity. Keeping that in mind, I have five themes to speak on. A how could we get AI into design and planning? I have been thinking if you

look at the Indian ports and a coastline of more than 7,500 continues and the aspiration to build apart from the 13 major ports a host of non- major ports and two major ports come and two large

ports coming at Vadwan and Galia Bay. What is it that we would learn from the predictability and design aspect? If you were to do a digital twin in planning and then conceive a port to be operated

thereafter, much of the difficulties in planning a port in terms of precision about birthing, planning, operations behind could be there. So the first introduction is towards design and

planning as a blueprint where you could do today much of it is softwaredriven but we haven't had a AI component to it to bring the predictability which Ramchand spoke about into the design and

planning and also when I say design and planning is not restricted to merely birth planning. It's about a modular scalability. It's about traffic flow alignments. It's about a strategic

deployment of how we run the resources over there. The second aspect that I would look at is the operational impact. When I look at an operational impact, we talked about just in time dynamic yard

logics. you know the way that we going to coordinate a vessel you it's arrival we have you for example Musk has developed something called captain Peter where you have an autonomous captain

getting in into a port making judgments which otherwise would be subject to human error now what is AI basically doing it's crunching a lot of data and bringing that data and predicting as to

how we could have more predictable safer parts of navigation Once we have birthed a vessel and then the traffic flow behind about throughput maximization, resource allocations between a vessel,

between the trains, between the ITV movement, between manpower, between yards and between warehouses. Now this looks very very complex but you'll be surprised as the integration of it does

not have even a proper software tool. We have at best some kind of software for a particular terminal. When you're going a multi- terminal and a whole port integration, you need a layer. The layer

which Ramchand spoke about a layer which is first the on that particular layer you build is to what is the tool of integration and algorithmic algometic governance tool which will then be able

to use the data and be future ready which was spoken of. My third part is about safety enhancement and risk management. You would be shocked and surprised to see the kind of

um you know safety events that take place in the ports and how quite a bit of unsafe working due to lack of predictive and unawareness of the risk. So risk assessments and building the

risk assessment into planning of the port is something which is very very aminable to a AI and to develop proper algorithms around it and the human machine and vessel interaction is

something again I'm sure we have you know Manish Tari who's with Jim Baky and I've had you know we've been in some forums together he will tell you as to how as the CTO he's driving these you

know combinations at individual ports to happen. Of course, it will also mean about each data we are having and how we are going to have sovereign data protections when we're also developing

risk managements in our things. My fourth aspect is about quality assurance and improvements. Now, as much as quality assurance and customer interfacing, we've been thinking of

developing what is called a virtual concurge where we have every part of coming in. You know, we were talking about documentation. A virtual conscience brings in all interactions on

a platform which are not human based and this is not about replacing human beings but having a particular tool where we bring in the multiplicities of interactions vessels agents transporters

multiple stakeholders that we have. I think this is one of the sectors which is very very very aminable for a composite development and bringing. I will pause over here and I will talk

about my last aspect about customer interfacing but I would leave thoughts on that and into certain global experiences we have that we borrow we have global experience the port of

Rotterdam where we use AI for reducing ship waiting times are nearly 20%. Port of Singapore in our recent in enclosed thing maritime single window which we wish to develop in the Adani ports that

we're looking at which will mean that we have vessel calls which are determined by a certain algorithm and not individually taken decisions. I did talk about the Swiss Canal event you know

where about more than 430 vessels were affected. If you could have a little bit of you know as as you know when Ramchandasar began he said waves and when you look at the waves of innovation

and in that has come to the world the first wave coming at 1845 and the sixth wave that we're experiencing with postcoid this wave of innovation which is embracing the world today is telling

us as to how unpredictable events could now be predicted you know so when I when I look at the Swiss canal event which I keep coming back to 430 vessels got affected Because the

judgment on how it's a regulated canal. The judgment on how some aspects of wave can affect safety is something which AI would tremendously help. So when you're looking at safe navigation, safe

birthing, safe operation of ports. AI is a tool that we have to adopt but it does require this particular digital integration that has been spoken. I'll pause here because of positive time and

other events. I'll wait for other speakers. If there questions we take it. Thank you so much. [applause] &gt;&gt; I request Manish Jaspal GI from GMBBI port to come in and uh he wants to speak

about the compliances around this whole area. &gt;&gt; Good morning everyone. Uh &gt;&gt; thank you Subra G. Uh you have covered most of the points which I was going to

talk about. So we we can save some time here. Uh uh but uh when I was being invited for this event, Tari G spoke to me and he said, "Manish, you are a chief technology officer. You already know

about this technology." Uh Tiwari G, I am as new as everyone else because this is a wave which it has hit the technology professionals also. So AI as such is a wave which has hit all of us.

Most of us have been exposed to AI through very small tools like chat GPT. Everyone would have used chat GPT and Gemini and such tools. Our exposure direct exposure to AI has been through

tools like Chat GPT which is generative AI. But unknowingly to us, people like the Amazons of this world, Netflixes of this world have been using AI algorithms for many years and we have not realized

that they have been using AI algorithms now. Ports have been adopting AI in a lot of automation areas but there are a whole lot of areas where there is scope for uh using AI.

The word port is derived from the Latin word pus which means gateway. The port is a gateway to commerce and anything which goes wrong in a port will get affected

directly or indirectly if it is not done correctly and that's where AI comes in right from planning stages which Mr. Subraat briefly touched upon. How do I plan arrival of vessels? How do I I plan

arrival of containers, trucks, cargo? How do I store it? That's one aspect of AI where optimizing the resources which are available can help. The second aspect is behavioral safety. The ESG

aspect, most ports are having a lot of human beings, a lot of manpower which is working and human beings inherently do unsafe behaviors. If we are able to use AI and JMBI is using AI using video

analytics is able to predict what are the likely areas where safety related incidents may happen. So that's the second area. The third area is fraud detection.

A lot of port paperwork happens through documents. A lot of documentation is there. AI has a very small but very impactful implementation which is for using for

detecting frauds. Now most of the times we don't realize that there are maker checker combinations. There are frauds which are possible. AI can help detect frauds. It can also help detect sources

of cargo from either restricted countries or movement of such cargo or payments from such sources. So AI has a role in fraud detections in helping us identify compliances whether it is

internal compliances or external compliances. The fourth aspect as more automation happens in the industry cranes get automized uh AGVs get automized please remember that there is

a risk of cyber hackers getting into automation and be preventing that automation to get through. So that's the fourth aspect where AI can create a layer over the

existing cyber security infrastructure and help fix or prevent cyber incidents from happening. Now most of us have been talking about predictive AI which to a large extent is successful. My final

point is that going forward predictive AI will turn into prescriptive AI where AI will also prescribe what is the solution. It will not just tell what is going to happen but should also be able

to prescribe what is the solution to fix what is going to happen. So that's the stage we are going to enter into over the next 2 years. That's my submission. I've been told that 3 minutes have run

out. Thank you everyone is to I would say comply with the timeline. Thank you so much. uh Aparita can I ask you to please come and I you know shed some light about the the legal

aspect of whatever is happening and how we get into it please. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. I think uh I'm I'm thankful that Manishi made the point regarding um moving from predictive to

actually taking deterministic decisions when it comes to AI deployment. So we all know that uh I mean there were a lot of facts shared by my other co-panelists about how uh how I guess how material

port infrastructure and maritime development activities are in India. Given the fact that 95% of our trade is taken place through the maritime corridor. It's it's it's not a surprise

that you know the government has notified this as a core infrastructure medium for India. Now naturally any kind of industry that's notified as a core infrastructure technology it becomes

very important if there is discussion in the industry from making it move from assisted and predictive AI to something which is more autonomous in nature. So I know that there is a lot of interest in

making port infrastructure, port industry becoming more deterministic and actually taking decisions that perhaps human beings would have taken in the past. But given its importance and given

its critical uh you know I think presence in the Indian market as well as globally and the multiple entities that are usually involved in any kind of port infrastructure project there are

multiple challenges that come up in the Indian domain. So for instance currently you would take a decision about let's say you know logging certain um you know decision making regarding some birthing

and things like that you would take a decision with a human being. Now everybody in the AI industry the viewpoint always has been that any kind of work your AI is actually as good as

your data. So we can assume that given the number of years for which the AI industry so sorry the port industry has been in existence there is naturally a lot of data that is available today

based on which AI can train itself. Now whether that data is actually consolidated in a reliable manner. Do you actually have data which is available with the port operator which

is available with the OEMs who are working with them which is available with the technology deployers. Is all of this really aggregated in a consistent and a reliable manner? Because if it is

not if you're using autonomous AI technology to take decisions based on that data then obviously the reliability becomes a big question mark. In addition to that, let's say you start deploying

AI for taking decisions that ordinarily earlier were taken by human beings. Now the issue obviously becomes about attribution and liability because in usually in a port any kind of porting

transaction you have multiple agencies that are involved. Now today if I'm a port operator and I deploy an AI model I deploy let's say an open source model but I don't know from my technology

vendor as to what are the limitations of that model. I don't know what kind of hallucination that model does. I also am not being informed about any kind of governance mechanism that I have to

implement when I'm deploying this model onto my industry. Now naturally if you don't have a good lawyer supporting you in those kind of contracts the technology vendor will make sure that

they have lot of exclusions and you know indemnities and protections etc wherein they are very much protected in case there is a liability issue and of course in this kind of industry just like any

other which is critical the liability will be economic it could be reputational it could be life and it could be something even you know cross country and diplomatic and and and those

kind of risk exposures. Now for a port authority which is a port operator which is implementing AI in an autonomous manner the main concern for them needs to be that how much am I protected visav

the technology vendors that I'm working with because if you don't have awareness of the the risk of that AI tech if you don't have a system wherein how is the AI being deployed there is no audit

mechanism that is taking place you don't have an ability to understand that how do I explain that this defect actually took place because currently when human beings take decisions there is a lot of

collaboration and there is a lot of dynamism ISM when you take decisions like that especially when it's very high range and it's very complex and sensitive in nature but AI is usually

trained on situations that it has actually seen in practice with human beings like us have seen in practice and they take the best course of action in that particular situation. So obviously

if you're dealing with an industry where there are a lot of unanticipated scenarios you can imagine that AI could take decision which somehow don't even actually make sense and they don't have

an explanability allocated to it. And in India given that we don't have an Indian AI law we don't have a lot of clarity wherein if there is any sort of liability any kind of incident that

occurs how do you actually attribute liability in that kind of situation and of course if you're not protected contractually then most of the liability will fall on the port operator but yes

for litigants for an entity that's actually suing a port operator for somebody like me perhaps who may be impacted you know as a result of some uh you know environmental disaster for

example because a port operator activities the issue will be that how will you actually establish causation and that I think is an issue under Indian law till the time we don't have

an AI law in place because in any litigation scenario unless and until I can allocate that you are responsible and this is the actual incident that led to this disaster you can't act you you

face a lot of challenge in allocating any kind of liability so I think going forward what we need really need to promote in the industry is having some sort of AI governance mechanism because

this is not one of those sectors where it's a good to have you actually need to have some governance standards about how is it that you're going to deploy AI to what extent to what kind of

functionalities for which you'll make AI autonomous and what should be the auditing standard what should be the explanability standard what kind of testing are you going to do and what

kind of data sharing that's going to occur between the various entities that are involved and after that once we have a reasonably robust governance mechanism we would need to worry about uh I mean

there would be litigation in this place because as in more autonomous you know decisions are being taken in the sector you will see I guess the risk of doing that because I mean everybody says that

whenever you start deploying AI in any sector one needs to see that what for that particular sector whether the harm outweighs the gains or vice versa because I mean I personally as a lawyer

believe that it's not possible to deply deploy AI onto every industry it's a very unique and nuanced decision and it has to be done depending on how relevant or useful it is for that industry

Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; I've been told I've run out of time. &gt;&gt; Uh [applause] uh I now request uh Gorov G to please uh come and let us know that you know we have talked about technology

and its like operations but the major thing is economy and I would request sir to kind of you know focus on that please. Thank [applause] you. Respected speakers, ladies and

gentlemen, already the watch is showing time is out and I am the last person but will not take more than 4 minutes. That is my promise to all of you.

AI powered ports. I understand that as a atma Nirvar India powered for Vikid bharat 2047 and how it is going to work. I will give you few eight

points and each point I will take 30 seconds. That is the agenda for my speech. 95% of total volumes which we are trading is by maritime.

But the fact is that that in spite of annual growth of 7 13.5% our ports are not comparable to the biggest ports of the world as far as the

handling capacity is concerned. So gap is both of infrastructure as well as intelligence and here I will talk about eight AIs which we have to work on. The first AI

is about the available infrastructure. Major ports in our country handles 855 million tons in FY25 that is financial year 25 but still average capacity utilization is around 50%. So available

infrastructure is there. Another second AI is assessment index. The dwelling time or vessel turnover turnaround time or crane productivity are not matched with the best of the

class in the industry like uh the dwelling time is 2.5 times on an average. Vessel turnound turnaround time is twice. the crane productivity is half. So we have to work on this

assessment index. The third AI is actual impediment. When I say actual impediment, the much more is said about this about the documentation and process delay. The

madam had reflected on this. the dwelling time crisis, the infrastructure constraints, the equipment and automation gaps and the digital or data silos which was reflected by Mr.

Ramchandran and my friend. So there is a actual impediment is there as far as this industry is concerned that is third AI. The fourth AI is authentic integration and much more is

conveyed like predictive maintenance, intelligent birthuling, automated container handling, optimal character recognition and digital twins. So a realtime virtual replica of port

operations are required. The fifth AI is automated initiatives which we took in the form of port community service unified logistic saga setu achieving maritime vision.

The sixth AI is actual investment. We had in the form of Sagar Mala national logistic policy like the logistic uh index ranking. We are aiming to be in top 25 nations by 2030 and the PPP

investments which are happening in the major ports. The seventh AI is avenues in India that is in the form of new port which is which is in the form of Vijam port, Vadwan port, greater Nicobar

international container trans shshipment port. The last AI about the accelerated initiatives and I will say there are three immediate moderate and long-term immediate we have to scale up the

automated gates truck maintenance system and predictive maintenance pilots medium-terms digital twins AIdriven birth au fleet expense and the long-term fully automated terminals national port

digital twins auto auton autonomous vessel support and the use of hydrogen uh uh as a as a fuel. Now I will conclude that the question is not whether AI will

transform India's port. Question is that whether we are going to lead it or not with the current 7.97% of GDP that is the logistic cost we are competitive but for Vix Bharat 2047 a.m.
