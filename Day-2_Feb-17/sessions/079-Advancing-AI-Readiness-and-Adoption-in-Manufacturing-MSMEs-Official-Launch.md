## 📝 Transcript

We're very very excited to have you here with us today because today we'll talk about manufacturing. We have the honor of having some of the most senior leaders in government joining us today

to launch a study. I'd like to kick us off with Mr. Krishnan Secretary Matey. uh who's really sort of been behind shaping this vision for the study that we will launch today. Sir, over to you

to do a keynote and kick us off. &gt;&gt; Thank you. And that is quick and businesslike. I know all of you have No, this is fine. Uh all of you have exactly 55 minutes to do the session including

the changeovers. Uh my colleagues uh the secretary of uh MSME Shrid Das um Mr. Mr. Rohit Kil, addition secretary in textiles and Mr. Bhnesh Kumar who's the CEO of the National Institute of uh

smart governance. Um this one of the things that we are very keen on doing as part of the India AI mission is to ensure that AI truly has meaning in the real sectors of the economy. What is it

that AI can do in the real sector in terms of enhancing productivity, enhancing efficiency, enhancing capabilities and skills? This is important because you know you can have

uh you can have the best models, you can have all the compute you want, you can have all the data you want, but if it doesn't convert into something that is truly meaningful for the people, then

you don't see the kind of growth that we expect to see. And which is why one of the areas which we wanted to focus on specifically was manufacturing. And within manufacturing what typically

happens is large enterprises have ways in which they can finance this transition and make sure that uh they see the value in it. They are able to make the necessary investments and stay

the course to make sure that they see uh outcomes which they require. Whereas smaller enterprises and enterprises in traditional sectors like uh textiles and uh other areas may or may not

necessarily uh be in a position to make the kind of investments which are needed to support this. uh so we wanted to actually launch a detailed study and this morning I was

at another session with JPAL in terms of you know how do we do impact so with as as part of this saying rather than just throw good money after bad do a proper study figure out how uh the most

impactful way of um of actually putting AI into manufacturing should really work particularly for MSMES get that study done and move forward so I'm very happy that NI ISG is partnering with Athena

Infomics and with the concerned ministries um and the ministries of course include MSME which will cover a broad range textiles, pharmaceuticals because they are looking at uh pharma

related manufacturing and of course electronics which incidentally looks like it could become one of the largest manufacturing sectors uh within within this entire space. So uh in these

sectors what is it that AI can do to actually impact manufacturing is the theme of what we are attempting to do through this study and uh I I for one personally am really looking forward to

the outcomes of what this brings out and practical real life use cases of where we can deploy. So I would be one of the most eager uh audiences to this study and uh I can assure you Deepa you will

get chied to see that it comes out in time and uh not that you've not been chied already but uh some more will be on the way to make sure that this happens. Thank you very much and once

again uh thank you all for turning out in such large numbers for the India AI impact summit. Um, thank you for putting up with some of the inconveniences but being such an enthusiastic and engaged

audience in all the events and part of everything that has gone on and I invite you all to also go and visit the expo. Some wonderful use cases there and applications there. Please do spend some

time. You'll need at least a couple of hours to at least walk through all the important stalls if not every stall. Thank you. &gt;&gt; So I request you to now formally launch

the study. Thank you so much. We'll all there's a copy of the study design that's available on your table that we rolled up. We also have extra copies for everybody in the room. So, feel free to

pick one up. So like like the secretary sir outlined this is an important a really important area for us to deliver impact and driving adoption in this space is really

crucial. Uh national institute of smart governance sort of is the nodal agency that's been commissioned. So I we have the privilege of having the CEO of NISG Mr. Bhnesh Kumar here with us who I will

invite to deliver a special address on this. Thank sir please. &gt;&gt; Thank you Deepa. Respected secretary Shiriel Dhaji, my friend and bachmate Shir Roy Kil,

additional secretary textiles Deepipa, my colleagues from NISG and all the dignitaries who are present for this session of AI for MSMES. I think I'd like to start uh with thanking the India

AI mission uh in the way they have designed this program right from the beginning and the way this AI impact uh summit is being democratized and being open to people from all walks of life

and they have tried to cover as many areas as possible. uh of course with the seven pillar uh structure of the India AI mission and apart from that going into each vertical at the micro level

and trying to understand and bring impact through AI. I think that's a marvelous way and for the MSMES they have engaged the India AI mission has engaged the national institute of smart

government in partnership with ethna in economics to understand how AI is going to impact MSMES and what is their readiness for adoption of MSMES. See, we all know that India is is is in already

in a decisive phase and it's it's an economic journey which is happening and we are going up the ladder in terms of the largest economies and we are supposed to be the third largest economy

soon to be there and artificial intelligence is going to make a very very important impact in the whole journey. But looking at the size of this country, it is not going to be driven

only by the large industries only because finally the workforce and the actual production which happens is the millions of small industries and those are the micro small and medium

industries where this impact is going to make a potential difference and that's why it's important to understand how much is their readiness, what are they going to adopt, are there solutions

available And can they afford that cost or do we need to bring those solution within the affordability of the MSMES and make them viable for them and make them the early adopters and which are

the industries which can be the early adopters where the clusters are located and I think uh we are working on three different fields in the textiles, pharmaceuticals and electronics and

looking at the cluster approach and going back to them and doing this study. and the inception report has which has been launched. I think there are sufficient copies uh we can share these

copies with you also. So maybe you can have a look at this and give us a feedback and tell us what more we can do in this side. U as secretary also mentioned I think it's extremely

important that we complete this study as early as possible and maybe uh then at the same time uh have have a kind of book of services or maybe a a shelf shelf of AI based solutions and then

offer these solution to the MSME and say that okay yes there is a shelf and now you can go and pick these kind of solutions which may be applicable to you these are these are the ERPs these are

the CRM these are those kind of other solutions which may be relevant to you. This may be in production. This may be in the in the other sectors and then you can perhaps pick out those generic

solutions and customize according to your needs and implement them quickly and maybe uh at some point of time government may also say that perhaps we we will bear some of the part of the

cost also and you don't have to bear every everything because we really don't want you to become uncompetitive. We we we really want the MSMES to remain competitive and offer the best of the

solutions to the market at an affordable price for the consumers and that's that's the most important part and these are the three sectors where India is doing very well both in electronics

manufacturing the growth rate has been I think 35% year on year last 2 three years and it's growing electronics manufacturing same is with the pharmaceuticals and the textiles textile

has been the traditional stronghold of India and uh if we don't adopt the AI as of now then perhaps it it may be possible that we lag behind and that's why to remain competitive and remain

market ready uh it it's essential that we bring solutions and this is an opportunity not only for the MSMES I I think it's an opportunity for large number of startups and AI solution

providers also they also need to look at and tell us what are the kind of solutions they can offer and what kind of prices at at which they can offer and how how those prices can be competitive

for the MSMES to adopt those solutions and and the early adopters can then motivate the others and the next set of people set set of industries follow it. So uh it's it's a great thought process

altogether and without taking too much of time because we we have uh a limitation of time we've been allotted only 55 minutes and that's why we we cleared up the first part in first 10

minutes itself. So I am not going to talk about too many general things. I think we'll go specifically into the study. I'll request Deepipa to make a presentation on that and of course then

we are going to hear uh our dignitaries on the dis and their views on this and maybe uh towards the end if you have a few questions we'll be happy to answer those. Thank you very much for joining

us uh and have a nice day. Thank you. [applause] &gt;&gt; Thank you very much sir. And one of the reasons we wanted to do this here is because we want to take the industry

along with us from the get-go. And we want to take the AI service providers along with the along along with us from the get-go, right? Because here on the dis you have some of the most senior

policy makers who are actively thinking about this issue and are here to demonstrate their commitment to wanting to make a difference. Alongside that, we wanted to make sure that this commitment

is visible to the industry and we're able to work with the industry very closely because that's the spirit with which we are launching this effort. I'd like to start with this statement right

which is the next productivity leap will be won by MSMAS that adopt AI. There is no questions about it. It's already here. We need to get it right. And through through various discussions and

sessions starting yesterday morning, I've heard Secretary Mr. As Krishnan, I've heard other senior dignitaries and thought leaders talk about how it's it's just logic, right? We will adopt

technology if it's accessible and it makes sense to us. We see that it adds value. It's a very simple thing. And that's really what the focus of this effort really is, right? But there is

something bigger which is India today truly is emerging as the use case capital of the world because we're showing to countries everywhere that you can not just advance adoption but you

can do it at scale through frugal innovation. So I think there is a story here that is not just domestic but it's about what is it that we're telling the world about how you can think about

making artificial intelligence available to every organization and make it truly inclusive. So within that framing where do we see this sort of study that's being

commissioned by the India AI mission fit under Matei right we alongside NIST see this as an opportunity to fill a market intelligence gap right because on the demand side which is really on the side

of the industry we see that these are the most common questions that have come up in our early consultations right like what's the value really how much do I have to spend and what is the value from

spending on it. There are so many technology service providers selling AI LLM agents to me already. How do I evaluate between those? How do I make a choice? How do I make an informed

choice? And there are very serious questions about data and digital readiness. Right? So there are these information gaps on the demand side. And on the supply side, we see similar

challenges because talking to technology service providers and AI service providers, one of the most consistent things is it is so difficult to acquire MSME customers. It's expensive. It's

expensive to acquire the customers. It's expensive to retain the customers. So there is a huge role here. I would say if we do demand aggregation meaningfully, a lot of technology supply

service providers on the supply side can meaningfully access. So it's not that the ecosystem isn't already here. I think a lot of the ingredients to that ecosystem exist. What we need or what's

missing is a clear segmentation and understanding of that market, bridging that market intelligence gap and thinking about what are some repeatable pathways that can scale across MSMES and

really that's what this study is intended to do. So how are we going to do it? Like Mr. So Bhnesh Kumar just just described we have textiles, electronics, pharma and medtech as the

three focus sectors that we will kickstart with because we want to start somewhere and then take it to more sectors within MSME and we'll first start by learning right

we want to we're going to do over 350 factory immersions across these sectors. So we're actually going to visit the factories, spend time in these factories, spend time with the leaders,

but also the staff and other members of that factory context and also talk to a lot of technology service providers, right? On the supply side and really learn. So that's what we call the

discovery phase. We want to be smart about this. We want it to be iterative and rapid and we want to as we're learning on the demand side, we also want to quickly validate and hear from

the supply side. And then we want to start designing and I'll talk about the design element in the next slide in a minute. But we really wanted that thing how do I go

from you know and I I you know this is a question that one of the you know as we were designing this a secretary asked me he said what can you do that a chat GPT won't already tell me right and I said

sir there is a lot right that we cannot get out of a chat GPT today in terms of details of how something will really work and I think that's where the design element comes and then finally it's how

do we then make sure that what we're learning doesn't stay in a small room or with a small group of people, but is made really available and diffused in meaningful ways and in practical ways to

industries, to service providers, to policy makers along the way. This is sort of the blueprint that we're going to use, right? The first thing we want to do is to get our archetypes right.

What are the high [snorts] priority, high ROI use cases? How can you build archetypes where you define the people, process, data, operational requirements, right? Because you cannot talk about AI

without talking about the instrumentation and the compute and the elements that you need to get right to unlock the power of AI. We're then going to really, and you know, this is another

anecdote as we were preparing this that I I'm very fond of and I go back to because one of the one of the joint secretaries in my in in my conversation with them, he said, "Every theme is

unique. You cannot use a single brush and just assume you can kind of have a single templatizable approach that will work across a lot ofmemes and I think there is something really powerful about

that that I think we want to incorporate. So how do we think about scaling pathways? How do we think about both entry thresholds? Maybe in some cases the advisory is don't do AI yet.

Don't don't embrace it. Maybe you're not ready. Maybe the risks are too high. Right? So we want to be able to provide that sort of due diligence and guidance and then allow for industries to know

how do you know something's working right the the closest example in the in the knowledge services for us is where is copilot all lines has worked has it unlocked value for your company how do

you know something is working and it's unlocking value so how can we make available to the industry that guidance along with the industry because it's a lot of this you know already

right we're in some instances just going to be capturing that knowledge and making it available. And this piece is the most crucial and it's a piece of guidance that we've received from the

get-go from uh Mr. S. Krishnan, Secretary Matey, which is I want you to tell me where policy is lacking. Where is it that we already have good policies to be responsive to these challenges and

needs and where do we need new policies and new guidance that then you know the leaders here and the policy makers who you see here on the dis can actively think about and engage with and how do

we think about questions of procurement and financing in a very practical way. So the vision for this which I know is ambitious but we're really going to do our very best to get all to get to all

of these elements uh over the course of this study that's being launched today very quickly as a snapshot what can you expect right so if you're in industry you're here in the room you're an MSME

and you're thinking about how you could go on this journey of artificial intelligence we want to first start by sharing what are validated use cases that we think will work on the

What are some clear practical ro lowrisk adoption pathways that will work? How can you procure these services? Do you want to just do equipment as a service with an integrated AI model because

that's just life in terms of life cycle costing cheaper or do you have to unbundle and think about these services differently? How do you actually procure the support that you need and what is

the visibility you have in terms of the impact that it creates in terms of market and productivity? And finally, making sure we make a service almost sort of like a an intermediary that

facilitates that matchmaking between supply and demand. So providing access to AI service providers that can come in and talk about what their models and tools are right right from the beginning

to policy makers. We I think one of the things that's come through very clearly is just an appetite and a curiosity to learn. Right. I think it's come through very clearly in all of my meetings where

they've said we also want to learn. We want to hear from the ground what is and isn't working, what's already being done, where the opportunities are, and the evidence to back this up with very

targeted guidance on finance, procurement, and regulatory aspects and safety aspects that can guide policy thinking, including the ingredients that will be necessary to build the

ecosystem. And finally, this piece is very important and the secretary touched on it even in his keynote, which is how do you know it's working? How do we track impact? So we don't keep throwing

good money behind I mean behind things that aren't necessarily working. Finally, if you are a technology service provider, right? If you are a service provider today uh that's providing

technology services to manufacturing entities, we're really excited to engage with you, learn from you, but also to share back with you what are some of these deployment ready use cases. What

are some clear operational and technical requirements that you will need to start thinking about as you're engaging with industry from a techn technology service provision standpoint? What are some of

the priority clusters that you can engage with where the appetite is already very high? It's not latent demand sort of more active demand and how can you engage with MSMES but policy

makers but also align with national priorities and scaling opportunities. So this is really the ambition of this exercise. We're so excited to have you all in the room with us. And with this,

I have the honor of inviting Shri Asel Das, Secretary Ministry of MSME. Sir, we're so honored to also have you here with us to invite a special address. &gt;&gt; Thank you Deep G. And good afternoon, a

very good afternoon to all colleagues and friends here. And thanks a lot for making me part of this very exciting event. Now Deepa used a very apt epithet India as the use case capital of the

world in AI economy. Now it's it's a really apt you know as just I was entering the Bhat Mandapam you know I was really struck you know energized by the lot of energy lot of the talent pool

in this in this you know compact premises and and really I felt that this is a very apt and not only metaphor but an actual thing. So India should be is a use case capital and you see so much of

talent pool and uh rich talent pool we have it's really inspiring. So great to be here. So now why am I here? This is basically to really reinforce the conviction that we all share in the

government that it is the industry which is going to drive this AI transformation of AI transformation or AI power transformation of Indian economy. It's one of the great force multipliers. EI

is a great force multipliers and that's how India proposes to use it for its various national macro goals towards atar bharat or wikid bharat in the longer term. So it is essentially to

restate or kind of underscore this point that me and some of my colleagues from the government are here. It is to be essentially an industry-led venture. At the same time there are in the Indian

context we are at a currently at an inflection point aiming for a high trajectory economy and also reaping the dividends of a kind of a demographic dividend of

this rich and the biggest talent pool in the world. It does require several support systems which require public support and public investment.

So essentially it's a partnership. It's a partnership which is where primarily the solutions would come from the industry. At the same time, government would have to do its bit in terms of

tweaking the policy design, in terms of providing resources where private sector resources would not automatically come and providing public goods, creating public goods and other you know public

securities like data security, ownership of data, transparency, those those values which go into a high level economy and high level ecosystem. So the reason why it's both promising

and challenging is we are trying to take and I must first of all uh compliment Deepipa and of course the India AI mission congratulate them for this very wonderful initiative. It's a very very

real in the sense we are going to take AI to the shop floor. It's a confluence of AI at the shop floor. And the challenging part while it's a great promise and the promising part is that

today as we speak we have digitally registered seven 76 million micro small and medium enterprises in the country. We can see the digital footprint 76 million and

it's ever growing. By the by March we hope to cross 80 million. So this is the large constituency and about more than a fifth of them are already in manufacturing. In fact many

of the MSMES who actually classify themselves as services actually do have an element of manufacturing somewhere or the other upstream or downstream. So it's a huge constituency. It's a huge

opportunity for our industry to really uptake and India as you are all aware is very very geared towards really on the manufacturing the national manufacturing

mission the other all the other line ministries such as textile pharma medtech all of them are DPIT they're all geared to really push manufacturing in a big way however the gains of such

initiatives can happen only if they are also parallelly AI enabled in terms of higher productivity in terms of various linkages in terms of improving comp competitiveness and quality

so how does why do we bring in MSME here we bring in MSME for a very very fundamental reason and all of you are aware of that it's a it's a kind of a aumatic but let me restate it

the MSMES may contribute ute hugely to the economy to export to employment very very important for India employment I would underscore that twice empowerment of women of the weaker sections and

environmental sustainability all the five E which are fundamental to our you know national growth and aspirations are very much really arise in a very fundamental way from the MSMES so

without a very strong dynamic and contemporary and forward-looking progressive MSME sector, we would be seriously handicapped in really uh reaching our national aspirations and

goal. So that being so at the same time as I said earlier, the transformation has to be industry-ledd. There's no other way. It has to be supported by academy on the one hand and by the

government on the other. So where we come in is to these two three things. Number one that I would like on behalf of my colleagues here and elsewhere in the government, I would like to really

reiterate that government stands fully committed to really making this MSME ecosystem vibrant, competitive, quality oriented and very very a productive sector which is which is which can

really drive be the force multiplier for the bigger industries and the other other sectors of the economy to really flourish and grow. Number one. Number two, government is extremely committed

to really bringing all those other policy instruments should they be required today or tomorrow in terms of enhancing ease of doing business in terms of uh uh improving the processes

in terms of having minimum government and maximum of governance in terms of letting the industry you know innovate and move forward. Number three, government is equally committed to pull

in its resources and the the uh set of people here do represent that kind of a convergence across sectors to really support programs where they require because MSMES there are a few challenges

in terms of reaching out to them making them aware giving them the confidence that they would have the user ownership over whatever uh changes we seek to bring and first and foremost that

eventually it is their employee which will gain in terms of productivity their employability will go up and their business viability will get enhanced. It is very very important to drive home

this kind of a confidence in the MSM ecosystem. Luckily in our country uh we have the sectorally well aggregated MSM demand aggregation which Deepa spoke of is very very important. However, the we

have a a very good positive feature that we have all these all sectors are mapped in terms of the sectoral profiles in terms of the geographical concentrations. So there is in a way a

logical aggregation already existing on the ground. So a study like this I think would open the gateways of many more such study uh backed evidencebacked interventions where we can actually

benefit the MSMES and I think it's a great opportunity and I would really call upon uh our very very talented young friends our talented pool to come forward look at these micro situations

and see how it aggregates into solutions which the industry can provide and where government can play the role of enablers in terms of reaching out to MSMES giving the confidence that this is eventually

to improve their business viability eventually to improve the productivity of their employees and to strengthen the sustainability of their operations. We are there to give that kind of a support

and confidence and I would urge my uh this uh industry leaders, our young talent pool particularly to really come forward and focus on the MSMES because these will be the drivers and these will

be drivers of growth and innovation for future and these will be the really the ecosystem which will actually absorb the maximum employment quality employment for India of the future. Thank you very

much and have a wonderful day. Thank you, sir. I've I've had the privilege of experiencing the passion and the clarity with which the secretary just described the the vision that the

government's bringing to this firsthand over the last couple of months. So, sir, we're really thrilled to be working with you. Next up, I have the honor of inviting

Mr. Rohit Kul who is additional secretary ministry of textiles and the first thing that occurred to me and I just shared it with sir as we were standing outside and chatting this is

perhaps the only discussion on textiles on AI that I've seen in the entire summit because I was counting for who else is talking about textiles and artificial intelligence and as far as my

knowledge goes and I'd like to be corrected if I'm wrong I think this is probably the only one that uh highlights or spotlights textile sir with that we'd love uh we'd love the honor of you

coming in and sharing your perspectives with us. Thank you Deepippa. Uh Secretary MSME Shri Das

my friend and batchmate Shri Bhnesh Kumar Mr. Dr. Aman Sharma, Joint Secretary Pharmaceuticals. Ladies and gentlemen,

let me begin with a provocative statement. India's AI dividend will eventually be earned on the factory floor. As I walked

to this conference, I was struck by two things. One, I saw billboards which refer to AI as AI equals all And then as my senior colleague and

secretary MSME pointed out, looking at the energy in the mandapum and the vibrance one could feel about I was reminded of what Alfred Marshall the famous economist said. It's in the air.

AI is in the air. But as we navigate this AI which is in the air and as we talk about breakthrough developments on one hand and a more inclusive and democrative AI

on the other. The question that we need to ask ourselves, what is it in AI that will move the needle particularly for a country as you rightly remarked the use case capital

which is India and the clear answer is that India's long-term economic shift cannot solely be determined by digital native businesses. It will eventually be

decided by whether AI can modernize legacy industries like textiles, food processing, leather, auto components, sectors where there is a legacy, whether is depth of capacity but also where

production processes are uneven, partly digitized or manually monitored. India's manufacturing base is dominated by MSMES who employ millions support small

industrial networks and drive exports. And yet many of them operate with uneven monitoring, with informal workflows, thin margins, often competing on lower labor expenses and homegrown adaptations

to cut costs, sometimes what we locally call jugard. Productivity improvement in these sectors will matter far more for national income

than incremental gains in already digitized sectors. And mind you, I am not talking about replacing labor at scale. I think the opportunity here is different. Embedding

intelligence into existing systems to reduce defects, limit waste, lower energy consumptions, strengthen audit preparedness. And let me talk about a sector that I am

most familiar with. textiles contributing to 2 and a half% of the national GDP 10% of merchandise exports the second largest employer in the entire ecosystem

a domestic ecosystem worth around $140 billion an exports ecosystem worth $40 billion employing 4 and a half cr people 45 million people directly.

How can we move the needle in a sector that is so critical as exports and how can we blend productivity, sustainability

and bring them together in a manner that improves not just productivity but global competitiveness. AI enabled quality inspection can detect weaving or dying defects in

real time. Predictive maintenance tools can reduce machine down times. And I could go on and on, but I really don't want to presuppose

your study. I think this is what your study is supposed to tell us at the end of this study. you're making our job easier [laughter] &gt;&gt; or more difficult.

But what I do want to say that each gain at the unit level may appear small and incremental but across thousands of MSMES the cumulative impact on quality operating margins and export reliability

will be significant and that I think is the economic logic of use of AI at at the factory floor in manufacturing in MSMES. Global competitiveness no longer depends

on labor or wage arbitrage. Global buyers increasingly value consistent quality, delivery reliability, transparent supply chains. They demand granular visibility across

production networks and AIdriven measurement networks can allow Indian firms to meet all these standards at lower compliance and verification costs. Another important dimension is

sustainability. Databased traceability has now become a market entry requirement. And here again, real time measurement systems using AI which track emissions, water,

energy intensity continuously rather than retrospectively will help us break into these markets. But why is this study important for us? This study is important for us for one

important reason. And what is that important reason? Readiness will determine what scales. Across the MSME ecosystems, we have firms which are very good at what they

are doing, which are competitive at what they are doing, but they are unevenly monitored. They are partially digitized. And it is important for us to lay a level playing field for them to using

AI. But before they can start doing that, they have to digitize. They have to adopt some of the basic traceability data interoperability mechanisms. And this is what we are looking at from this

study. What is the second thing that MSMES need for them? Any returns from AI have to be visible, have to be time bound, they have to agree to them in a short period

of time. Next, cluster level deployment is important. Shared digital infrastructure, common data standards, collective service platforms can help us

adopt lower adoption costs and create scale efficiencies. Fourth, vendor lock in has to be discouraged as much as possible.

And finally, and what is most important, AI has to be seen as productivity enhancing, not labor displacing. We cannot look at look at it as an eitheror issue. We are not looking at AI

to displace labor. It is not a productivity versus a headcount issue. It is improving productivity, making labor more productive while adding to global competitiveness

through realtime monitoring, lower machine downtime, etc., etc. Therefore, the focus needs to shift from headcount management to productivity, value upgrade, global competitiveness.

AI adoption in MSMES will improve only when quality is improved without impacting jobs. All these things have implications for policy but we will discuss them when we

get this report. All I want to say at this point of time that I really look forward to NI NISG and Athena coming up with implications of adoption for policy makers.

What regulations need to change? What kind of fiscal support may be necessary to increase adoption? What kind of monitoring tools may be necessary to enable and evaluate AI

adoption impact at scale. But irrespective of what the results of this study are, we are quite clear that the next wave of AI growth will not just come from code. It will not just come

from companies, digital native companies scaling rapidly. It will come from machines, shop floors and supply chains becoming adoptive, adaptive and intelligent. And finally, I began with a

provocative statement. I must end with one. India's battle for AI will be won or lost on the factory shop floor. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. [applause] Wow, thank you so much. Uh I just want

to call out one specific I'm so much there right like and in the but the sustainability dimension to competitiveness I think is such a powerful one and is so so much more

pronounced in textiles and in something that we're very excited to learn more about as we hit uh hit the factory floors and think about where that fits in. So thank you sir for that really

inspiring and uh brilliant summary. Now I have the honor of inviting Mr. Raman Sharma joint secretary department of pharmaceuticals uh to share his perspectives.

&gt;&gt; Thank you ma'am. esteemed panelist. Ladies and gentlemen, uh I would be very uh specific to uh the pharmaceutical sector to which I belong. Uh just to give you a perspective, uh in India we

have roughly around 10,000 units uh who are uh into pharmaceutical product manufacturing and out of these uh almost 80 to 85% are MSMES and uh the rest are large scale units.

Now uh when it comes to uh the output of uh pharmaceuticals in the country uh now 80% is uh actually delivered by the 20%. And uh the 80% MSMES they deliver only 20% of uh the output. Now this is where

I think the problem lies and uh there are precisely two problems that uh we face in the uh pharmaceutical sector. uh number one is uh this without uh the scale the cost of manufacturing of the

MSME units is way too high. Number two the quality issues are there. Now to basically address the quality issues uh the government of India the drug regulator had taken an initiative and

they made it mandatory that all the units uh who are into pharma manufacturing they need to uh comp be compliant to uh the WH GMP or we called it revised schedule M. So

there is a requirement uh in that you have to basically invest in a lot of infrastructure hard infrastructure I would say. Uh so that is a issue because the scale at which these MSME units

operate they are finding it difficult to u actually u convert their units to uh uh whomp compliant units. Uh, of course, government has uh several uh schemes to uh basically finance a part of this

expenditure, but yes, the progress has been not so uh good. Of course, many units are uh in the process of converting their uh or rather upgrading their units to WHGMP compliance. Uh so

these are the two problems and I think these problems are universal as far as the MSME sector is concerned. high cost of manufacturing because you are not operating at a scale and number two if

you really want to compete in the market with such high cost there is a compromise on the quality that happens many times it happens and uh this is where I think the challenge before the

MSME sector lies and uh AI I think it's a perfect tool to basically help the MSME sector to not only reduce their cost of operations but also pay a lot of focus focus on quality. Now quality is

something which it's not that uh deliberately the MSME units are trying to produce lowquality stuff. Many times they do not have the required tools or the feedback loop to basically see where

the problem lies. Now as we have seen in uh uh recent cases where there was some issue in the cuff syrup. Now in the cuff syrup primarily what happened is that there

was no check on the raw material that was coming in the uh the compounds which uh ought not to be there or uh they had to be there in very uh you know minuscule uh percentage in that

particular solvent. They were way too high and it uh led to a lot of problems. Now without a feedback loop without proper batch testing and without compilation of proper data as to exactly

where that particular solvent emerged. Now for the regulator also this is the issue. Now there is a possibility that that entire solvent came from a particular plant or maybe it was a

common importer which actually imported it. So for that if there is no credible data maintained in a particular plant now it's impossible to basically figure out. So everything then becomes a

postmortem. So government I think when uh we are talking about compliance to WH GMP or scheduleM I think uh uh along with the hardware the software component also

should be a part of that because this is a way you actually encourage the units to shift over to the good manufacturing practices if they realize that it is actually going to help them reduce the

cost of operations. Now this is something which I think the regulators also need to understand that it the good manufacturing practices also should have the use of AI which should be I would

say uh a mandatory part ultimately it helps you to improve your quality reduce your cost of operations. So this is an area I think which the regulator also needs to look into and uh uh government

of India uh various ministries have been funding lot of common infrastructure development across the country. Various textile parks are there, pharma parks are there. Recently we have had medical

devices parks also coming in. So the focus so far has been on the hardware part. I think as part of the common facilities that we are funding, the government is funding uh should also

have AI tools. I think that will help the units actually use AI to bring down their cost of production and enhance their quality. So this is an area I think uh I'm sure the government is

definitely looking into it and uh this is something which the industry should also come out and demand such common facilities that this is what we want because uh ultimately for the MSME

sector to succeed and prosper and grow. I think this is uh where we need to put our money in and uh world over MSME is very important because everywhere you don't need the scale of production in

some products you need very good quality but the scale is low I have worked in the steel sector for some time uh now all the specialty steel grades they are produced world over by the small units

it's not produced by a big steel mill because they don't uh such scale is not required the demand is not much but the product is very specialized. So this is where I think the MSME needs to focus on

focus on high quality specialized products where you need not have such a huge scale because uh wherever the scale is there you cannot match the large scale industry it's impossible. So this

is an area this is a niche area where the MSME really need to focus on specialized products and there the government should actually support it and AI is the way forward. Thank you

very much. [applause] Thank you very much. Uh so I think this message that we're no longer talking about just cost competitiveness. We're talking about capability competitiveness

which I think Mr. Council talked about and I think was reiterated by you sir. We can do really high quality specialized products and expand export competitiveness is a phenomenal message.

For those of you here in the room with us, there is a QR code here. You can scan. This has the whole study design so you can download it. We also have physical copies that my colleague Atri

who's standing here maybe Atri you could raise your hand can also share. We have copies we were happy to first come first serve we're happy to hand out to us. If you could be very precise with your

question, sir, please. Yeah. And second one is some of them and some of them are basically planning for the uh uh operationally automation for their businesses. So are you

segregating your effort on uh information technology uh vertical as well as operational technology vertical as well? &gt;&gt; I think exactly how we are going to

segment will become clearer when we start doing the work. So I don't want to make any commitments yet because we're just getting started. But I think that's a really valuable perspective. What's

becoming very clear is that what what we were going to need is an instrumentation layer that we cannot talk about the model layer without the instrumentation layer. So that's already

very clear. Now what that looks like are we simply talking about LED loggers, sensors, high resolution cameras, what that means is something we will discover u along the way.

Uh thank you so much for the wonderful presentation. The question is how is AI going to be leveraged primarily for the micro or about to be micro industries and how can it be benefited particularly

coming from the skilling and the labor side. Uh I always have this fear that AI is going to replace the labor forces. So how this can be tackled? Thank you so much.

&gt;&gt; It's a great question. I don't know if uh any of Yeah. Right. So, I'm happy to touch on it a little bit and if anybody else wants to weigh in, please do. I think with micro,

we're going to have to be innovative, right? Margins are thin, right? Ability to make significant investments on the instrumentation layer may not be high. So, we'll have to think about what what

truly what frugal means in terms of unlocking the AI value. We are going to be very intentional about the labor impact right from get-go. Right? So, so far in the early discovery work that

we've done, we really don't see artificial intelligence having a huge impact on labor yet. We actually see it and it goes back to something that has now been talked about in the AI world.

The total addressable markets expanding. The pie is becoming larger. So you're not necessarily taking away jobs necessarily, but maybe adding new kinds of jobs and expanding productivity

through expanding competitiveness. So there is there is some of that in terms of the jobs piece. But just on micro, we're going to have to be very creative and maybe some of it will not just be at

the industry level, but could be at the cluster level too that we can explore. But if any of the panelists Yeah. No, I think we'll take one more last question and but at the same I'll request if you

have more questions you have the emails please write to us and if you have any feedback also not necessarily only the questions if you want to tell us something guide us something on the

study and you want to give us some some suggestions uh anything please write to us so we'll take the last question we need to be fair to the next uh session also we'll close after this question

thank you &gt;&gt; um so sir my question is that since uh MSMES they begin to adopt AI for decisions like u credit assessment and inventory planning and even fraud

detection. So, how can firms ensure the explanability and auditability of these AIdriven decisions? &gt;&gt; Gosh, that's a great question, right? There's a whole I mean, we're now

talking about AI governance, right, and model risk, right? There's now a whole body of thinking and work on hardware governance, right? and how to sort of hardwire some of the what a model can

and cannot do and how it does things in the hardware. But there's also aspects of how do we look at the data pipelines. We're trying to come up with a framework internally and I talked about this in

the presentation which is how do you benchmark different service del service models right if you have four LLM agents that all offer improvements in operational equipment effect

effectiveness how do I say what is the safety risk relevance we're trying to think through what the benchmarking framework for that would look like so that it goes back to what I led with on

the choice question hopefully we'll have more ideas on that as we proceed but that's the direction that's a great Uh with that &gt;&gt; I have one last question for the textile

sector please if if I may be allowed. &gt;&gt; Okay. Right. Uh thank you Mr. Council. Right. I mean I appreciate uh the the the kind of uh uh presentation that you have made. Uh I have been working in

textiles for last 15 years and with a lot of machinery companies. How do you look at uh machinery as a service? Right. and specifically for the uh uh MSME sectors right I mean textiles

being an an age-old capital intensive businesses uh software as a service we have seen how India excelled right can can the same story be replicated for machinery

as a service and what are the policy initiatives right that the government is taking from for from PM Myntra or the PLI scheme uh for machinery as a service sector

&gt;&gt; thank you &gt;&gt; uh uh so that's A very good point. Uh if you've been following the textile sector, you would have noticed that in this year's budget, uh six schemes under

an integrated textiles program have been announced by the finance minister. One of them is called team TEM textile employment and expansion program. So under this textiles employment and

expansion program we have a component on machinery technology upgradation as well as machinery manufacturing. So use of machinery through upgradation as well as machinery manufacturing. So some of

these aspects we are trying to address uh through this program and incidentally there is a national consultation scheduled at Vanija Bhavan on the same issue on the 19th. If you would like to

come please let me know. I will send you any &gt;&gt; will it will it really benefit the MSME right I mean for the kind of certainly will we can carry on this

discussion offline happy to &gt;&gt; uh I really need to thank secretary medi for coming out of his extremely busy schedule and uh launching this report uh inception report and secretary MSME

Shriiel Dhaj gi for reaching this venue and that two in advance and standing outside just to be part of this session. Thank you so much sir my colleague Rohit and Aman for joining this session and

enriching this session and Ethna and my team for all making all the effort to organize this session and all of you for joining here. Thank you ladies and gentlemen. Thank you so much.
