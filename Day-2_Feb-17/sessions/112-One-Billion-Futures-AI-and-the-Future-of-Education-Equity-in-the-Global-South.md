## 📝 Transcript

You actually don't need a jacket now in Delhi in early Feb crisis whether it's geopolitical socioeconomic or human humanitarian and then code obviously AI you know there's

a mentor in this room uh Minakshi ma'am who said this morning she was telling me that you know technology is no more the ketchup that you get to enjoy with your baja but it's actually become the very

oil without which buda is not even possible. So you know code is increasingly shaping how we learn, how we live and how we work. And with that you know how there's so much to figure

out and if we can't do it together then definitely we not we won't succeed. So what we are going to discuss today is this conversation when we were designing uh Aditya my co- co-host is here when we

were designing we said it has to sit at the intersection of education technology and justice and in that context I want to highlight few things and we said can we really reimagine the power of AI so

that it's seen beyond just innovation it's actually seen as something that that can be the force for education equity that it can really nurture these 1 billion futures and not just create

better opportunities for a privileged few and in that context I want to share few figures with you. Four in every five people that is living on this planet is

actually today in the global south while Europe and the global north is aging more than 90% of the young people are actually sitting in the global south

right then if I move forward you know in India especially when I was in school my whole generation grew up with this word that D stands for demographic dividend

But that demographic dividend stands at risk because education equity per se is at risk. I'm sure most of you sitting in here I see Indian faces. You are familiar with

the Indian statistics. But even in the global south context there are over 270 million children who are today out of school where access itself is a question mark. We have over 70% kids under age 10

who cannot read grade appropriate text. We have one in every five young people in the global south is actually out of education, employment or meaningful training and more most of them are more

likely to be girls. So us many of us who are actually the gender advocates this is a worrisome figure. Now if I take you further, you know why this conversation for

global south is important because we are not just different countries on different continents. We actually have a shared legacy. Our education system has been shaped by our colonial history.

There's a friend of ours who you will meet in the second half of this conversation who will talk about identities and language. Many of us do not grow up or do not have

the medium of instruction that is familiar to us. Education system has constantly systemically seen underinvestment. You know what's the average per child

expenditure in global south? It's less than $55. 5,500 Indian rupees. Obviously external support in education more and more is decreasing. We are

hearing and rightfully so. People are talking about climate, people are talking about crisis. But education is something that is going down the on the radar.

Digital adoption technology in the last two decades all of us would agree that has created more has really widened that gap than bringing people together. So the opportunity in front of us today as

we sit in this AI impact summit is that how do we design consciously intentionally so that AI can become a force of equalizer and not really widen that divide.

I'm Kushbwa. My organization is Sika Lokum. And in Sikka Lokom, we have started these early prototypes using AI where we have really seen that G when designed right people are able to share

their voices. We are able to hear and listen to the voices that were previously not possible. There are women in the most remotest part of the country who are saying that

they really found it empowering when we provided them with an AI based companion. So how do we design AI solutions so that it restores agency? It really brings up

dignity rather than further cutting down on it. And that's the discussion that we wanted to have today in this room saying AI really matters but only when it is designed thoughtfully when solutions

will be done considering the use cases that all of us will bring to the four and tech and impact sector will not work in two silos but will work together as one unified force.

So I'm I'm very very happy uh that this conversation we are we are uh able to host it in this very very powerful space and to begin the conversation we have two very committed wonderful

thoughtful women leaders who have been working at the intersection of education and technology and specifically AI who will be introduced to you by my friend Adita if you could just stand up for a

while a wonderful ful social entrepreneur, founder of maker but also an AI scientist himself and he has been experimenting working with how AI can really become this force for social

good. So Aditya I would let you introduce the wonderful speakers here and then please have the conversation. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much Pushbu and thank you everyone for being a part of this

session today. Um I really appreciate the time you've taken out to join this of the 600 odd events happening at this very moment in this entire venue. So really means a lot that you showed up.

Um and your presence itself is something that we are very grateful for. Um you will have to excuse me because I conveniently picked up a cough the morning of the day when I have to

moderate a session. So I hopefully will not not have that interrupt me too often. Um between the two people that are sitting uh uh with me over here um their work has touched over a 100

million learners around the globe through free textbooks, open courseware, coding curriculums, communitydriven education programs and much much more. Nu Kosla on my far right is the

co-founder and executive director of CK12. This was an organization launched back in 2006. They built courseware and now also AI solutions for hundreds of millions of learners around the globe.

Uh she's also on the board of uh the Noeva school in the Bay Area, the America and Indian Foundation, Donor's Jews among many others. Nu and I actually met through mutual advisers at

Stanford Graduate School of Education where we both had degrees that we did but at least a couple of decades apart. So thank you for being with us today. Vana Sikka um serves on the board of

directors of code.org, or Pratam and women in data science. She previously um also launched Infosys foundation USA in 2014 but most recently um is the founder of learn which has built an app called

Vasi. Um this is a freely available app on app stores um built with a simple belief that everyone is great at something and this platform is one way for anyone to create great nuggets of

wisdom using AI um that they can then share with the world um on this platform. So here's what makes this conversation really urgent. Um we're we're at this moment where AI as Kushbu

was describing can be this incredible equalizer or it can perpetuate and widen all the divides that we have been trying to close for the last few decades in education. Um I think the questions that

I want to ask this group here and I want us to all then do in our discussions later on um are not about um if we what AI could do for education. And I think what we're trying to get to is what it

should do for the classroom um and what it must stand to serve um in terms of our objectives for learning. And so I'd love to start with you Nidu uh with my with my first question. Um um CK12 has

been offering free educational courseware curriculum resources for two decades now. Um and this of course was long before the current AI wave and even previous AI waves that we have had in

the last 20 years. I'm curious to know now that we have this state-of-the-art um with with generative AI today, what has actually changed in what um you can do for a student a student in say rural

Tamil Nadu for example versus maybe what was possible 3 years ago. &gt;&gt; Uh thank you for that. Um 20 years ago when I started I

you know It was textbook text in the classroom. It still is, don't get me wrong, but when I started, it was a textbook in the classroom and you know online was just coming on. The thing

that we knew that could happen is that we could offer lot more than just one modality. That itself was such a big issue. You could take multiodality

but the problem was focused on foundational learning which is K through 12, math and science. That's where we started. And so we knew that to make everything available, we would need

devices. But I think long term, I just don't do a quick hack. I want to make sure when we're dealing with kids, we've got to keep in mind that it's about learning.

It's not about anything else. So when we think about learning, what is it that they really need? Access, equity, or those are all things that you know um are everyone's trying to do, but it

costs a lot. You have to when you think about teaching and learning, you have to be systematic about it. You just cannot say I'm going to teach you, you're going to learn. It never happens. So we

started talking about putting content that was at level and remember 2020 uh I'm sorry 20 years ago it was the content that was actually coming out of you know Wikipedia kind of text context

but today what we can do is multimodality we can do we started building the heart of the system which tell which is the practice because we could do this now. We started

simulation, we started all kind of things but we could put them in a package. So it's it's a vertical that needs to be its own vertical like medicine is its vertical, education

needs to be its vertical and we need to make sure every sciences, learning sciences, development sciences, all those are part of the game teachers teaching. So that's Now we could do with

all that when we built that into one flywheel, we could then take all this and create knowledge for the teacher with deep knowledge tracing through and conversation. We could put all that

together and then get real in the moment knowledge about the students knowledge state. That's changed. Before it was Did they get the right answer or not? Right? Did they learn by

standards even though the standards don't mean much? That was just a political and a required thing so that you could say, "Oh, the teacher was doing their job." But it

didn't help the student. We are in a place and I'm so thrilled for AI. I I know we've got lots of issues, but every technology is iterated.

If you think about every technology and you keep making it better better sometimes you take time takes time sometimes you leave right so you know those are the things

that we can do that are absolutely necessary for the students to learn not that I got the answer &gt;&gt; no I love that thank you and I I love the context you gave of us needing to we

finally are at a moment point in time where we can meet the learner, we can meet the learner where they're at in terms of the context, in terms of their uh learning journey, their understanding

journey. Um, and the same is also true for the instructor. Um, Wanda, I'd love to ask you, um, as we bring these tools and these technologies, as students all over the world start to engage with AI

systems in and outside the classroom, there's also this idea of AI literacy becoming extremely important. And you know, we haven't really settled on an answer for what AI literacy looks like

for a 14-year-old in Chhattisgarh versus a 14-year-old in Palo Alto. And uh and as someone that has been deeply involved in shaping AI literacy curriculums and before that foundational literacy and

numeracy curriculums and programs around the world, how would you kind of answer or approach this this this interesting opportunity we have now of of of building literacy for this new medium,

for this new technology? &gt;&gt; Yeah, I think we are in very very amazing and interesting times and as you said very excited about the potential of AI here um you know out of 8 billion

people on this planet I'm going to stats here as Kushbu did earlier um out of 8 billion people on the planet I think there are only about a few thousand people who can actually make large

language model and the number of those working in frontier labs is even smaller AI engineers um are probably in a few hundred thousand and application builders are probably less than two

million or so. So as you can see we have a massive asymmetry in the creators and consumers of technology here. Now to address your question there here's the thing about AI literacy um I don't think

of AI literacy in terms of a curriculum. I think it's a ladder and um where a child stands on that ladder depends entirely on what access they have already. So for a 14year-old from

Chhattiskar for example um it could be about uh the starting point could be about recognizing misinformation um learning to safely ask questions from these large language models using

perhaps a voice tutor or a WhatsApp chatbot uh that works very well for learning in low connectivity areas at the same time for a 14year-old in California yes there is disparity but a

14y in California would be u perhaps digging uh deeper into how LLN work, understanding bias in um data sets, um perhaps even making some small applications using machine learning and

even exploring careers in AI. Um but here's what I have learned um from my experience from my decade experience at code.org which has been teaching computer science and um AI literacy uh

for a while now. Um you cannot leap frog foundational literacy whether you are looking at reading uh reading fluency or uh building AI literacy. I think you just cannot leap frog the fundamentals

and both as Nero said earlier have to be taught at the right level and I think that's that's an opportunity that AI has brought to us. Um it is very very exciting. uh we now have lots of uh

tools that are championing this through AI tutors and personalized learning. A code is doing that. CK12 is doing that. Khan Academy has been doing that for a while. Um and Pratam has been teaching

at the right level as well. So there's plenty of these examples of success stories here. So now who gets to define the AI literacy? Um &gt;&gt; well actually it's not just AI literacy.

It's you know foundational. &gt;&gt; Yes. kind of foundational of math, science, literacy, right? &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; that's the question.

&gt;&gt; That's a good question and I think it has we have to do we have to work on AI literacy just as we have worked with math and STEM and other sciences. Um you know we have to bring in all

stakeholders work together in partnership um you know the the local communities have to define the objectives using their local context. Government has to probably provide for

the in infrastructure and set the guard rails. Educators have to define the pedagogy and the how and of course um companies can provide tools uh and transparency we hope. Um so there's

definitely it has to be a foundational it has to be a partnership between stakeholders to get to this wonderful dream of universal foundational literacy. And I think our goal has to be

we don't just want consumers of AI of technology. We want to make it so we have more AI shapers, AI creators. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. I really love that point that you bring up. It it so happens

though um that so much of the large language models that we use that I use that our children in the global south will use are have largely been trained on western data sets on western

pedagogical frameworks as well. And so when it comes to this question of context um and context beyond just language yes in in India alone we have 22 languages that uh are spoken by at

least 100 million order people um and in that world I'm just curious to know as uh maybe Nero this one is for you and uh uh and I'd love to hear your thoughts here. How do how do we build AI tools?

How does CK12 build AI tools that that addresses the context question or opportunity beyond language? Actually CK12 always had this in our mind that we were our mission was about learning and

teaching. It wasn't about did they get the answers right which I've said before but really this is what we've been working towards. So for us it's been making sure that we take every

thing that we know about learning and putting that into the system in the platform we will build. I mean if you think about every every educational company or

you know company or online AI thing that people are doing is based on one thing it's going to be a tutor it's going to be lesson plans it's going to be whatever and I never believed in that

because that's very fractionating right it fractionates u the work so I said the platform form had to come together where all the three things the teacher the curriculum and

the curriculum is just a package right and and the student tutor have to come together so that they know exactly what's happening at every moment and we can tell hey teacher this is what's

happening with this student don't ask this question because three4s of your classroom cannot students canot answer this question cover something else. this particular child has gone all the way

and kind of you know just um has kind of u um you know didn't understand they don't understand carrying the fractions over right some not fraction um what do you call those um

operations thank you right sorry I'm getting old but um so you know it's it's an iterative process we very carefully started building online content which was covered made into flex

books. Flex books were nothing but flexible textbooks. So we were doing personalization 20 years ago. We will the content so we could give it away for free. So

everything we do is offered for free for every child and teacher etc. But the whole thing is really knowing teaching can only happen or learning can only happen if the teacher can help you

whether it's a tutor whether it's a AI tutor because the AI tutor will go very deep and pull out where exactly you miss &gt;&gt; and um and I I have to say that we didn't do any PR didn't do any

advertising nothing. We just very seriously kept building this platform. So it would be long-term thinking and it would be useful for learning and it can now within

two to four questions we can we know where exactly the students making a mistake. Well, Flexi, can you help me understand why does the sun burn when there's no

oxygen up there? Imagine a young kid, middle school kid asking that question. We at once know that this kid doesn't understand the difference between chemical combustion

and nuclear uh uh &gt;&gt; fision. So this audience really great, &gt;&gt; really amazing.

&gt;&gt; So um we can help that child. You say well think about it. There's no oxygen and then we know that this child doesn't hasn't been exposed to nuclear fusion. So that's how the system works. Can this

is a small example but these are really true question. You should see the questions students ask. phenomenal to the point of and I'm sorry this is very important

students in the US or in the west students in here are at the same things some students are very capable right it's we are wrong if we are assuming that the students in the

west are better they are not they are not most of them are not connected. So we have to be careful when we say that here the students are not you know uh uh up to par. It's the same

thing there. Yes, there are students who don't have opportunities that we want to make available. So I just want to make sure that I'm sorry I wanted to say that because I

don't want to leave this point in the middle &gt;&gt; and not let people understand it is not about children here having not being smarter than the children in Palo Alto.

That's not the case. &gt;&gt; It's just about access. &gt;&gt; Yeah. It just comes down to access &gt;&gt; equity at the right level and that's what we've been really focused on. AI

helps us a lot &gt;&gt; and and I really appreciate you bringing up the point and using the words access and equity as well. And I'd like to add another dimension of that. I'm also

cognizant that we are reaching the end of our time here. So I want to probably ask just a couple more questions and then open up to part two of our session which involves everyone in the audience

here. Um speaking about access um many people in the audience here are social entrepreneurs. They are builders of these technologies. They are builders of

education programs in classrooms. Um, building AI tools is expensive. It uh it costs money to run and and and have foundational models that can be trained on relevant data. Consuming AI generated

experiences is expensive. Access to computers is not at an all-time high in schools across the global south. infrastructure connectivity um literacy training knowing how to the

knowhow of working and building with these uh tools um is very fragmented and so I'm curious to hear both your perspectives um on how do we how do we kind of either leaprog or think about or

deal with some of these realities around both sides creating with AI and also kind of in the classroom context using engaging with AI experiences AI literacy curriculums in the absence of ubiquitous

infrastructure. &gt;&gt; I think &gt;&gt; Oh, may I go first? &gt;&gt; Yeah. I think it comes down to um infrastructure and understanding the

infrastructure needs. Um I think that would be a good starting point. Um when we talk about infrastructure, I think there's two kinds. Uh the first one would be the one that students and

educators need to have access to uh these tools like broadband, electricity, um compute devices. The second is the infrastructure that these uh large language models and the tools themselves

need to run on. And I think for the former um a good approach as Kushbu mentioned earlier is that we should consider intentionally designing systems that work well for example offline first

um thinking about WhatsApp chat bots uh voice enabled AI tools all of these will work well in um you know where there's low connectivity or spotty electricity and then um there's organizations that

have already done a lot of work uh like Pratam for example example they have built uh um I think it's called parhai and bal balika uh these are both offline tools and WhatsApp chat bots that work

very well in low connectivity and um I think Khan Academy has also had such tools so u there's a lot of success stories around that and we have to build for those intentionally but on the

second point about large language models I want to um throw in a little bit of a reality check there about what those costs are. I know we we have a lot of dependence on um outofcountry

organizations right now and the hope is to build our own uh large language models and I think we have built one here already. Uh but to run these large language models, these frontier models,

we actually need massive amounts of GPUs uh primarily from Nvidia at this point at least. Um now to my knowledge um India AI got access to about uh 50,000 of these NVIDIA GPUs already and the

goal is to get about 200,000 more before the end of the year which is all awesome and we need it. Uh but for perspective, by comparison, OpenAI um had access to over a million of these

last year and Africa alone has access to less than 10,000 of these. So as you can see there are huge gaps in access to infrastructure here and that um is something we have to consider when we

build these systems. And then there is the energy cost. um these AI clusters are actually insanely hungry and here in India I think we are building a 3 gawatt data center um I'm not an expert on

energy but my sense is that that is a massive amount of energy resource that we need and we need it and we need to go ahead and build it but I think there is a lot of inequity um um in in in these

infrastructure resources however I also think that that creates It's an opportunity for all of us. Um, for example, we need more local talent um to deal with this energy needs. I think we

need more local talent in nuclear power. Not to digress from it. Um um actually talking of nuclear power, do we know anyone here who has the ability to teach students how to make things?

&gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; We're talking about maker. Hey Ade, do you mind teaching kids how to make like fusion reactors &gt;&gt; and you know SMRs and things like that?

&gt;&gt; That would be the dream. That would be the over to you. [laughter] &gt;&gt; No, thank you. Absolutely. I I beforeh you go Nidu, I did want to kind of react to that very quickly. Um when we talk

about AI and education, I I think it's so important to look at the entire stack of what it takes to deliver an AI intervention um to the to the classroom. It's the energy dependence as you very

rightly described. it's the data sets, it's the training. A lot of this stuff is isn't visible as a consumer app, but is so vital and critical to be able to build um and sustain these experiences.

And so I really appreciate you for calling that out as infrastructural requirements and opportunities for entrepreneurial thinking as well, which I know a lot of people here are deeply

engaged in. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You know, this kind of u bothers me, right? There are various levels of requirements.

We didn't stop teaching kids because you know we didn't have textbooks. We didn't start stop teaching kids because they didn't have pen or paper. Then online came along. We went along.

We kind of got ready for that. So when we did CK12 20 years ago, we kept building whatever technology was available. So it made what the teaching learning was in the classroom, took it

to the next step, took it to the next step, took it to the next step. And you know, I I I not a chip builder. I'm not going to do Jensen's work for him, you know, but but

we ourselves were what one of our mission criteria was that we were not going to make education more expensive, right? We were going to make it so it's

accessible, it's equity, it's, you know, to the point for all the students. Now, I'm not saying that we can do uh everything that's being done for the consumer for education we have to be a

little bit careful about the noise about consumer AI versus educational AI and so when we did that and my co-founder Mir Sha is in the room I you know he says what should we do 12 years ago he joined

13 years ago and I said let's build technologies that are good for human beings One of the things we did, we started using, we didn't have access to open AAI

or any of the LLMs. We started hacking those and saying how can we use these without making it costly for ourselves. We had uh experts who came in and who did the

whole process and they're still working with that. We have a human in the middle. So that human made sure there was no hallucination. We made our own content

so that we could control the quality of the content and offered it for free for everyone. You could flex it. Right now what we are offering you can bring any curriculum into our system and we put

intelligence into that which means right which means not just learning did you get the right answer go do the homework etc. But it's stepbystep solutions. It's giving them hints. It's making them

think. If you're a student who doesn't have help, parents can't help. You come to CK12 24/7, Flexi is available for you. You can, you know, get your parents um, you know, phone and you can use it

then. Now I agree it's not the optimally uh uh you know fair situation but we cannot stop because we don't have the capacity like I said before I feel very strongly

about that let's continue so we can help everyone as much as we can we are already built for helping students who are behind we encourage them they don't even realize

oh my god God, that's why I didn't get the answer wrong. I mean, right? So, those are the kinds of things we've really very carefully built into the system.

&gt;&gt; And we're a nonprofit. We don't sell data. We don't share data, but we help you. So, bring all your students into the system. Come talk to us if you want to adopt it. we will use your

curriculum anywhere to help you. &gt;&gt; And thank you. Yeah, absolutely. Um I I want to kind of call out the the note of optimism there about uh yes, there will always be constraints. There will always

be technological um infrastructural constraints. Um but that is by no means a reason to stop or to take a step back. It is to continue to remain ambitious um in our efforts to build and design and

take these forward. Um one thing that all of us had committed to doing here was uh there are some really amazing people in the audience here. We're all going to a number of sessions. We're

hearing a lot of panels. We wanted to create a little bit of space where there isn't as much talking happening and a little more engagement happening with this group. So, in the spirit of making,

in the spirit of design, um I will pass it back to Kushbu to walk us through a very short 10 or 15 minute opportunity for us to get to know who's here um in the room and for us to maybe share and

make some meaning together. Um a lot of the orgs that were mentioned here have their leadership sitting in the audience over here and um we we would like to use this space to to create a small uh

discourse with all of you. Before we do that, um I would encourage everyone to join me in thanking our incredible &gt;&gt; Absolutely. A big round of applause for both our wonderful speakers. Thank you.

Thank you, Nom and Wanda for joining us. Um so like uh Adita said and as I always say in education, there's never a one-way street. It's always a two-way. We really want to dip into your

experiences, your use cases, your uh uh insights that you you have brought into this room. So we have already heard you know Nom and Madana already talked about the tensions the cost the energy needs

but then she also said that hey we shouldn't be limited by our current resources we have to think about the opportunity that AI really is offering us to leaprog right so that's where we

want to dip into this super short collaborative sprint um because of the way the room is organized we are also play be being jugardu okay so what we are going to do is uh people if you can

please hold the placards We have four personas that we really want to dive into which are the parents and communities, policy makers and administrators,

teachers and educators and youth and children. So if you feel there's a particular persona that is that speaks to you, please find that corner and just circle around. You know too much of

sitting is injurious to hell. So we need to stand up. Uh there's Ruchi here. Ruchi if you can wave your hand. She's our um she's the CEO of Atma Shakti Thrust and she has huge experience of

working with parents and communities in the tribal districts of India. So she's going to be the track lead for parents and communities. People please start getting up and start moving to your

track leads. Uh this is mandatory. It's not optional. Second, we have uh Niraj. Nirj on my on my left your right hand side. He's dealing with the teachers and educators personas. There's Shabban Shu

uh at the back. Dr. Shitan Shu Mishra is the chief of digital learning and uh working with UNESCO. He's at the back. And there's Niru who is the CEO of uh RAA for the young people and learner in

the center of the room. Parents and communities on my left hand side here.
