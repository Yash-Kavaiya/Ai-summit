## 📝 Summary

India stands at a unique inflection point. We are one of the youngest nations globally, with enormous talent potential—yet unemployment among educated youth remains a pressing concern.
While many factors contribute to this challenge, three stand out consistently:
lack of industry‑relevant skills,
limited awareness of emerging opportunities, and
absence of structured career guidance.
For fringe and underserved communities—rural youth, women, differently abled individuals—these barriers are magnified by geography, socio‑economic constraints, and access gaps. If India's AI journey is to be sustainable and inclusive, talent cannot come from a narrow segment of society. Inclusion is not charity—it is a national necessity.
