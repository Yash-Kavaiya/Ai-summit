## 📝 Transcript

There you go. Good afternoon everyone. Good afternoon. I see the enthusiasm in the room already. My name is Samir Pujari. I'm

from the world organization. Uh as we wait for the transitions to happen and the media clears and we're just preparing for the next session. But thank you for coming here

and I look forward to a great discussion. The next session will be on responsible AI for health governance implementation and investment considerations.

And we've been hearing a lot about AI and how it's functioning and what's happening. What we want to see is how we can now take it to scale. &gt;&gt; Can I please request uh the stage be

cleared? Can you be respectful to the next panelist? May I request to be respectful to next panelist please and leave the room.

Thank you. So without further ado, we have few minutes late and given the amount of the scale that we have here, I think uh we are not bad. So we'll try to catch up

with the discussions and we'll get there. But let me start off without further ado. I'm going to do the less of the talking just by way of introduction. I'm Samir Pujari. I lead the work on AI

uh in the WHO's headquarters in Geneva. Um and I'm here today to discuss Sorry. &gt;&gt; Okay. All right. So may I in the meantime can I request all the panelists to please

come on board uh and take your chairs here. So we have &gt;&gt; I can see the order here now and &gt;&gt; yeah

please we have and chalendra &gt;&gt; somin and Dr. Mona I'll introduce you as we go along. I think we need to take a picture first. have been told. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.

&gt;&gt; Stand first and take a picture before we do the other format and then we can go to the actual discussions. &gt;&gt; All right, I think we can get started now.

All right. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much everyone. Um and thanks for coming here. We'll dip into the I I've been told that uh the CEO for National Health Authority Mr. Bano is

running late. Uh so we'll just go ahead with the panel discussion which is we already have all the panelists sitting here and we have a very elite panel and I'm very humbled and pleased to to

welcome all of you here. Uh some coming from far away from Geneva uh a few of you from here some from UK and other places. So thank you so much. Let me I have a pleasure of first introducing the

panelists here. I have Dr. Monul as the first one a longtime collaborator. She's a director of a very long center named center but at ICMR and she's a focal point on AI and digital health at ICMR.

Uh one of our co-chairs also on evalions front. So thank you. Please welcome Dr. Monad to the panel. Then we have um from the welcome trust uh Miss Emily Müller. Emily uh is a

technology manager at the welcome trust and she supports AI health research and innovation Africa with the data for science and health team. She also holds a PhD in computer vision which is one of

the big areas. So as a technical expert also on this space and the urbal health from Imperial College in London and has served as chair of deep learning in the bar in 2024. Thank you Emily for coming

in all the way making the way from UK here. Please welcome. Thank you. I I think the reason I'm I'm introducing properly because often we see these panels we just come sit listen to people

have the same thoughts and people leave but I think it's also about these conference about connecting and knowing who's doing what so that after that session you can actually build

partnerships and I think that's what I'm hoping we can go forward from here that's why I'm taking a bit of depth of who these people and how much strength they're coming in and these are not just

people asked to come and sit on the panel but someone who have been working in this space quite intently and deeply and can share share and replicate the knowledge going forward. So that's why I

think please do welcome these people. Then I have Somia who I had the pleasure of meeting for the first time and again I'm not going by any order here. I'm just going by my list here. Somia is a

member of the applied AI research team at anthropic which is in the news a lot of course. Uh and I'm glad that we have the industry partners also on on the floor here working at the intersection

of customers and research. He has published research on AI for mental health including suicide ideation detection on social media and suicide risk assessments and has contributed to

digital mental health technologies through work with WISA. He previously served as a head of model quality of at open pipe and holds an uh masters in AI and innovation from Kangi Melon. Thank

you Somia for making it all the way here. [applause] Next from anthropic to Google on the other side a big uh big from again Dene

uh who's the India lead for Google health specifically uh Dinene joins uh with over six years at Google and extensive experience in digital healthcare spanning product design go to

market strategy and scale up very important point that we need to discuss and explore today and she served as a head of product at Telenor Health in Bangladesh and holds an M MBA from

Symbiasis uh and a healthcare management qualification from IM Ahmedabad please welcome Din from Google thank Thank you. Next, I have uh my dear friend Andes Rice uh who's a co-lead from who

headquarters in Geneva of Health Ethics and Governance Unit, WHO. Uh Unes uh has worked with us for a long time in one of our publications on the ethics of AI uh which has been uh the one of the most

downloaded guidance from who and checklist for research uh has been a big pleasure. And has is a public health uh expert uh with a focus on ethical aspects of infectial diseases, public

health surveillance and a big data and AI. He's of course a medical doctor as well. Anest thank you so much for coming from very close in in Geneva again um our dear partners uh we have Mr. Urik

the director of AI policy at the World Intellectual Property Organization. For those of you who know this is a specialized agency of the UN dealing on IP copyrights, patents and one of the

one of the richest ones if I may say so. So uh but thank you. She's a director of AI policy at the at the World Intellectual Property Organization covering innovation policies for AI and

frontier technologies. She's experienced IP lawyer with a PhD in chemistry, an MBA from Oxford and broad industry experience spanning pharmaceuticals, medical devices and IT. So now you know

why she's on the panel. So thank you. Please invite her as well. [applause] And um uh and last but not least, Sharendra. Uh we go walk long back again again we met in the past but Sharendra

is a physician and public health uh specialist with an MBA from the University of Geneva. Actually he currently serves as a senior program officer at the Gates Foundation based in

Delhi anchoring health and nutrition policy work supporting family health, infectious diseases and digital health and AI portfolios. He comes with over 19 years of experience in program

management, building partnerships and engaging with governments across healthcare delivery in India. Please welcome Shalinda as well to the panel. So the panel here today represents the

whole ecosystem of AI as we're looking at it. We have the medical research side of it. We have the industry scale. We have the investors who are making it actually happen on the ground and we all

are here as users. So we need to discuss that and see how we can actually bring together that AI talk 300,000 people that are coming here is AI just a myth or is actually happening and we saw in

the morning uh when uh Katherine our or uh OIC in the region office launched the compendium of of AI that a lot of this AI for health is actually happening on the ground. How can we structure it? How

can we synthesize it to make sure that this benefits us as current generation our healthcare providers a lot of it who are providing these healthcare services and the future generations as well as us

right now today the day we are living it can we benefit from this AI so that's what the discussion is going to focus on thank you so much again for everyone coming here and I've we have of course

some questions around so please um I would request you to please talk to your wisdom because you are here as as experts in the topic area and Let me start first um in a question with

Urique. I mean sorry to put you on the spot but as as uh a implement a lot of the industry people come to me and ask me the question we are innovating um but what in the AI space how does the

IP function right now this is a big question for for a lot of players we're creating does it set out where does the IP and what particular mechanisms are there for IP and often the the story has

been that people have avoided this question oh no we against IP has been a a common sentiment that I've heard and you will say that right because it restricts innovation but I think that's

a myth we've had discussions plus what what can you tell us about what VIPO and international community have been doing around this IP space and how it can help take the scale to the next level

&gt;&gt; thank you so much for the starter question you hear me okay very very good so I'm I'm I'm your warm up actton I'm really grateful for the question because as you said um very often it is pitched

is IP versus access. Um and the the main message that I I have it's about development and deployment. So really um and I like this panel so much because it's an ecosystem approach. Um there are

many that turn in order to adjust the ecosystem to give the access but also to develop the AI for health application across the the entire ecosystem that we need. So it's it's

development and deployment and IP in my world in the wiper world is one of the that you can use to help fine-tune that ecosystem because IP systems at their best when they're tuned the best

way um are a powerful incentive and economic tool. What does that mean? Um I mean I'm an IP nerd and I can talk um until my other panelist will take the microphone away from me. Um but really

when we think about innovation um the very first thing that probably comes to mind from an IP side is patents and p patents are a powerful um incentive to invest in the development of these

technologies. They're also a powerful investment um in providing legal certainty that attracts the investment and that then also allows licensing and rolling out of the technologies. The

other thing that some people might not be aware is um patents um are ideal. Patents require you to disclose an invention. Uh you get a a patent for it, but it then becomes part of the public

domain. So public actually have an incredible function of making sure that the knowledge is open and disseminated. super important in the AI space because what we see more and more um if it's

difficult to patent things, companies will keep data sets for example as a trade secret and that really stops the roll out of things. Um, the other thing from an IP side that maybe doesn't get

talked as as much about but should talk get talked about is copyright because innovations and copyright is not necessarily something that people associate but when you think of training

data sets when you think of code and everything that AI can do in the models that we're doing there is a lot of copyright in it and again that provides a powerful incentive um in in that

ecosystem. So I mean my my pitch would be very much to say um that uh IP is a powerful tool um but of course it needs to be calibrated and it needs to be calibrated by access um and I'm really

looking forward to discussion how you turn the IP a little bit together with the other so we make access possible I'll stop stop at that point &gt;&gt; that's very well said and the reason I

started with this foundational question is this is something people don't want to touch often and I've always heard industry partners developers saying oh IP fee if we want to put in we're going

to get stolen we don't have any access we can't get income out of it so I think the clear message is said this is an enabler it's to protect and facilitate and enable and there are mechanisms

ecosystems tools to help sort of sort out those things thank you so much for those comments and we'll come to you in the second round but moving from the IP to ethics another big gap I mean of

course in the research space we see a lot of ethics when you go into the actual implementation actual development Ethics is just a word right I mean often what are the major gaps I mean you guys

have worked a lot and there have been products that we've developed through what can you highlight the need for ethics and what are the major gaps that need to be addressed this conference so

that if people go back from here they need to understand that ethics has to be the core of of it &gt;&gt; yeah thanks for that question so for the world health organization ethics and

governance aspects of AI have always been front and center and Already in 2019, WHO established a dedicated international expert group on ethics and governance of AI. And despite COVID

coming in the way in 20121 already um who published its first guidance on ethics and governance aspects of AI for health. um which also included the first six international ethical principles on

ethics and AI. And in 2024, we then followed with the guidance on LLMs and this was as Samir was saying one of the most downloaded documents at WHO. has um found a very big use in in countries and

and among um the industry. Um what Samir said the problem is uh we do have the ethical principles. So you know since a few years and many other organizations have also come up with similar

principles. So there is an international consensus I would say uh by and large on these principles. The problem is really how to translate these principles into practice in AI in healthcare and uh

there are several factors I cannot uh speak to all of them. One of course is a very important one is the national regulation and legislation. So ethical principles have to be translated into

national laws and regulations. But uh what is really important as well is that AI includes ethics from the start. So that ethics is not an afterthought but that the AI algorithms actually are

programmed already with having ethical aspects in mind and uh so this is a concept called ethics by design and this is why we have been working with programmers and designers to um you know

teach them about the ethical principles and how to incorporate them into the uh programming already. Um and about a year ago, who issued a international uh online training course for designers

and um AI programmers specifically on how to do this, how to integrate ethics from the start. And I think this is really key and of course we will have to work even more with our industry

colleagues on this issue. But u I will leave it there in the interest of time. Thank you. Thank you so much Son. Yes and and thanks for talking about the ethics by design principles because

often I mean the challenge to scale is you are creating a product maybe it is uh a problemcentric problem product but if it's not addressing the ethical issues the six functions or the the uh

the six parameters that that just mentioned you're already risking a scale of that that uh solution. So I think it's very important to look at that ethics by design to make sure that

checklist is is uh properly a tour and and and as as tans and for telling us that we have trainings already set out by who for these developers. So that's that's very encouraging to take at that.

Let me switch from here as as And mentioned we have to work with the industry. Somia I mean you are a researcher you've studied very much and you're working on the very very latest

trends of things probably more into it uh through anthropic as AI models are increasingly adopted and tailored for specific health situations right I mean what are the key considerations from an

industry perspective to see scale and what are the risks cuz I think everyone intrinsically still scared of how health and AI are going to engage and interact right we've seen the recent uh saga

around the mall books and and those things but how does the health space and AI space actually converge from an industry perspective? &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a that's a great question

um Samir. So I think first of all I would want to double click on what Andrea said already. Um I think for industry um when applying AI to health it is the the ethics by design or safety

by design and not as something bolted on is like is extremely critical. Um I think this is quite popularly known but like in enthropic um we have this framework called constitutional AI where

we essentially as part of training the model um before it it ever sees the light of day um is is guided the training is guided severely by this constitution which focuses on like

ethical principles and um you know as as as Andreas mentioned and yeah that is definitely something like you know would be amazing to collaborate on um with with folks who have like a broader

stakeholder view. Secondly, I think the place where like industry and AI and healthcare kind of converge is also just understanding that and like the considerations that go into play is

understanding that there are a lot of kind of so to say lowerhanging fruit use cases um and and you know kind of clerical and administrative tasks where AI can like be a massive force

multiplier um and let like let kind of experts um in the field do what they do best uh while leaving more of the grunt work um to be done to be done by AI. So I think that that those are like I think

some of the key considerations besides that one major thing that um industry is always looking for is great benchmarks and evaluations that um can help guide how the next uh models or the next

iterations of these things are formed. Um as as you know you guys are the domain experts there. So yeah, &gt;&gt; thanks O that's brilliant again the benchmarking evaluation components that

you mentioned and yes I agree I mean when we talk of AI it's not replacing the entire health systems it's about helping enabling and I think this has been said often but again this keeps on

keeping coming in everything so the solutions have to be focused on where those process problems or administer problems can help actually address the major gaps that we seeing we don't have

providers who can who can sort of provide some services in that so evaluation the other thing that you mentioned so I mentioned important for the industry to see these evaluation

programs. So I'm pointing towards uh Dr. Mona in a double role uh as uh as I mean she's also with the ICMR but also working on the global committee of of evaluations. Dr. Dr. Can you talk about

the work that's being planned in the evaluations work stream how it will help these different stakeholders and why it's important for a global institution to do it and

everyone to be invested in this space so extremely because we've seen in the digital health space and the e health space a lot of verticalization uh a lot of priorizes as as was mentioned again

again how do we enable that through evaluation I mean what are the areas ofation that you're looking at &gt;&gt; yeah uh uh thanks for uh taking this question. Uh I think two things that we

really need to understand. I think there's lot of movement happening across the world. Uh and I think there's needs to be a lot of cross learning. So even when I'm talking within India, we

already know there are states down south who are actually ahead of the curve and uh I was a part of the committee at um in Andra where they are working on taking some of the medtech companies and

now they are in the process of starting the evaluation. So already a lot of health systems are taking into this place but if we go up across other parts of India within India there's a lot of

variability that we are seeing as a research organization I think um the compendium was a good starting point where they actually made an effort to bring lot of those case studies together

what was the real world action happening so we have the evidence as we are talking so we have evidence from the north we have evidence from the south and we have evidence across the globe

But we have not been able to collate it because even if we talk about evaluations in the space of RCTs uh so RCTs are an evolving thing but when we are like we really do not have

the time for RCTs we really need to have trials that are pragmatic and what are the kind of trials we need so we need to have the AI test beds and trial units that are now going to actually be giving

like a quick answer. So if you screen that first part then you might be able to take those things give a feedback to the companies or other people even within the health systems that they're

working how do you strengthen it then go to the next part and use technology you have the area of digital twins that is coming up very rapidly in the RC cities so taking the newer concepts how do you

evaluate this and take it forward so as the chair when we are taking up this we want to look at what are the best practices across the globe how do we like operationalize it and what are the

how do we engage with the governments and be the technical partners. So I think I see a lot of this interaction that is now required. We are already working across the globe. I think we are

part of the responsible AI network also. So giving these networks we are able to be the cross networks. I think UN has a network the AI has a network and the WHO. So this is a time when the global

agencies need to get together give and they have the right space because they can pull in lot of those big partnerships together. So that is what is required so that we can go from pilot

to scale get the best practices in have the AI test bed clinical trial units have the centers of excellence if they are built across this will help us kind of engage rapidly with the governments

scale it up and make sure that whatever we are talking right now ensuring that the ethical and the responsible and the trusted all the buzzwords that we talk about they are put into practice

otherwise it's going to be very difficult we will always be be in those silos so that is kind of that builds into the system. So that is my take on it.

&gt;&gt; Thanks. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thanks Dr. Mona. I mean that's that's actually very nicely put together. I mean we've discussed the guidance is out there, the principles are out there.

Then we need to have uh the collaborations as you mentioning to make that evaluation possible because that will facilitate that and not just collaborations in terms of of having

centers but these centers of excellence who can benchmark or evaluate these products themselves and it's not one person do all uh kind of job but I think so that's setting up the stage where we

have to do this obviously this all needs investments and that's why I now come to the welcome trust and and the gates foundation to discuss I mean I know welcome trust has been doing a lot of

planning around this space of work around the evaluations ecosystem. Um what I mean and and you guys are are also technically very involved in this this work. So from welcome to

perspective in terms of AI and research how you're looking at the evaluation components and building that ecosystem learning from the past of e- health digital health systems where we have had

fragmentation sort of which has uh sort of failed to succeed. So Emily, let me ask you first. I mean, how is welcomes strategizing uh this evaluation to scale approach uh

going forward? &gt;&gt; Yeah, thank you for the question. Um I think we are focused on the rigor of the evaluation as well as as Mon has highlighted the ecosystem and the

network. So in order to see that public health value being delivered, we need safe and scaled adoption. Um and to derisk those investments, we need evaluations that go beyond just the

technical validity but look across multiple dimensions. So what is the intended clinical use and is it effective? How cost effective is it? How does it integrate into the existing

health system infrastructure and governance? Um how how crucially especially how how does it affect health outcomes? And bringing in the lens of equity, is that the same across

different population subgroups once it's deployed? Is the model uh stationary over time? Does it drift? Um and how is it changing clinical behaviors in practice? And does it keep is the

efficacy still the same after some time? Um AI developers might not always be in the best position to evaluate all of these things, whether it's because of resource constraints as Mon highlighted

for for time or uh clinical expertise or evaluation expertise. So one of the roles that that we see as funders is let's bring together those relevant expertise. Let's support that broad

evaluation agenda that can lead to scaled adoption and you know bringing in not only individual individual evaluations but what happens when we start to develop methods that other can

others can use as Mona was saying bringing in networks to share within country across country and um enhance and accelerate that learning. &gt;&gt; Thanks A. Yeah, I think I mean this is

something that we've seen has failed in the past or challenged being challenged I think in the digital health space because there was a lot of uh verticals kept on reinvesting in the same space. I

know Rwanda uh we had a case study where they had 300 pilots going on the same time uh on the same topic right and that's I think I think it's the reinvestment that needs to be thought

through but I mean and and you guys are working closely with I think one of the efforts I've seen is is the investors are working together a lot now in this space and the donors also sharend over

to you I mean just trying to think on that same uh honing in I mean you've got from the Gates Foundation um a lot of investments in AI yes of course I think it's important one of the things I I

keep in hearing is is you know people do pilots and pilotitis I think it's important because without that you not have innovation but does it stop there how we go from there to scale has that

effort been enough and how can how is gates foundation now looking at because we've been hearing through all the announce from Mr. Bill Gates around how he wants to scale the AI impact. So what

is the Gates Foundation thinking on the same lines of how can these principles be embedded into the actual scaleup planning of implementation of these AI systems?

&gt;&gt; Thanks Sami. This is working. &gt;&gt; Yeah, thank you Samir. Uh thank you for having me here. uh I think we're all uh seeing the rapidity of u the evolution

and revolution of AI uh truly and well here is the AI era and um I think health is going to be affected very significantly by AI as we are already seeing so um you rightly said that many

of these pilots don't go beyond pilots they remain projects um so few criteria that we have been applying based on our experiences firstly um are these pilots operationally real. I think that's very

critical. Is this working in a PHC? Is it working in a um in the hands of an asha worker? Is it really making difference to a the life of a patient? I think so having those uh specific

components are very important. So one of the examples uh that come to my mind is when doctors are actually practicing um you know treating patients um it has already it was always been told that you

know they don't write enough or there's a data entry operator who's required to enter the data so now having this whole voice cribe feature um and making it work in an enormously crowded place loud

environment I think is making it very real and I think such kinds of AI I tools and solutions are critical for our work. So having something which is real is important. Having something which has

a foundational infrastructure architecture which uh a lot of our government uh interventions are currently working on you know uh making a difference there. So ABDM for example

having these entire infrastructure built to share data to share these uh components and having your AI solution aligned to that I think is very very critical. Third important feature and

there are quite a few of these principles that we are looking at but the third one is on governance right so how do we really create a mechanism for uh governance I think one of the p one

of [clears throat] the aspects that I think Dr. Premona mentioned as well is the ICMR guidelines on ethical usage of AI the governance principle but also the same principle needs to extend to

procurement of these AI tools by the governments and that's very critical because many times what we've seen is that the government budget line items may not have this particular uh you know

line item because it it's not prepared that way but now what we are seeing more and more states are gearing up for that. So governance and having that of you know forethought to include that as a

part of the line item is very very critical. I think uh another important feature that um that we've been really trying to understand is how does this work in a system right all of these

cannot work all of these solutions cannot work in isolation and so the health system is the health system geared up to be able to accept and use AI is our um do we have enough training

modules developed do we have doctors and frontline workers who are not just going to be trained but also behaviorally uh you charged up to be able to use these tools

to make their life simpler. I think these are some of the you know core principles that we are looking at Samir. Um and then the last one which I feel is probably the most important is are

patients ready and sort of um are they trusting AI enough? Right? And I think that has really made a difference because now we see a larger number of people you know trusting AI, trusting

themselves in the hands of AI. I think those these principles are the ones that are helping us look at our investments and making those decisions to support the right kind of uh solutions and they

themselves will help us scale as well. So the having clinical validations to help these pilots to grow to scale while aligning to all of these principles I think is probably where we'll find the

midpoint. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. It was so crisply put by you. I mean the two areas governance and it's very nice to hear from an investment perspective that governance

is now the core because we have realized this. We've often just knee-jerk reactions this is good shiny object let's use it try to scale it up. Doesn't work. And we've seen I think governance

the foundation has to be there very important and then second thing you said very nicely was trust the patients themselves will scale it up we don't have to push around it so that job of

ours is to build that trust as a community of of AI with that intention I think that's very critical because we don't talk often about regulations and the work around regulations and how do

we build that trust right like IP is regulation a competing a compounding factor this thing let me go to Dene I mean divine you have been implementing sorry I've been putting people on the

spot here and there. I mean as a company and this is the regulations is the probably the hatred word for in the companies often right says alongside AP regulations why do we want that we can

just we are responsible we can do it uh how how does Google health I mean what are the challenges that you've seen in terms of regulations and again I'm not saying it's good or bad right it's it

has to be the the right level which is like a right manage you can never get it right right but how do you get that right intent from Google's perspective so that we don't stop and hinder the

implementation of opportunities that are there but at the same time don't damage it and you've been on the ground you've been working uh in in uh in India for a long time I mean it's a content itself

and how do you see these challenges or the opportunities there from from regulations perspective &gt;&gt; thank you for that question Samir so um I'd like to first point out that AI

regulations are it's an evolving area uh each country or for that matter group of countries looks at these regulations in a very different manner. Um the EU has its own set of regulations, the UK has

its own set of regulations, the US is looking at it differently, India now also has a set of regulations. Um for a organization like Google and I'll probably refer more to India. Um the

regulatory landscape is something that we've kept um a breast of very um in a in a observatory manner. We observe it very closely. We try and comply as much as we can and we try and work with the

um policy makers um very very closely as well. But I think one of our biggest challenges has been trying to um adapt our models for the Indian data which fortunately or unfortunately exists but

it is not as usable as we would like for it to be. So one of the things which I think all of us here would love to see is that we keep talking about digital infrastructure. We're talking about um

uh digital infrastructure which is for the public benefit and under that we look at AI models but I think one very big piece that we should be looking at is how do we get data sets which are

very much India focused very Indiacentric and are available for use to train AI models for um global organizations. So that's a that's that's my first point and the second bit which

I think is um is is something that today we definitely need is to create awareness on a massive scale. So referring to ABDM referring to the entire interoperability data standards

that we've that we've all been talking about the question to ask is does the Indian citizen actually understand what interoperability is? Does the consumer today know what they're consenting to?

Because I am pretty certain um probably five out of 100 Indians would actually understand what exactly they're consenting to. So where I'm going with this one is that if

consumers are made to understand that their data is safe, it is going to be anonymized, it is going to be used for training AI models, the access that today we don't have to that organized

data might just become better. And eventually I know we're all moving towards um you know AI models which are more uh localized in nature. maybe that becomes a reality much sooner than

anyone else can anticipate. And I think the one other bit which um would be very very good to look at and does not exist today is that when policy makers are looking at regulations are looking at

guidelines uh the end toend ecosystem should be taken into account. So we should look at public health, we should look at private health health players, we should look at the consumer, we

should look at um how we are looking at it from a health budget perspective as well which I think today um that zoomed out perspective uh seems to be missing. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. So you said a very

good point. Thank you again uh for those those critical points but you mentioned data sets and this is I think I've not been to a session on AI since 2017 where data sets have not been discussed anyone

says we need to have access to data sets right they should be made available my question I'm going to put it back to you deeply I mean coming from Google how and what needs to be done sorry I'm putting

you on the spot and this is I want the panelists this is the now terror round where we [laughter] go random on the questions because I think we want to hear from people sitting here I want to

sit as an audience understand yes all this has been said how how do we make that happen if I'm a startup developer if I'm a policy maker if I'm Google how do I make it happen

&gt;&gt; so I think the lowest hanging fruit Samir and I might be you know the the odd person in the room who says this um today global data sets exist across other geos uh we don't necessarily need

to start from scratch we can have an expert committee look at those data sets and say okay this makes sense for X condition. So a lot of bio banks today have enough and more data to train

models. But no one today has actually had the good sense to say that um of let's say um 100 million data points probably half of it makes sense for India as well or why just India it could

be for the global south really. So I think that is a very simple and easy enough exercise to get the ball rolling. Secondly, um there are no data mandates as such which exist. So Apollo has

millions of data uh data points. So does um let's say a manipal but then sodas and as interoperability is a great um concept but then how does all of it come

together? There has to be I feel a policy level roll out of where of how we want to look at medical records and medical data. In principle it exists but in terms of actual deployment um we seem

to still be taking baby steps. Um yes the ABDM has an infrastructure in place but um I think this this requires central level mandates which have to be implemented with um a very very solid

[snorts] repercussion of what happens if you don't comply. Um I know the we we keep talking about I think 100 years of independence and things like that and how we want to completely upgrade our

health system. Is it possible? 100%. But I think the pace just needs to be scaled up a little bit. &gt;&gt; Thanks Julene. I know I mean you're definitely saying that there is need for

governance which I think Sharina mentioned also. I still want to keep on going to you one more last one quick question. Google are they internal thinking around if I mean if we want to

speak speaker and I said we want to try and find solutions are are there thinking as a leader uh to sort of make some kind of these data sets available for the research globally other

discussions or are you using these mechanisms because you are conveners are you able to convene and do these things as well and I'll then go to you promise this is the last question for you

&gt;&gt; so Samir what we try and do is um we influence without power. Um I'll explain that a little bit. So we try and um ensure that we have the right relationships with the right set of um

policy makers. We try and influence in circles where we know where we know that um we might end up having a voice. But to be very honest, it is something which is um a learning curve for us also. Um

if I were today it's been a few years where we have the right set of relationships we are welcomed by um policy makers um folks within the government but it has been uh an upward

and a not so steep curve also um having sorry I I'll just conclude um &gt;&gt; I think Google as Google today has a lot of resources. Yes. And we are more than willing to work with um government

partners, government agencies. We would love for them to also want to work with us. &gt;&gt; Okay. Thanks, Jimmy. I'll take a yes from Google's side that you're very

willing to work in this thing. But I understand the concept of of governance. Sharendra and Emily. I mean coming to you now, right? The investments in the government. You mentioned about

governance and this has always been the orphan baby in the space, right? Cuz if you want to scale up things, we don't see that space. Watch what areas I mean is it just talking about governance at

broad level or are there specific actions that gates foundation and welcome trust together are looking and governance probably entails a lot of things it's defined differently by

different people the operationalization the regulations the ethics the evaluations what sort of are you guys specifically investing in and if I'm an audience here sitting I'm a developer

I'm an implementer I'm a healthcare workforce person how does that sort of help me the governance issues that and How is Gates facet in that or or welcome to faceting that?

&gt;&gt; Sure. Uh thanks Samir. I think um two dimensions to it. one um internally I think what we are trying to do is put together a team um that is specifically looking at all kinds of regulations,

governance guidelines that are coming together from different um different different uh sources and trying to figure out what is it that makes most sense to the region the country that we

are operating in. So in India if it's the ICMR if it's the um ICMR digital health team that is looking at it. So our role has been to support uh the institution there to be able to make

sense of it right um our role has always been facilitation and that's what we are also looking at right so um that's one one dimension right which is to look at different guidelines different resources

different kinds of regulations come together and the second one and probably that is for all the developers and organizations that are working uh on this is also to align to help um or you

know let them know that they need to align with all of these in order for us to even you know start working with them and working with them also means that we will try and help alignment as well.

It's not that that we just leave them alone. Um so these are the two ways in which we are trying to support AI solutions and I think these have been pretty much similar principles that were

there even before even from a digital health perspective and now that has kind of graduated into the artificial intelligence space as well. &gt;&gt; Thank you.

&gt;&gt; But over to you. &gt;&gt; Yeah I mean definitely to echo a similar sentiment working with experts in country. So we we work closely with APRC who were in the audience and to really

contextualize what those interventions mean in country and developed a shared learning agenda across the continent feeding into regulatory networks which are relevant for East Africa which are

relevant for the continent and really leaning into the expertise of institutions um and also supporting the institutional capacity on the ground &gt;&gt; and Emily I mean and again just a cross

question on the globalization I mean you've both mentioned about learnings and crossation of these knowledge is very important. &gt;&gt; How does that happen? I mean through

networks is you fund so many research grants, you innovations &gt;&gt; and then to some extent you also support try to get them to scale because that's the whole purpose of these things

&gt;&gt; through crossing. How are you guys doing that? I mean how how can people do that? Actually &gt;&gt; actually uh two examples one uh what I'm currently actually anchoring is uh

supporting the government of AP. uh what we're trying to do there is um we've helped the government set up a high level expert advisory group and this group comprises of experts from

different parts of the world uh and within that there are experts who bring in these uh specific AI and digital related expertise to the state of AP. Now the government of AP now can

essentially leverage these experts and their networks to be able to bring these AI solutions to the estate and in fact even better is that government of AP themselves have invested heavily in

different AI tools and so it becomes a little more easier for them to be able to make these connections. So that's one example that I think um is something that addresses this. The second one is

um to do with u when we are looking at not just experts but also um I I think I just missed that point specifically but I &gt;&gt; but the first part is good. I mean any

example of Emily? &gt;&gt; Maybe just to speak a bit to the developer community uh as a funer and with our partners thinking around um supporting a cohort of scientists and

how we can actually also create wraparound support for that cohort to learn together um with a institutional partner. Uh and also you know with my hat with the deep learning in Dha on

also thinking around like grassroots communities that support communities of practice that annually convene get together and share ideas on how to move forward from the developer level.

Thanks. I mean that's great because Shel mentioned about the government ecosystem that you're building up that's very important because the governance comes from the government side to a lot of

extent and that's will facilitate what Dave said is there has to be the engagement from both sides to make it happen and then as you mentioned to the developers committee as well excuse me

to help and [clears throat] build the ecosystem whole rounded up in the space. Dr. Mono going to you I mean at the center of these things right I mean investments and everything how do

you what is the ask I mean are we going in the right direction cuz you are actually seeing the research being converted evaluations to evaluations and evaluations to actual hopefully scale I

mean in a big way we haven't seen that landscape of scale in uh implementation we are close I mean vision is of course getting much there where do you see I mean if we want to come to the next

summit somewhere and have this panel And what do you want to see changed from that? I mean we said that we have had the discussion. Where are those gaps in that one?

&gt;&gt; Um I think uh um as we are talking I think lot of change is already happening and I think when we when I started 2017 and when I look things that we had said then they are starting to happen now. If

I had talked about data sets in 2017 nobody would have asked but the concept was actually made at that point. I still remember in 2021 the final recommendations went in and uh the talk

had started but now it is at the point where there is an ask once the industry starts happening then things also start happening. Second uh around the evaluation uh ICMR has called you have

national health research priorities right a lot of those calls have been gone out so we already have an ecosystem where across India so those uh we have centers which have been identified which

are doing research in particular areas so we have that ecosystem and that can be leveraged so identifying places where research is already being developed and lot of these things it's not the usual

partners a lot of new partners have emerged So those things we have to start leveraging. Now the second is like once you have the and third is now uh at the

digital health institute we are now talking to the states itself. So one of the areas we are like they have coming to us and we are actually advising them like can we have the computational

health units something like that around where you actually train who are able to do both the things and uh this comes from my own experience that I worked very closely where I was in the research

institution there was an advocacy partner that worked with the states and uh we had technical partners like the international technical partners and this is not even from the AI this was a

fortification study that I had done so it was a very well done small project which happened at a very state level but it took to the national level same for the national that we did the screening

like we did the evaluation for the diabetic retinopathy again we had NITO you have to have the right partners at every stage if you're able to pull the right partners right partnerships even a

small well done project will take it to scale but that's why I said we already have the national health research priorities that are already there we have within that we can identify places

which are doing very good research take them from there and I think as uh devel also mentioned how do we support these places because data is the last part you know when we had talk like in a medical

field like for me data is very flat it is like it's an excel sheet I'll pay 30,000 to a data entry operator and that is how I'm going to collect data but the concept of data is just not there so you

have to build that data concepts right there you have to institutionalize research Um I am going to the IIT they are thinking we can open medical schools but

you know medical medicine medicine is an art you cannot just have a medical school in an IIT and think that the patient is a data point no it doesn't work like that you have to have a

coexistence co- collaboration where you have to start across when I talked to the lawyers I think kaneka is there it was very funny I think just before we came in um we were talking to somebody

they said I've come to the tech field but law stays law is very confusing Health is exactly like the same thing but I think that doesn't mean we leave [clears throat] that we have to

integrate it so that everybody moves together and we are able to build those things. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Going from the lawyers point of view

[laughter] I I [clears throat] know we I mean we started a bit late so we can I think stretch a couple of minutes over people sitting here as an audience you

said IP is easy and convenient. Give me two messages for them. I mean what do you need to do as an implement developer to get the IP scale away from them and actually sort of integrate and involve

that into it. &gt;&gt; I mean I'll start by saying this. I mean my my first answer to the first question was my pitch to you to say IP isn't like the 13th fairy at the at Sleeping

Beauty. So IP has a role to play to be at the table. But that's very high level stuff. I mean, I used to work in law firms. I used to work in industry. Um, and I mean, I'm looking around the room

and I'm sure we have people here that work in research. We have people here that work for companies. We have people here that work for startups. Um, and my guess would be if I mention IP, um, half

of you will run for the hills and say, "I'm a startup. I don't have time for this right now. I need my investment elsewhere." and the other half that have um like bigger companies will say, "Oh,

these people over there, the lawyers, I'll hand it over to to them." Um so I mean my practical advice is um I mean in the the AI and IP space is difficult is to engage um as early as possible with

it to see the potential. what we're doing at VIPO is we're actually actively working with practical things because a lot of the discussion about um AI and AI and IP can be at a really high level

level where people disengage. We're trying very hard to be closer to be practical to have tools to have guidelines to work with innovators on the grounds that have these difficult

questions. I mean the the other thing is um uh IP is only as good as the IP you get out of it. um and the same question we're struggling with um governments, IP officers, regulators are struggling

with. So again, I mean my key message is like it's important to understand the high level stuff but you move things by diving in and actually getting to a basic practical level.

&gt;&gt; Thank you so much again. There are resources doing that. I've been warned of the time again but I' I've got two more speakers. Andreas very quickly just a last comment again on the ethics side

and then I one more round of one word but just advice from your side because you said the training courses exist ethics by design what can as a user do here I mean as a developer or an

implement what's be the core of the ethics sort of thinking at the part &gt;&gt; thanks uh so I think it's very important for the industry as we have heard to incorporate ethics teaching um into um

their you know education for their workers. It's also important for the universities and we'll have a separate panel tomorrow on that on the um education that is needed on ethics to

integrate that really into the curricular of designers and programmers but I think it's really a big um job for the industry to uh ensure that their staff are well aware and well trained on

the ethical issues. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. trainings is important. And some last but not the least, the most optimistic word. Where do you see AI from health going from

from here on as a company? Where do you see the vision of AI for health? Um yeah. So I I think in in the most optimic in the most optimistic version of the world where I see like AI for

health going um is very frankly uh is is is is a world where we have basically like solved like or cured diseases or found cures for diseases like all diseases by like 2030 2035 or something.

Um and and and that world might seem like like crazy and like it's might be really difficult to even imagine especially given the the number of stakeholders, the number of the amount

of coordination that's required in addition to just doing the science to find cures. Um, but I like I that's where I think there are so many force multipliers for all of these

coordinations to happen much more smoothly and and kind of develop those systems um to to uh to then like get that impact to you know the global south um across the world everywhere.

Yeah. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much Somia. I mean so there is hope there's potential and there is the need for all these ecosystems to be built together. So I think the key words

that have heard from this this session and thank you so much again for all the wise words uh that have been shared. Of course with 500 sessions happening I know hands going up. Please talk to

people afterwards. We don't have time unfortunately for more rounds of questions here. But uh that's why we've introduced them very eloquently in the beginning. Please do reach out to our

experts. But I do want to summarize the session. I think the key that was discussed is as an AI implement here and we have some really prolific policy makers as well. Governance is the key to

scale. So even if you're an individual, if you're sort of part of the policy, look at how can we help build a governance. Mona kept on saying partnerships and I think in every world

of the way we say that do we actually do that. So I would suggest in the next summit when we come at least come and say I have made three partnerships happen on AI and actually implemented

those from whoever it is data sets be it. I mean I would love to see collaboration between the governments and the data sets and the industry coming and showing that that case. I

think that's our call to make this happen. We all believe in AI. Uh we all believe the potential but if we can make that happen and shape the investments and resources towards that I think we

would have achieved something and made the mankind a better place. Thank you so much again for being here. Thanks for this panel and I don't have to say anything but you can see the interest

here. Please do apologies for not being able to raise questions. We were told we won't have opportunity for doing that but please reach out to our our panelists and other experts uh if you

need anything and from who there's an email who. If you need anything or information please do send an email to that. Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; Anybody who has questions can they

please take it outside of this room. We have a session at 12:30 as well. Please I would request you to not speak to the speakers here. Thank you so much.

&gt;&gt; Oh, thank you. Pleasure. Everyone is requested to please leave this
