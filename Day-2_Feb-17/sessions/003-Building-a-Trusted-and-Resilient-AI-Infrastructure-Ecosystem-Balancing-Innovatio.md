## 📝 Transcript

Um we have Ankit Bos uh who is the head of AI at NASCOM and we have Rishiesh Kaneer who is the head digital and information technologies at Nara Energy and he comes with a wealth of experience

in industries such as oil, gas, FMCG and retail. Um and our esteemed panelists today would be exploring and sharing their uh beliefs and core principles um on uh what should be the core principles

and infrastructure required to build a secure and trusted AI ecosystem. Um they may be highlighting some best practices solutions to address the existing challenges so that we can enable a safe,

scalable and inclusive AI transformation. So what we would be doing now is we have a 30 minutes rapid fire panel uh where I would be asking the panelists three two set of questions

and they would have three minutes to respond. Then we would try to take a few questions or comments from the room and uh at the end we have a report which we would be launching the soft the launch

of it. Um so without much ado I would jump to Raju first because that's how my paper is and Raju from an infrastructure providers lens what does resilience by design practically mean today for AI

workloads in India &gt;&gt; you can yeah But in general, forget about the AI in general data centers means it has to be

resilience. That means it has to be always on and it has to meet certain SLS quality levels. So when people talk about the data data centers, it's not a real estate game. It is involve lot of

other things. We have to build the data centers for the purpose of highdensity servers, racks and providing all the new technologies, plumbing required for the data centers and also it has to be

connected from the day one and the power energy. So the challenge you know power is very important you know it has to be always having a not only the grid power renewable energy is very very important

and the fourth one is important is you know managing the data centers not anymore easy because the kind of variables you have in the managing a data centers there are thousands of

parameters. So how we are going to apply AI into operations point of view those are also very important for the data centers. So looking at all these things you know when you're talking you're

hosting somebody like you know Aadhaar or NPCI UPI or DZatra into that kind of a data centers it always has to be on otherwise you know the it's going to create big chaos in the system. So those

are the things we have to look at it very carefully and um you know it is a mission critical uh applications we are building. So it's very important and um and also a place like in India you have

to build very cost effective also that's very important. So that that's the way I look at it what is important for resilience point of view. &gt;&gt; Thank you Raju for sticking to the time

and also highlighting the higher issues which needs to be addressed if we really want what we want aspire to be and with that I move to Shahana. uh you know while India wants to do a lot of things

um but from a legal and policy standpoint what minimum regulatory clarity do enterprises need today for creating this resilient AI infrastructure

um thank you Amita and uh um thank you for inviting us to this uh event obviously a milestone in uh India's AI journey um I I want to answer that question in two ways I I think there are

very many critical criteria on which clarity is still required to stimulate investment in in AI infrastructure in India in particular and AI infrastructure that is trustworthy. Um

and I think very few of those parameters require regulatory or policy intervention. Right? So I think the top three criteria that I would look at and I'm speaking uh you know looking at this

from a private practitioner. I'm a lawyer. I'm looking at it from that perspective is that um you know like Rajuza said there has to be availability of resources. There are currently uh I

think between the top four tech companies four or five tech companies as about $600 billion dollars committed towards building out uh trusted AI infrastructure out of which there is

just a poultry amount that has been committed towards building that infrastructure out in India. Right. Um and so one of the important criterias is that how do we show availability

uh and reliance of utilities of resources of electricity of water etc. That's an incredibly important parameter and that issue is actually fairly fragmented because a lot of it is

controlled at a state government level highly fragmented. Um and then the other two issues actually are around what sort of tax regime do I have? uh do I have a favorable and stimulating enough tax

regime? I think there is there has been some initiatives taken under the current budget proposal. Um but I think there details to be worked out over there and more to be done. So perhaps the tax

framework is something that certainly will require more regulatory and policy intervention. Um but the third issue which is around you know risk classification and liability allocation

is something that I believe doesn't necessarily require regulatory intervention at this point and therefore you know no regulatory clarity uh because this is largely something that

needs to be left to the market forces. It needs to be left to the uh to the private stakeholders who are negotiating depending on what their place is in the uh AI ecosystem in the value chain. um

and just simple things right that uh what how can I what are the best practices what are the contractual mechanisms through which I can allocate liability throughout the AI value system

right if I'm an end user how do I do that when I don't have privity or when I don't have contact necessarily with the developers or the deployers so what are those mechanisms what are those best

practices looking like how can I get support to interpret an existing law so specifically ly around the DPDP act which is the privacy law in India yet to be implemented. Um there are questions

around how do I use my data in the context of building models in the context of training my uh my models given that there is this new law that has now put in place these rules on how

to process data. So I think more than um more than building more around you know regulatory intervention I think these are the opportunities where either uh best practices are developed leveraged

shared uh or where there is support on what the interpretation of an existing framework would look like. Thank you so much Shahana for this. I think that interpretation part is

critical and even the synergy between the available getting the resources states center etc all those uh things are difficult uh with this I'll come to Changai and we'll take a bit of a global

lens um you know what role can multistakeholder global platforms uh such as the IGF help um in developing nations to build capacity so that you know they can shape

norms for resilient AI infrastructure in their countries uh looking at globe at the global policies but also having a local uh context.

Uh thank you very much Amita and also like to thank the organizers for inviting me. The IGF is a multistakeholder model and it ensures that developing countries are not just

policy takers but also engage on an equal footing um in discussions as co-creators of norms uh through the national regional and our youth IGF initiatives local realities

are brought directly into the global discussions and also um vice versa context matters. There is no one-sizefits-all for AI governance. Um the IGF is a bottomup process for the

for that particular reason meaning that its work is driven by stakeholder priorities across the different regions. So the US does not have the same priorities as India for example.

Last year at the IGF in Norway, over 6,000 multistakeholders set a strong message. As you can see in our littlestrom IGF messages, AI infrastructure and its global governance

must reflect different levels of digital must reflect the different levels of digital maturity, data ecosystems and institutional capacities and aim to advance them.

The IGF helps shift the discussions from adopting models to adopting principles. This supports uh developing countries in identifying fitforpurpose approaches grounded in their realities.

uh through IGF initiatives, the national regional initiatives, the youth initiatives and also our training efforts, stakeholders from developing countries also gain the knowledge and

confidence to engage meaningfully. Uh this is essential to avoid asymmetric trees in shaping AI governance frameworks. Uh there's also a growing awareness

among member states on this. For example, in the WISH plus 20 resolution from December last year, which you helped [laughter] uh with um explicitly reaffirms the need

to strengthen the participation of developing countries in digital governance processes and to bridge digital and data divides, recognizing that emerging technologies, including

AI, must be developed and governed in an inclusive and development ment oriented manner. I think of my three minutes left. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thanks so muchai for this and I'll move

to Ankit now. Ankit you work with a lot of u business organization industry I would say. So what do you see are the top structural bottlenecks stopping companies from investing in uh resilient

governance practices? &gt;&gt; Uh thank you for having me. Uh uh great question. Right. I'm I'm see I'm taking it from the enterprise lens right uh I I'll tell you a structural problem and

then go to the pointers right the structural problem is that you know uh the business team wants in enterprise the business team wants the best use case to be implemented right and and

reap their benefit right the technical team who is implementing right they they want to implement the way they want to implement right uh the legal team uh and the risk team is basically you know uh

held accountable for any any issues Similarly the finance team is basically budgeting right the the struct structural issue is that you know when you are running at a you know probably

120 m per hour uh and you have to have the guardrail you have to have the governance right you take care of all of that right uh the structural issue becomes a issue right why because

everyone has their own KPI don't have a joint KPI right so I think that's the first thing so the business team would want uh the best tech in the cheapest amount uh without any ownership of you

know legality governance all of that the risk team will want the otherwise the finance team will say why you are spending it it's it's a too much uh spend right I think that's the first uh

point structural issue now if I go down to the the specifics right again uh there are four or five key points here the first point is uh you know the ROI and the budgeting mismatch there's a big

RO and budgeting mismatch because of the same structural issue right uh so ROI is expected fast, right? Uh as fast as you know within deployments uh within few weeks, right? Uh but but that's not the

case, right? Uh that's the first thing. Second issue uh uh big issue is you know uh the the understanding of the domain and putting the right guard rates right again internally you will have pockets

of understanding but again there's no joint understanding right the third issue is uh you know in the whole landscape of things there's an big issue of tool and availability of this that

tool in an enterprise right so that's the third one fourth which is the biggest I will say is the talent issue right again uh who should implement a whole governance piece. Someone who

understands the business, the risk, the the legality, right? or the tech and and the fifth issue is you know the overall coherence and thinking uh of the end user the the customers right I think uh

that's what I see uh and and and and the statement I will end with is you know if you think this issue in enterprise from a lens of compliance it will have its bottleneck and you know resistance right

instead of that think of uh scale enterprise [clears throat] grade right uh I think that is something which will take it ahead Thank you so much for this Ankit and uh

bringing in some of the ground realities which uh most enterprise organizations battle with. Um Rishi my question to you uh what do you see are the main barriers to integrate AI infrastructure in

existing enterprise processes and how do you think leaders can embed resilience and reliability from the start? &gt;&gt; Sure. Thanks. Uh thanks the organizers, thanks Sophie. Uh to this mahakum of uh

the AI summit that we are all in. Uh good morning everyone. Um an interesting question and I'll carry on from where uh Ankit spoke of ROI. Um I'd approach it from a structured methodology

perspective to implementing uh AI projects be it uh agentic AI, generative AI, be it AI in general. Um if we approach it from an ideation phase where ideation does not come in from the uh IT

organization but comes in from the business and how that happens is with a cultural mind shift change with the business teams the organizations the functions talking of how they could

better their functionalities their functions their processes with the use of AI and then follow it up with uh uh an ROI up front before a single line of code is entered. What we are currently

talking of is establishing an ROI and snippets of ROI could be if I break it down into four or five different heads. The first head could be the uh the number of tokens the LLM and the value

per metric per query. What does it constitute? Maybe 25% of the total costs. Okay, so that's the number that you've got to budget up front. The second would be uh talent and

development to invest in the teams who are developing AI. The third could be the infrastructure uh which uh uh you know CFI and a few others are kind of you know investing

heavily in how much of it does the organization contribute into uh and then there are several others in terms of operations in terms of ethical AI governance and all of those costs around

operations and support and all of that. uh that's the TCO bit and then you compare the TCO to the value and this value again comes in from the business tying back uh the processes and how much

of it uh you know can be realized so that's one number that you get into before you start the project and then when you get into the actual project I'll not call it as a pilot pilot is

such a use uh a misused word uh people nowadays are calling it as MLP which is uh minimum lovable product right [clears throat] so you start with an MLP And then uh you start getting into the

guardrails the data and the integration bit. Uh I'll just take one minute more. I'm mindful of the time. Uh so when you get into that is when the actual problem starts you know surfacing in terms of is

my data ready? Uh are the guardrails ready? How am I uh how am I going to tie up the integration grid? And there are a few things that we're looking at here in terms of uh the governance aspects.

There are agent-to-agent protocols that one needs to look at in terms of how does the entire uh protocol work, how does the governance layer work. You're talking of even uh an MCP protocol where

there are clear kind of demarcations in terms of roles of each of these agents and how does it interact with the LLM layer and all of that. Um so all of this kind of contributes into the next step

which is to get into the implementation phase where whatever was being discussed from a use case perspective how much of it gets realized into the MLP iteration one uh measure the value get back into

measuring what was envisioned versus how am I performing iterate again go back and complete the feedback loop then go back through the cycle of data integration and all of that and get into

the actual process and that's when you would establish whether you could trust the answers and then kind of evaluate once you get into that single iteration which is the evaluation could be do I

need to be accurate. I might not need to be accurate at times but I might need to maybe look at a a more uh theoretical answer or I might need an AI to perform from a work workflow perspective. I

might need to have uh a very creative answer coming about. So for each of these the evolution and the evaluation of whatever module we are developing needs to kind of you know reach its

stage one completion and then you iterate back and complete this process and along this the entire process around security governance responsible AI ethical AI the things that uh uh uh Raju

mentioned the things that everyone on this panel is mentioning all of this needs to be intact I think once we approach it from this perspective we'll see a lot of benefits coming out of it

and through a structure implement it like an IT program. Uh if we start AI projects by calling them as pilots, then I think we'll never see those pilots rectify into production. So

I think we need to get into a structured methodology, &gt;&gt; right? Thank you so much. And I'll come back to Raju now. Uh Raju, uh you've been hearing all this and you've been

seeing the Indian enterprises. So how do you see Indian enterprises balancing the push towards hypers scale AI infrastructure with the need for distributed edge and sovereign

architectures looking at the geopolitical situation we are in these days. &gt;&gt; First I want to address one thing. uh for me people should not consider AI is

a project AI is a journey because it's going to take lot of time and you know it's going to be continuous process like how we evolving as a humans intelligent so that is way it's not end so it's

going to be continuously is going to evolve second what you said is hypers scale the way I look at is very simple ama is AI I when you look at it who are investing in AI at this point in LLMs

and the training there are hardly forget about the countries there are only five six companies in US and two three companies in China the kind of amount of the money is required to support the

GPUs and the the whole infrastructure. So that is I call phase one and we learned so many things and created how you know evolve in this how many generations of Nvidia chips people are

buying every 6 months 9 months a country like in India to be honest it's still IT point of view we're still long way to go right and uh for us I think the the phase we are entering now I call phase

two we are defining the use cases and the you know a company like Nara how do we get the benefit of it that's very important to do this I strongly believe the hybrid model hyperscalers plus

private cloud that is the right model for India and that is the way I see the India is going to evolve at one point probably you know we will develop ourself hyperscalers

but if you look at the enterprises point of view to offer the same resilience like hyperscalers they have to do what is they called you know jones hyperscalers calls multi it's

not DCDR it's multiple jones to be mission critical applications so those things will be very cost sensitive things and enterprises you know we are moving from the server rooms to colo

colo to clouds so I think you know we are going to be spend wisely and India being know the way somebody asked me what is India I look at three things. One is India is

a scale. You need to aim at big scale and India I don't call cheap because I call cost effective. You have to be cost effective to operate in India and India you have to have a long-term

sustainability. So those are the three things I look at it how India is going to evolve in this technology and for India this is the great opportunity to leap frog the low

the way I look at is you know the building data centers building IT resources the skill sets we have from IT transform to the AI and we have the biggest assets on the globe taking

advantage of that and we need to take you know India has to take advantage of AI And you know like you said how do we do is it India it's not only the six or seven metro cities and we have tier 2

tier three cities so there also is very important how do we build this ecosystem in tier two you know next 20 cities those are very important for a influencing a low latency for like ner

you know a factory cannot get the latency reaching to the Mumbai you know 30 milliseconds or whatever it is So to act those kind of things AI you know AI is at the end of the day is simple you

have to have lot of high you know accelerated computing and second is you need to have low latency so considering all these things how India is going to take advantage of AI I think there's lot

of potential I don't believe you know it's a five year or a six year project probably it's a 20 years of journey how he is going to India is going to evolve in AI I think it's going to be how

internet changed our life. I think AI is going to change our lives. No, preAI post AI. Now we are talking about you know pre- internet right Amita and post internet. Now it's going to be pre AAI

and post AI. I think that's what we are going to see next 20 years. You know that's what I look at it. &gt;&gt; Thank you Raju. I know those were very um I think um gave a very high level

thing of how things are more clarity and Shahana while you uh spoke a bit about it um you know when AI infrastructure is increasingly being used for critical um and is becoming a critical

infrastructure because it's been used in such a way and given India's aspiration how should its regulatory structure evolve you elucidated to it in the previous response but quickly if you

could because you know every there there are talks about governance but do we really need to govern it can best practices work now yeah thanks Amit and I think um for any uh legal practitioner

any lawyer in the room this is the million-dollar question right what should that what should that approach be uh thankfully I'm not the only one the Indian government as as are any other

government and multilateral organizations s um also thinking about it. Uh look, I think uh I actually see a lot of value in the approach that the Indian government is taking in that they

are thinking about it, right? They are evaluating what is going on in the world. They're evaluating what is it that we want to um govern and and regulate and mitigate against. What are

those risks? What are what are those harms? we don't want to bring a framework in just for the sake of bringing a framework in. So that I think is incredibly valuable because uh you

know some of us were talking just before the session some of the panelists and we were saying that look I think in the EU yes the AI act is uh just from an academic point of view is a great piece

piece of legislation. They have done a lot to help with risk classification but is it something that actually stimulates innovation? We perhaps not right that that seems to be early indications. Um

and so I think the kind of approach that India has taken that horizontally we want to take a very light touch approach. We want to rely on existing laws in India to sweep up whatever risk

and harm may be emanating from development, deployment, use of AI systems. Um I think that's a very very valuable approach. um is that we want to stimulate the investment, we want to

stimulate the growth and perhaps perhaps getting getting a policy or a regulatory framework that is not just right will do more harm than than a benefit on the run. Um and I think

there are you know obviously a lot of sectoral pronouncements that have already occurred in this space. We've seen how intermediary platforms are being subject to content regulation,

labeling, due diligence requirements. Um, in the BFSI sector, we've seen a lot of pronouncements around disclosure requirement, based on transparency principles. Uh, and that is perhaps

appropriate because it is the regulator who is being able to determine based on you know what is the the sector that they are regulating that what are the appropriate measures that we need to put

in place. So I think this kind of um almost like a hybrid approach where some of the horizontal requirements are going to continue to be light touch uh they're going to be tech agnostic to a large

degree um and the sectoral regulators will be you know will is where we will see some progress in terms of what that governance framework should look like. Now having said that Amit I think what

is also incredibly uh valuable is developing governance structures in any event right but that should be based on a on really a self-regulatory approach it should be based on best practices it

should be based on what is relevant to that sector to that industry um because I think there is you know especially the what Ankit and Rishi were talking about on how an organization expects such

incredible ROI so quickly Having an internal governance structure will become very important to the sustainability right like the way Rishi was saying that you have to move beyond

the pilot stage and having that governance framework within your organization irrespective of where you lie in the AI value routine having that governance system will be incredibly

valuable. &gt;&gt; Thank you Shahana and I'll move to Changai and I'm mindful of time so three minutes for each person. Uh so Jangita my question is at the IGF you have

various interessionals like the policy network on AI so what role can they play in fostering a more nuanced evidence-based understanding that prevents the fragmentation of the global

AI infrastructure landscape. &gt;&gt; Uh thank you very much for the question Amita. Uh the IGF serves as a neutral space for convergence of ideas. While it does not negotiate binding rules, it

plays a critical role in aligning understanding across stakeholders across regions. This helps reduce the risk of fragmented AI infrastructure ecosystems.

uh the policy network on AI uh we call it the PNAI brings together diverse expertise to develop evidence-based insights on AI governance and infrastructure and I

think one of our key contributions as well is that we actually raise the voices from developing countries so that the discussion is not just dominated by um

&gt;&gt; yes exactly thank Um it helps unpack complex issues and um such as compute access, data governance and interoperability uh in a nuance, balanced and inclusive

way helping align uh to to move forward from silos to shared knowledge. Uh the PNAI synthesizes inputs from across sectors and regions creating a common reference

points um even where policy approaches may differ. AI infrastructure is inherently global. Um there's compute, there's data flows,

there's standards and they are deeply in interconnected. the the IGF helps stakeholders understand these interlinkages and um helps reduce the risk of policy decisions that

unintentionally fragment ecosystems and they and it does this by grounding the discussions in case studies, community inputs and multistakeholder dialogue. Um the IGF counters excl

exclusivebased or imported policy approaches. policy should be relevant to those in the ecosystem in the ground and it must be relevant to the stakeholders in that

arena. The goal is not identical regulation but interoperable approaches based on shared principles such as openness, security and inclusiveness

and three minutes. &gt;&gt; Thank you. market now and um how can Indian companies meaningfully integrate

resilience throughout the life cycle? &gt;&gt; Yeah, I think uh resilience uh is uh linked to how the product is built right uh again uh masterful statement shift left right shift left then you know wait

for the afterthought. So when you're building a product, when you're building a service or feature, right? You think of resilience as a core central piece. Then thinking at the end, right? I think

that's that's the uh overall statement. Coming to specifics, I think what what I will uh suggest is you know uh talent uh basis a use case, right? Again uh a high impact or high risk use case should be

having a different level of resiliency and governance versus a low, right? uh set minimal uh or minimal viable standards for data governance, minimal data standards or standards for you know

uh response right have human loop when it is high risk right uh I I think these are some features I will recommend right uh but but definitely uh you know beyond uh enterprise I think uh when when we

talking about resilience and and governance as a feature the the industry right and and the ecosystem can you know also give incentive ives right government can give incentives uh to

companies who are building resilency and governance at at the core right uh VCs can give incentives or or you know brownie points to the startups who are building it at the core right uh then

having afterthought right I think uh that's also very important uh enterprises who are adopting any product or or services they can give them you know additional technical pointers right

I I think that's uh the mix I think from an enterprise lens or or the product lens and from the customers. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much for this. And Rishi, the last question to you. How should

organizations measure and sustain resilience outcomes uh for AI systems once they graduate from proof of concept to core business workloads. &gt;&gt; Right? So uh for an enterprise like ours

where 8 and a half% of energy requirements for India come in from our refinery in Madina uh imagine what resilience means for us. Uh I look at it from three different perspectives.

Technical resilience from the perspective of making sure that the core the infrastructure is always available. Uh we look at it from not just accuracy of the models but also from uptime. uh

similar to the uptime that you'd measure for uh uh your business critical applications if I were to deploy an AI for mission critical process. Uh the first part would be resilience from

uptime perspective. The second would be also from the users who use it uh from a technical perspective. Is there something that the solution suggests or a workflow or process uh which demands

an immediate automation? Should the loop be there? Should I bypass it or should I redo it? Uh those are the kind of things that I would need to worry about. The second part would be uh okay it from an

operational uh zones perspective from an ops resolution perspective what it means is uh have I conducted my email address for business critical applications yes why can't I convert a dream or create an

AI for applications where it's a process that is automated uh that could something that could be something that uh the teams should look at uh necessarily Also in terms of workflows

that are integrated, agents that are working the the humanity is we talked of already but uh there are things that come in place like uh from a business critical

process is that process going to be hampered positively or negatively I'd rather also enable not just accuracy but how ensure that the results that are and there are they are how So the operations

team to walk through those kind of uh processes. The third part is uh the governance layer of uh uh resilience. from a governance perspective, from a leadership perspective. What it means is

to make sure that uh it covers a overall set of uh guidelines, guard rails and how we assure ourselves, the organization assures itself in terms of uh not just deploying projects,

products, services but also making sure that uh uh things like uh maybe a data drift of making sure that the feedback uh again and again comes back in business team and then there's

validation and processes that happen there. So that uh the overall process does not get hampered. It kind of improves and we are on time of improving feedback mechanism so that the model

delivers its quality resolution quality successes. That's it. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. Uh we have time to take three questions. We would want very short questions. Introduce yourself

questions. We'll take all the three and then our panelists will respond. So I see you here. You here. There's another gentleman so please introduce yourself very quickly.

&gt;&gt; Yeah, thank you very much. Such a fantastic topic. My name is Sua and I have two questions. One to Mr. Raju. See these data centers they place so much of uh you know demand for energy and

already our grid systems are like know stressed because of renewable energy, wind and everything. So how do you see like you know the uh grid infrastructure also to evolve as the data centers

evolve that is one my question the other question is to Mr. uh Changai uh you know as uncle said the ROA is for the to scale as organization scale now from the country's point of view there

is this data sovereignity where like you know each country is trying to limit uh you know uh the uh scaling up of uh other countries to enter the their country data sovereignity and all those

things. So there is a paradox right I mean the enterprises wants to scale and countries are limiting. So how does uh you know do you resolve this kind of a paradox from a you know international

organization. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Hi everybody. I'm Sah. Uh I have 10 years of experience in this field AI ML and agent. So deeply care about building trust in AI. I think that really matters

to the business to the government uh in the in the legal department and that's why I've been building an open source project called glassbox not blackbox. My question is how do we move from just

talking about responsible AI to actually building systems where trust is embedded by the design I mean by design especially when these systems go from P to full production because that's where

I think the things are breaking at this right time. uh we see a lot of repetitive processes. We want to automate them. We want to build uh workflows.

The piggy like us build the workflow but they never go live because we can't trust them. So shouldn't we have some kind of constitutional frameworks like inside the systems which kind of

embedded in the system itself and we can have templates and we can evolve them. uh and so I want to know about like what kind of possibilities out there in and with what horizon and with what

auditability &gt;&gt; the government is not going to audit everything by itself we need systems and frameworks in place so what kind of system do you envision

&gt;&gt; he should take the responsib Mr. &gt;&gt; No, we we'll take the three because I'm also mindful of time. &gt;&gt; Okay.

&gt;&gt; All right. Uh thank you for such a lovely session till now. So I take it from Mr. Raju that um it's a journey that we are going into. Now we are all talking about responsibility liability

and that is going and again it's a it needs to be I also believe in a bottomup approach. Now I was just thinking uh what kind of department there should be. Shall we have a AI department in our

organizations to handle all these different different challenges whether it is from legal whether understanding ROI of the technology of the talent gap to resolve

our day-to-day challenges and adoption of the AI in the organizations. So just one one quote from each one of you what would be the characteristics of those department. Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. So I start from Ankit everyone one minute to respond to the questions whichever you want. uh so I I'll come to him and him I think his push so specific so I think uh 30

seconds for you I think uh compliance as a code is something which is picking up right so you can have compliance at the code level right which can be embedded at the AI systems which will give you a

a technical person as well as business person from a code lens right again uh most of the compliance when it's deployed it's top down it's the you know the you know the audit team the so they

do it but if you do it both ways I think it will be ctor that's one we can talk more on that uh coming to you I think uh you know AI is becoming a uh multimodal sort of you know department in the

company you know really scale uh with the right pace and right governance level right you need multiple things not only tech people right you need the business people to be aware you need you

know the right budgets you need the right uh skilling hiring plan so definitely it's important to have a uh uh cross functional team who is running all of that Right. I think which is

seeing the pace, the technicalities, the business benefits and the governance aspect of it. I think that's what I'll suggest. &gt;&gt; Thank you. I'll also address your

question and then your question sir. Uh don't underestimate uh the value of capacity building. That goes such a long way in demystifying concerns and building trust. 10 years

ago we were talking to stakeholders about what cloud computing is and how the cloud service provider will not have access to your data. It was fundamental discussions. Know who your audience is.

Uh demystify with them. Build capacity with them goes a long way. The more you can scale with associations etc the better it is. Uh but do not underestimate the value of building

capacity. Um and to your question of course completely agreed with Ankit. Of course, it has to be a you know a multistakeholder approach. Uh but whatever that mechanism is within your

organization has to be highly empowered. Uh and that means that it may have to be at the level of the board or it may have to be at a level where it is able to take independent decisions not just

about the procurement uh but also about the deployment. what sort of uh monitoring and supervision and trusted environments within which that audit has to happen like all of the mechanisms for

the operation of an AI system within your organization. So that that sorry I will empower ask you to take it later because we'll be thrown out sometime. &gt;&gt; I will answer quick the power power

issue right. So see the way India right how much physical infrastructure you going to build roads metros and all it's not going to solve India problem only the way India is going to accelerate is

by digital infrastructure that means we have to put those grids required all those things that the way we have to do the kind of generation of the power we have I think we have plenty of power

available with especially with renewable energy both solar and wind. We're not touching the nuclear yet. But I think that is the way I believe India if you want to take a leap frog they have to

invest on the digital infrastructure that in parallel with physical infrastructure that is the way I look at it. So I'll choose the uh question on uh uh

who owns the AI project solution and the value that comes out of. So if we talk talk about it from a value perspective, it's the business teams, the functions themselves who are responsible for

carving out uh uh processes, projects and creating the ROI. Uh it's not an IT project at all. Uh it is a support enabler for these processes. Again if it is top down which means that there is

governance there is management mandate right from the top levels of the organization that helps kind of seeding and and making sure that the right processes right uh technologies are

covered uh so that's the answer that I would have &gt;&gt; uh thank you very much and just quickly for your to answer your question um the doctor sovereignty is a big topic now um

especially the in Europe um considering the current geopolitical um environment that we're in. So at the IDF um we do discuss it and we are um trying to help people and also

businesses and governments realize that they have to support their local businesses. They have to have an environment where these local businesses can come up and build data centers, have

good laws, good public policy instruments that encourages um this and also we also try encourage um technological transfer and that was a big issue in the WS plus 20 uh debate as

well. So um I'll be quick. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. And before we end the panel, I still have four minutes. We have a report which our teams joint teams had prepared. Uh we would like to

release it today with our panelists and if you want more copies the cifhi's booth is there at the expo. Uni can share more about it. But I'll just uh uni would you like to come?

&gt;&gt; We'd like to take a group photograph. Can the teams come? Ammon if you would like to come. Swati. Swati come. Would you like us to scratch that one? &gt;&gt; Yeah.
