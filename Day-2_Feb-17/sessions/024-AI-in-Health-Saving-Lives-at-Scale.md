## 📝 Transcript

moving. Hello Yeah, &gt;&gt; they're moving. Excuse

me. We request you to please exit quickly so that we can start our next seats. Welcome back to JPAL's AI for social good impact that works seminar. Our next session is AI in health saving

lives at scale. Please join me in welcoming Zad Overme. Zead is an associate professor of health policy and management at the UC Berkeley School of Public Health where he works

at the intersection of machine learning, medicine, and health policy. He helped set up the computational precision health program and his research focuses on how machine learning can help

clinicians make better decisions. A fun fact about Zead is that he was named one of the 100 most influential people in AI by Time magazine. Zad, over to you. &gt;&gt; Thank you uh so much. So I thought um uh

I would tell you a story about when I first came to my job at Berkeley. So this was in 2018. I was a junior untenured faculty member and I just signed up to give the first seminar of

the year uh in the economics department. Now the economics department at Berkeley is uh friendlier than the economics department at other institutions affiliated with JPEL. Uh but they are

still economists and still very hardcore. So I was nervous. And about um three or four days before the seminar I started feeling a little unwell like my my stomach was hurting. I just didn't

feel right. And I made the mistake of mentioning this to my wife um who said something like oh is your tummy hurting? Are you a little nervous about your anyway uh she was not very sympathetic.

So I uh I prepared for my talk I prepared for my first class that I was teaching. Um and I gave the seminar and during the seminar instead of feeling just globally not well I started feeling

um unwell in a particular place in my stomach which is the bottom right side of my stomach. Um, some of you might know what I have already, but I want to first make an observation that this made

me realize, which is that, um, when people make really important health decisions like, do I come into the hospital? Do I ask a doctor about this? very very important with very little

data. So at the end of the seminar, I actually drove myself to the emergency room uh near Berkeley uh and I got a CT scan and this is my CT scan. Um and some of you might be able to see what I have

or guess what I have, but I had acute appendicitis and it had perforated and I needed to have my appendix removed. Um, I think what makes this story surprising and a little bit embarrassing for me is

that I trained as an emergency room doctor. So, there's a few things that you're not supposed to miss as an emergency room doctor. And this is one of them. And

yet, I missed it in myself for four or five days. So I think what this highlighted to me is how critically important it is to be able to have access to this kind of

data. the kind of data that normally live only inside of the health system and that you can only have access to if you're lucky enough um to be close to an emergency room with a CT scanner to have

access both financial and linguistic and socioeconomic to these kinds of technologies because without data like this there's no diagnosis of critical illnesses and without diagnosis there's

no treatments. So this data is really the key to a lot of things that happen in the health system. And yet in order to get access to this, you have to be part of the health system. You have to

have access to begin with. So there's a circularity to this problem. And it locks out many many people uh of course not just in the US but but even more around the world.

So um this kind of underdiagnosis is of course not just limited to acute surgical things like appendicitis um but to many many different conditions and a particularly salient example um to many

people happens even in high income countries which is heart attack. So there are these studies that follow big cohorts of people across time in the US and it um every so often they do an MRI

of the heart to detect scarring in the wall of the heart that indicates that this person had a heart attack. And in these studies when they look at all of the people who have scar in their heart

consistent with a heart attack, most studies find that the majority of those heart attacks are silent. they are not known to the patient and not known to the doctor and not diagnosed either

because the symptoms were subtle um or because the person never sought care to get those symptoms diagnosed. So as you can imagine this is um a huge problem even in high-income countries. It's an

even bigger problem elsewhere in the world. And so um there's uh data uh from South India from Tamil Nadu um that asks people about things like high blood pressure and diabetes and asks them do

you have these things and then does the objective measure of those things and even for these basic risk factors for heart attacks we we can't do cardiac MRIs in a lot of places but even for

these risk factors there's dramatic underdiagnosis and underawareness of the things that cause heart attack. So, this is a problem everywhere. Um, and it's a problem that really urgently needs

solutions. Um, so I thought I could tell you I'm going to tell you about half of the solution. Um, and instead of uh just telling you, I'm going to show you. And you'll see more of this uh from my

colleague Shredda um in in a few moments. This device is a mobile handheld electroc cardiogram. So, the two silver sides are electrodes. You put your fingers on it

and it records the electrical field generated by your heart as it beats. And I think these technologies are really miraculous because they cost so little. That device costs $60. In the US, you

can order it on Amazon and get it delivered in the same day. Uh it connects to your phone or tablet via Bluetooth with no wires and it requires absolutely no training to do an electroc

cardiogram. So this is really an incredible technology um that that's become commoditized over the past 5 to 10 years. But the reason that these kinds of devices have not had the impact

um that that any of us would have hoped is because there's a key constraint which is that what do you do once you generate this waveform? Well, you have to send it to a doctor for

interpretation. This is too complex for patients and even for some doctors like myself have trouble interpreting electroc cardiogram waveforms. And so if you need to, it's great that you can

generate this data wherever you are in the world. But if you still need to send it to a doctor to get interpreted and to translate those data into decision-m, you haven't solved the key bottleneck um

which is access to the healthare system. So even though these devices are wonderful and miraculous, they are only part of the solution to democratizing access to diagnosis around the world. So

this is an AI summit. Um could AI help? Yes. Uh but it's important to remember that there's nothing magical about artificial intelligence. And in fact, artificial intelligence is just data in

a very literal sense. So in an ideal world, what you'd have as far as a data set to train your AI algorithm is a data set that links data from these cheap devices to some ground truth outcome

about heart attack, appendicitis, etc., etc. Unfortunately, those data on the ground truth are quite hard to find um even in highincome countries and certainly in low and middle inome

countries. And so what we often do when we're training AI tools is we make a key and very pernicious substitution which is we say okay well we can't get the ground truth linked to these electroc

cardiogram waveforms. So instead we're going to ask doctors to look at the waveforms and tell us what the doctor thinks about that waveform. So we substitute human judgment and human

interpretation for some sense of the ground truth of does this person really have a heart attack or not. Let's just ask the human. And the problem with humans, many of my good friends are

humans, so this is nothing about humans in general. But humans have biases and humans make mistakes. And human knowledge about the human body and many other things is incomplete. And so when

we automate human judgment, we also run the risk of automating all of the problems with human judgment along with it. And I think that's what makes it so critically important to train artificial

intelligence not on doctors but on patients on what happens to patients and their outcomes. So um let me tell you about some work that I um am doing in collaboration with JPAL South Asia uh in

a few uh villages in Tamil Nadu. So, uh, this is a line of people queuing up, um, for a district health center. And what we did over the summer of 2023 is set up, uh, health camps, a long-standing

tradition, um, where we just had a, um, a facility outside of this district health center where, uh, thanks to the tireless work of um, of our colleagues at JPAL South Asia, we rented out a

bunch of very fancy equipment that you can normally only get inside of hospitals. So for example, we rented out a cardiac ultrasound machine and a technologist to acquire the images of

cardiac ultrasounds. We hired cardiologists to interpret those images and look uh among other things for signs that this person had had a heart attack, signs of scarring in their heart. And at

the same time, we did data collection from these cheap $50 devices. Um so here you see two patients that were uh participants in this health camp. Um uh this young lady is having an electroc

cardiogram done and sent to the tablet in front of her. Um and the gentleman over here is getting a cardiac ultrasound which serves as our way of understanding if this person has had a

heart attack by looking at um wall motion abnormalities in the walls of his heart. So every patient got both the fancy expensive tests from the hospital and the cheap lowcost tests. Um and of

course if we found any abnormalities we communicated those back to the patient and their doctors um as as part of this study. So um so the eventual goal of this is to create a way to screen people

for a number of serious health conditions including prior potentially silent heart attacks in the comfort and safety of their own home either by doing the electroc cardiogram themselves or

with the assistance of a community health worker. And just to give you a sense of how well even this early version of the algorithm is working, when we flag the highest risk, two,

three, four, five% of the population, just general population of people um visiting an ambulatory health center, 10% have actually had signs of a prior heart attack. And that's compared to

about 2% in the general population um of people that we were looking at. So, we're finding very high-risisk people and people who even though the algorithm is saying that they're high risk and

they do indeed have silent heart attack um on their their echo their their cardiac ultrasound, they lack the traditional risk factors like blood pressure and cholesterol and diabetes

that are traditional because they were defined in western populations and as we know South Asian populations have different risk profiles and different risk factors that this electroc

cardioraphic approach is able to find despite the fact that they lack those traditional risk factors. So I think this highlights the fact that um these algorithms can be trained and tuned to

populations all over the world that might be different from the populations in which most of our medical knowledge is developed. When we put this through the cost effectiveness of screening, in

other words, sending high-risisk people for confirmatory tests at the health center and treating them with the medications that you need to be on for people who have had prior heart attacks.

this comes out to be cost-effective um even using Indian guidelines. So it's around $2,000 per disability adjusted life year even for this very early version of the algorithm which is

continuously improving as we collect more data. So this is very exciting and the next step is actually uh this wouldn't be JPAL unless the next step were a randomized evaluation. uh and so

we're doing a randomized evaluation where we're going to start screening people either with traditional risk factors like blood pressure um etc or this AI enhanced electroc cardiogram

screening approach and referring the high-risisk people for confirmatory testing in both groups and seeing which approach finds more people that we want to find people with prior heart attacks.

So, um, one of the exciting things about doing this project is that unlike a lot of the research that, um, that I've done in the past, this is a real thing. It's a device and it's already interacting

with real people. And so, to give you a sense of that, um, if you don't mind, I'm going to introduce uh, Miss Shesh, who is an instrumental part of our team with JPAL South Asia. And we're going to

violate every principle of giving a talk by doing a live demo and hoping that it works. Um, so if you'll bear with us for a second, we're going to get this set up and then you will see my own electroc

cardiogram being put through uh our um our web application and screening me in real time uh for my own risk of prior heart attack. Um, luckily since I'm a physician, uh nobody needs to take

responsibility for the outcome of the test besides myself. Um, all right. So, we're getting it hooked up and I'm hoping it works because we tried it before the talk. But of course,

live demos have a way of frustrating your expectations. Uh, we're going to switch to the other podium. Um, one thing I'll um I'll just mention as we're getting set up is that

this approach um is not limited to mobile electroc cardiograms. So, um those of you who um uh who have Apple watches of course know that there's increasing amounts of mobile technology

built into your watch that can be fed in. But these electroc cardiograms are not the only lowcost data collection devices that we have available to us. So in the course of this study in Tamil

Nadu, we also collected a number of other lowcost devices. So um those of you who sadly had to live through um uh COVID here no doubt had mobile um portable pulse oximters. Those pulse

oximters in addition to generating oxygen percentage numbers generate a waveform that actually represents the blood flow through your finger that the pulse oximter is is measuring to get

that fraction of oxygen. But that waveform has an enormous amount of information about how your heart is working, how your capillaries are working, how your blood vessels are

allowing the flow of blood um through all of these channels. So that also can can plug into algorithms. Uh the gentleman in the front row is wearing an aura ring or or a related ring that can

also measure this kinds of thing. Um continuous temperature monitoring is another feature of these rings. There are smartphonebased attachments that can take a picture of your retina. Uh, a fun

fact about the retina, you got a lot of fun facts about the speakers from Audrey. A fun fact about the retina is that it is part of your central nervous system. It's uh the only exposed part of

your central nervous system. And with a $200 um smartphone attachment, we can actually get a view into the central nervous system that can be useful for diagnosing stroke, intraraanial

hemorrhage from trauma, uh retinal disease, um other kinds of diseases of the eye. Okay. Um thank you so much for getting this working sha. Um would you mind uh telling us a little bit about

what we're going to do? &gt;&gt; Of course. Thanks so much, Zad. Uh sorry this took a bit of time. Uh good morning everyone. We'd now like to demonstrate what this looks like in practice. So all

a participant has to do is basically place their fingers on this very small device u that's connected to my phone as you see um and that's it. No wires, no hospitals

and just 30 seconds. Um Zad, I hope you don't mind. Do you want to go there? &gt;&gt; Sounds good. So what this device does is it records a single ECG which is the

electrical signal of your heart and once we capture that I enter the participant's ID onto um our app that we developed in house and behind the scenes our AI model it analyzes this waveform

uh the pattern of the heart almost instantly um which it has learned to do from the thousands of real life cases that we've collected from the field and within seconds you get a risk score that

we'll show you just in a Um so what this risk score tells us is based on just again 30 seconds with this single ECG alone uh how likely it is that this participant has had a silent heart

attack in the past. &gt;&gt; The uh the stress of the live demo is elevating my Not. &gt;&gt; I hope it hasn't provoked a heart

attack. That would be unfortunate. &gt;&gt; Are there any other doctors in the audience? &gt;&gt; All right, I think we're ready to go. So what you're seeing now is um the ECG

was automatically uploaded into a web application and generating a uh lowrisk score. Thank goodness for that. Um thank you so much for And thank you so much to our uh tech

team here. Uh live demos are an unpleasant uh ask for um for the tech team and I I really appreciate your help. Thank you. Okay. Um so as I mentioned this is not just about ECGs.

You could imagine a setup where a very small amount of hardware totaling under $20,000 US dollars comprised of an ECG, um, a retinal photo, a mobile chest X-ray unit, a handheld ultrasound device

can actually be put together in a district health center or even in a little kiosk in a uh, shopping center uh, somewhere else and could generate an enormous amount of raw device data that

can feed into a number of diagnoses. that are of critical importance to lots of causes of burden of disease in low and middle inome countries but in high inome countries as well. So I think the

the scope and the scale of these kinds of diagnostic devices and approaches is really enormous and I'll just mention one very personal application of this uh for me to give you a sense of of of what

this can do um in in life. So, my my wife and I have uh twin daughters who are almost two years old. And the way that we found out that we were having twin daughters is because I um as part

of my practice in emergency medicine, I own a handheld ultrasound device. So, this costs $2,000 and it can generate uh pictures like this of our uh of our two future daughters. So, we knew that we

were having twins uh well before most people know um because we are lucky enough to have access to this technology and I think democratizing and broadening access to both the hardware and the

software components is really incredibly important as we seek to diagnose illnesses across the world. The last thing I'll say is that I think one of the really exciting parts of this work

is that it represents a fundamentally new way that we can develop AI algorithms um in a in a in a in a sense that many people I think in in um well-resourced settings find

counterintuitive because this is an innovation that starts here in India. Why does it start here? because there's very high volume of data at very low cost but also because there is an

enormous amount of human capital here um engineering and AI talent people who know how to build hardware and and train AI products there's the ability to move quickly and at the same time and

especially thanks to um the the team at JPEL there's scope for very rigorous testing this kind of innovation can scale seamlessly to the rest of the world one interesting fact about our

algorithm is that we pre-trained our AI model on electroc cardio uh electroc cardiogram data from Sweden and the US and that actually helped a lot for um improving the model performance in India

and that interoperability if you will of the ECG waveform is a really exciting part of building algorithms that run on this kind of physiological data because as we've tested algorithms that are

trained in one place for example in Sweden they generalize incredibly well to the US to India to Taiwan to wherever we've tested them because we do electroc cardiograms the same way in all of those

places and because the heart is fundamentally wired in the same physiological way in all of those places and so those algorithms can generalize and they can solve barriers to access

that are um widespread not just here in India but all over the world where people struggle to get access to the formal health system because of distance because of poverty because of um

discrimination because of cultural or linguistic barriers. So I'm very excited about that and and I would urge anyone who's working on this kind of work here with data is to protect and steward this

secret sauce that you have here in India because it's really uh such a valuable resource to the to but not just to India but to the rest of the world to be able to develop AI products in a way that is

safe, ethical but also rigorous and fast. Thank you very much. Thank you so much Zad for that insightful presentation and may your risk of heart attack remain low for many

years. Please rejoin the stage for a group photo with the rest of the session speakers. It's my pleasure to invite to the stage the panelists for the AI and

health saving lives at scale session to join Zad on stage. The panel will be moderated by Amy Barnes. Amy, please join us on stage. Amy is a policy manager at JPAL Global, where she leads

JPAL's health sector. With all the promising applications of AI and health, Amy has increasingly been pushing to increase the available evidence on the real world effects of AI solutions on

both providers and their patients. A fun fact is that Amy started her time at JPAL focused on policies to strengthen governance and public service delivery and to reduce crime and conflict.

Now, please join me in welcoming our panelists, starting with Shahed Alam. Shahed is the co-founder and co-CEO of Nura Health. Since its founding in 2014, Nura Health has been transferring health

skills to family caregivers and patients. So far, NURA has trained over 43 million caregivers and patients across India, Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Nepal. And now, Shahed is using AI to

take NUR's mission to the next level. A fun fact about Shahed is that he earned his MD from Stanford. He's an associate faculty member at Ariadin Labs at Harvard Chan School of Public Health and

he's also been a TED speaker. Also on stage, Zamir Bray. Zamir is the deputy director of technology diffusion at the Gates Foundation. In this capacity, Zamir leads the foundation's

strategic coordination on the equitable and safe use of AI, including work like the internal AI task force, AI related grand challenges, and external AI advisory efforts. A fun fact about Zamir

is that he trained as a medical doctor and he also earned an MBA and on top of that he has a PhD in health systems and innovation and a master of law from the University of Cape Town. Um and he

serves on the board of Groot Shore Hospital in Cape Town. Finally, Rob Sherman is the vice president of policy and deputy chief privacy officer at Meta where he works to set the governance and

safeguards for how AI powered products are designed and deployed responsibly. A fun fact about Rob is that before joining Meta, he was a lawyer advising major tech and digital tech companies on

privacy and data security. And he was recognized by Chambers USA as one of the nation's leading media regulatory law lawyers. We have very great people on stage with us today

Amy. Over to you. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much Audrey. I'll just the audience can send in questions by scanning this mentee code and thank you Amy.

&gt;&gt; Awesome. Um first just so excited to be here with all of you today hear your thoughts around you know the rapid evolution of AI and health systems how it can be integrated your thoughts on

evaluation of course um audience members please do submit your questions but I'll just uh take the moderator privilege and start diving in with one um I want to start locally with Shahed I know we're

so far but going to start with you and your organization Nora Health which does a lot of work including in India to train family members ers to advocate more for their loved ones in hospitals

and to provide better care when they're leaving the the hospitals to return home together. &gt;&gt; So Shahed Nohora Nora is already working across multiple countries and already

recognized for its impact at this stage in Norah Health's growth. What problem are you trying to solve and what's the role of AI and your solution moving forward?

&gt;&gt; Thanks so much for for having us and and also for that question. Um at Norah Health again we support the family caregiver of the patient with the knowledge, skills and confidence they

need to care for their loved ones. We work with uh governments and health systems in order to incorporate these programs that really support caregivers. The anchor of of our work really starts

in healthc care facilities when families are anxiously waiting uh by their loved one and we provide them a skill-based training by a trusted health worker in person um to engage them in their in

their loved one's care. Um now once they go home families uh may you know they'll face some sort of a challenge. they need they may need a reminder or a nudge to remember what to do uh in order to care

for their loved ones. And so that's where um for us technology and our mobile messaging service steps in. So after an in-person training to continue to receive nudges and reminders for

families once they go home. Um from the very beginning as we've developed the service, we've uh not developed this as a chatbot because we wanted to always keep humans that human connection

between uh patients and families at home and a health worker at the back end as as a critical and core part of what we do. But as we've scaled it, we have seen that that whole process can become very

constrained. we went from um uh response times that were pretty quick to uh to response times that needed to take more than 10 hours. Um so that's where a AI really stepped in for us um to be able

to address this challenge of keeping highquality support to families once they're at home, but also ensuring that response times don't balloon to something like 10 hours. We had families

who who loved the service. they would reach out to us and they would um asked our nurses to to name their newborn but they were getting increasingly uh frustrated with how long it took. So we

uh sat down with our health workers and and that's really where it begins is to define what are the challenges that that people are facing and for us those are health workers and uh and started to

look at uh a lot of manual uh tasks that they were doing looking up things in an FAQ database annotating things manually um and then with them alongside us we started to co-develop an AI co-pilot

that supports health workers in answering questions providing them context on uh on the patient and family that they're supporting and importantly also tracking operational and other data

so that we understand the the quality of the of the responses and the system overall. Um and with that in place we've been able to reduce uh those 10 hours down to 30 minutes. Um we've improved

retention so families more than 30% of families keep coming back to us uh for for more more support and uh importantly the health workers are happier. They're getting to focus on what motivates them

which is to provide care versus to fill out a bunch of forms on a on an Excel sheet. &gt;&gt; And to follow up on that, I've heard rumors at least that you're planning a

randomized evaluation later this year on this. Could you say more about why you're exploring an RCT now given that you already have some evidence of Norah's impact?

&gt;&gt; You are correct. Um, and uh, you know, for us, impact and evaluations is is not a one-time thing. As we evolve, as as the world changes, we need to continually update, you know, the

evidence that we have and the knowledge that we have. Um the RCT is really critical for us because while we've done evaluations on the model, some of the product metrics, how it's affecting

users, ultimately what we hold ourselves accountable to is having an impact on health outcomes, uh things like newborn morbidity and mortality. And the RCT is a way for us to actually uh in a more

definitive way answer that. So in a simple in a simple way it is to understand the impact on this incredibly important outcome which is newborn mortality and to understand also

incrementally what does the AI supported tool provide um versus our our standard program which is the the in-person initiative um and hopefully with with that data

ultimately what we want to do is to have family caregivers support be the standard of care across health systems globally. And what RCTs and and this evidence that we're generating will

allow us to do is to provide information on what works, what doesn't to government so that they can use their scarce resources in supporting caregivers most effectively.

&gt;&gt; Thank you so much. Zamir, I want to bring you in next and hear from you from the perspective of a funer who's thinking about technology diffusion a lot in health systems around the world

because AI tools are evolving so rapidly. How should funders and implementers like Norah Health design evaluations that can keep pace with that reality while still producing evidence

that's credible enough to drive adoption and policy? &gt;&gt; Yeah, thanks Amy. Um I I I must just depart for a second and um I wonder if Zad is still around because when Zad

made his admission about being a clinician that missed the diagnosis, I realized that's why I was invited to this panel. I too missed the diagnosis and I was just remembering that it was

actually my first trip to India 15 years ago when I came here had a great time um and went back home and had a classic swinging fever for six days

and completely missed that it was typhoid fever and two ended up in the surgery room with choleiccyitis. is um so to to Zad uh this is a bit of a clinician anonymous uh admission session

so thanks for creating a safe space um but Amy to to get to your question and also you know just to pick up on where Shah left off I think the the role of evaluations for decision makers for

governments where resources are scarce is absolutely critical and I can already tell from the proceedings this week that this will be one of the key messages we take take back which is we need to

double down on evaluation um particularly giving decision makers the right kind of evidence at the right time um I'm a big fan of RCTs they have fundamentally changed the global health

landscape but there are two kind of issues we need to grapple with the one is the models change very fast and I see some colleagues smiling with me because this is a very real issue. Um you know

and I was doing a little bit of homework on like how long does this take takes us 6 months to design the RCT let's do the RCT for maybe 24 months and then take 18 months to publish the data.

That means that if we all left here today and we started designing shade maybe 2029 we have some good results that you can put out there right I'm not saying that that's what we should do the

other reality is that policy makers like in India like in many countries uh we work in as the Gates Foundation are really hoping that AI brings new promise uh brings new tools to frontline workers

that it's never been able to do before. And so the policy windows, the policy cycles don't track to publication cycles. Policy decisions are often made because

of resource con constraints or there's an outbreak or there's some political economy uh issue that drives a decision. And so being receptive to that means that we're going to have to challenge

ourselves on conventional models of doing RCTs or uh you know long trial designs that shouldn't mean that we compromise the evidence generation. So just to be

clear we have to have good evidence but in the early phases we can start thinking about does this give us a safety signal? Can we do something in short step in three to six months that

says this looks like this could be safe, could be interesting. Um and very much to what the pre previous speaker said, maybe those are short, inexpensive,

quick experiments that we can run. Then we can move into kind of pragmatic trials, adaptive trial designs that don't take us two or three years, but give us the kind of evidence

around adoption. And this is really key. We've seen lots of models perform really well in labs and desktops. Um they beat every single benchmark. And

there's no doubt that most models today are better than clinicians. those results don't hold up when you hit the field. Why? There's some fundamental issues. Uh you know, one trial we saw

was that the clinicians actually didn't trust the AI. So adoptions were stuck at about four, five, six%. until someone actually sat with the clinicians, went through their own

clinical cases and their mistakes and showed them that somebody in the room there were 100 clinicians uh in a trial in Kenya and one of them was making the mistakes and those mistakes were

significant and catastrophic that they then sat around the table and said hang on there's something we need to embrace about the technology and then we saw adoption surge to upwards of 60%.

Still not at 100%. Um so so I think that how we think about evidence is what's the right methodology for the right time. Um and again want to

just applaud you know the the Indian government for and the India AI mission for proactively recognizing that evaluation and evidence will need to be a key part of the AI strategy for the

country. setting up these centers of excellence on health, education, agriculture, etc., and then bringing really strong partners, you know, like JPAL who has the experience, but also

locally like ICMR um and and many other uh folks who can kind of put our heads together and I'm sure folks in the room about what are the best ways to evaluate AI in a period where if we were stuck on

one method that took us that long, we'd likely work ourselves into irrelevance and and increase the the inequality of how AI plays out. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much for sharing that

perspective, Zamir. Rob, I want to bring you in next uh from a global governance vantage point as we're thinking about what's needed to really drive adoption and policy and impact. What are the

biggest privacy and governance mistakes that you see when health AI projects are scaling and how can programs avoid them without stalling innovation? &gt;&gt; So, thanks for the question. I mean I

think it's really an exciting opportunity and an an exciting moment where we are sitting here where the technology that is being built is capable of solving lots of different

problems. We've heard about a bunch of them from this this panel from the speakers already from preventing health heart attacks to diagnosing anemia to giving um personalized health guidance

to people who otherwise wouldn't be served by the traditional health care system. So, these are really exciting opportunities. And I I before I answer the question about privacy and and and

security, I want to say um you know, I I was just sitting here listening to this conversation and thinking back to the past couple of global AI summits that we've had four years ago. Um, the first

one was in the UK and I think I wouldn't have been able to say the same thing four years ago that we build generalpurpose technology um, like the kind of technology that my company

builds and then people use it for all of these compelling use cases that actually enable health delivery to scale and to enable the kind of health delivery that would previously have been limited to

more wealthy nations to to more limited populations. um is something that everyone can have and I I just think that's a really exciting opportunity right now. So what are the big mistakes?

Um the first one is just treating governance as a gate rather than a guide. Um I think very often you get into this mode where people say hey we're really worried about X issue or

worried about privacy. I I spent my career thinking about privacy. I worry about privacy a lot too. Um, but I think it's important to realize that the fact that we are worried about privacy

doesn't mean that we shouldn't be able to use data in novel ways in order to deliver really positive health outcomes. We actually did a study um with Stanford University um on something called

deliberative democracy. Basically looking at at broadly representative groups of people in the US and in India and asking them for their attitudes about about frontier AI. And one of the

things that we found is here in India 90 plus percent of people said that they want AI to be used for cutting edge cures and that they're willing to contribute their data in privacy

preserving ways to have that happen. And so I think as a starting point it's important to know that um as a starting point it's important to know that if you're not if you if you're stopping the

development or stopping the deployment because you're worried about those issues rather than trying to build in a way that is privacy safe and that is secure, you're making a mistake. The

other big thing which I think we also heard and I think you you talked about earlier is is the idea of human in the loop and you know the traditional understanding here is is always humans

are the gold standard. We should make sure that we have humans in the loop and making decisions at all times and that has two consequences. You talked about mistakes and you talked about people not

getting access to care because there are bottlenecks. And so I've come to think about this problem, especially as we're getting to a point where the AI is potentially more capable than humans,

faster than humans, and more reliable than humans. Thinking about humans as the architect, we should be driving the way that the technology should be used and thinking about AI as a tool that can

help us scale our impact so that we don't run into this case where um people who could be helped by the technology aren't receiving it. and Shahed or Zamir, do you have any

reactions to Rob's comments here? &gt;&gt; Yeah, I you know it's Rob, you you remind me of a a real encounter I had um speaking to a skeptic head of neurosurgery at a very big hospital. I

won't mention the name. He looked at me and he said this AI thing is complete waste of time and it's not going to change anything in my practice. and you know it was in South Africa

and he said the only reason I'll give you five minutes is cuz you were my student at one point in time and put me on the spot and said there's this there's the CT scan now show me and I

was like I didn't come and do a demo I didn't have anything special in my pocket I didn't have a trained model you know and I took out the general purpose LLM I won't say the him, took an image.

It's multimodal. You know which one maybe. And I turned the phone around and he looked me dead in the eye and he said, "Hang on.

Actually, this is this is crazy." Cuz he then told me the clinical case. This was a case, a very real case of a

12year-old child who was admitted to a district hospital who the clinician on duty was late in the morning. I I don't know, looked at the child and said, "Child's got raised

in the cranial pressure of unknown cause and for whatever reason decided to do a lumbar puncture." Clinicians in the audience are gasping. You know what happened next?

Unfortunately, the child coned. By the morning, the child did not survive. And when he looked at the LLM result, it said to him very clearly, it was the first time I saw bold and capital

letters, do not lumber puncture whatever you do. That clinician turned around and said to me, "This is something I've never seen before." And just last week, he emailed

me to say he submitted his first publication to the New England Journal of Medicine on the power of AI for African communities. And that's where I think we're going to

get the change is when clinicians start to see the evidence and trust that this will make a change for their patients uh on in a in a kind of real life situation.

&gt;&gt; Shad, anything that you would briefly add in 30 seconds there? &gt;&gt; Okay. Um before we get to one last question, I just want to say that this discussion has been really exciting for

me personally because while I can't say too much yet, JPAL is going to very soon be really massively expanding our work through a new initiative to support research on AI and health specifically

in low and middle inome countries. And that's going to be formally announced on the 20th uh at the summit. So stay tuned for additional details there. But I just want to flag that with that new

initiative in mind, we would be really eager to reconnect with the researchers and impleers and policy makers in the room here today um after the announcement on the 20th to speak more

about how we can you know build the evidence base on health and AI together um and make those new evaluations possible. So with that in mind, as JPEL is looking to support even more research

on AI and how to integrate promising tools into the health system, I want to hear from each of you one more time. So in one to two minutes each based on your experience, what differentiates AI

applications that succeed from those that fail? That could be data availability, regulation, evaluation, other factors. and what advice would you give to implementers who want to build

AI into programs iteratively while also staying grounded in learning what works? So I'll start with Rob first maybe and then Shahed and Zamir feel free to bounce off of that.

&gt;&gt; Sure. So I think that you know we t I I talked earlier about the the downside risk of not deploying and I think that you know by thinking about things in binary terms you often run into this

case where you leave opportunity on the table and I think the projects that are successful are ones that have a dual focus. They are thinking they're thinking about the way to the the

upside. Who are they who are they helping? what is the specific mechanism by which they're going to deliver that? They're thinking about governance upfront. They're making sure that

they're identifying the downside risks and they're building them in. So, as an example, when we do our data modeling, we look at anonymization technology. So, we take data and we build we build the

data sets in ways that protect the anonymity of the people that are in it. Um, so we don't have problems later on. Um, and then thinking about access to data. We This was something that came up

earlier too. Making sure that the data that's being used is broadly representative of the people that are that that we're trying to serve. I think if you build a project and you build a

model based on PE based on data from people in the US, you're going to end up with something that serves people in the US and doesn't serve people in the rest of the world. And so I think thinking

about both a very clear targeted upside, a very clear mechanism of action, very clear governance for how to build it responsibly and broadly representative data that so that the technology and the

models that you're building can serve as many people as possible. I think those are the key key attributes. &gt;&gt; Shahed, maybe over to you. &gt;&gt; Sure. Yeah. And thank you. Building

building on that um maybe would share like three things uh for implementers who are thinking about incorporating AI um first would be starting with people um not the technology uh for us that

meant health workers understanding their needs their challenges their motivations as professionals deeply and then seeing how this tool can unlock potential. Um again for us that was about unlocking

moments that they provide care. Um, second, it was really important for us to get very precise with our definitions. What do we even mean by good care? Um, how what what's in the

bounds of of this service? What's out of the bounds of the service? Both of those things helped uh essentially provide a northstar for things like when we developed out the knowledge base,

built-in guard rails for our prompting um and again do that in a way where we iteratively come back to it. Um and finally, especially because we had humans in the loop, um putting that that

product or that tool out there to um in a in a small uh geography for us to learn and understand and and then iterate on. Um we learned so much more uh when we actually started to

communicate with families and see what were the challenges that our health workers were facing uh when we put it out there. So again, um of course do that in a safe way. For us, it was

keeping people in the loop. health workers specifically and and monitoring all the conversations, but what we learned was um was tremendous in those initial days.

&gt;&gt; Thanks, uh Amy. You know, I think a couple of things. I mean, I I think we're going to hear this week, you know, lots about models and the cool tricks they're going to do and and so on. I

think it's a 10% problem. I think models their accuracy will be 10% of what we need going forward. I think there's a 20% on how does this actually integrate like what sort of infrastructure do you

need and then I think 70% of this is going to come down to change management and how we engage people and take people along on the journey. Um and I think if we if we neglect that I think this is

going to be an uphill battle for for some time. I also think that as we think about evidence and adoption, there's a very real cost issue. You know, one of the studies we did in

partnership with Bath over here showed that the clinician assist consult actually only costs 4 US cents. And the accuracy was up to 97%. That may be expensive when you expand it

over thousands you know of users but actually the cost of compute will continue to come down. It's 240 times less than what it was 2 and a half years ago. So you can easily start to see that

this becomes scalable and sustainable. I think that one of the biggest game changers if I if I was forced to bet I don't bet but if I was forced to bet on what I think could be the biggest

gamecher for development on AI I think it's personalized health coaches &gt;&gt; in the pocket of every single individual that can speak in their language that has context and memory over time that

eventually doesn't only serve health needs but is your coach for education, &gt;&gt; is your coach for financial um but just a coach that you can trust with decision making uh over time.

&gt;&gt; Thank you so much, Samir. That's a really exciting vision to lay out and I think a good way to close. It was so great from hearing from each of you. Um I think this was just a great way to

highlight the need for more evidence, the excitement around AI and health and just really appreciate you taking the time to be here and all of you for attending. Thank you.

Thank you so much to all of our AI and health speakers. Um, it's really just amazing to hear these perspectives from every type of organization from all around the world. I hope you're all

learning a lot. We'll take a short break and we'll rejoin at 11:40. Please try to exit from the right side of the stage. Thank you very much.
