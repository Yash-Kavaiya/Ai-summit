## 📝 Transcript

Hello everyone. Thank you very much for coming. So uh this is the session on frugal AI and quantum ready systems driving growth impact and the SDGs. Um so it is a privilege to be here at

the India AI impact summit. I would like to thank the government of India and the summit organizers for convening this extraordinary gathering by bringing together institutions from

across more than 100 countries spanning governments, multilateral organizations, academia, foundations and industry. So the proposed flow for this session is going to be there's going to be about 10

minutes of opening remarks uh welcoming and framing the session. Then uh we'll have a keynote speech by Mr. Samir Chawan the director of the United Nations International Computing Center.

Then we'll have a 30-minut panel session and we'll have a few minutes for closing. So coming to my welcome remarks and my framing. So the scale of participation as we have seen yesterday

and today and over the course of the next three days what we are seeing is reflects something important right artificial intelligence is no longer something that is niche uh it is now

part of our everyday fabric it is now a global public policy conversation and the real risk today is not that government governments will miss AI the real risk is that they will deploy it

badly right no it's not because because of lack of ambition but because of fragmented decision-m so governments today are not struggling with enthusiasm regarding AI they are struggling with

the architecture of of how AI is deployed they are not worried whether to use AI but what to deploy and at what cost so this is the institutional capacity concept that we are talking

about and with that comes long-term consequences so this is where this particular session sits Much of the global AI discourse is dominated by scale, right? Larger

models, more compute, more capital, but public institutions operate within a different set of realities. Budgets are finite, energy is finite, institutional capacity is finite and most of the time

it is uneven. digital infrastructure especially the maturity varies dramatically across various regions. It could be India could be one way in Africa it could be another way and so on

but expectations from citizens they continue to rise. So the question becomes how do we design AI systems that are not just powerful but deployable and not just innovative but they are

institution ready and they should not just be impressive right they should also be how can you sustain this long term so this is where the idea of frugal AI comes in so I have been talking about

frugal AI for the past three four years primarily because especially when the chat GPT moment came in I realized one one of those things that yes AI is there but what does AI need? It needs a whole

ton of physical infrastructure. It needs uh chips for training, chips for inference, data centers, it needs electricity, it needs water, it needs power grids. And do we have the capacity

to do all of that? Maybe, maybe not. Right? So frugal AI is not about building smaller AI. It is not about doing things cheaply. It is about building deployable AI. It is about

designing systems that work under real world constraints of cost, energy, governance and institutional capacity. It is about moving from AI ambition to AI decision architecture. So around the

world we see hundreds of AI pilots. Many might have also at the gathering here many might have also read about uh the lack of these AI pilots scaling right. So what is the issue? Many demonstrate

technical feasibility. Very few survive procurement cycles, budget reviews, leadership changes or integration challenges. If governments treat AI as experimentation, all they get is pilots.

If they treat AI as infrastructure, they must measure it like infrastructure like the total cost of ownership, return on investment, alignment with the sustainable development goals. So this

is what we are interested in and the work together with uh the United Nations uh international computing council has been about uh which we had a report out last December. So this past year, this

past year this conversation has evolved through institutional work u and together with UN this is what we did uh the report that I was talking about. This is not only a government

conversation innovation often originates in the private sector and its research labs but transformation of this happens when institutions adopt scale and sustain systems very responsibly. So

responsible AI, trustworthy AI, how to do low cost, low compute but in a way that is population scale. So these are the things we are interested in all along the whole AI value chain all the

way from uh hardware software from the supply side to the demand side. So the most important thing is will AI become transformative simply because it is powerful? Maybe, maybe

not. But it'll become transformative when it is embedded into public systems in a way that is affordable, resilient, interoperable and citizen serving. And the citizen dimension is very

fundamental. AI systems must serve people, right? That's what we have. People, planet, progress. Um, and the citizen dimension is fundamental. They must serve people, not just dashboards,

not just ministries, not just investment metrics. They must reduce friction in services. They must improve access, increase transparency, otherwise scale becomes just noise. This is what we

believe. So why bring also quantum readiness into this discussion? So you think frugal AI is something that is different from all these kind of uh high scale kind of things and quantum seems

like a frontier technology and so on. So why bring quantum into it? Um AI is the current value chain but quantum is the future value chain. Um because technological cycles are accelerating,

AI is reshaping digital infrastructure today and quantum technologies may reshape computational infrastructure tomorrow. So quantum readiness is not about replacing AI next year. It's about

strategic operationality and it is about ensuring that the systems we build today do not become technological deadends. It is about the standards that we need to have. It is about the talent pipelines,

interoperability, institutional preparedness and future proofing public infrastructure in this rapidly shifting computational landscape. So the summit's framing there is people AI must be

inclusive affordable and institution ready the planet efficiency matters life cycle energy use infrastructure footprint sustainability by design we need to take it into consideration and

progress growth must be resilient it should be future proofed technologically economically and strategically frugal AI and quantum ready systems are not separate conversations they are part of

the same systems logic we should build efficiently we should build responsibly and we should build with the future in mind. So today's session brings together precisely these perspectives. A multi

multilateral systems lens from the United Nations. A state level quantum infrastructure strategy uh Amraati quantum value from Andhra Pradesh. A population scale AI deployment

perspective reaching millions of citizens from Foundation. So if we get this right, AI investments today can become long-term strategic assets. If we get it wrong, we risk

fragmentation, stranded infrastructure and widening divides. So I believe this is not a technical debate. It is a systems decision-making debate. And to move from concept to institutional

reality, we need practical experience. We need to understand how multilateral systems are navigating these trade-offs in real time. So it is therefore my pleasure to invite Mr. Dr. Samir Chawan

from the United Nations International Computing Center to share a multilateral perspective on how we move from AI experimentation to AI infrastructure. How cost resilience and SDG alignment

must shape the journey. Thank you Samir please. &gt;&gt; Thank you sir. And hello everybody. Uh pleasure to be here and I echo your Thank you. I echo your uh note that I

have to thank the government of India and all the organizers. Uh and just seeing all of you here uh the scale of what we can do with AI becomes apparent and the impact we can make becomes

apparent. So it's my pleasure to kick off this panel here today. Uh and uh where do I start? So let me start by telling you a little bit about what UNICC is. So we are uh a part of the UN

system and we are today the largest strategic partner across the entire UN system for common trusted cyber security and digital foundations that are used by the entire UN system and beyond. The UN

system is designed to support the world. They work with a very large uh consortium of other like-minded nonprofit organizations. We work with them as well. So, UNICC supports uh all

of the UN system and large multilateral organizations like the development banks, the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, African Development Bank as examples uh by helping deploy solution

at scale and I think the uh thought leadership and the work that's being done in Cambridge that Sish spoke about is very relevant to what we do because we are trying to deploy solutions around

the world in very different contexts uh and uh making sure they are fit for purpose and efficient are almost the baseline under which we have to build any tech that we roll out. We've been

doing this for 55 years now. UNICC has been around for a while. Uh but uh for us this whole approach of frugal AI, we don't see this as a constraint. We don't see this as a limiting factor. We see

this as a strategic approach we need to take. Uh sir spoke about it. We see the same case in the UN. Hundreds of pilots, very few scale up into production. And of the ones that go into production, how

many are sustained in the long term, the numbers drop off very very quickly because there's a massive cost involved, not just cost in building it, not just in training the model and the uh tokens

you use, but also sustaining the AI over time. So that's why this endto-end uh total cost of ownership approach that Cambridge came up with is very meaningful to us.

So we believe this approach of frugal AI should become of the part of the digital foundations that governments and the multilateral system should use in how they deploy AI. Uh so today I think the

global conversation about AI and the hype and the buzz is all about more and more and more. We need bigger models. We need more GPUs. We need bigger data centers. We need to generate more and

more energy. Now it's like we need nuclear power stations everywhere. We need more uh uh fusion technologies are being discussed. Uh micro nuclear power station. So it's

this race for more and more and more and more and more. Uh and I think we're missing the point. Uh I think the main mantra of the AI summit is AI for people, right? AI for all, AI for

humanity. And that's the lens through which we look at it in the UN is how do you deploy AI so it's actually fit for purpose for everybody. So we are not looking at more and more

and more more complexity. Uh it's about how do you make it affordable? How do you make sure it's accountable? So if you're deploying it in a particular geography for a certain

constituency to make sure that they actually say this is useful to me, right? Uh I'm based in Geneva. Uh and if I uh and my team work on a project, it may make sense sitting in Geneva, but if

you're deploying it in a particular country, does it make sense there? Do they see value? That's the lens through which we have to look at this, right? Uh reliability.

Is this something that can be sustained in the long term? All of these elements have to be more important than just sheer volume and sheer numbers of money and GPUs and power being thrown at this.

Right? So, it's not brute force. It has to be much more elegantly thought through and designed and fit for purpose. Uh it has to be secure. That's another key aspect. uh everything we do

in the UN uh and at UNIC security is a very big component of that because we have to make sure it's your data and that data is safe and similarly the models you have to be able to tell where

does this data come from is this something people have voluntarily shared to to empower this AI so all of those aspects have to be kept in mind uh contextual design uh as I said

understanding uh the context in which we're operating is it uh a a situation where you have uh low bandwidth uh or you have low computational capabilities. So you have to deploy solutions that

will work in those situations uh on in the field. And then continuity to me that's the biggest element here is this has to be sustainable. It should not be a flash in the pan where you roll out

amazing solutions and one year later people don't see value in it and you shut it down. Big pomp and glory at the beginning when you launch and then quietly it gets shut down. that is not

success. So it has to be something that can be sustained and grown and scaled. So as a shared service provider, everything we build, we look at it from a scalability

perspective. Is it fit for purpose in one context? But can it be deployed in other context in other parts of the world in other uh scenarios? So if we build something for agriculture, can it

be used in health? If it's used for health, can it be used for children? Used for children, can it be used for outer space? Can it be used for nuclear energy? Right? So there are very many

different domains across the UN and what we're trying to do is look at things so that it can actually be scaled up and that's where I think the frugal aspect becomes very critical because if you're

building something that's not uh designed intentionally to be frugal when you try and scale it up times 10 times 100 the cost should not go up linearly with that because that's when you run

into real walls real roadblocks what might make sense uh I've seen projects where you deploy it in a particular uh state or a particular district it looks great now try and

scale it up to a national level and if the cost goes up linearly with the population that solution will not work AI or otherwise right so so that's why the frugal mindset to say right at the

beginning if you fine-tune it and design it that scaling should not be a linear function from a cost perspective so so those elements have to be kept in mind and then uh being in the UN we also have

to say there is an econ uh sustainability aspect to this we all know that just by throwing brute force and more and more money, more and more energy at this, it's not sustainable. It

is bad for the environment, bad for the planet, right? So there's a huge huge huge sustainability aspect to this uh that we need to keep in mind. Uh so that's why I think the point Sish made

looking at total cost of ownership, return on investment and tying it to SGS is very very important because SGS are looking at the planet holistically. Is it helping uh life on earth? Is it

helping make it more judicious, more fair for everybody? All those aspects have to be thought through. And uh the one thing we've learned uh and it's it's the real challenge today is trust. Trust

in governments, trust in the multilateral system. Uh it's a challenge for us in the UN, I can tell you to to retain that trust. So when it comes to tech, we want to make sure any tech we

deploy also builds that trust or retains that trust. Uh it cannot be something that we're deploying today and it maybe solves some immediate problems but in the longer run people say wait but what

the UN deployed is actually not beneficial to me as an individual to my community to my country to my region. So that element of trust has to be baked in again security trust all of those

elements. As I'm mapping out these points, you can start to see it's a very complex landscape. And I'm not talking as a technologist. It's all those different

elements you have to keep in mind. Uh it's challenging. So we have to think this through uh design it correctly. Uh and and uh also make make it work in parts of the world where they don't have

the scale. Uh there are some studies that show that uh only 5% of the compute capabilities is in Africa. So how do you deploy something that will work in those regions right? uh we in India are lucky

look at all of you lots I see lots of young faces here there's a deep talent pool sometimes countries don't have that deep talent pool so how do you deploy AI in a way that you don't need to have

massive horsepower of brain trust sitting there and trying to maintain this all of those elements have to be thought through uh so what we really need is that mind shift change and I

think the paper that sir spoke about that we uh collaborated with Cambridge University of Cambridge on is a starting point to start that discussion of saying you need to think about this

holistically not just from a pure technologist's point of view not just from a a solutions design point of view but a holistic uh end to end uh point of view of what does it take what's the

impact it can have on the planet so this TCO to ROI to SDG thank you sir that was a brilliant uh I think formulation that's the mantra in which we are looking at AI uh and any AI that

we build is think about the total cost of ownership That's the very first thing and it's not just about building it but sustaining it and then what is the impact and that

return on investment is not in in dollars or rupees it is on the impact and the benefits it's having in society and then how does it enable the SGS so end to end impact on the planet all of

those elements need to be thought through so uh I look forward to this conversation today I think we have Sish said a great panel here you can hear different perspectives from them uh but

please what we're focusing today is not on cutting edge uh latest models. It is about trust. It is about sustainability. It is about scale, reusability. It's with those lenses in mind that we're

looking at AI. So, I hope it's a fruitful conversation and I hope you can learn something uh valuable today. Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much Samir. Um so now we

will move on to the uh panel discussion. Uh one of the things so we have our panel members. Um we have Adich Chabra from Astep Foundation. Uh Mr. Sither from Amarraati Quantum

Mission, Anusha Dandapani again from UNIC. She heads the uh AI hub at the UN. So I'll start with um Adita I'll start with you. So you are with Astep Foundation. You have deployed agentic AI

systems like Bharat Vistar and Amul Vistar directly to farmers. What does it take to make AI usable, trusted and operational at scale in rural and montilingual contexts? Thanks. Is this

audible? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Hi. So you missed Mahavistar actually which is the biggest of all which is uh which has reached 2.5 million farmers now. Right. So I think

early on when we started as well we thought of it as a distant dream you know a few hundred agriculture extension officers using it here and there will it ever scale right then we continuously

started to tweak the system uh the whole team bureaucrats bureaucrats I I'll tell you they were involved in the middle of the night on phone calls with with the entire AI team they had a much better

understanding of AI than most people would I would say towards the end of it uh by tweaking the system every little that they were accounting for every little thing that the farmer may ask.

How should it respond? What data does he need? What data does he not have? Over time, within a span of six months, we saw massive coverage, massive uh amounts of farmers just word to mouth, word of

mouth, you know, flowing through the whole flowing through all the farmers and we saw huge numbers. So now we have 2.5 billion farmers. Then the I think the challenge came as to you know the

same cost of uh cost of compute. What is the real cost of compute here? How much are we essentially uh how much are we paying for each question? How much are we paying for each conversation and the

real flip to that was when you know at step we were all discussing about what is the actual value of it. Uh so if you could also think of you know what is the value of actually going to a farmer

without AI let's say and giving him the advice that he needs giving him you know the information about a scheme some person some extension officer who's already very overworked will have to you

know travel miles and that farmer and that farmer has to communicate it right and be able to offer that advice. So also when we think about cost I think the point to think about is what is the

value that this actually bringing is there. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much. Um Anusha I want to ask you next so you have been at the UNIC for a while but you had uh worked

at financial institution Barclay before. Um so you have a very diverse background from that perspective. um how should governments evaluate AI systems and multilateral uh organizations as well?

How should they evaluate AI investments uh beyond immediate efficiency gains especially when long-term societal impact and institutional resilience are at stake? Do you have any comments?

&gt;&gt; Yeah. Um I think this is exactly the tension that we do observe um between many governments and the multilateral institutions that we are collaborating and working with that they

are also navigating today. Yeah. Um I would frame the response to your question um in three practical shifts that we do see uh that we are seeing right now. The first shift that we see

is actually moving from This is trust. Um as Samir alluded to, trust is not a break on innovation. What we see is that if we are able to adopt and accelerate by baking in making sure that we have

governance, risk assessment and also accountability baked in in the design, not having it as an afterthought. That is one of the very prime focus uh priorities of ours. And the second that

we do see is like a staged and a risk based approach. You know the approach wherein we bring in an AI sandbox kind of an infrastructure where there is low risk of you testing and making sure that

operationally you're able to adapt to AI and making sure that like this allows innovation to move quickly. This is uh you for going through the procurement activities and making sure the assurance

is in place and the safety and the guardrails that you need to have in place for an enterprise ecosystem. Uh we want to make sure that the focus of having these things with the societal

impact being high as our prime focus. And the third that we do see is the practical mechanisms of having embedding human in the loop and having clear model documentation. And what we do which we

are collaborating with most of the institutions and academic institutions is this red teaming and independent testing of these AI models. Thereby it gives not only the purposeful but also

right-sized AI models that we can bring to the fruition. So it is not just about ultimately the goal of not having the technological success but making sure that there is public value that we are

bringing uh to our stakeholders and making sure that we maintain the rights and the dignity of the human and the humanentric design of AI is what we are focused on. Yeah. Thank you very much.

So, Shrther, I have been working with you for a while now uh on uh our frugal AI lab in Amraati. So, Shr comes with the background also again from private sector. He's with the Tata Consultancy

Services, but now he's deputized to the Andra government as the mission director for Amraati Quantum Valley. So, how do you see the do you see a tension between quantum and AI? Um and how do you see

governments need to look at that from investments perspective uh from deployment perspective and scale perspective? &gt;&gt; Thank you Sish and good afternoon all

thank you for having me here. Uh great question uh Sish. Uh [snorts] so yeah so for those who are new to quantum computing I mean I just give one oh one line introduction to quantum. So

quantum significantly accelerates AI. So it provides uh uh either a quadratic speed up or exponential speed up to your AI algorithms. So which means this is another important processor that you're

going to see apart from CPU GPU you will also have QPU. So which is a new processor that is going to come. But having said that so this is also in the state of research. So there are many

problems uh which are intractable today which we cannot solve it irrespect of the amount of GPU that you add to the systems. So you need quantum computers and uh it's also important uh to invest

on this technology very early and government of India has taken a very nice initiative of national quantum mission. So which is a 6,000 cr mission that has kickstarted uh initiatives on

building the technology around centered around quantum. So this is extremely important even from the AA perspective because so just imagine all our A algorithms are getting significantly

accelerated. So some of you must be using uh a model vision models say let's say you are using unit so you can significantly accelerate that model using quantum computer

so uh so which means so we have to carefully plan our investment so instead of investing too much heavily on GPU so there might be a solution where you can bring a quantum computer and then create

a hybrid architecture so which will solve the problem right so for that from that perspective we need to start investing into these technologies and what government of Andhra Pradesh has

done is uh uh done a PPP model public private uh partnership investment on bringing uh TCS and IBM together in bringing India's first quantum machine into Amraati quantum valley. So so this

is first state-of-the-art machine that is going to come. So India has a lot of scientists who are already working on this technologies on quantum technologies and uh what we are now

aiming for is not just looking at the machine and consuming all the services uh that quantum can do. So we are now questioning so can we make this machine uh within the country. So in order to

again uh going to the theme of having this frugal systems so we need to look at the holistic perspective. So buying the box and integrating into an existing infrastructure will not give us uh that

kind of uh architecture. So we need to look at every part that goes into this machine and can we question so can we do this in India and can we manufacture this box uh from the quantum valley. So

that is what we are questioning right now and we're trying to do that and uh to do this again we also need uh skills of people. So and this is where the capacity development initiatives are

very important and uh this is where we've taken some steps uh in training large section of people on quantum technologies while good section of people are already learning AI. I think

AI is not new to many people right now but quantum is relatively new. So what we have done is we've taken training uh we've trained large section of people about in the first phase we trained

about 50,000 people uh at 500 rupees. So you can imagine so a foundation from US has come and uh trained 50,000 students uh in inher. So we again went for the second phase. So throughout the country

about two lakh students have registered for this quantum training. This is free of cost now right and now we have about 100,000 students coming from Andhra Pradesh learning this technology. uh we

are preparing uh uh the road map uh to have these skills which are required to build this next important technology and prepare for the future and while this is happening uh so there is also uh uh

opportunity to build quantum machines so with a goal of about in 2 years we should be manufacturing about 100 quantum computers from the state so that's uh the objective with which we

are working &gt;&gt; thank you sra so this is primarily a question for Adita but others can also the chip in. So one thing that we so we are in India so majority of people speak

multiple languages right and then let's say there are maybe 500 million people who call Hindi as their mother language mother tongue and then there are hundreds of millions of people who call

uh you know other languages as their mother tongue Telugu Tamil Canada Marati Bengali and so on right uh from your point of view from astep uh what are you thinking about when you are thinking

about like population scale solutions, citizencentric solutions, what governments can do with respect to deploying because large amounts of our population are also illiterate. Um so

voice- based models, multi multimodel solutions. So maybe can you talk about it? &gt;&gt; Atep I think uh see when when you say population scale you still have to look

at all the communities possible. One example of that in Maharashtra is we're looking at Bili. Bili is a tribal language written in D nagari strip very difficult very very limited data I think

I I saw ka team here as well they were involved in it a lot of the government departments were involved in this project so they collected all of this data from the grounds up they recognized

that bile there is a substantial population a few lakh people which is not small which is not a small number and they essentially started this project early on early on in the advent

of Mahavista they started collecting BI data and now we have models coming out of AI for BAT that are actually translation models speech to text model text to texttospech models so the whole

stack we we at the in the initial phases of it we were thinking of how do we integrate other tribal languages let's say and was an experiment that I I would say right now it is at a stage where

very soon Mahavistar will be able to offer tribal farmers also advice in pil so you know that is the wholesome approach that we are taking generally when it comes to languages.

&gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Um Anushia for you. So there is the AI hub at the UN. Um then uh how does it work internationally with multiple governments uh and also how does frugal

AI fit into you know you talked about AI sandboxes so experimenting piloting and all these kind of things. How does frugal AI or the concept of using scalable AI solutions with low cost low

compute kind of thing how does that come into the picture and uh what do different governments feel about uh how to utilize your AI hub? [clears throat]

&gt;&gt; Um so perhaps I can talk about what we have prioritized um as one of our strategic initiatives as part of our AI hub is investing in skills

because reskilling and upskilling of our not only our stakeholder community but also the user community that we see as a very big gap in adapting to these technologies. Yeah. So what we have done

essentially as Samu alluded to in capacity building um to bake in those skills and the institutional knowledge and how do we want to govern these AI technologies apart from capacity

building because when it comes to skilling and upskilling for an organization like ours or the institution like ours we cannot be having this oneizefits-all approach

approach. So what we did is collaborated with academic institutions like yours and are also making sure having um education partners who are not only giving us the opportunity to map the

kind of the persona needs that we have in these organizations. So what we did is instead of going with a toolbased approach, we thought this through with a curriculum that is context of the

organization and the persona of the users who are actually going to use the AI within our ecosystem to sort of get familiarized with the tools first. It's not a tool-based approach. It's more of

a skilling approach where the capacity of the individuals has the human component to it where the component of being the public sector uses or our civil society who is going to upskill

themselves. They need to understand based on a use case based approach in the sense that it's not just about how do you use the tool where can you contextually use this tool. So the the

academic training and the collaboration that we have is to make sure the content that we are sharing with these institutions is fit for purpose and the construct of the organization and the

the scale that we are operating it with the governments and also the institutions that have this need. So we are tackling the citizens first the AI citizens first approach. So that kind of

gives us the possibility of not only bringing the investing in the skills or the institutional skills but we are also embedding the tools that they can access via our AI sandbox. So it is like a kind

of a learning by doing approach is what we are um currently focused on. &gt;&gt; Thank you. So I'm going to ask a question but I'll also ask the audience to think of few questions uh later on uh

so that uh you know we could get few questions in from the audience as well. Um one of the things uh obviously is you we want to have uh in India hello we want to have in India uh the

supply chain of the quantum ecosystem. This is what you said. U so we have there is the can you talk a bit about uh the value chain for quantum that needs to be in place. So the supply chain is

one but what about the value chain and how can you know the citizens of the global south be it India be it from people from other parts of Asia, Africa or Latin America

the global south broadly uh what is it uh that can be used from Amarraati as some sort of benchmark or anything like that? Okay. So the first the supply chain part

in terms of supply chain. So each of so we have multiple options of uh making quantum computers. So we have multiple technologies that we can use to arrive at uh uh building a quantum computer. So

so there is an opportunity for us to build uh uh cryogenics semiconductors new semiconductors new materials uh new fabrication methodologies etc. So which will all help us to build uh and

and photonics as well uh which will all help us to build new quantum computers. So which will help us to solve some of the most complex problems. So now let's take at the application infrastructure.

So what we can solve? So we can solve some of these uh interactable problems in drug discovery. So today the drug discovery life cycle takes about 12 years 10 to 12 years. So we can

significantly reduce uh the time by using quantum computers. So we use AI also there AI augments plus quantum. So most of the pharma companies today use uh quantum as a baseline technology and

exploring uh these drug discovery uh life cycles. Uh similarly so the logistics optimization the supply chain optimization problems are very good. Uh so these are some things that you can uh

optimize and this is especially to the context that you mentioned about the uh technologies that are doing good for the global south. So, so you bring significant optimization capabilities uh

into the supply chains by using quantum technologies especially in logistics optimization. Uh similarly you also have uh opportunities to improvise uh uh the risk management in financial portfolios,

financial uh modeling etc. So those again will help all the uh things but the benefits of all these things will be felt by the uh people uh uh so and another interesting important point is

the energy aspect. So with data centers was talking about setting up the nuclear reactors or powering these data centers and quantum will provide that optimum. So with quantum computers you don't need

to use much of energy but can still solve the largest of the largest problems. So with all these things the benefits are going to come to the people and uh this will help help in the long

run. &gt;&gt; Thank you. So uh first uh I I'll gather some questions and &gt;&gt; hello my name is Akancha and my question is to Shr. So we know that AI is moving

at a scale and it's catching up and there are a lot of infra you know changes that are that are being that will be needed to get done when we move at scale and so will be needed when

quantum comes up. We will like even for now with PQC we have the keys where we need to make modifications to the HSM which are not cap you know compatible with the key sizes that we need for the

new algorithms. So how are we making sure that our systems which are being built for AI today will be crypto agile and quantum agile as well. &gt;&gt; Hold on to that. I'll take a few

questions and then we'll get a rapid answers from all of you. There's only six minutes left. &gt;&gt; Hello panel. My name is Karthik Badaj and my question from the whole panel is

that uh how do you see the future of the uh quantum systems for preede startups that are working on quantum machine learning and &gt;&gt; um

as making a quantum computer is super hard. What is the practice being followed for your uh government? Are you tying up with US-based companies and co-designing with them or are you

building a quantum computer for ground up? Both are fine but what is the approach? Thank you. &gt;&gt; A lot of questions for Sther but maybe others can pick up as well.

&gt;&gt; Final sorry thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. So uh we we are talking a lot about um um frugal AI or AI from the point of view of startup AI producers or the service providers. How about the

other side of the story? Startup AI users those startups who are which are using different they are into different different sectors or sunrise industries. How are they seeing AI adoption and if I

if you go by the statistics or the data or the reports the AI adoption rate is extremely low comparatively the the the talks what are going on all around the world. So what could be the factors

underlying factors from the point of view of startup users why the adoption rate is still low and how can we uh expedite it? Thank you. &gt;&gt; So um maybe that could be for you from

&gt;&gt; maybe first you can start and after the address all the quantum questions. So um I have a different experience at least from the point of view of end users from what I've seen and I can only speak

about the farmers that I've seen that they have they have really adopted it and in fact not just with with vistar even before they we were surprised to know that they were familiar with chat

GPT they were familiar with all of these tools right so I think there was some knowledge already existing what I think they struggled with initially to understand is that a voice bot is

actually a bot it is not real right so we had to add a little uh little introduction at the beginning but from what we've seen there is a significant understanding even in that part of the

population but it could be that we have not seen uh all of all of them right &gt;&gt; sure yeah so let's take the first question on PQC so yeah the postquantum cryptography is just gaining traction uh

so the standards are very new there are no frameworks or there are no frameworks for testing and evaluation per se as of Now uh but this presents a huge opportunity for all of us. If yeah if

we'll take off few jobs then postquantum cryptography will give a good amount of jobs because we need to do this migration at scale and there are regulatory requirements in some

countries. So India we have the guidelines that are framed but there are no regulatory requirements in India as such. So RBI at some point we'll put this in cyber security framework and

then that's when the Indian banks will start migrating and that's when you'll see a lot of opportunity in the country. But again taking that to AI again we will have to migrate even the AI systems

onto the postquantum cryptography as well. Uh so that will make the systems more secure. So that's a huge opportunity in front of all of us. Now coming to the quantum machine

learning for startups. So here the paradigm is little new. So the conventional AI programming methodologies will uh will so yeah whatever approach that you are taking

will help. But if you are trying to write this for quantum so you need to have a different uh uh skill and different methodology to run this on a quantum computer and uh it is very

expensive today. Uh so to access these machines it is significantly expensive and and if you hear the cost that will take to inference one image on a quantum computer. So this is super expensive as

of now. But uh there are opportunities. So you can access this smaller number of cubit machines and uh you can also run simulators on your own uh desktops and then try out some of these algorithms.

Uh value you'll see once you reach about thousand cubits. So today most of the quantum computers are in the range of about 100 to 200 kind of cubits and once we reach thousand cubits and that's when

you'll see the value and naturally when you not tell actually that time you will only start using it. So that's what you'll do. And the third question is about the supply chain of uh this

hardware whether we are making it bottoms up or we are buying it from the US. Uh so the IBM investment is uh like buying from the US. So we it's a uh it's a box that we will be accessing on the

cloud. Uh but whereas uh uh the programs that are going on in India as part of the national quantum mission so all these are uh u uh trying to make uh indigenous hardware. So every part

indigenously right so we have the quantum processor the cryogenic systems then the cables microwave amplifiers etc for a superconducting system is all made from India and we have a lot of common

manufacturing facilities that are coming from different institutes across the country like IIT Madras IIT Bombay IC Bangalore and IIT Delhi so they're setting up a lot of common

infrastructure facilities which will help us to manufacture these quantum machines so we are trying to make this grounds up from the Um two more questions. Okay.

&gt;&gt; Maybe somebody from the back. Okay. &gt;&gt; Um hi panel. This is ocean. Um the question is for sir. Um in terms of quantum computers uh currently is error correction a real problem and are we

trying to invest in it and is there an opportunity for young individuals to work uh on something which will help uh reduce the cost or reduce the compute uh required for error correction right now.

&gt;&gt; We'll also gather couple of questions and then just a moment. Yeah. So yeah my question is very straightforward and simple. What would be your advice Mr. Srther um regarding

guiding the youth of current nation towards what can they technical non-technical what should they start doing learning to be upfront in that technology that you're building

&gt;&gt; a last question. Yeah, very quick question which is when we talk about responsible and ethical AI or in this case you know frugal AI and citizen centered AI would you advocate

that the correct route route would be public private partnerships oblique United Nations multilateral bodies rather than leave it to the cowboy tech runaway uncontrolled developments in AI

Okay. And this is for everyone's one line to share. &gt;&gt; Uh I agree with you. So I'll start with that. But others can take their own. This is me uh you know on X and other

places you say these are my own personal opinions maybe not associated with Cambridge. So &gt;&gt; anybody wants to take &gt;&gt; you want to tackle it first and then

&gt;&gt; yeah. So the first any question. So the first question on error correction. So it's extremely important actually if you go and see the Fujitsu center there. So they have create they have displayed a

model quantum computer there in one of their boots. Right. So uh today's quantum computers are extremely noisy and uh they are actually built in a architecture where a group of quantum

processors are brought together and built right and uh this requires good amount of error correction and these skills are extremely important. So that is one. The second part to this one is

as you increase the number of cubits. So because these quantum processors are not very stable. So you have to handle error correction. So the number of actual cubits versus the logical cubits the

ratio is very small. So though you may have bigger number of physical cubits. So you'll have very few usable logical cubits with which you can work upon and uh the rest you need to handle with uh

error correction so that you can make use of best of this uh technology and uh your question is about whether we are working on it. Yes. So we have a very decent team working on uh this

technology and this is also the area that we need to focus upon as the quantum computers gain number of cubits. So this is a this is one of the most important skills otherwise even if

somebody gives you a very big quantum computer so you'll not be able to handle it. So that's pretty much very important skill. Now on the question of uh the path for

education so again quantum is no different. So it is an extension of uh the current AI cyber security and uh the conventional science skills uh like bio etc. Right? So what we are only trying

to do is improvising by adding significant computing capability. So which means again so as a quantum engineer what you will do is uh uh so you will benchmark your algorithm for

example you are using time series forecasting right you write this in classical AI so using one of the best state-of-the-art methods and then convert that into quantum and also

benchmark this and look for efficient result. So which means your classical skills will also get better. In fact, we have one case where customer came to us to convert the problem into quantum. But

what so what he has seen is during the process he realized that uh his own classical methods have started giving better results by applying some of the quantum principles. So uh so the point

is uh so these are not new skills these are extension skills. So we are not displacing some technology and getting a new quantum skill into our portfolio. So we have to learn all the things uh

together and then and slowly start shifting and learn using quantum computer. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Anybody want to take? &gt;&gt; So

so on quantum just quickly. So we are working uh on both QKD and PQC today in the UN on starting to re-encrypt data that is most sensitive. Uh we are intentionally looking at solutions from

all around the world. Right. uh because this is still defensive measures of encryption but when it comes to uh actual quantum computing uh you make a very good point that one we should

understand what's available today whether it's coming from IBM or from any any other large company but technology today is such a big geopolitical uh issue that I think every country that

has the wherewithal and I believe India does we need to build from the bottom of the stack so when you look at the investments that are happening in quantum around the world India is also

so at par with some of the biggest richest countries in the world in making massive quantum investments and with the frugal mindset that money could go much further in India. Uh and it starts with

education. So that's why I'm very pleased what uh Amraati quantum valley is doing and setting some very high targets to educate all of you. So step one in my opinion is you all need to go

and understand there are basic quantum courses you can take online. We have one that we launched with uh the Dutch uh called quantum delta that's available to everybody in the world for free. Start

to understand what does it mean? There are certain problems where quantum will be very powerful and others it's not so much. So understand what are those scenarios? What are the use cases? And

and just like with AI, start with what is the problem you're trying to solve? How will it help people? Who will be impacted by it? Start from that and work backwards. That would be my

recommendation to you. But as a national strategy, I'm glad India is focusing on every element of the stack starting from designing our own hardware or saying okay let's source the best that is

available today but let's start building on top of that building actual solutions scenarios uh there are known use cases like drug discovery which you spoke about uh in financial services in energy

optimization supply chain optimization so those are domains if you become business experts in that that's another angle you don't have to be a quantum engineer become domain experts in that

and then you can apply those skills as and when quantum computing gets here. And to your question about uh AI, uh I think that's the biggest lesson from what's happening in AI is that

today I'm I'm personally and again I speak as an individual uh not as the head of a UN agency. I'm very pleased that countries are in the game and when it comes to quantum because we have to

make sure that technology is designed so it's fit for purpose for different parts of the world and not pushed from one particular direction onto everybody else to say this is the latest cutting edge

thing you have to buy it otherwise you lose and oh by the way this is how much you have to pay us for it right and forget the guardrails and forget whether it's actually has uh errors or flaws or

biases so I think that's a big lesson learned so In a roundabout way, what I'm saying is even for AI today, it's the beginning of a long marathon. So there are no

winners. There might be people who look like they're winners, but it's the first round of a long marathon. So we need to invest more heavily. We need to build open source AI. We in the UN are looking

more and more at open AI, open source AI from around the world. So that that's the trajectory we should take as humanity in my opinion. Thank you. Thank you very much. So we just got a few

minutes left to wrap up. So I'm going to do some concluding remarks. So thank you very much Samir Shrther Anusha and Ala uh very honored to have you on the panel and uh in the session. Thank you all

pleasure and honor to have you all here. So one thing I'll tell you is I don't come from a AI background. I come from a innovation strategy background. So we should not leave technology to the

technologist. Yes, we need them but we need everyday people who use these technologies to have a say in how this technology is being deployed and that's how I got involved is uh how and why is

uh these kind of large language models being deployed um so if they are having come coming from you know abundance a land of abundance you know the innovation is one way but in where we

don't have abundance of these physical infrastructure resources and uh financial resources. How do you go about and do that? So that's the space I have been in. Frugal innovation was the space

I have been in. And for me, frugal AI was very natural to do because we don't have the infrastructure that US has or China has in India. But we do have talent. Uh we do have ingenious ways of

making things happen. So I believe frugal AI is the way for India and especially for the global south. Uh and with that I'll conclude the session but I'll ask for a moment that we want to

take a selfie with you. So please just a moment. Come on let's take a selfie. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you very much. Hello.
