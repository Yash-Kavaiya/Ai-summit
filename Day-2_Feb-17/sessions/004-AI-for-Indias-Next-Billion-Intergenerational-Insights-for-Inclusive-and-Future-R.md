## 📝 Summary

AI is rapidly reshaping economies, public services, and governance. As the global population 
approaches 10 billion people by the next century, the stakes are uniquely high for the countries 
across Asia and Africa that will host many of the world's next billion people. Choices made today will 
shape the lives of those young people, and determine whether AI becomes a force for shared 
prosperity and public trust, or deepens inequality and power imbalances for generations.
