## 📝 Summary

AI is rapidly reshaping economies, public services, and governance. As the global population 
approaches 10 billion people by the next century, the stakes are uniquely high for the countries 
across Asia and Africa that will host many of the world's next billion people. Choices made today will 
shape the lives of those young people, and determine whether AI becomes a force for shared 
prosperity and public trust, or deepens inequality and power imbalances for generations.

## 📝 Transcript

governments and platforms. And when harm occurs, where should accountability ultimately sit if we want AI governance to be seen as a legitimate uh governance by the people who are most affected by

it? &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. Yes, thank you very much for that. Very I see we're starting with the easy questions here.

This is my first event. Let me also very warmly thank the government of India for hosting such an already vibrant um and exciting summit and also very much for the fantastic partnership

not just on this event but on many um many areas um over the last few years on this critical topic. Um so coming to accountability I mean it is one of the features of conversations on this that

Sometimes, you know, something bad happens and we're not quite sure who to blame and something good happens and we're not really quite sure who to uh who to thank and therefore how to do it

again. So, the fact that accountability is so diffuse um across the system really can have one of two, you know, can can I think have two different consequences. can it can

be the basis for a flexible, vibrant, appropriate um way of thinking about AI which can adapt easily to the pace of this fastmoving technology. It can also of

course be a recipe for nobody taking responsibility and never knowing how to fix things when they go wrong. And which one it is is going to depends very largely on decisions that are made

in places like this in governments in companies. And I think we don't know yet which way uh the pendulum is going to swing. I think also you know we hear often that AI is a transformational

technology like the steam engine, like electricity, like many of these things. It has also a unique feature in the the extent to which the technology the innovations the diffusion of these

technologies are being driven by private sector activity rather than by the actions of government. In previous in many previous eras of technology it was state um investments and in some cases

um enterprises which were leading the roll out and therefore lines of accountability were much more straightforward because we can see um lines of techn lines of accountability

between states and citizens. This is a challenge not just AI presents us therefore not just with a technological challenge but also with a governance challenge. We are in a slightly new era

at every level at the level of global governance, national and even local governments. How to line up these various um different players to make sure that accountability sits where it

needs to sit that people can get redress when bad things happen but without stifling the innovation that that has brought us to where we are. So um I mean a few I don't have a definitive recipe

alas but um but a few I think companies need to be accountable for what they do and that accountability needs to reside outside the companies

themselves. We cannot have a situation where the behavior of companies um and the impact of companies is monitored and and governed by bodies which are set up by those companies themselves. There are

arguments that are made endlessly as to why this is necessary, but it never works. We know that time and time again. We should not let that happen. But that said, I think you know these these are

the companies which are have creating this new technology and which know it best. So they need to be involved in some way. I think coming right down to the other end of the chain, we also need

to get much better at driving accountability from users. I think we often get slightly bedazzled by new technologies and we sort of think that this is all much too complicated for us

and we have to leave this to someone else. I think it's absolutely critical that people have the confidence to demand that accountability themselves and we cannot as citizens be endlessly

passing the job onto somewhere onto somebody else. So the final point is who who is it who needs to sit between those companies of whom accountability must be demanded and those citizens who

ultimately need to be the ones where accountability ends. Well, it is governments and the public sector. And I think there is, you know, we like to think that perhaps this is a new

technology and there have to be some new answers and new things. In the end, I don't think we have any substitute for governments understanding what it is that people

want, which is not always a simple thing, and then doing their very best to deliver it. That has been the basis for democratic governments for centuries now. You know, it's a formula that works

and it's a formula that we need to apply um in this new context. I'm very aware that doing that is going to be much harder than it looks but I'm hoping that the other panelists will be able to

provide some answers on that. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much for that answer. Um I'll now shift to Mr. Khan. Under your leadership, India's G20 placed the global south at the center of global

economic conversations. This is now the first major AI summit hosted in the global south. From your vantage point, how do you think that AI can become be deployed as a genuine growth engine for

countries of the global south, including for challenges like climate action without reproducing the same concentration of power and value that earlier waves of technology did.

&gt;&gt; Uh so first of all uh uh make no mistake that this is uh a hugely transformational technology. It's going to cut across every sector is going to disrupt every single uh way of life and

therefore it's uh very very important that AI is made accessible, it's made affordable and it's made accountable. Also AI must be multilingual. uh important thing is that uh today

the way AI is evolving it's putting in a huge amount of investment vast sums are being invested uh it's leading to a huge amount of disruption but worse it'll end up

creating a highly inequal society the challenge is whether we can ensure that AI AI reaches those below poverty line vast segments of population. Whether AI can be used to transform lives of

citizens in the global south and whether AI can be used to improve learning outcomes, health outcomes, improve nutritional standards which are major challenges before the world. uh

important thing is that today we in India I mean if you look at uh open AI chat GPT we are providing more data than the United States of America 33% more data than what the United States of

America is doing these large language models are getting better and better and better on the basis of data from the global south so the models are getting refined on

data for the global south they will create business models and sell you products at very high cost tomorrow. And therefore, it's important that when India builds up or the global south

builds up its models, they are made better on their own data. That's number one. Number two, it's important that we've learned from our own digital public

infrastructure which is which enabled India to leapfrog in seven years what the bank of international settlement said India achieved 50 years of progress in seven

years. Why did it how could it do it? Because it was done because it was open source. It was open API and it was globally interoperable

and therefore today uh we do fast payment, we do stock market transaction, we do insurance, we do credit uh to the last mile on the basis of this open-source where because

we created the digital public infrastructure layer but on top of that we allowed private sector to innovate and compete in the market space and therefore my view is that there has to

be a layer of digital public identity in AI on top of which we should allow private sector to open and compete but more important than that is that as we go ahead it's important that we use AI

to transform lives of citizens in global south if we end up creating an inequal society which is I mean if you look at the United States it's not that the United States has not progressed in the

last the postw World War II era. If there's one country which has progressed and grown, it's the United States. It's accounts for 27% of the global GDP, 50% of the market cap with just 4% of the

population. But it didn't build up a safety net. And because it didn't build up a safety net, you have an inequal society. And therefore it's important that as we progress, as we grow, we use

the power of this technology really to transform lives of citizens in the global south and put in sure that this technology is used uh if it is not multilingual, it'll cut out a large

section of the population. If it is not used to the benefits of below poverty line, people below the poverty line will remain poor forever. If you're not able to use it for improving education which

is the key to improve learning outcomes and what was physically not possible is today possible because of the power of AI. The power of data enables you. The power of machine learning enables you to

achieve quantum jumps and to achieve technologically pole walting because of the power of this technology in learning outcomes and health outcomes and nutritional stunting wasting all these

are key challenges of the global south. And to my mind that is really the key. How do we use this technology to transform lives of citizens and the next billion people?

&gt;&gt; Thank you so much for so emphatically laying down the contours of how AI should be looking at creating impact which is why we are here. Um I will now shift to Dr. Gosh.

AI is increasingly being framed as a tool for climate action but at the same time it comes with its own energy, water and resource cost. So how should young countries navigate these trade-offs and

pursue AI development without undermining climate action as well? &gt;&gt; Thanks Richer and good morning to everyone. Uh on behalf of CW, let me also extend my uh warm welcome to all of

you and thank Claire and the UN Foundation for the partnership we've had for many years and also thanks to the eminent panelists here. Uh we're particularly privileged and excited to

have you here Jo and join joining our conversation. Uh Richard, the I see this as a double helix. There's a digital revolution going on and a decarbonization revolution going on at

different speeds uh with different momentum and different geographies. Um but the two have to come together. These can't be parallel tracks. These have to come together. Uh when they come

together properly, then AI becomes one more generalpurpose technology to impact another general purpose technology which in my opinion is climate action. Climate action is not

one sectoral vertical but something that can impact all sectors of your economy, improve productivity, increase resilience and deliver better jobs growth and sustainability.

AI can do that by for instance optimizing for how we use the solar radiation or the wind for better integration of renewables in the grid. It can do that by better flood

forecasting uh to save lives and livelihoods. It can do that as we'll talk of in this in in a session little later in the in the morning uh that we're organizing with Google on how it

incre in increases agricultural resilience and so forth. But equally there's a dual duality. The the data centers are significantly contingent on power demand on water demand on cooling

demand. Um and you need to then develop this infrastructure that is ready for the future not just leveraging the present. That means you need to factor in the water that will be

needed in perpetuity the energy that will be needed the land that will be needed for scaling up the connectivity that will be needed. Now as Mr. Kant was saying right now we are potentially

facing a risk that an unequal approach towards this means that the global south becomes the geography from which data is extracted um but is not extracting in return the

value that we could get. How do we flip the script? How do we make sure that the global south is not just raising its hands saying we would like a seat at the table but is able to leverage its

capabilities? Um there is uh increasingly this the Stanford University has has has found India, Singapore, the UAE are among the top 10, Brazil, South Africa and others

are in the top 20 uh in what they call the AI vibrancy index. So this is not this this desire to have a seat at the table is not a a call for you know uh altruism and charity. It is a demand

based on capabilities that we already have and that we'd like to leverage. So how do we then square these two uh circles? on one hand the need for decarbonization and on the on the other

hand extracting value through the digital and the AI revolution. I would say number one we should reject at least at a narrative and first principles level this false binary that either you

have climate action or you have an AIdriven ambition. Um secondly, we've got to have intentionality in embedding environmental sustainability in our AI strategies. Transparently measuring the

energy, the water and the life cycle footprints, incentivizing local energy efficient AI applications, collaborating to build the capacity and infrastructure in the geographies where

it makes the most optimal sense. Um and thirdly then insist on equity in global AI governance. This is what CLA was also referring to. At the end of the day while we could say this time is

different in some ways it is not. Technologies have always disrupted human society. This technology will also disrupt human society. How society then adapts to it depends on the

intentionality of the guard rails that we put in it. uh you know 3,700 years ago Hamurabi wrote his code and we all celebrate this but the Hamurabi code was not just

written by Hammurabi it was actually deriving from pre-existing traditions legal traditions customs etc that existed in the civilizations of the time so the code that we write today is not

just the AI code but the guardrails code that we write must draw from the legal traditions that exist across the world. That diversity must illuminate and inject new energy in a more equal

inclusive approach towards these two revolutions on decarbonization and digitalization. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Us back into not falling into binaries and false binaries. I will now hand over

to Selma to take this conversation further. Thank you very much. So good morning everyone. This is Salama with a global fellow for UNF. So I will I will start

my question from uh Ambassador Phillip. Um so many African countries want to leverage AI development. Uh but lack of infrastructure that ecosystem and capital uh capital uh has hindered this

experience. So from Kenya's experience, what should be uh country's priority to avoid being dependent on external AI ecosystem? &gt;&gt; Thank you so much Selma for the

question. Uh and again for the Indian government but also uh the center and UNF for for conveying this meeting. There a couple of things. One um I think of course is that [sighs] there's and I

always say it's it's a conceptual framing right. So AI is not necessarily new. is 50 plus years old. But I think it's it's the current version of it that some of us in Africa are a little bit

curious about. Um if you look at the opportunity and I think my fellow panelists have mentioned it that AI has potential for growth and transformation. But the first thing we always say is in

Africa is we have to do the unfinish business. Uh we still have to invest in connectivity. We are still the lowest connected continent in the world. We still have to invest in in energy. We

still about 600 million Africans are not connected to the grid and so as much as we have this aspirational artificial intelligence I think we need to do what we need to do and and that's largely

falls squarely on governments like ours uh but that is where also AI becomes interesting because it can actually accelerate a lot of these things whether you are provisioning for energy or

connecting unconnected populations and that's some of the use cases we're working on secondly Africa is not one country it's not homogeneous it's 54 countries and so I think our

understanding that each country heavy lift. Um what we believe is that yes talk about sovereignity but it has to be sovereignity in an era of interdependence right so countries still

need to do what they need to do in terms of what they think is sovereign you do not have to invest in everything and I think that's where we see there's a problem everybody wants to invest in

data centers we can't uh currently only 1% of global data centers are in Africa 50% are in South Africa it just means some countries will not be able to do this but then it calls upon

collaboration and sharing and that is why I think working with the Mandep and the team on the United Nations it becomes becomes interesting that global cooperation and especially regional

cooperation but also south south uh cooperation becomes important where we have to kind of see where there's shared value and we can collaborate uh and not necessarily spend money on doing

anything. So where do we start? Uh we believe in the African continent we have enough talent to do this. Uh we are still the youngest population in the world media age of 19.7. We have one 1.2

million Nigerians for example contributing to GitHub for free. 300,000 Kenyans doing it and I can I'm sure I can extrapolate including Ethiopia and so it means if we have the talent then

what is missing and I think it was mentioned here issues around access to the factories of artificial intelligence uh I think we still need differentiated pricing models around accessing AI

models right so today Kenya is the largest user of childity Kenya at $20 you can imagine so I have my colleagues paying $20 to access models And you can imagine what $20 means to

India and Kenya. It's expensive, but they're still paying for it. So I think we need a conversation around access. But is access and excellence. We just don't know how to access cheap things.

We need to access at the same level that folks are accessing. Second thing is use cases. You're accessing it for what? I do not want to use JGP to find the next Starbucks. So we need to figure out how

to ensure that our young people actually using AI for things that are of meaning, health, education, um things that are outcome. So the more we we we sort of enable folks to use these use cases is

the better. The third part of course is scaling the infrastructure and I agree we may not necessarily have all the data centers but we can scale um uh infrastructure to to the extent that it

delivers outcomes and this is why I have a sense we have collaboration and we must invest in the entire stack right so invest in data invest in compute invest in talent invest in use cases but also

invest in trust and for me trust is where the governance part is so there's not a one-size fit all in my view but I I think where we can we can collaborate is where we have use cases and use cases

enable us to to actually collaborate better because I do not think anybody here talks about I'm going to use AI in the morning or there's somebody who does who does that can I check the room

right you you you don't right so you take an Uber you're using AI you you use your email you're using AI right so so I think it's to the extent of getting folks to understand that if we do the

right investments and do the unfinished business and then just leverage of this technology in the everyday use that you do then it becomes interesting and and finally and this is where I spent a lot

of time it's leadership and it all boils down to leadership and not technology leadership the techies are fine you know but it's it's people like us who need to understand it's

ministers of finance it's minister of planning is the ministers of science the ministers of research we need to invest in AI fluency so that the leadership understands that this next general

purpose technology and its potential influence must deliver for every sector and not just the technology sector. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much uh ambassador Philip for actually mentioning about access

collabor regional collaboration more than the regional collaboration but also south collaboration and leadership. So I will go to uh his his excellency uh Amand for the next question. uh you have

seen this system from both uh sides as a carrier uh bureaucrat and now as a shaper of global AI uh governance. How should how should young countries like India and other countries uh resolve the

tension between regulation and innovation without freezing delivery? Uh also in line with that question uh why do global system uh still struggle to hold speed, legitimacy and

accountability together when it comes to technology? &gt;&gt; Thank you very much Salma and thank you for the organizers for this invitation. Uh great to be uh with the esteemed

panelists uh uh this morning. Now the real tension is not between regulation and innovation. The real tension in my mind is between the halves and the have nots in terms of the AI opportunity. So

Arunaba was talking about another false binary. So this is a false binary between regulation and innovation. Uh in fact the right guard rails um can help advance innovation. Now let's reflect

for a moment because we are in this u uh discussion today with young people. So we have this moment where AI is growing uh its capacities its power its adoption is diffusing and at the same time you

have the next billion in a sense coming of age and ready to shape the world. So we have to ensure that you know just like we spoke of those two twin that twin transition decarbonization and

digitalization. So this demographic transition and the AI transition they work uh together. So that's the big context uh uh for uh for me at the end of the day uh all technologies that have

shaped societies through these waves of industrial revolutions or waves of general purpose technologies um uh they are about power uh so how that power diffuses who holds that power what's

that power used for so again useful to keep that in mind now you your question about how can young countries like Kenya, like South Africa, Phil mentioned the median age in Africa,

the median age in India is higher but not that that high. So how can they resolve this tension without freezing uh delivery? So let's remember that the AI that we're dealing with is not a

traditional product. You cannot have a static governance of it that you get a one-time code an OTP and then you punch it in and there you are. Uh these systems learn they adapt to context. Uh

the users uh the interaction between the system users that also shifts over time. So we have to be dynamic and agile in terms of our governance approaches. So higher impact use cases that will have

consequences like life and debt decisions uh or you know systems that are hooked up to financial markets. They would require higher oversight, mandate mandatory testing for flaws and

vulnerabilities uh clear accountability, human oversight. Whereas you know other use cases uh with low risk you know experimentation should be the default u

setting. So this is the way to avoid stifling innovation uh while protecting uh people and uh Shri Amitab Kanji spoke of this very important idea of having a safety net you know in countries like

India and Kenya it's very important to have that that approach. The second point is uh there was a reference earlier to digital public infrastructure. So the with AI also we

should build shared rails uh and we should not regulate in silos. So this means uh um uh interoperability open standards and this is the way to dramatically lower costs and accelerate

diffusion without limiting innovation. And the third point and this is very important and Phil hinted at that and that's investment in capacity. capacity to govern, capacity to adopt uh AI in

context. So it's not only about codes and laws and committees and so on. It's about the capacity to absorb AI to govern um AI because unequal capacity would lead to unequal uh uh outcomes and

greater inequality. Now I I want to close by speaking a little bit about what is happening at the uh the UN. There is a pillared approach, threepronged approach u built around the

science of AI, the policy side, the governance side um and the capacity issue. So across science, policy and capacity, we are moving with a strategic mindset following the decisions taken by

member states at the global digital compact and you know we are also informed by history. The world has tactical electricity, uh nuclear energy, civil aviation, the internet uh and uh

where we've seen innovation outpace governance. So we are bringing in a bit of let's say agility a bit of foresight to the looming AI governance challenges particularly through the science panel

which for Aronoba would recall the IPCC approach but more iterative done by a smaller group of interdicciplinary experts who were approved by the general assembly uh last uh week. So on the

dialogue it's very important u that this summit is a very very important moment first time in the global sum uh south now this summit will help us transition to an inclusive dialogue in July where

all 193 countries have a seat at the table and in a stable manner. So it's a regular dialogue everyone comes together regularly to share experiences lessons learned best practices what to what to

avoid because without this coordination uh without this cooperation adoption costs will stay high and accountability gaps can uh widen. So this is why I think uh the questions around speed,

legitimacy and accountability lead us to the inclusive settings that are being put together. Now I'll conclude by saying that AI governance at last will be shaped by those who are going to be

the most affected uh by AI which means uh this younger generation. So without this intergenerational design intergenerational approach we are not going to be able to shape uh an

empowering uh AI future. If today's inequalities continue into that era and we end up with a Kh shaped economy more of a K-shaped economy more of a K-shaped society then you know we would have

failed. So young people should not be passengers in this story they should be actively shaping the outcome so that we can bend these two uh legs of the K and build a more equal world. Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Thank you very much uh Amanda for the answer. I wanted to echo the point that was mentioned regarding capacity and outcome. Unequal capacity will lead to unequal outcome. So we need to work on

the capacity aspect as well. So lastly uh I will go to uh Safia. So we have talked about AI governance for so long. So let's talk about what it means to what it means uh when we say responsible

AI. So as AI scales across sectors uh millions of people in young countries will encounter it not as user but as a worker inside its supply chain. From your perspective and experience working

with uh communities and workers, what does responsible AI looks like from the perspective of those workers? &gt;&gt; Thank you so much Salawit for that question. Um I'm very happy to see that

we are bringing the conversation um back to the workforce and I also want to really thank Ced and UNF for this excellent panel. So I think there's a few words that my uh panelists have

shared here today that really brings to the core of this question. Those words are accountability, being multilingual, excellence, and fundamentally trust. I think one of the things where I want to

start is by reframing how we actually think about those that are currently at the bottom of the AI pyramid. those who are in the invisible aspect of the AI value chain and that is often the

workers. In fact, the global south but India and specifically India, Kenya, Uganda and the Philippines are the four countries that have some of the most amount of AI workers than anywhere else

in the world. These are the workforces that are actually building, annotating, and evaluating the models that we have today. And it's within this value chain that we actually need to make

improvements and changes so that we can actually see AI becoming a power for actually upliftment and catalyzing everyone rather than just unfortunately what I feel it is right now centered on

those who speak English and those who are in the global north. So I think when we think about the value chain I actually want to talk about four aspects. First you have the aspect of

labor. How is the labor actually defined? How are those workers treated? What is their contribution and how is that contribution valued? Do we pay fair wages to those people that are a part of

our digital economy? Are we allowing them to engage in fundamentally safe work? Because I'm sure as a lot of you know a lot of the work that happens around AI is around moderation and that

is a very psychologically difficult task. If it is that task, do we have the right guard rails in place? Do we have more than just saying I will give you a little bit of money if you want to go to

a therapist? Do we have real support? Do we have dignity? Right? I think this is something we often forget about in the workplace, especially when we talk about the informal sector. But I think we need

to bring all of the positive tenants that we have from white collar jobs to this informal or currently informal economy to say what does dignity actually mean in the workplace. What

does it mean to show up for work to annotate the models that we are using every day and come out of that day with something more than just a check? And finally, how can we ensure that there is

actually knowledge in this value chain? It is extractive if we're only thinking about our youth and our workers as simply workers. We need to actually empower them with knowledge and skills

about AI so that they are able to do more with what they have learned so that they're able to actually progress and move out of the value chain or move up the value chain. So I think labor is one

of the most important foundations. Second to labor is about data, right? Is the data that we are building our models on act actually actually inclusive and is it taking into account the lived

realities of so many of the people that we have in the world I mean even though a lot of the data workers that we have are in India are in Kenya they are being forced to do work that is very centered

right on an English-speaking world they are not actually contributing their own knowledge and lived realities and to Amitabs's point if we actually want to have a AI system that is inclusive. We

have to have at the data level data sets that are multilingual, that are contextual and that are culturally grounded because otherwise at best you'll just have a very fancy system

that can maybe speak your language but probably wrong. And then of course we need to build models intentionally. I know vibe coding is a big thing that we all think about today, but that is not

how you create an AI world that is fundamentally more inclusive. Every aspect of model building needs to be intentional. And then finally, we cannot stop at building. We need to think about

evaluations and who evaluates. It is not simply enough to have a doctor evaluate the veracity of a medical chatbot. We also need to understand if the Asha worker is able to interact with that bot

in VHP in her local language. We need to make sure that everyone is able to understand the language and the outputs that are there not simply because they are technically correct. So I think if

we really want to create an AI future that works for everyone, we need to create this feedback loop from labor to data to models to evaluation and make sure that everyone in our community not

just those who are at the top of the value chain are actually having a voice to discuss. We need to make sure that fundamentally this isn't extracted. And I think at Karia, which is the

organization that I run, this is something we've been trying to do a lot. And I think I'll close with just giving an example of what can happen if you decide to actually center communities.

So over the past two years, we've actually been working um with the support of the Gates Foundation to engage 20,000 women across six different language communities in India to answer

the question, what does it take to tag and flag gender bias in your languages? And we started from a very fundamental point, an understanding that gender bias as a word is something that is English.

And we actually don't have ways to define this as is in any of our Indian languages. And so we had to start with actions of collective community engagement to actually build those

definitions with those women. We then were able to take that to actually build a framework to flag and tag gender bias that specifically speaks to the types of gender bias that we see in our languages

today. And what I think is a very interesting way of showing this is that most gender bias, you know, when you speak about in Indian lang in English languages, it's around profession, it's

around occupation. But when we worked with these 20,000 women, what we learned is that for them it was actually a lot more about uh community, about personality, about emotions. And while

this is a slight difference, it is a critical difference because it means that without addressing this, we are building models that aren't addressing the core lived experiences of people on

the ground. So I think I just want to close by saying we need to really think about how do we think about ownership differently and creating ownership across that value chain so that we don't

actually leave behind those that are pro probably our most important builders, right? How do we actually make AI work for everyone? &gt;&gt; Thank you very much. So I will now hand

over to Kunalika for some qu question and answer segment. Thank you everyone. &gt;&gt; Thank you everyone and thank you to our speakers for helping us stay on time. We do have time to maybe take two to three

questions. I'll be taking them collectively. So please if you could raise your hand. Okay. Do we have mics to go around? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Uh maybe two questions from there

and two questions from the other side. If you could introduce yourself with just your name, your question and if it's addressed to a specific panelist and their name also.

&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a DH Gupta. My question is to be a AI is being destructive to become a constructive to the young one. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Hello sir and good evening. Uh good uh

good morning everyone. Sorry. Uh my name is Rupesh and question is we already have crypto, we already have dark web and now we have AI. So how we are going to deal with cyber crime especially in

multinational level. &gt;&gt; Um if you could give it to her. &gt;&gt; Hi Yogini. I have a question for Mr. Gosh. Uh so uh Mr. Gosh, what are the green technologies or what are the

decarbonization technologies you see becoming more and more prominent and important especially for the global south as all the uh energy requirements and water uh usage requirements uh also

sort of start appearing in perpetual. &gt;&gt; One final question right there. at the end and then we'll go to the speakers. &gt;&gt; Uh hello sir, hello ma'am. I'm Suti Shawasu and uh my question towards the

panel is uh uh India has a vast uh diversity and we have a very glorious past. So I would like to ask the panelists that how can we integrate this process uh like how can we use it for

the indicance uh how can we use AI in the process. Thank you. Just one 10 seconds. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Uh I'm Vandana. I work with

senior citizens and um with the growing um you know life expectancy we are going to have a very big cohort which is older. they have a lot of uh value to add but we are viewing them as a

non-productive sector you know in terms of how they can contribute to the AI revolution so I just wanted to ask the panel if there is any intervention that is happening in this area

&gt;&gt; right thank you very much we'll close the questions here move over to the panel uh I'll allow one minute perhaps to everyone um starting with Shriab Kant and then

&gt;&gt; let me start with the question start with the question that uh the the very young lady wander asked about senior citizens. You know, I'm a senior citizen myself. Uh you know, I'm

uh uh I'm quite I'm nearing 70. I got on to I got onto Claude and I started learning coding myself and Claude has become a way of life for me. uh every single speech that I prepare I give my

talking points and I get them refined uh every intervention that I make uh my daily preparations of what I need to do for the day it's all done using clot today so I've done it at my age of 70

today so my suggestion is that it'll uh in terms of improving your health improving what I want to do for exercise what I want to eat everything can be uh done using the power of AI So uh it's

very important that people like you really you know to the senior citizens help them teach them this power of AI can really improve the quality of life of these citizens uh to the to the young

lady there about uh civilization and she has a very important point because if we do not use the power of our own data if we don't use our own history our own civilization

uh it'll be nuke took neoc colonization in reverse you know we'll again become colonized on the basis of model I mean we should understand what's happening in the world we are talking about 50 60,000

latest GPUs to drive India AI mission uh the open AI deal with Nvidia is for 11 gawatt of power that is close to about 5 million 5 million GPUs driving that so look at the power computing power which

is being used there but what is important is that can we use sophisticated software where India excels and limited computing power limited computing power with with much

greater better software to excel and it's important to understand that the the f the winner in a technology race is never the the first person who breaks it you know you look at the history of

technology uh Clive Osbbor did the first laptop top but the war the the battle for laptop was not won by Clive Osborne it was won by Apple Alta Vista did the first internet Alta Vista went bust but

it was Google which won the race so my view is that India has the data India has the talent without the talent there can't be AI without the data you can't refine models and therefore India must

use its data it is talent and spread out computing power to its citizens so that we can benefit from this power. This is a transformational technology. Make no mistake. It'll transform the lives of

citizens. It'll transform India. And therefore, we must use the power of our own talent and our own data to use our own history, our own civilization. We're building 10 large language models. We

are opening up our data through our AI coach. We are providing computing power to our startups and to our researchers at much lower cost. And I think what we should do is really build the guard

rail, do what we've done. We should be DPI digital public infrastructure for AI and create an alternative model for the rest of the world. [applause]

Thank you. Um, lots of very tempting questions there, but in the interest of time, um, let me just come back to the the first question. um that also referred to crypto and the the dark web.

Um I mean I think I'm not going to address any specific points about crypto but I think you know one of the challenges that we're facing today is not just any individual technology be

that AI or anything else but the way in which they inter intersect and build on each other and if we look for example at what happened a few weeks ago with the changes to Grock and the sudden the sort

of new facilities that were you know the the new capabilities that were added to Grock that allowed all kinds of abuse to go on. Part of the reason why that was so destructive is because of the

intersection there between the AI tool and the social media platforms on which the that tool um was diffused. So I think you know one of the things to look for here is not just any single

technology but the way in which these different technologies intersect and the specific challenges that that poses. I I'll just pick up the question about children. I think onethird of the data

is being generated today by children and you have unique challenges with AI shaping uh play learning and social interactions all three and the unique challenge that's foremost for us at the

UN is how do you translate the international norms the CRC for example child rights convention into practical guidance uh design considerations and accountability. So I think this has to

be a key focus and I'm very happy that India has prioritized this theme for this summit you know we'll have uh a discussion longer discussion on this on 20th but I think when we look at the

elderly that's of course and and women and young girls but we also need to keep this demographic in mind uh because uh the potential for empowerment is huge but also the potential for harm is

stupendous we already see some early signs of harm, some tragedies, and we need to make sure that young people are not forced down uh a slope of cognitive decline, further destruction,

issues around not just safety and protection of rights, but well-being. Thank you. And thank you to the foundation and the council for bringing us together.

a quick on the environment. So for the first time ever, there's a UN resolution that we we sort of pushed through the UN in December on environmental sustainability of artificial

intelligence systems. So I think it'll be useful for you to coordinate with us and the United Nations environmental program because we are doing for the first time a stock take a global stock

take on technologies that are you know that are sort of energy efficient but also we also coming up with standards and evaluation mechanisms for data centers, water, cooling. So I think it's

the first year. Hopefully by December we'll have something but it's a collaborative effort. Hopefully you can connect with us. &gt;&gt; I think I'll just close with saying

something very uh quick on the point around AI and youth. I think uh we need to realize that this is the time where youth can be both sides of the co the coin. they can not only be the most

excellent builders of the AI models that we have and the data sets that we that we use, but they can also be the ones that can reap the most benefit. So I think it's really important to open up

the conversation and in fact not just have them in rooms like this, not just have them uh at the higher levels but have them within South South collaboration, have them within

countries across countries so that we don't continue to build without their foresight in mind. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. Before we move to the final question, I would also like to

thank uh the USG for his time today. I know he has to leave a little early. So, thank you so much for joining us. I'll hand over to Vishal now for the final. &gt;&gt; Thank you. I'll be uh quick. I think I

just want to pick up on the question ma'am asked about sustainability of data centers. So my question to you Arnaba is uh uh like what is the how do you understand the frugal AI framing that

the economic survey and the and this summit itself uh also is uh uh focusing on is do you think it's a reaction to like resource constraints that global south countries are operating in or is

it like a sustainability framing that we should be looking towards thank you &gt;&gt; I think the answer is the latter all all countries operate under resource constraints the question is whether you

are intentional about recognizing them or not. I think what my interpretation of frugal AI is it's optimal AI. It's optimized for resources, optimized for use cases, optimized for places,

optimized for choke points. Only then you will get a model that's actually fit for purpose. And to your question, Yogani um we've in in our uh report, we've looked at different cooling

technologies. These aircooled technologies use less water but more energy. Water-based technologies use more water but less less energy etc. We have to solve for this uh and that's why

CW and systemic have put together a report on scaling India's data center ecosystem and I request all the panelists just to hold this up as we release this report.

There we go. I'll probably read it online. See you later. Super.
