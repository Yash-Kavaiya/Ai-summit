## 📝 Transcript

world. I myself have seen this operate in countries like Ethiopia which is a low lowincome country and I've seen it operate on uh um uh really empower primary healthcare workers. But let's

talk about India. India does some of these things already at scale. AI enabled TB screening tools are helping increase case detection and reduce adverse outcomes. And this is very

important because of the very high burden of TB in India. Let me talk about Inenics which is a biotech company and which is using its deep knowledge of human biology to improve the

effectiveness of drug trials and develop new drugs and therapies. These are just a few examples of things that are already happening in this space. The second point I want to make is that

the likely outcome of using these technologies is not mass displacement of workers but job transformation and job creation. It transforms the work of those who are who are working already

and it creates jobs in the whole value chain that is associated with these technologies. Now let me come to my point about India. Um uh I maybe I'm I'm preaching to the

converted but India has a distinctive position in this global landscape. Digital public infrastructure um provides a foundation for embedding AI at population scale. India has a very

active AI health car healthcare market already. It's not only trying to develop frontier models as I said it's it's it's developing promising use cases for low technology environments and this is

where there is huge potential to scale and there's a vibrant startup ecosystem which is driving innovation. So at the World Bank Group in the work that we're doing we want to partner as I

said with India but we also want to learn and that is where this this panel is so important. We want to learn about uh how scaling can happen and scaling cannot happen without the emphasis on

narrowing inequality and reaching a wider population. It cannot happen without skilling people and and developing the institutions which will allow AI to function effectively. It

cannot happen without financing models and governance frameworks. I hope that this distinguished panel will elaborate on these points further. Thank you for your attention.

&gt;&gt; Thank you Ma. Thank you for reminding us of the role of AI as a UHC universal health coverage accelerator and the importance of AI for enhancing equity and resilience in health systems and

more import most importantly the unique role that India has to play as a global learning platform. I would now like to welcome our high level panel to discuss and debate some

of these issues. Bios are on the screen will appear on the screen. Um starting with um Gita Mangjanat CEO and founder Narami Health analytics analytics. Dr. Gita Mangjanat is founder CEO and CTO of

Namay Health Analytics a gold medalist with a PhD from the India Institute of Science Bengalaru and management training at Kellogg Chicago. She has over 30 years of experience in IT

Innovation. She holds over 50 US US passions and has received numerous awards including the CSI gold medal, the BRACK winner award 2018, Forbes top 20 self-made women and women entrepreneur

of the year 2020 by biospectrum India. We then have Kala Badiji, executive director and head global development center seaman's health and ears. Kala leads technology teams in

India and Slovakia with DC India as a company's largest tech hub outside of Germany. She was a NAS NASCOM executive council member from 2025 to 2027, an active industry leader bridging IT and

healthcare and a strong advocate for women leaders in tech. With over 28 years of experience, she focuses on using digital transformation to expand quality health care, especially for

underserved populations. Moving on to Prammode Varma. Proo is co-founder and chief architect of networks for humanity. Building open interoperable digital infrastructure for the AIdriven

economy. It's trying to read it. [laughter] For over 15 years, he's been the chief architect of one of India's major digital public infrastructure including

AAR, UP, DJ Lock, Digilocka and so on. Pritha Reddi, executive vice chairman, Apollo Hospitals Enterprise Limited. Prithther has led India's first JCI

accredititation and helped establish NABH standards advancing quality and sustainable healthcare. She also guides NAT health, the international hospital federation and serves on the World

Bank's high level advisory council for skilling and jobs. She was named among Fortune Asia's 100 most powerful women in 2024 and 2025. [applause]

Kiran Baska, Joint Secretary and Mission Director, ABDM National Health Authority. Kieran leads the implementation of the Aishman Barath Praan Mantri Janarogi Yoja and the

Aishman Barath digital mission. He holds a computer science degree from IT Bombay and a master's in public administration from Harvard Kennedy School. And last but not least, Karthik Arapa,

regional adviser AI and digital health, WHRO. Dr. Trappa is a physician scientist and digital health leader with over 20 years of impact across government and global

institutions. An IAS officer, he served as health and IT secretary in Punjab where he launched national firsts in blockchainbased health recruitment, population scale AI valuations, fraud

detection and large scale digit digitization of primary care. So welcome everyone. All right. So the focus of the first round is what has worked at scale and

why. I'd like to encourage you all to to keep your interventions to two to three minutes in order to allow time for more rounds and questions from the audience. Okay. So Gita, starting with you, there

is no shortage of AI pilots in health. Which innovations have truly moved to scale and improved outcomes and why did they succeed while others failed or stalled?

Okay. Um, again thanks a lot uh for inviting me to be uh to this elite panel I would say and a very very interesting topic uh to discuss and excellent audience. Um

from my perspective of course there's lot more to do. I wouldn't say it's worked already. I think there's a lot more for each but uh the best uh some of the best cases I know where AI has been

used effectively. And just sort of you know to set the context a little bit more is like AI in healthcare can be used uh at broad level uh in two categories right so one where um it is

helping improve the operational efficiency making things faster making experience better resource utilization better so the nonclinical usage angle of it and second is where AI in healthcare

is using and helping as uh ma'am mentioned before um making healthcare workers and doctors uh make clinical decisions much better, faster and uh at the right time and the you know right

place. So essentially the clinical decision support systems. So uh my focus is on CDSS and in that space I would say where AI uh some of the examples would be like for example cure.ai AI, you

know, where they're using AI on X-rays uh to basically uh chest X-rays to figure out uh TB, potential lung cancer and so on. That's there. And second, of course, we are trying to make uh some

Mickey steps, but we have actually sort of made an impact on 100 400,000 women. Uh this is on AI on breast cancer screening at Mirami. We call it Miram.ai AI as well where um uh we use AI on uh

thermal scans uh to detect breast cancer um uh triaging at least immediately and also generate detailed report for women who are at high risk. So these uh can be used uh by health workers and so on.

There are also use cases for example with uh eye usage like AI with for diabetic retinopathy and uh and related uh diseases you know remedy for example is doing forest is doing these are some

startup le activities and I also um bigger organizations like seammens phillips are also working on how to use AI in this but when you talk about grassroot levels u some of the things

that we need to be focused on is um um how do these these tools uh work in the hands of the real healthcare workers you know so the literacy levels the the IT savviness is like really just to give a

specific uh case in point right uh we initially developed this AI based breast screening where there's of just click click click the photos will be taken and automatically these will get uh uh you

know analyzed to generate a red yellow green uh there were a lot of protocol errors that uh these girls and health workers were So we had to even innovate to figure out and make sure that the

protocol is followed. So now when they take an image ah yeah it's it's kind of it should have been 45° you have done like you have missed one whole view something like that right so it was

immediately using deep learning and was again another one of the patents again uh we've actually been able to immediately give corrections guidance and then working in offline mode I think

um mandi already mentioned that so that's very very important how do we make that work and most importantly I think ensuring that it works works from a clinical accuracy standpoint having uh

you know good clinical validation not just in the hospitals uh but also in the field uh with the intended users and intended uh you know beneficiaries is very very important and there I think uh

you know I had the pleasure of working with Dr. Araasurer for a very large scale study in Punjab you know where we got a lot of insights we improved etc. Happy to share more as we as we go.

&gt;&gt; Yes very important points there. So moving on to you Kella um globally which AI enabled innovations have most effectively improved health outcomes and how can these lessons be applied in

India's diverse and complex healthcape. &gt;&gt; Thank you Aerna. Um that's a very pertinent question. So listening to mash she covered what is the challenge that we are facing in the world right 4.6

billion okay about 50% of the population do not have access to basic healthcare and there is financial constraints etc right and at the same time there is a projection of shortage of 10 thou 10

million uh uh doctors or care providers by the end of 2030. So all this is making it much more complex. Now um if you look at what companies are doing they're taking this as um a guardrail

like you know to come up with innovations which really matter and also take care of the regional fragmentation which is very pertinent in India. So given this like um I would like to touch

upon like you know what are the strongest what drives strongest outcome. Um this is when you have to understand what really works right it is not a solution which on top of what is

happening but really understanding the care continuum especially if you look at where the world is moving the focus is shifting towards non-com communicable diseases okay so this is where the shift

is happening from um basically treating a patient once right uh to care continum where you have to start from like you know early detection to followup to referral like you know all the things

has to happen so for that We have to strengthen the complete care pathways. So an AI which is going to be embedded in this complete care pathways is something which is going to work. So now

referring to what we do at seaman's healthiness right our purpose is to see how we can bring breakthrough innovation in healthcare for everyone everywhere sustainably. It touches upon all the

points that ma mentioned. So let me look at key areas right where the strongest outcomes are looked at. Okay, one is about uh the imaging. How can you bring standardization when you're imaging?

Because when you go to the hospital, the first thing that they do is some kind of a scam. So how can you improve the standardization of imaging? So second is decision support. How can you augment

the decision support? All of them spoke about that. And the third one is expanding the access. So when when it comes to um imaging standardization, I'll take an example. Um this is called

my exam companion. Okay. So this is where like you know you have the software which is going the AI enabled software which is going to help with standardizing the scan so that like you

know you can go faster when it comes to diagnosis and then thereby the care. Second is about the decision support. I'll give you example of AI rad companion where it helps the radiologist

to plan faster and it'll bring out the abnormalities and helps the radiologist or the oncologist to plan faster to look at the contouring and then see how the therapy can be addressed going forward.

So and the third one is expanding access. So there's a huge difference between the rural and urban right we don't have as many specialists in the rural areas. So we have solution like

you know uh this is called single virtual cockpit where it allows the expert to connect remotely and guide the people on the other side to get to the outcomes. So in essence I would say

something which is going to augment the clinicians and help to get to the results faster embed in the workflow so that the diagnosis can be done faster and then finally look at scaling it. So

this is where we can get the best outcomes. Right. The recipe for success. So moving to you promote um having built one of the world's largest digital identity

systems, where do you see AI making the biggest impact on health outcomes and what lessons from ADAR can guide its responsible deployment? &gt;&gt; I am the only non-healthcare person on

this panel I think. Oh you too. Okay. All right. that at least by role you are you have NHA running under you. So um I don't even have a role so it's pretty easy for me to answer what I think what

we should then and I'm part of the NHA ABDM team as well. So part of the journey is that we will never have enough of doctors and specialists we will for 1.4 4 billion people. So we

just seriously screwed. And I I think we cannot look for a better horse argument. You know, we can't say let's improve it, improve it, digitize it, digitize it. We have to completely reimagine, you know,

it's not the horse at all and maybe automo or something else. And that is where digit is coming into play. And what was the learning from DPI journey, not other dig

people UK world's largest payment system now I mean these have shown few things one you cannot imagine solution you cannot take a solution approach because a country like us with extreme

diversity and scale requires thousands of solutions and thousands of innovators and thousands of workflows and fine-tuning contextualization to happen So very common mistake that we

make is that let's go to the state and fund a digitization project. Absolutely terrible thing to do because you are assuming that in one year you will find a solution is going to last in the next

five years. You're going to be how many are going to be outdated. So what you what is that we learned is that you should separate the infrastructure what is a fabric below which is minimal

empowering but not actually solution and allow a flourishing a forest view rather than a you know garden view you know it's not like you're creating exactly the way you want. This is very key

because it allows innovators and private sectors to continuous to quest push for that workflow. And what works at scale is very different from scaling what works. This is the second mistake we

make. We think we can try this out in a village work very well. Two more villages work very well and let's try 600,000 villages and the whole thing falls apart. So what works at scale? You

have to define different from scaling what works. I think this is a learning we got from DPI. Well, I think we we might have laid the right foundation. He'll speak more about it. But it's all

about distributing the ability to solve, not solving. &gt;&gt; Great. Thank you. So moving to you already

and how do you see this evolving as well as in your hospitals? &gt;&gt; Thank you. um you know after promot's level and depth of what he's done this is a little bit basic but I'm just going

to attempt that uh we have you know from AI and health there are two ecosystems one is the internal which is you know day-to-day hospitals we walk the rounds and what we do deal with patients and

the other one is the external and both AI can impact tremendously on the external we've got you know educating people not not enough doctors, not enough healthare workers and there it

can play a a large role. it can do in screening like you know what she has done with Nami and multiple options which are already happening which again we need to just scale and and I'm sure

it'll happen including what the Asha workers which the government's doing with the Asha workers but what I'm excited about is what is happening on the hospital floors and there are two

three examples one is you know we run large uh ICUs not only us but many health care systems And today AI can actually predict the onset of sepsis. And to me that is lifesaving and

pathbreaking. And it's something which we have done which we are working and if we can scale that you know within our system we have about 2,000 ICU beds network them get together use AI to

predict onset of sepsis and this is now real and happening and then scale it up to about 10,000 beds and be able to not only give it to our own country in India but be able to do it for the rest of the

world. I think that is going to make a huge difference for me. gediatric care gediatric population you know there's a large population AI can actually predict falls or predict their nutrition levels

where they get into problems multiple options which are already in place again it's about scaling and we need all the help we can to be able to scale it to those levels the third one is the drug

interactions you know typically drugs are given to people for multiple you know they're multiple specialists they're given drugs but it doesn't come together for drug drug interactions and

we have seen with research that AI is a great tool to be able to see that one is it cut down cuts down the amount of drugs required for a person then cost economic impact but it also cuts down

the interaction of drugs which can actually have a huge impact on your health. So I think these are the things which excite me about uh AI can do for us.

&gt;&gt; Thank you for that. Kieran, what role do partnerships with the private sector play in accelerating AIdriven health solutions? And how do

you align innovation incentives with public health priorities? &gt;&gt; Thank you very much. Um, no, no, it's okay. I I'll combine both

&gt;&gt; because I read both. So uh you started with a very good imagery of imagine a village where there is a pregnant woman and and so on. I mean we are in Delhi we don't have to

imagine 2 hours in any direction we can see it and if you are in Madhya Pradesh where where my carter is that 2 hours converts to 20 minutes. So the problem is there the work to be done is out

there and uh thanks to the approach and the rails that the pioneering efforts of people like promote Dr. Aes Sharma and and others who have laid down the rails of the digital mission where the the

systems that are required for building uh a digital ecosystem at scale have been laid. Now our effort is to take it to the next level. You know when people say that okay we are there in the AI

world or we are an IT power I always think we don't own an operating system we don't even own a mobile operating system we don't have even have our own distribution platform so at least

we should build our own models the foundational models that can take that that understand our priorities that can understand our requirements and we are able to achieve that. So therefore under

ABDM we continue this approach the DPI approach of building foundational models building the foundational architecture that is necessary to make sure that both the public and the private sector

prosper while we provide and and cater for the health requirements of our country and the partnership approach here is very very important and this is where building the ecosystem. Yesterday

we had a very interesting panel where the CEO of NHA stressed about how important it is to create ecosystems where the state governments which are actually the implementing authorities,

our academic institutions which where the technological uh innovation and technological knowledge relies and the private sector come together where we have clear pathways and that is the

effort that NHA under the direction of the ministry of health and family welfare is going to take is to lay down a clear pathway way from lab to pilot to scale because and yesterday Dr. Dr. Dr.

Mangjunath very clearly said you know there is a lot of knowledge gap there is a lot of information gap that is between the private sector and what the government is doing and this is what we

would like to bridge and then the second is to make sure that AI works at every level and every uh every stakeholder of the health sector the patient how do you make sure that there are enough use

cases there are enough uses for them to embrace AI through let's say a public personal health record application or providing them the kind of support that is required Some examples have already

given by being given by the speakers for the workforce for how does AI help an asha worker do her work efficiently. It is not about adding another portal. It is not about adding another work another

thing to her and increasing her cognitive burden but instead we should make it a part of our workflow. So that is how we we would like to take it forward and then as a standard setter or

a as a regulator or an enabler as a catalyst we were we are working with we haveus now with IAC Bangalore IIT Kpur today in fact we are unveiling the strategy for AI for healthcare for

India. So that should set the tone for how we would want to take AI ahead uh in healthcare and we are also releasing the platform for benchmarking AI solutions today. So that is another effort. So

these are efforts where we are trying to strengthen the regulatory apparatus, strengthen our workforce and also create that enabling environment by following one mantra innovation over restraint

with safety and ethical use in mind. So this is the main thing and lastly I want you to leave with another imagery. All of some of you might have seen interstellar

that drone he captures it's an Indian drone he says. So even Christopher Nolan believes that we can build intelligent AI system automat automatic systems. So we will definitely

do it. We will definitely build our own foundational models and that is what ABDM will strive for going forward. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you Karen [applause and cheering]

and thank you for answering two questions in one. So finally to you Karthik you were telling us earlier you wear both a WHO hat and a government of India hat but what evidence does who see

so far that AI deployments in health systems are improving health outcomes not just efficiency and where are the biggest gaps in proof what transformative directions do we

expect from India's AI in health strategy &gt;&gt; thank you Aerna it's it's it's an absolute pleasure to be here with the World Bank colleagues here and

uh it's my pleasure also to actually address some of the wonderful comments that I've heard on foundations that promote talked about and uh the optimism that Kiran talked about with what India

can essentially do but in terms of the evidence that we see on AI deployment uh what we see globally is a lot of evidence that is emerging from AI in the research control settings but then as

you move from the lab to the bedside essentially all those applications with our evidence-based are essentially not moving into clinical environment. So it's essentially a translation of about

just hund out of every hundred what studies indicate is just about 20% of them really reach clinical environment and then from clinical environment that gets scaled at the population level are

just about 10% of that. So while it's and that's primarily because what promote essentially talked about how do you scale what works is not something the recipe of that in AI is

essentially not very clear to countries. So the foundations of standards, auditability, regulation, governance, these are essentially what does right. So as a standard setting organization,

this is these are essentially the backbone and the foundation that you need if AI truly has to scale. And very often as promote did talk about most funding organizations donors would

really want to pilot and 20 years of digital health what we've realized is the is the big phenomenon of pilotitis right what we're interested is those shiny glamorous pilot tools rather than

building on foundations and that is essentially why even in a big event like this the most important sectoral contribution is How does each sector create those

foundational guardrails for every ecosystem to thrive? And for healthcare, for India, having a strategy on how do you use AI both in the lab settings and then move to clinical environment,

generate that evidence and then scale at the population level. That is essentially the foundations of that is what the AI strategy for India does. One, identifying what should those

governing principles be. two when we how do you get essentially data in India there's so much of data that we have and so instead of encouraging standalone applications how do we use existing

digital platforms say for example nshai which is essentially rolled out at the national level building AI plat AI applications on that is much more easier and that's what it scale which works as

against trying to build individual pilot based product based project based focus is it is it's and then moving away from these shiny pilots to more of the foundational elements that every country

needs to scale and that's essentially where globally what we see is health systems even in the US except for Mayo which is which has essentially become a factory for AI tools even a Stanford

healthcare system is essentially struggled in the last decade to bring tools from research to get them implemented in the hospital level at the system level. So in fact when Stanford

had its first chief AI scientist Nigum Sha appointed about four or five years back Nigum had only a two job role which essentially to bring evidence-based tools from lab to the clinical

environment. So essentially this is a huge cliff moving from the lab to the bedside and then bedside to the clinic. So I just want to say in terms of evidence what we see is just very

intermediate evidence in terms of improving health outcomes. But I think the science of how do you scale is through these foundations which I talked about and not really the shiny pilots.

Thank you all of you. So the beauty of a panel like this of such experienced, qualified, knowledgeable people is that in the one round you get so much on both insights, scalability,

the future of AI literally. So, we're going to change tack a little bit for the second round and we're going to ask all of you the same question, a bit of a futuristic

question and we will give you a minute and a half each to speak. So, the question is as follows. If we were to reconvene three years from now, what is the one measurable change that

would prove AI in health has moved beyond pilots to delivering equitable systemwide impact? From your vantage point as a public sector leader, innovator, private sector

partner, or global institution, what is the single action you must start taking start tomorrow? to make that change real, right? So, what is the one measurable

change that would prove that AI in health has moved beyond pilots and what is the single action you must start taking tomorrow to make that change real? One and a half minutes, rapid fire

round. Who would like to start? &gt;&gt; Yes, Ramode, it looks like you're ready to go. None of the healthcare specialists want to go. [laughter]

Okay. I I think I would look at it from few things and I want to you know um go back to the Karthik's earlier point. We should move from scarcity to abundance mindset. So we

have to ask what's scarce and will remain scarce and how do we look at what is abundant happening abundant and look for that abundance. Second we will we must look at the foundational

foundations that are necessary but not sufficient. So DPI if you look at it none of the DPIs solved anything they were only the building blocks Lego blocks that were

that were necessary to be able to solve credit access to credit access to jobs access to market access to they came later. So we have to ask this question if you want to look for the next 10 20

years and no one knows what the future is going to be what will you do today I will bet on the underlying Lego blocks so that we have optionality as a strategy for the future that means we

have options in the future because we have no idea what the future entails that gives us I will do one action I would absolutely invest in addition to the ABDM building blocks which is

portable records know portable benefits and so on also to layer an open network for AI trials. What does it mean? Today a startup in Bangalore

absolutely struggles to obtain what the rules are, where do the data come from, how do I train and the amount of harassment you'll have to go through to go through FDA or equivalent I see there

are pros here and literally sit with the doctor that's not scalable. We want a 10,000 neas in this country 10,000 of them. How do we do that is by creating the play store and creating the

underlying fabric so as to say I can come in and I can be triled rapid trials I get access to data in a controlled ethical you know regulated manner and then I can move through that pipe not in

10 years in two years I can move from if I have a really good solution that's working I should be able to roll it out in two years any startup $10,000 of Very good. The foundations. Who would like to

go next? &gt;&gt; With so much emphasis on foundations and with so many of wonderful colleagues here, let me just reiterate a little bit more on the foundation part. First is

can we promise that every AI tool that a patient under goes is being validated to that context. So typically very often we focus so much on building tools but have we evaluated them have we validate them

for the context in which they've been built and that is something which is not is very easy to say but how do you build those capacities both in healthcare workers create multi-disiplinary teams

that can validate every tool so when I as a citizen use a tool can I be sure that it is safe it's been built ethically it is It can be scale for sure but most

importantly is it safe to me and to my children and two it it is equitable in both in terms of equity by design privacy by design right so I think it is these foundations second thing is is it

auditable third of course is going to be governance and very often that's the most neglected piece and so I want to just stay with these foundations of

validation regulation auditability as the foundations of what we need if we really want AI to be something which is safe, effective and of course improve health outcomes.

So yeah sure okay I have the mic [laughter] so good points great points from Moji and uh so um I'm a technologist but I will wear a sort of the u overall metric hat that

you are looking at sorry overall hat and then look at metric that is required right um instead of saying was AI used we have to go in the outcome based right you know how many people were really

benefited if you want to sort of account and sort of have a metric after five years, three years, how many people were really benefited because of use of AI because once we prove the outcome in

India and India is the best place we have maximum number of problems, maximum AI talent and uh you know beautiful pilots possible and also of course uh you know agreeing to both points that

Praod and Karthik made uh if we can measure the outcome as to like for example every patient gets to know AI was used somehow how whether the hospital puts in or the patient puts in

or something and if we can track this number and somebody uh I mean this becomes a uh kind of a data set that so many people every year is getting benefited really on the ground right uh

improving their health detecting their cancer early uh you know you mentioned some beautiful use cases in the beginning from a motherhood pregnancy perspective So like that if we can

actually log these use cases and case studies and over time if this builds and builds and becomes a million the world will be how did you do this right you know like like for the example of the

covid vaccines right the outcome was uh really the the proof point right I feel uh that's what we should uh aim to count &gt;&gt; thank you thank you very much so even I would look at the outcomes I talked

about the NCDS which is a huge burden for And that is getting more complicated because of doctor to or caregiver to the patient ratio. And many at times it's

about the dropouts. If there is a declining trend of the dropouts okay for the patients who are taking the care right and they get well and then there's a good follow through that is one of the

metric in order for that to happen we have to strengthen the pathways using AI and we have to augment like you know all the caregivers in some way so that they don't do repetitive job right and then

third one we have to integrate everything which is happening in India right we have the ABDM we We have the right federated architecture that you spoke and then three of you spoke about

how can that come together and the right financial support thanks to the World Bank uh for all the things and responsible AI. How can we get all of this together and India becomes a model,

a role model for inclusive, equitable AI for the rest of the world? Because I believe we have all the ingredients. Maybe it will not happen within three. But this should be the vision that we

have. We become the example for the rest of the world because we have all the ingredients. That is success for me. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Just one quick point is that if we can and I think we will be able to do it

is if we can democratize uh genomics if we can find a way to make it equitable and we can use that janam patrika to prevent the onset of disease uh I think that would make like a huge difference.

I'd love to see that happen in three years. I know we are doing it in smaller ways but if that price point can really you know come down to a level that everyone has access to it there will be

a breakthrough in medicine and and that's probably the vision for the future with me I'm last so uh like I said I continue my optimism

on what we can build for us and for the world so I you might have seen on the way building in India for the world. So in three years from now I'm sure we would have our models which are working

in our systems and also are helping uh the others especially the global south. But as we do it I think one important thing that we need to make sure is these solutions or these models that you are

bringing in are safe and are and and also result in that equity. So therefore what I would also start working today worked on is to build start building something like a health cert

is that computer emergency response system similarly as we start using more and more AI we need to start also monitoring good for bias for drift and for certain unwanted outcomes so unless

we we build start building safety into our systems from day one we would be it would have gone too far to bring it back right so I think that is something that while I'll be very optimistic that we'll

start building it. We would also start working on building a healthert from the very beginning to make sure that we keep our AI within the reigns as well. So in fact as I was just looking at the logo

you know if AI were to really achieve this building that safety into the systems is very important. So we start we should also start working on it from today.

Thanks. Thank you [cheering] panelist [applause] and you've done such a great job sort of sticking within our time intervals. We have time for maybe two questions, two

very pointed questions. Um if you'd like to raise your hand okay &gt;&gt; so please introduce yourself really briefly and ask a question.

Hi, my name is Rohit. Uh I'm from American Express. I'm a product manager. Uh so I was looking into all of you speaking on this health ecosystem. Uh what my question is like equity when you

say equity that means we are almost a partner into this. So and I was thinking out loud that if AI has to enable everything and maximize the potential of every person then how the cost is going

to come down because the tools are remaining the same in healthcare right the humans are not the cost the tools are the costly thing so how AI is going to bring the cost down and make it more

accessible more functional to the locals &gt;&gt; thank you so if you can think about answers to that we'll take one more question. &gt;&gt; Uh thank you. I'm Priyanka. I'm JPP for

Phc from WCRO. So my question is for Kiran actually given that HR human resource for health challenges in our reason reflect inequitable distribution rather than uh

very absolute sortages. and we are prioritizing primary health care as equitable access for everyone uh towards universal health coverage. How can AI investments and innovations avoid

concentrating AI readiness uh in secondary and tertiary settings instead of strengthening uh community based PHC systems? Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. One more question.

&gt;&gt; Hello &gt;&gt; over there. Good morning everyone. Uh I'm Rajiv Seka. I'm the founder of a tech company based out of Chandigar. Uh my question is to both Pam and uh Kiran.

Well uh there are two questions actually. Uh one is what is the plan of having uh a policy like or a framework like HIPPA as we have in the US for Indian uh uh audience. Okay. because I

don't see any kind of uh framework or any kind of policy structure that is in place or or regulatory in in place. Okay, people are creating apps on ABDMs but AI to me being a being a techie AI

to me is not just limited to apps and dashboards. Again I recur with uh Mr. Gita that it has to be uh outcome focused not output focused. Okay. So uh creating so many apps on ABDN uh without

a policy without a framework without a structure or a regulatory doesn't make much sense because when uh Indian Indian medical board of governors launched their tele medicine guidelines in 2020

okay uh like who the who the hell on earth is following those guidelines I have I haven't seen hardly hardly any app is available in the market which is which is which is out there and which

follows all those practices all those policies Even prescriptions are not anonymized. Leave aside everything else. &gt;&gt; Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Okay, the second question. Sorry, second &gt;&gt; I think we only have time for one unfortunately. So maybe yeah after so the last question was specific to promote and right. So would one of you

like to take it and maybe touch on some of the other ones on equity and &gt;&gt; yeah I give you a very a high level and I leave Karen to speak about it. I think don't assume there are no rules. a

significant amount of best practices and rules that are evolving. Everything continues to evolve and it's not obvious that on day one that everything needs to be improved. But we do have a privacy

law. So, you know, the good thing is that we have DPDP that is going to give you an umbrella uh cover for us to be able to protect our privacy and so on. But specifically to healthcare anyway,

I'll let him speak about it. Yeah, it's it's a continuum I think. I I I agree with what uh promote says. I mean it is an evolving phase and you know when you go to the government

saying that I want to create another regulator you yourself will not like it because you know you want to have you want to regulate a space once it is what you call ripe for regulation. I would

say currently we are building towards it. Of course that kind of regulation will have to come. It will defin definitely come. We are slowly railing I mean putting the rails the the DPDP act

the health data management policy. The thing is you need to also have the capacity to regulate once you pass a regulation. So therefore making sure that the the regulator also has the for

example I said today every solution should come to steo for approval. Does have the capacity to do complete all your verifications and give you you will be you'll be in a queue. you will

not even be able to go to the market at least for next two three years. So the effort is we are building internal capacity that is why the benchmarking platform that is why the strategy and

regulation will come and once it comes then you'll tell me how much you'll like it. Then uh the other question that was asked me you know

&gt;&gt; you're absolutely right but the interesting thing is it is more easier to approve or take out a solution that works at the primary level for screening because you know we are saying let us

take a graded approach I mean you don't have to pass every AI solution through the exact same rigger comp let's say you are it's an autonomous robo that will do a I mean operation it has to go to an

extreme rigor but it is a simple workflow enhancement for an asha doing her day-to-day work it is it it will be relatively what you call easier to certify so we are following that

approach by that I'm sure more and more solutions even the screening solutions that Dr. Mjunad and other panelists have talked about they are already they are getting used they are in fact being used

at the primary level and in at least in the government the maximum number of solutions that have AI solutions that have been used be it for TB be it for diabetic retinopathy be it for cataract

all are actually at the field level. So therefore more and more solutions will come uh at that level simply because they are easier to understand and easier to uh regulate for a lack of a better

word. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So by the way um all of these solutions we've been talking about are CDSC cleared and many of you may know there's a class A B CD depending upon

the risk right so it is class C device so just one point on the scale I wanted to mention that uh um you know I think it was more an implementation centric thing so if more and more things are

using uh solutions are using cloud uh cloud can actually give you the scale of the volumes right you know because uh there's only uh if you actually deploy it on the cloud more and more people use

it then the cost per solution cost per API cost per person comes down drastically this is one way of doing it definitely economic economics of scale definitely will uh kick in it's not just

about the equipment it's also about the operational and everyday usage uh one last point using AI you can do things faster there's an example where the scans can be done 70% faster that means

with the same resources you and create many more scans and the cost will come down. One is about the implementation, another is about like you know how can like clinical usage and cost will come

down if the scale increases. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; Thank you. So as we come to the end of the [cheering] session, [applause] as we come to the end of the session,

let's go back to our community health worker, the one we started with. Her impact came from technology embedded in the system backed by data standards, training and trust. When we get those

foundations right, AI becomes a force for equity at the front line. You know, we might be practitioners, scientists, development organizations, but let's remember that success for all of us will

be measured not by how clever the algorithms are, but by real outcomes for real people like the pregnant mother whose preeacclampsia was caught and trusted early on, treated early on. So,

on behalf of the World Bank and the World Health Organization, I'd like to sincerely thank our panelists for sharing practical insights and real world experiences. And thank you all for

your engagement. Thank you. Have you seen Chick. Hello. Can I request everybody to settle in so that we may start?

Uh sir, please. Hi, we are starting in just about a minute. So, uh can I request everybody to sit or settle down?
