## 📝 Transcript

uh India impact AI summit because this is the world's largest AI expo and what better that uh our honorable PM has himself been putting in efforts to make India reach to this place that we are

now hosting many nations there are dignitaries there are industry colleagues from many nations who are you know joining hands they are seeing India progress on this front so this is a

proud moment for us and let us you know enjoy let us contribute to this moment moment. So the point of conversation discussion in front of us is uh the India AI stack you know strategic

framework for national growth and pride. Uh before diving into the discussion I I want to read an adapt adaptation of Ramhari Singh Denji uh Rashmirati or modern take on patriotic verse of that.

It goes like this. AI AID. So I read these lines for our esteemed panelists who have joined us today and

have embodied the character to develop India stack. Our panelists have lived these lines by their work in their respective fields and immensely contributed in building nation strength

and to give wings to the AI revolution in India. Please join me with a round of applause in welcoming our guest today. [applause] In the order left to right, I'll I'll

introduce uh our our panelists. So, Swastik Jakarvati is the vice president uh technology at network technologies India limited where he leads strategic technology innovation

and uh AIEL product development for large scale digital transformation solutions. He drives the design and development of AI enabled platforms to offer complete sovereign AI platforms

including GPU systems, AI storage and AI cloud stack. And maybe if I if if I can have the liberty to introduce myself also I'm Hakra. I'm senior vice president and chief sales and marketing

officer with network technologies. So uh I have been on the uh you know on the AI front and HBC for last uh 20 plus years. So I I uh want participation for from each one of you to make this moment

actually uh moving forward to uh Dr. Dr. Tarprites Sati, professor of computational biology and uh also serves as founding head at center of excellence

in healthcare information technology at triple IT Delhi. He has also contributed to research at as New Delhi and served as a visiting faculty at Stanford University's school of medicine. He was

CSIR quick hire fellow at the C CSIR fourth paradigm institute. Please give a round uh of applause for Dr. Trici. Then we have Dr. Manuri. He's a professor at IIT Delhi specializing in

neuropformic computing, artificial intelligence, hardware and advanced memory technologies. He's also the founder of Sirean AI solutions. He has been featured in prestigious list like

MIT technology reviews innovators under 35 and FOBS 30 under 30 Asia. Dr. Suri leads pioneling research and on next generation brain inspired computing systems that promise to revise

revolutionize AI hardware. Then we have uh Colonel Amit Mana director AI DGIS Indian Army. He's a senior Indian army officer serving as director artificial intelligence defense geospatial

information service that is DGis for his distinguished service of the highest order to the nation over 28 years. He has also been awarded the vicious sava medal VSSM.

[applause] Then we have Dr. Sultan Singh. He's a distinguished geospatial scientist and director of Hana space application center. He also serves as chief

geospatial officer for Hana state development authorities including GMDA and driving geospatial governance implementing AI for urban planning infrastructure and environmental

monitoring across multiple authorities. Under his leadership, Hersek has executed over 270 geospatial projects spanning agriculture, water source, forestry, disaster management and

disaster resilience. So we have such esteemed panel and we we all would like to you know get you know enrich ourselves with the thoughts coming from them. So let us try to take part as much

as possible. So goal is definitely you know to provide various perspectives on the topic of India AI stack you know fostering uh and engaging the information

experience rather than having discussions in I solutions I would say so for our audience quick understanding India AI stack comprises of three important elements application

layer that basically covers the foundational models text speech, vision, multimodel, different type of models. Then the second layer comes hardware layer where the applications the models

where these applications run on how each ingredient are being enriched by Indian manufacturing ecosystem and uh you know how the implementation of the hardware which is used for India stack

how this is getting done in the country. We are going to know about both the you know layers. Then comes the important aspect that uh how these organizations be it PSUs,

central PSUs, state PSUs, defense organizations or the education research institutes they are implementing the both the layers that is the AI stack the applications layer as well as the

hardware layer because with these two applications only with these two layers only we can really see the India AI stack in real action. And that is what we would like from our

esteemed panelists that how they have implemented during their uh you know tenure what they have done what difficulties they face. So that is the objective for you know all of us to know

that how India stack is getting built in India how it is basically leveraging the technology. So before I dive into the session I'll I'll in quickly introduce the flow of

the session to the panelists and even the audience as well so that you know we can be on time frankly speaking on covering all the inputs I uh request our estine panel to first share their

respective thoughts on the importance of India AI stack the strategic framework for national growth and pride I request the panelist to cover their thoughts initially in 2 minutes thereafter we'll

uh dive into the details discussion and we'll have some questions for which our audience would like to hear from you. So uh maybe in the uh order starting with Dr. uh Taprites sir please let us know

that what India stack means to you and what you have done in the past you know building this India stack for the country. So starting with you sir. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you Netweb for having

me here. Um I think uh India as we know if it's a famous saying that if you solve it for India we have sol solved it for the world and I think it's very much true for especially for healthcare which

is my area of expertise and I work in health tech and health AI. Uh so India AI stack for health I think is a very important component um that that should have all the layers of sovereignity

explanability also inclusivity. I think there's several countries that have been trying to build AI um from several lenses, right? We there can be more capitalistic approaches. Uh but India I

think has taken a very balanced approach towards building inclusive AI and that's what all these discussions on responsible AI are about. Doing that is not simple. It's easier said than done.

Um the blocks are already there. the building blocks of having data sets for example and having a framework like ABDM is a fantastic uh step towards uh that direction which allows um

interoperability of data and then perhaps applications to be built. My particular work has been focusing on ICUs a lot um building models that can predict which baby is going to crash in

the next 24 hours with things like sepsis or shock in the tertiary care settings. But very quickly we recognize that that's a very small proportion of um what healthcare is. What we really

need is in the stack how do we build these models for low resource settings. I work with as where a nurse may be visiting a bed maybe every 30 minutes and monitoring equipment exists maybe

all not all ICUs have that re that kind of resources right so we've also built models which actually do some very interesting novel tasks like resolution transfer where such equipments may not

be collecting high density data so how can we build the transfer learning to settings where low density data can also um help with with the same kind of accuracies. I think those are some of

the things that we've been doing. Then we contribute to antimicrobial research, drug discovery and all of that. But happy to talk about that more later. Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you Dr. T. Dr. Manan if we can have your inputs uh on on India staff please. &gt;&gt; Thank you Ree. Thank you to web and the organizers. So, so in my opinion, uh you

know there is no understatement that u AI is important and we are headed to an AI dominated age. So uh the India AI stack is important because uh as a nation we should inspire to be AI OEMs

you know and not just AI service providers you know uh sector after sector for whatsoever reasons the economy or the approach has been more towards services but when we are faced

AI is an inflection point so we have a chance here to aspire to become a OEM. So when you have to become an OEM uh you have to own the stack right and so that is why it is important not just from a

sovereignity point of view but also from a growth national growth national value creation point of &gt;&gt; change the service economy to the manufacturing economy

&gt;&gt; manufacturing economy so so that is the core thing here now in our own experience how we have contributed to the India AI stack we have contributed on two sides one is the application side

our team at siren and at IIT Delhi we have built many indigenized applications specifically for geo AI or geospatial AI, defense AI, computer vision AI. uh these solutions have been uh you know

built indigenously. They are all also deployed and they they are operational as we speak and proud to say that some of the uh you know co-panelists and their organization institutions also use

that and it is uh so so that is the uh you know fundamental owning the stack at the application layer and the best part is some of our deployments run on u you know hardware

which is uh flawless in terms of the physical layer. So, so this is so this is so that gives you some confidence how you're owning the uh stack. uh the other area where we are where we have been

contributing is the R&amp;D that is uh what are the future building blocks of this AI hardware uh puzzle you know it's it's GPUs uh you start with extreme CPUs GPUs accelerators uh FPGAs so on the academic

side we do a lot of work on the hardware building blocks nuts and bolts of semiconductor IP uh that is neuromorphic computing or brain inspired computing so so that is something which will probably

hit the ground say 5 years from as a product as a product which will hit the ground say 5 years from now or so. So these are the again I can go more in details but these are the stack level

interventions that we are doing in our &gt;&gt; that clearly describes you know how the India stack is important from your perspective and I think you know one thing very beautiful here is that just

imagine that now the situation for the country is such that on one hand we have the uh you know the solution providers like siren AI solutions we have got the contributor in in terms of IT Delhi and

then we have the users on the other hand the Indian army and then the manufacturers who are manufacturing the systems. So this is called the true sovereignty that we have

got application user and the manufacturers all sitting on the same DS that is the true sovereignty that is the true achievement of India mission or I would say you know India summit so you

know definitely we appreciate the efforts of you know government of India honorable PM that we have resulted into this situation. Thank you so much sir. Thank you Colit Mana please.

Hello. Uh first of all, thank you uh Mr. Naven and uh Mr. Reid for inviting me to this panel. Uh as far as sovereign uh India TAC is concerned, it can't be more

important to the Indian military. Right. uh I have seen our journey started about uh say about two two and a half years back as far as the AI absorption uh within the Indian army was concerned and

what we saw was over reliance on you know all the foreign stacks uh whether it they are LLMs open source LLMs the hardware everything and recent uh you know the skirmish which we saw opsendur

it further you know emphasized the need to absolutely go sovereign, right? Uh reason is we are planning to have even the critical aspect of military decision making at some point in time uh being

aided by the AI part not given to AI but aided by the AI. So the commanders with their own cognitive uh you know thought process which they have developed over a period of time uh the processes the

workflows of the military decision making how does AI help it uh help the commander to you know uh fractify whatever he's thinking maybe give a different option give a different

thought process but this can't happen if I'm you know overreiant on some foreign technology or a foreign stack uh military decisions are made uh in the shortest span of time uh the Udaloo

group has to be faster than the adversary and if we have to do that if someone on whom I'm relying say a foreign technology pulls the carpet under my feet what do I do and where do

I go right so the requirement is that absolutely sovereign stack is the dire need of the Indian army there are some steps which we have started over a period of discussion uh we will have

those uh steps I'll elaborate on that uh we have been working with you like co- panelists like siren and everybody wherein just to give an example simple thing like uh say an application layer

of uh satellite imagery change detection right uh I have seen some models working outside I've gone and visited some foreign militaries also uh they are using their own stack but let me tell

you the terrain there and the terrain here is totally different the objects there and the objects here are totally different what we are looking for from my perspective is not what they are

looking from their p perspective So they are working on or training a model on their own concept of warfare fighting where I have to train it on my own set and once I have to do I have to rely on

absolute sovereign India stack and this is one example where we work very closely with the team from IT from sang and the model is a functional model today within the Indian military uh

thank you we'll discuss more about &gt;&gt; so thank you thank you for inputs uh kina so uh Dr. Sultan if we may have your inputs please. Thank you. First of all, thanks to organizer and uh I great

regard thanks to all audience in front of me. Then I thanks to their thoughts. They are the keen to attend this kind of uh sessions. uh in Hiana we are thinking like in a

different way of that space to citizen stakes all citizen stakes how can we build in the complete so staging system we working on that means every stake of citizens

right from birth to end of the heaven how can we work out that platform we are working on that almost last seven year for that we need to very very high-end computing

infrastructures so we are seeking that way of the understanding and uh hana in terms of area is very small in compared to other state but using this

such kind of the technology we are working in I can say we are the basically create oxygens in between citizen and governance So we are the basically media of that.

On that account uh we work each and every citizens using this technology. Probably Hana is only st every citizens know about the entire satellite

utilization up to partial and pixel level. So that is our basic capacity building at the end user. for that this AI summit is a more important probably in across this entire participations

hana is more actively in across the all in morning I'll see that everywhere the hana stakeholder is actively and uh adventurously they are the participant so we can detail out in that's in thank

you &gt;&gt; thank you so much sir and I think we definitely appreciate even we all understand that how you know state governments function despite all the

limitations Despite all the restrictions I would say in simple words or in you know frank words you still use the technology especially the AI in such a way that you

have implemented those uh you know uh the the AI framework so that you know you can make the departments like uh scrit function in the state. Hana space application center has basically you

know designed and delivered such GIS solutions which are even deployed across country we really appreciate and uh I'm I'm sure with the with the questions following we would like to know more

about that how it has been done practically so over to you Swastik now &gt;&gt; please your &gt;&gt; yeah so thanks and thanks the esteemed panel members and also uh you know the

the viewers or the the the people who are in uh in the um in the room. uh with reference to Netweb uh we have been uh you know in this journey of uh manufacturing

uh high-end uh computing systems for last 25 to 26 years now off with uh with you know a AI and proliferation of AI uh and and that's why the India stack comes into picture wherein you have uh

high-end AI infrastructure which is housing uh different uh you know uh you know chips which are primarily deployed for AI applications and then you have that application tier uh which is

leveraging this underlying platform the investment of the customers to basically take it for a citizencentric services or for the usable business related applications at Neteb we are focusing on

both these aspects the first thing first is that we are one of the seven global manufacturers design manufacturers of NVDF so we have uh servers uh which are uh which are configured with the latest

and greatest uh you GPUs that being manufactured by or that is being offered by uh Nvidia. One of the biggest advantage for us is since we are the design partners, we get to have access

to the uh uh you know systems which are going to be released in the market maybe 6 or 8 months down the line. We have that access you know right now. So we can keep our customers way ahead of the

curve. Uh so when Nvidia or principles launching their product I mean we have our products ready so that customers can leverage the latest and greatest technology much more faster that is that

is one aspect and towards that you know if I have to take certain names like you know we had been having H100 H200 and V200 V300 um and we have all the all the systems ready today and also for the

future right you know there are NVL72 which is going to be a kind of rack scale uh GPU design but where we have made a difference again the relevance of India AI stack comes into picture

wherein we are creating a differentiated value of the same architecture but making it available for our Indian customers with the Indian usage needs which is NVL4 in a 2U form factor two

numbers of processors and eight numbers of B200 GPUs basically tells you two things one is you know we can actually increase the the the the computing power per rack and the Second thing is that a

local innovation can actually keep our customers well ahead and know than any other innovation that are happening. On the other hand, from an application perspective, we are also talking about

you know some of the solutions that we build. I know sir has talked about some of the healthcare solution but one of the perennial problem for India happens to be the public health system and how

do I actually build that. So we have been doing a lot of application development so that I can reduce the time to cure for the for the common Indian citizen. We can also increase the

productivity of the doctors. We can also increase the productivity of the lab workers as well as you know the the radiologists who are doing this. So I think you know from a network

perspective both in terms of the stack which is infrastructure as well as the applications which leverages this underlying benefit is the maximum and and icing on the cake happens to be if

we have to reach the age the age AI. So we are also having our smallest form factor systems that can be deployed at the edge which can do an age AI and that can deliver to the rural or the most

remote part of the of the of the country and that is the the the biggest benefit of an inclusive AI bringing those uh you know citizens also within the purview of serving the the go I mean government or

citizencentric services through those platforms as well. So that is the way we are structuring our hardware and software. &gt;&gt; That's fantastic that I think that

really you know defines the definition of India stack and how you know what importance even the hardware carries and what India has achieved on that front. So I mean delving into more uh details I

I would like to start with Dr. You know tav sir we have been seeing that on the medicinal research side India has been progressing you know uh in in many ways but for an outsider you know maybe there

can be some uh members in the audience who may not be able to understand that how do you basically use the foundation models which is part of India AI stack still you are able to basically render

such services which are directly helping the citizens that that chain is not understood by the audience even by you know many of times despite we being part of the technology world we also don't

understand that how the benefit of those India AI style foundational model is benefiting the you know the patient or the user or the citizen so please please throw some light on that

&gt;&gt; sure I think u swastik we were outside just chatting and you hit the nail right on the head that um u being a very diverse country u and and the technical terms that medicine has. If you just

take a model out of the box and essentially try to and we we we we tried doing I mean taking all the foundation models two years ago at that that were available at that time and we were

deploying for the Madhya Pradesh primary healthcare settings in um uh the Sanjivney clinic not the Sanjini but the Sanjivnney clinic model right and the use case was very simple we have a data

science-driven model which will basically enable let's say uh the drug stocking the drug stocks not being out of stock So we discovered some incidental very interesting findings

such as the antibiotic overuse etc. That's another thing. The use case that we were trying to build was not all nurses know how to interact with these kind of models, right? Not all

pharmacists know how to interact with. So can we build a voice interface for this? If you pick up a out ofthe-box model, it won't work in this setting. And that's where I think the India stack

we need customization with all the dialects with all the uh languages and dialects that we have. We need those kind of um uh interfaces to be built. along with the application layer that

needs to be built for the models. I think that's just one example where we we have to think as India differently than than just using English or just using Hindi or or or a single language.

We are a very diverse country, right? So that's that's one one side of things. The other thing is that I think there's a lot of scope for as Swasik said about the public health data itself to be

actually collected. Asha workers are the most overused u and I think overworked uh segment of the health collection uh I would say layer of uh public health system in India

right perhaps 18 different applications that they have to enter data with a redundant uh data entry in many of these um applications as well and they we have to make their work easier by using AI

right that's that's not a and that's again where voice-based interfaces come into picture ABDM frameworks once only data entry mechanisms they come into picture and that has and

that's what we are also contributing in the space of antimicrobial research um working with the government government of Karnataka and PATH and and ICMR and MG to contributing to at least that one

application like the pandemic that's already here is AMR how can we actually make that data um layer also strong on that aspect because every country across the globe is actually entering into a

post antimicrobial world. So those are the kind of challenges which are unique to India but also opportunities which are unique to India to leaprog to to because I don't see an ABDM like

architecture anywhere you actually make them make that happen and of course voice based interfaces would be a way to go. I think I'll &gt;&gt; maybe maybe you know the India stack

what you were defining for the medicine research maybe the the day may come that this the same model may further be tuned for the respective territories of the other other territories of the world.

&gt;&gt; Absolutely. I think that is how the absolutely on one hand we are talking about sovereign AI stack for the medicinal research helping country. Thereafter we are talking about the same

AI stack getting replicated and tuned for the respective other territories of the world and I think that that defines that how we are progressing on that front and using making use of India

stack. Thank you. Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; So Dr. Man, I mean my my question to you is that you know you have been working on the innovations on the you know nonvolatile memory and the neuromorphic

hardware acceleration and all that. I mean it this is something which is very different from a uh I would say a normal user normal citizen perspective because they never get to understand what is

this area and how this is going to use the India stack. Can you please throw some light and let us understand that what are your plans what you have seen in your tenure that this kind of a

hardware innovation can also make use of it please? &gt;&gt; Sure. Thanks. So I'll just try to you know cut aside the jargon and uh make it more translatable. So, so let's let's

just consider one thing, you know, the a typical GPU would consume anywhere around few hundreds of uh watts, right? You you plug in four GPUs in a motherboard and you start talking about

a power supply of 2,000 W with a gold rating, right? That's what we are looking at. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; if you plug in even four GPUs.

&gt;&gt; Now, consider biological intelligence, right? Two meals a day, maybe three meals max or sometimes even on one meal and whole day. Biological intelligence is running multimodal models.

&gt;&gt; So the dissipation of biological intelligence is estimated to be around 20 watts. That's human brain or any intelligent organism doesn't dissipate more than 20 watts of power in a day for

all the signals that they're processing whether it is speech, vision or text or whatever. And all of this simultaneously and your GPUs would draw

300, 400 or 2,000 watts for the duration that you run them. So uh neuromorphic computing uh essentially it hits at the core of uh energy energy dissipation and we have to see even from a usage point

of view as AI becomes more and more mainstream as we all start finding more value in AI as it starts solving our problems the consumption of AI will be much more. So for a billion scale

inference or for uh how do you get that how where do you fulfill that energy requirement from right so the core essence here of uh neuromorphic computing or bioinspired computing is to

come at those building blocks which are energy efficient right because if AI has to succeed uh in the long run then it has to be more energy efficient so that is where the uh you know uh the core

motivation lies &gt;&gt; and how how do you plan to use the India stack for that for that part. &gt;&gt; So so again you know India as a civilization as a the ethos of the

Indian charter is sustainable you know &gt;&gt; more uh green consumption or getting more output on less resources plus whatever the &gt;&gt; so this is hitting on the you know the

fundamental layer of hardware in that case and you know probably that is where you are starting with you know hitting at the aspect of energy which is ultimately translating to you know uh

taking advantage of uh you know maybe reducing &gt;&gt; new new hardware. So I see absolutely we talk about you know AI for all the impact for all. So if this has to really

go in a sustained way so it has to be more energy efficient. Do you do you think that this model can you know be directly be helping the citizens of the country someday or it has already

reached that stage &gt;&gt; the way you are trying to transform? Think think about it in the sense how traditional compute or electronics industry has evolved right we we

initially there was functionality then there came the concept of threestar electronics fourstar uh electronics or carbon emissions or you know you take air conditioners which don't have a

emission of of a certain point so I think AI will also go through that cycle where your building blocks will become more will have to become more and more energy efficient the hardware building

blocks will have to become more and more energy efficient and that will feed back uh to the wider audience or wider you know citizens uh in in in general that that will make AI sustain

&gt;&gt; interesting interesting that that's very interesting actually that how the low energy stack which you can infuse at the maybe edge level which may definitely leave an impact on the lives of you know

billions of citizens and I think uh this is something we can see arriving very soon in the market also even [snorts] maybe if this is at conceptualized stage at this stage but I think this can see

the reality very soon if if I may be uh if I'm right yeah &gt;&gt; absolutely so a lot of these concepts they have crossed the prototyping stage now it's just a matter of mass uh

&gt;&gt; understood &gt;&gt; production or mass industrial adoption but they have certainly crossed the prototyping uh stage &gt;&gt; interesting so I I go back to klmit mana

so kl I think uh there is absolutely no doubt that sovereign AI I indi stack as you rightly explained in the initial uh you know inputs also that that plays a very important role but now the

question is that do you think that this is absolutely non-negotiable although you have explained if you talk about developing models you need definitely something curated for army you need

hardware definitely that has to deal with the problem of you know infiltration or intrusion happening at the hardware level. So please please throw some light that is this

non-negotiable for you that India AI stack has to exist and there has to proliferate. Okay. So uh before I delve into the answer proper uh let me just uh bring about what we are looking at right

uh I have trained a open-source LLM right for any kind of decision making a simple tool like uh say I am asking a small VLM uh what is that you see in this you know image

the VLM or the LLM has been trained on some data set I do not know what when the critical time comes and I have you know fine-tuned this LLM uh for my specific need within the military

at the critical juncture what kind of biases hallucinations it can inject into my military decision-m and military decision-m is very critical because it [snorts] involves you know a person

dying or living and there are humongous uh collateral damage which can be also inflicted if a wrong decision is taken. So therefore I don't want to leave even a iota of chance on a open-source LLM

which is fine-tuned or tuned by us for a critical decision making within the military. So how do I subvert that or how do I you know overcome this. So what we have started is uh we are training as

we speak today a military LLM to start with a small uh uh 10 billion parameter model. uh within few months you'll hear the news that uh the first military LLM of India is you know onboarded which has

been from the scratch made on by the team within uh the Indian army trained on the military data set absolute military data set which we have trained on so that there are no biases there are

not hallucinations there nothing and this is the journey which we wish to take from 10 to 50 to 70 to 100 as we go deep dive into how do we want this LLM to function with a deep reasoning what

you see 253 uh billion parameter neatron models and all I'm looking at such journey and this is the journey which we intend to take now coming as far as the infra is concerned right uh uh you are

aware we have taken the GPUs the H200's the H00s now people are going for B200s B300s and this complete infra is coming up in you know various locations within the within the mil tree within the navy

within the air force now but finally the dependency is still on the hardware you know I do not know what bug is there today I do not know &gt;&gt; that's right

&gt;&gt; uh so what is the option now so the option is I'm now looking at you know obviating the requirement of GPU altogether let's see this is a problem statement which we have given to

the environment and this is a problem statement for all of us uh in the audience too uh what I'm looking now is I'm not directly jumping to the LLM. I'm saying let me make small SLMs first,

right? And there are some uh you know teams and some startups and some industry who have shown some kind of promise in uh training a SLM on a CPU instead of a GPU inferencing on a CPU.

So CPUs are still you know although they are foreign make but still you know the the journey of the CPU has been long enough and therefore I can still rely on the Indian players or the make in India

thing. So let me see can I join these SLMs to make a multi-agentic platform train different SLMs on requirements specific to the army and give an answer which the LLM is uh designed to give. So

my journey starts from there. So this is an open statement which we have you know given a challenge to to the environment and let's try and see you know how far we can remove the requirement of a GPU

all together. The third most important facet for us is also what we some of the co-panelists touched upon is a sovereign capability at the edge right so there are

requirements which are met by central resourcing of these GPUs today uh say at Delhi or say at wherever we have the uh networks uh so I place that central resource I train those models I place

those models on the central resource but at the same time I'm looking at the AI capability at at the edge and the edge is what you talked about you know small boxes so which have got VLMs which have

got uh you know agentic vsss which have got yolo models for object identification and therefore I want to obate the requirement of you know sending this complete video stream back

to the central resource choke my bandwidth and do the analysis there at the edge and finish the task give the analysis to the commanders who are looking at it. So this is our journey

which we have started uh and as as I told before also we are opening out in a major big way to the industry to the academia to the startup the complete ecosystem. We have established a stall

here uh at hall number four we are showcasing what are the dual use technologies which the military is using today and how could it can benefit in the civil industry and vice versa.

Obviously we have to you know learn and take from each other how how do we get these technologies into the decision-m as such. So this is where our journey is and I'm sure you know there are ideas a

floor in this complete floor and the complete bat bat mandapam uh once the voice reaches that what is the Indian army looking at how do you join this into our journey to you know make it

absolutely sovereign network has taken the lead and let's see how others uh join our training thank you &gt;&gt; that's very interesting to know in fact this is for uh you know for the

knowledge of our audience also so what colonel mana has talked about is that army has worked worked on if if you please correct me if you find me wrong somewhere has worked on all the layers

as of now first is the paramount important thing was that they wanted to develop their own uh LLM and I'm sure that adoption of AI does not limit to the level of LLMs or creating SLMs or

VMs I'm sure about it this is a good way and seeing I mean seeing that how enterprising our army has become that now they have you know put out their uh booth out they are talking about their

product. This is the progress. This is what we talk about what India AI has achieved and let let us have a you know round of applause for our army as well because we all understand you know they

work under so restrictions there are many limitations still they are they they have reached to this level that is very you know tremendous and on top of it he's clearly talking about that there

is no negotiation possible across all the layers be hardware beat you know the uh you know LLMs or SLMs or even the adoption of AI at the edge level there is no negotiation possible at all. So

there is something you know which is very interesting and I think this clearly uh reflects the efforts of army which have gone into it. Moving on to Dr. Sultan. Dr. Sultan I I have been you

know I've been fortunate enough to know about your work in the past and uh do you think because in your case geospatial data has been used in many forms. I mean frankly speaking I have

been knowing that you use the same for you know studying the crop yield you know serving the data to the ministries and thereafter you know you also understand that whether there is a

land which is unutilized whether they there can be you know change in crop which can take place. So all that work is going on that is just one aspect of agriculture and you have been dealing

with you know mapping the entire city mapping the canals mapping the rivers everything has been done by us. When did you realize that India AI stack or your sovereign AI stack is important for you

because there is something important that you might be having some readymate software available but was it important to you know go ahead in that direction and build India stack for that purpose?

Yeah, this is a [sighs] different kind of way I can understand. Initially for understanding we need to existing any oper operational established software any technologies

there first we operate that since 2006 on 17 or 18 then we come out that our actual requirement like colonel means he's already expressed key how we come out this Indian system then we realize

we need our own way of that in Indian ecosystem each and every citizen their own thought, own will and own commitment on their own way of the understanding. So I can say every 11 kilometer in

geographical area everything is a change. So the variety of that understanding no one is international any software is understand Indian ecosystem. So this is a more important

we only only solution is Indian AI system. I can say within the India is a multiple India. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; That's so true. So for that way we

realize in hana in hana we also classified as per the agreeological John topographical John thought of the citizens we understand how dalect that they understand. So on that way we

understand this only is so system is served our purpose. Initially I can say being a academic I can understand the entire ecosystem the all academia

activity so that is a basic limitation without in making India Indian so we can't process them &gt;&gt; no one is any international even then

operating system existing there they are not able to serve our actual delivery because our individual within a family if it is a five five person every own understanding.

&gt;&gt; So how we integrate and how we create the all LLM and all system. So that is a basic limitation that solution is there &gt;&gt; with the help of geospacecial. Geospaceial is nothing each and every

pixel of the location we need to integrate map &gt;&gt; with the map. Map is one to many many to one integrations. Mhm. &gt;&gt; So I can say in terms of consumption of

this high and partial image in coming time I can say as I understand one citizen use the almost 2.4 TB data sets one single citizens

&gt;&gt; so that is we understand how can manage that way. So for that we need a high-end computing in analytic way. &gt;&gt; So every citizen is very fast &gt;&gt; thought is so fast. How can we work on

that? So that is a basic our approach. But we are mainly work on the citizen centric governance. So every citizen stake we can make in this system

and we have a lot of things is there and anybody can audience can visit our one of the stall is there all number four and then we are open for the all acade academy and all our

&gt;&gt; very very interesting actually you know the way they have made use of geospatial data and for the rendering services to the different ministries in the within the state that is something which is

very commendable. And I and again you know state governments function in a very different way. Priorities are very different. You know functioning in a central government environment is so

different than functioning in a state government environment. And really appreciate your your efforts on that front. So swastik I I come back to you and uh would would like to understand

that uh uh what is [snorts] the current status of readiness of hardware to achieve India AI stack capability or to achieve India stack sovereignity? Yeah. &gt;&gt; Is data center to edge readiness there

already? &gt;&gt; Yes, absolutely. Absolutely. And and Netweb is actually uh in a front runner for uh for this kind of deployment as Scondolar has also mentioned right there

are age AI applications which are on the rise and having a kind of age deployment. We already have launched our age uh server or age deployment with AI and and then how do I actually connect

back to the data center and there is an application stack which will basically work beautifully which is called you know um a kind of H to the core connect uh connectivity so that it is called

speculative decoding. So we have applications using that so that you know the local inferencing can be done there in case of any bigger thing is there it will basically forward it to the bigger

model which is running out of the data center. So with reference to the data center we have we are readiness with NVL4 which which is going to be you know a kind of four GPUs in a liquid cooled

machine and you can have uh you know at least 21 numbers of the servers considering power is there. So that is NVL4 is what we have launched. uh we would in invite all of you to come to

the hall number four with a net booth where we are showing not just the server but also all the individual cards that are actually bringing that server all of them are being manufactured here in our

farid factory. So, so that is one along with that we have B200 and B300 both liquid cooled and air cooled systems are positioned there. We also have the latest generation of H200

based know PCI based servers that are also being there. So we are cutting across that entire spectrum of the hardware required for us to be more impactful addressing the India AI uh uh

stack that we are talking about and sir was basically mentioning about you know CPU based inferencing. Yes, we have capability to run even the CPU based inferencing on the SLMs and we can

cluster multiple number of CPU servers put together to create a distributed inferencing cluster. So that is also possible for us. So I think from a hardware and application perspective we

are there which can help us build more capabilities using this India AI stack. &gt;&gt; Nice. This is very important. I think uh this is for the consumption of audience also that what we have talked about is

that on one hand there are four different verticals who are progressing on the India stack. There's a vertical you know uh related to healthcare medicinal research. Second vertical

which is dealing with the cyber security you know you you know the low power AIcentric edge devices. Third vertical which is directly related to the army. Army themselves are behaving now as an

enterprise and you know started building their own solutions. On the other hand then we have got state government departments also who are now you know not shying away from building their own

sovereign and AI stack. So I think that beautifully exemplifies that how India is progressing on that front and at the same time to empower these divisions, empower these verticals, the hardware

which was required to be manufactured in the country is what swastik has talked about is now getting manufactured in India itself. And important part is the same was not the situation I would say

2015 2016 before 2015 2016 and I think now we have arrived an era where we are talking about producing world's most powerful GPU platforms what he talked about that is NVL4

which pro which probably houses 80 GBs in a single rack. Yes, absolutely. &gt;&gt; Cooling &gt;&gt; which takes care of your training happening at the data center. At the

same time we are taking care of the AI happening at the edge level also what Colonel Mena clearly talked about that we just now we want this AI adoption to take place in such a way that the user

sitting probably at the at the you know the uh I would say the border touching the botting nation there also we want AI to leave an impact for that uh you know army man to see how it can basically

help the user to take an advantage of quick decisions Maybe you know looking at what is there in your stock in infantry or maybe if we talk about the asha worker who is working day in day

out and the asha worker is not basically aware of that what is the medicine stock I have how the you know different type of treatments may be required to be given to different patients that is what

you know you know this uh uh AI stack or sovereign AI stack is going to embody uh the character of that application likewise what uh you know Dr. Dr. Manan talked about that how basically cyber

security related or the low power AI edge devices can be designed now in the country and at the same time how GIS applications can leave an impact. So this is something which is clearly

showcasing and progress you know showing the impact I would say the India AI has uh done on the overall industry. So now the I mean in the interest of time I would I would uh like to hear from

audience also that what are your uh please let us know that what are the curiosities you have in your mind in terms of understanding that how healthcare is behaving how healthcare is

basically catching up with the EI speed or you know the uh Indian army if there are any questions please I mean you are welcome to ask please &gt;&gt; uh there's another concept of federated

learning models &gt;&gt; okay &gt;&gt; are we experimenting on that also we have some individual SLMs placed right then we transfer that learning

from there &gt;&gt; so Dr. if you can &gt;&gt; yeah in the healthcare space that's very very important I think it's something that we are also doing with between

tertiary care hospitals like as and max because obviously data exchange is not so easy but also with even between different as that we just signed an MOU with CADC where several as subscribe to

the same uh sort of the HMIS model how do we make models move um and believe it or not I mean every single setting has a different kind of challenge um so Federated AI is definitely one of the

things which is super important for um uh healthcare especially in the current DPP scenario as well. So we want these models to be sovereign at the local setting as well and I think u sir

mentioned about even at the sir mentioned about even at the citizen level right giving sovereignty ultimately the control of the data patient data to the person that's what

ABDM is about. So thank you &gt;&gt; great I think that yeah next question please. Yeah about Uh my question to you specifically on

what are the top three metrics and how do you decide that uh the deploy will work you how do you decide &gt;&gt; it's not easy to explain here in this audience right and [laughter]

there are a lot of things which I can't speak also uh uh but uh suffice to say that the agentic platforms which we are talking about today uh there are a huge bouquet of you know these agenti

platforms all across whether lang chains crew whatever you talk about the most important facet is how do I tweak this platform to the army needs right and we have very specific use cases they they

are not generic use cases you know enterprise type uh what you use in banking or any other industry for that matter for that you will need a very specific

data set which we will give we will define sitting with the you know the developer uh domain expertise which you will require because uh we have seen in this journey of two years the most uh

difficult part is you know transfer transferring my domain knowledge to you know you can work in a banking sector within a month but you will take at least 6 months to work with me because

you'll not be able to understand the requirements which are very very peculiar to uh the decision- making in the army as such so that uh I can't go into more details you can have

one-on-one with whenever you wish to. Uh but these metrics are defined with us. What we are looking is defined with us. Uh very soon we are also you know uh opening out to the industry and uh there

is something in the offering which we we can have one-on-one. Uh &gt;&gt; so this is this is interesting and I think Dr. Manon if you can also throw some light on this. I understand you

know uh Colonel Mana has to basically you know he wants to limit himself in terms of you know sharing data in such public forum but since you are also dealing with you know uh with such

problems how do you see I mean the question he asked and uh do you think that you also design these cyber solutions which are using you know AI models and all how do you decide do you

you know invest time or uh you know to see that how whether whether it is impactful or not because this is something uh this is a very closed domain and there is no data available as

such deciding what is going to work what is not going to work how do you basically work in you know what what is your strategy in that case &gt;&gt; yeah so there is a very systematic

process to it you know the very first thing that you need to achieve is the functionality right first you get the functional something functional doing the job uh that you desire

&gt;&gt; and once the functionality is achieved then we go on to the metrics you know whether it So you know it can be any metric whether it is accuracy whether it is latency precision recall. So so th

those are that is the typical direction. Now edge edge and data sensitivity again brings more unique uh aspects to it. They're different compared to enterprise. You know for enterprise the

evaluation is more uh standard for for edge when you have data sensitivity involved. So sometimes you let go of the u you know the standard metrics &gt;&gt; and many times what we have seen in

these new use cases you have to deise your own metric depending on the use case because &gt;&gt; you may be chasing an industry metric you may achieve a very good score on

that metric but at the end you realize that it has no equivalence or no correlation to your use case. So uh we have been in most at least in our work we have more often we have been in a

situation where the industry standard metric gives is of no use like we we have to devise a new metric for that &gt;&gt; this has to be absolutely curated you know based on you know whatever

observations your system receives and all &gt;&gt; yeah and fortunately unfortunately after certain time we say AI is automation but it becomes more human because then

you're literally conversing with the user that Does this help you? You may have a very high precision, you may have a very high uh accuracy or a very low latency, but if it doesn't meet the

expectation of the uh you know the human at the other end. Uh so so that is the you know the ironical part of I I'm throwing open I'm undoing the whole panel when we are arriving at the end.

&gt;&gt; Correct. I I understand &gt;&gt; but uh I I hope you get what I'm saying. &gt;&gt; I get I get a point. Any any more questions please? &gt;&gt; Yeah please. Yeah.

So my question is actually from a very different industry. I come from the agriculture industry &gt;&gt; and you know I would like to ask Dr. Man especially that do you at some point of

time see that you know the farmers will be using AI to you know understand what are the weeds in their field and understand how can they actually remove or even as you say I mean you're talking

about the healthare industry they be able to understand what is the that their crop has what is the stage of infestation because it's a very very it's a massive area that we're talking

about and once they get used to this I think a lot of problem in the farming community will be &gt;&gt; I get a point so basically you want to say that how by when the practical usage

of AI in the space of agriculture can be seen by us &gt;&gt; by farmers not by the corporates &gt;&gt; I I get a point yes basically the end user

&gt;&gt; yeah so the theoretical ical answer to your question is that yes there are solutions there are problems also and there are solutions which are in agriculture which are being solved very

well by AI. You know the if you look into the domain of precision agriculture and we also have other space scientists here you know the hyperspectral data or any space data is being used very

aggressively to monitor the aging of the crops or the nutrition value of the crops. Now whether the farmer gets to use it it's more of a economic question that uh at what cost at what infra cost

the solution is delivered. So there might be entities there might be you know public there might be entities which can afford and obtain that solution but uh whether

the whether the last mile farmer how they &gt;&gt; economics plays a role there. Yes. Uh I can extend on that. Uh basically farmer in our state right from we can say seed

[snorts] to seed we monitor. &gt;&gt; I see &gt;&gt; right from the day a moment you are seedling in the your soil with the particular moisture

to finally I can say up to bite also. We are working on that also. Today you buy some uh food, I can track that also. But right now in our state we are monitoring right from sewing to till harvesting

each and every parcel of the land up to or I can less than one acre. Then growth pattern of that particular plant if it is any stress due to any environment conditions due to irrigation stress any

other any fertilizer in that everything we use that daily satellite imaging every day we are using that &gt;&gt; talking about satellite imag but but that's that come come out that

that is available data is available depends upon which satellite data which sensors we apply either optical either microwave either SAR either thermal and many of the weather related it is a

combination we predict the yield before the harvesting how much yield is particular even than 10 by 10 m area of the that so that is there or then entire system is used by the farmer

&gt;&gt; so I think the the we can information Thereafter takes place in their in their you know the state department scenario because whatever data they capture that they disseminate the information to the

respective department they issue the directives to the farmers or they you know guide them with some recommendations that's how the practical usage may take place for now your

question is quite valid the practical usage the farmers himself should be himself should be capable of capturing the data on his own and make use of it I'm sure I think the day is not

&gt;&gt; it's a very simple stubble burning is one of the chronic problem in this NCR region. I &gt;&gt; I would request the participants to ask the question outside because other

speakers are in the queue. We would present a goodies to all the speakers. Thanks for coming. &gt;&gt; Sure. Sure. Sure. Thank you. In the interest of time, we'll have to wrap

this up discussion. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. The same panel. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Sure.
