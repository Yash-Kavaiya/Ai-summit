## 📝 Transcript

so that it becomes affordable and accessible. It's multilingual and it's socially beneficial. Can we design a DPI, a digital public infrastructure for artificial

intelligence architecture that makes adoption easy, it makes it trustworthy. It makes it interoperable and scalable and especially uh for those who are in MSME and those

uh who are below uh especially for women and those below poverty line so that it is accessible to all otherwise we'll create an inequitable society and therefore to help us answer these

questions uh we have deliberately structured the session session into two panels 30 minutes each and the first panel looks outward to understand how other countries are organizing

institutions building trust frameworks and enabling the diffusion of AI. We want to learn from competitive and comparative experiences. And the second panel will

look inward asking what India can build or how India can build, operationalize and implement over the 12 to 18 months. And the first panel helps us to attract uh you know extract the design

principles. The second panel helps us to translate those principles into architecture. Diffusion requires both perspective and execution. So ladies and gentlemen, we have a very very

distinguished panel here. Uh let me uh introduce uh Mr. Amandep Gil who's the under secretary general and special envoy for digital and emerging technologies of the United Nations. I

have a very distinguished friend of mine Mr. Kita Nishiama. He's a former director general of matei the ministry of economic trade and industry which is the most powerful ministry in Japan. We

have Mr. Hugo Waladaras the director of science technology and digital innovation from government of Brazil and we have professor Romesh Rasca uh from the Massachusett Technology MIT. So

ladies gentlemen let me let me first uh start with Mr. Nikkita Nishyama. Uh, Mr. Nishyama, uh, what lessons can we draw from national experiences such as Japan's in building institutions that

enable artificial intelligence to diffuse into everyday economic and administrative use. &gt;&gt; Uh, thank you and thank you for inviting me to this important uh, session. Uh,

time is limited. So I will give you in this instance three points or four points. The first approach of Japanese government to AI is process-based if I may call it that way because as

everybody knows today's AI is learning based meaning feedback based. So in my opinion the most important things how we are able to construct a good feedback channel rather than bad feedback

channel. So when when we say process approach means that we don't rely on very stringent as uh uh sorry as uh uh Mr. Kant uh introduced me I was a government official but we should not

rely on you know government official order ordering very minute rules that's not feedback approach so we are having AI strategy we have the AI law but all of them are based on essentially agile

approach feedback approach that's first point second point relates to the education or empowerment And of course previously we have many many uh curriculums for IT engineers for

that matter but they are essentially designed for uh providing curriculums uh education to become professionals in this area. Of course these are still important but I think we are at least

Japanese government is changing approach from more generalist it to empowerment for general public for example we have a uh uh semi-governmental agency called IPA uh information uh promotions

something but anyway they are providing a IT passport together with uh what Japanese deep learning association is providing uh certificate for journalists in AI. So these educational curriculums

are actually focusing on users rather than developers of UI. So everybody should become or have to become a users awar. So therefore we are focusing more on

education empowerment of users or generalists for that matter. And also I'm now in University of Tokyo. University of Tokyo is providing what we call GCI which is specifically designed

for data science and its application in uh many uh business use cases and it's open to not only government uh sorry university students but uh many uh uh uh business persons or even high

school students. So it's it's becomes very very popular. Again it's not designed for uh specialists or per or experts rather than anybody who are interested in AI to develop its own

application it's in own positions and actually we are now trying to promote them into uh uh the global south as well in including India. Certainly because as you know Japan is manufacturing

country we are linking AI technology to manufacturing or hardware businesses and I'm some I now have some business with uh uh in the construction industry construction may not be uh uh uh

particularly uh manufacturing but it's same in in the sense that they are dealing with hardware wares and as you may know AI is very uh uh compatible with construction business because if

you go to the construction site you have to deal with complex things and unique things every day if you go to you know Toyota factory for example it's it's it's complex but

still they're making cars almost similar every day by similar person but if you go to construction site you have to build something different by team of different background people. So these

are the typical use cases which are now very popular to introducing a technology. But finally since because DPI session I have to say what Japan is lacking is structured DPI and I there is

I think this is the area which where we can learn from many other countries experience including India and why I'm stress this issue is if I may go back to my first principle AI governance should

be feedback system and if you are had to have feedback system you have to change how government functions not only limited to how AI should be developed but how you government should

make rules, how they regulate uh industries and I think that most has to be changed and so in that area I think there are many things we can learn from uh uh uh DPI experiences of India

including uh DEPA. So I'll stop here and pass. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you so much. Uh thank you so much Nishiasan. Let me turn to Mr. Gil who's the

technology zar of the United Nations. Uh Amandep uh you know India has built up opensource open API globally interoperable uh digital public infrastructure

that's because we believe in making technology affordable. uh we believe in making it accessible and now with uh server

uh we believe in making it multilingual uh so tell me how do you view it at the United Nations what's the takeaway for India if we were to build a digital public infrastructure for artificial

intelligence uh what should we align with internationally and what should remain sovereign by design and uh how does the global digital compact signal a global

commitment to digital cooperation? Can you give us a broad sweep of this? &gt;&gt; Absolutely. You know, delighted to be here and reflect on what the DPI's experience. You know, India, we have

Brazil represented here on the panel. Pix for example. So, what does that mean for the AI opportunity? I think the DPI principles of interoperability, openness and modularity, they help us land a

sweet spot between digital sovereignity and international cooperation. So sovereignity if you look at the DPI stack the core elements you know so it's a sovereign infrastructure managed at

societal scale in the public interest on top of which you know private sector innovation can take place and that is where the interoperability aspect the international connections being part of

the global digital economy becomes uh obvious. Now taking it one step further uh if you look at the DPI experience as a model for AI governance and AI adoption as well. So if you have model

repositories if you have these APIs these benchmarks then startups can focus on innovation without having to build everything from scratch. So they focus on what they can do best

while relying on the foundations both in terms of access to data, access to customers but also in terms of governance uh which is as my uh you know friends from the I spirit community in

Bangalore would say which is a technolal infrastructure and then innovate with confidence. So I think this is the most valuable lesson that we can see from the uh DPI's experience. Now if we take it a

step further you know at the global level we are building something of a similar architecture which is in the global public interest. So you have these

regular scientific assessments through the international independent scientific panel on air. So every country doesn't have the resources to do its independent assessments and they want to rely on

neutral independent advice. So you're providing a global public good through the dialogue. Again every country doesn't have to reinvent governance from scratch. So you can look at experiences

that work well that don't work well then make up your own mind and apply it in context. And finally through capacity building uh that's the third pillar of our approach at the you know you can

then take AI diffusion a step further and uh learn from experiences of other countries where use cases are scaling what are the critical enablers and perhaps even collaborate on some of

those critical enablers like data sets for climate change resilient agriculture compute that's scarce so it can be pulled and made accessible to uh startups talent which is flighty. So how

do you retain talent within the global south by providing them those exciting opportunities. So those are the kind of you know global level consideration in terms of a DPI inspired approach. Uh I

just wanted to ask you a follow-up question on this you know because one of my huge concern is that uh you know talent resides here uh uh a lot of uh data resides here many

of these models are getting better and better and more and more sophisticated with Indian data and uh the data from global south. The challenge is that so much of computing power is being added.

You know, OpenAI is one deal with Nvidia uh 11 gawatt 5 million uh GPUs of the most advanced variety. What what does it imply in the long run? I mean, won't they need more sophisticated software uh

with less computing power eventually? Won't AI get commoditized? And that would require us to have a very sophisticated software uh which will make a difference rather than just

hardware. &gt;&gt; I think that's one approach and that could get locked in of massive compute, massive data center capacity for uh inference and models that serve as uh

you not just commodities but essential infrastructure. uh so provide intelligence within codes through APIs at a cost all over the world uh and in a sense compress AI

development at the top end. So that's one possible future out there. But I think we also have to work for a future that has more democratization of opportunities uh where SLMs smaller

models 50 70 billion parameters working with you know multilingual context specific language data sets are solving local uh problems where you have more diverse talent cross domain talent

engaging on that. I think that kind of a future which recalls kind of the earlier vision of the internet and the digital economy is worth fighting for and I would say this is not so much you know

digital sovereignty but it's a practical approach of maximizing the benefits um from AI. &gt;&gt; Okay. Thanks. Uh thanks uh Amandib. Uh we have with us uh Mr. Hujo Hugo

Walades. uh he's uh he's from Brazil and uh he's played uh you know Brazil as you're all aware uh did the G20 right after us and uh one of the key things about uh Brazil is that it's publicly

framed uh uh inclusion concerns in its artificial intelligence policy discourse and therefore uh what uh Hugo what uh mechanisms actually ensure diffusion uh beyond on big firms, how does shared

infrastructure, public procurement, MSME toolkits, sandboxes, what role do they play? Can you tell highlight a little bit on this? &gt;&gt; So, hello. Can you hear me? Okay.

Good afternoon for everyone. Uh it's a pleasure to be here actually to speak about what we are doing in Brazil. Uh to achieve an scale on artificial regarding the long run we have to run

due to the problems we have along our history. We are not especially a very rich country but we have a lot of things to offer. I believe uh what we are doing uh we can summarize in two words

sovereignty and ecosystem. Regarding the sovereignty, you know, to do something in these days, especially in in in big data, we need very powerful infrastructure, hardware, GPUs

and we know we have to buy somewhere because we don't uh can make this this this kind of uh infrastructure by ourselves. However, we can buy, we can learn how to use and

especially we can do the software stack because software is easier for us. We we we need for this of course to know how to do that. But we need people, good people,

engineers, computer scientists and doctors, PhDs and what else? So uh regarding this we also have a lot of data public data which is very important and many of

countries would like to know the data you have uh because you have data from uh uh the justice uh the health the education you have of course is a lot of people not a lot of people like uh India

but 200 million people it's a lot of people And uh first of all uh we have to do that sovereignty. We are very concerned about that. But we know we have many steps to give before uh be

absolutely uh uh capable to do all of the things uh necessary to uh accomplish all these tasks. But we are also concerned about the ecosystem. Uh we are in this very moment

buying a supercomputing a public supercomputing to do many things. Of course research we have to put our researchers to make science to solve the problems of the

country and the problems of the world and the problems of the friend countries. We are working together to many countries in this very moment. But we also uh is we also trying to give to

the for example to startups to small companies uh capability to use our infrastructure instead of by processing in another countries or from the big tax. So with this we believe we can

start actually we already started uh we have a plan a the Brazilian uh the Brazilian artificial intelligent plan uh which which was uh launched uh two years ago by president Lula and we are we

believe you are in the correct way. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; So we are going to do very good things. &gt;&gt; Thanks. Thanks Hugo for that uh Brazilian perspective adding on to the

overall viewpoint of the global south. I now turn to an old friend of mine Romesh uh Romesh Rasca who's a professor at MIT and who's been dabbling on this subject uh on a day-to-day basis for a long

time. Uh so Romesh uh America is the most innovative society. I mean it's uh all the innovation on AI is happening there. All the investments in the world 80% of it is being attracted by AI

companies in United States. Uh is this leading to a more inequitable society in the United States because they don't have a safety net and will this bubble ever burst? What's the MIT viewpoint?

[snorts] &gt;&gt; Very easy questions. Thank you. Thank you Amitab. It's great to be here. Um, and I think a lot of the confusion here I think stems from what I would call

kind of the factory era of AI versus the bazar era of AI. And Amandi hinted at it which is right now we have an assumption that a handful of companies maybe four or five companies are going to create

this massive solutions with billions of dollars of investment nuclear power plants and hund00 million salaries. Uh, and we're just going to be downstream users of that. Um, but I think we're

shifting from the factory model to a bazar model where intelligence is commoditized. Models are very small. They can they'll run on the edge. They'll run on your laptops and your PC.

And very soon all of us will have our own micro AIs. You know, we'll run our own AI agents if you want to call them. And when everybody has their own AI agent, we're training our own models.

We're solving our own problems. you know, every math teacher, every diabetic expert, you know, every farmer is creating their own agent, you know, and uh, you know, that's how they're going

to run their life. And once you have this decentralization, then you go into this era where what how do you actually create a society where every individual has their own AI agent.

Um and I would say uh definitely there's a lot of investment in the US but there's I would say and some people are saying that there's an overinvestment in AI infra buildup when the focus should

shift to the network of AI agents which is what happened in the 80s and 90s there was a lot of focus on mainframes and people like actually it's about the PCs but actually it's not even about the

PCs you know at MIT Tim Blossy said it's about the worldwide web it's the internet of those PCs and right now it's not about the AI I it's about the internet of those AIs and that's where

the digital public infrastructure starts playing a very key role because if you want to network all these AI agents there'll be an Amitab agent there'll be Romesh agent but how do we know who we

are how do you authenticate thanks to Aadhaar and UPI and diger and so on all that works out so I have been chatting with Mr. Abhishek Singh uh and Mr. Sophie from India for quite some time

and they strongly encourage us to put together a program leading up to uh this this this summit. Thank you for encouraging us and pushing us and uh with their blessing uh you know we put

together a coalition to create an AI agent for everybody and I think my my team got a little bit overboard so they wanted me to wear this t-shirt which says Duth uh which is you know another

layer uh in DPI uh to see how every individual can have their own AI agent. So I would say when there's an overinvestment I think those folks are going to go focus on maybe ads

&gt;&gt; advertisements but I think now we can probably focus on health. &gt;&gt; So Romesh let me ask you one follow-up question on this. So you've seen u the the build up on computing power in the

United States. You've seen a most uh more optimization of uh comput computational power in China. uh what is the midway path to that uh for a country like India to make it more affordable

make it more accessible uh make it multilingual what is the right approach from MIT perspective &gt;&gt; yeah I would say this phase one of the factory model of AI you know is still

important &gt;&gt; but the focus has to shift to the you know the bazar model you know the network model and whoever make who whoever can make that shift faster uh is

going to be the leader who's going to serve their population really well as opposed to focusing just on phase one. Um, and that is really a network problem rather than AI problem. But in today's

world, you're going to solve the network problem also with AI. Just as in the '90s, you had Dell and HP building PCs. But the company that became much more valuable than them was Cisco because

they built the networking gear. But the networking gear of Cisco is also computer. But the networking was much more important than building the PCs. And the same thing is true now. We have

to build a whole new stack for the networking aspect of it. You know, trust identity, you know, a new DNS, you know, a new ICAN, a new W3C and so on has to emerge. Um, and that's critical.

&gt;&gt; Okay. Uh, so wonderful. Uh, such a delight to be this uh great uh panel here today. Uh, we've had a perspective from Japan, from Brazil. uh we've had a great perspective from the United

Nations and we've had a great perspective from one of the greatest academic institutions in the world MIT on how different governments, different institutions and the United Nations uh

view uh the adoption of AI, how to accelerate greater affordability, accessibility and to make it more accessible to the common citizens of the world and how to transform their lives.

This was a global and international perspective. Uh thank you very much to all of you. I greatly appreciate your presence and you're coming from different parts of the world to join us

at this panel discussion as we now turn to an India inward perspective. Thank you very much ladies and gentlemen. [applause] for a photosh.

Okay. The next panel comes please come come please come here come here &gt;&gt; see what's inside. I'll get a t-shirt. [laughter]

&gt;&gt; Okay, everyone. Please take everyone. &gt;&gt; Thanks. Thanks. Thanks. &gt;&gt; Thanks. &gt;&gt; He's coming. How's this? &gt;&gt; Somebody uh Pratik names

&gt;&gt; quickly. Uh so &gt;&gt; so ladies and gentlemen uh we have a we have a very very uh formidable panel here. Uh let's first uh

give a clap for Mr. Abhishek Singh who's the CEO of my who's [applause] been who's the man behind who's a man behind this summit and who's driven it with great passion a great energy. Uh we have

uh Dr. Jenny Tennyson of the Frontier AI labs. Uh we have another give a big clap for Dr. Vive Ragavan for [applause] the pathbreaking work on multilingual model that SAM has done and made India

proud and uh we have Dr. Gorav Agarval uh from Reliance Gio. So uh what we are doing is uh that our view is that India has a huge distinctive advantage. It has talent, it has skill, it has uh already

built up digital public infrastructure model which enabled India to achieve 50 years of progress in 7 years. uh we have demonstrated that DPI can align incentives, reduce marginal cost

and scale adoption across a billion billion people, bring equity and ensure that there's no technological divide. uh and therefore uh let me say that the question now is whether we can apply the

same uh principles the same institutional imagination to artificial intelligence and uh we for our purposes we believe that there is a 12 to 18 months window and uh if we had to ship

version one of DPI for API in that time frame of 12 to 18 months what would it include how can India drive DP API for API and let me uh start with Abhishek Singh. Uh Abhishek Singh uh is a key

driver. Uh he's the uh the need for institutions that lower adoption costs and build trust, make it accessible, affordable. Uh uh what institutional form is best? How do we drive it? Uh do

we need NPCI like operator? Do we need uh my do we need Abhishek Singh? Do we need a standards body or do we need a federated model across ministries? Uh tell us how do we take it forward? If

you were given 12 months to make DPI for AI, what are the five key things you'll do? Thank you sir. And indeed uh great to hear from the global panelist and now to come to the national perspective. So

like the DPI playbook has lots of lessons that we can adopt for AI. Like in DPI what did we do? what we built the common layers that was required for everyone whether it's identity layer the

payments layer or the data layer the the Aadhaar the UPI the digil locker on top of it we build applications in healthcare agrication agriculture like that the similar model is would be

required in uh AI as well because what does AI need it needs compute it needs data it needs talent talent we have a plenty but what the investment that is required for building common compute

infrastructure is not that every state government or every government department or every entity can do especially for public services. So what we need to do is invest in common

compute infrastructure which we have started doing under India AI mission but that needs to be scaled multiple times over. Second layer this required the data layer because without data you

can't train models you can't build applications. So the AI coach platform which currently has 10,000 data sets that needs to be scaled up further. So different entities both from the public

sector and private sector who hold data they need to contribute data sets there and make it available sharable for people to train models and build applications. The third layer that's

again a common is the foundational model layer. Luckily Vive and Pratush have built server and there are many other Indian sovereign models that are currently in the pipeline. So I believe

that in the next 6 to9 months we'll have four to five foundational models which will on top of these three uh fundamental layers. You will need an orchestration layer with which anybody

who is building an application AI use case in healthcare or agriculture can connect to any of these models leverage the data sets and the compute that is available and offer services inferencing

services at scale. So sir if we have to to sum up if you have to need if you have to scale up AI at population scale to ensure diffusion of AI to ensure that every farmer every student every health

worker has access to these services we will need to maybe expand the compute layer to from what we have today to say 100,000 GPUs expand the data set layer to multiple levels and come out with a

framework in which those who are developing application startups and researchers can leverage this common layer and start building applications at scale. Yeah, but Abishek, don't you need

the Indian private sector to take the lead and push for more and more computing power? It can't be just the government's job and Indian private sector needs to be more aggressive in

getting computing power. Exactly sir. And in fact, I must say that the compute that we have built so far today we came out with a model with the private sector invest into the compute. Government only

subsidizes the end usage. So we are not buying any compute for the government. So the 14 players who have invested in the 38,000 GPUs that need to expand further. We need to have the big

companies that are in India who is operating who have sufficient margins in the other businesses to invest into the 100,000 GPUs or 2,000 GPUs or the AI factories like the west is building. So

that compute backbone will be required and the investment should ideally come from the private sector to make this dream of making AI up for AI a reality. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you Abhishek. We now

turn to uh Dr. Vive uh Ragavan who's uh done some sterling and pathbreaking work and uh you know many years back uh Lee Kuanu the prime minister of uh Singapore said India is a crazy country because it

has uh endless languages and every 15 kilometers you have a new dialect. Uh it's impossible to govern. He said if he was asked to govern India he would fail. Uh what uh Dr. Vive Ragavan has

demonstrated is that what was a disadvantage is actually an advantage through his multilingual model and uh he's done it at optimum cost and he's demonstrated uh that uh India can do a

great great unique uh model uh bringing in India's diversity. Uh so Vive tell us the next challenge for serum to make it what don't you need more and more Indian data why should Indian data flow to open

AI? Why should Indian data flow to Google Gemini? Why shouldn't Indian data flow only to server? Because that'll make you more and more better, more and more sophisticated. Uh you know tomorrow

open AI and Google will be sell taking consuming Indian data and selling you in products to Indians using Indian data at very high cost and that'll be colonization in reverse. So tell us.

No, first of all, uh thank you for inviting me uh on this panel and thank you for your kind words. Uh I think we are at the very beginning of our journey. We're at the very beginning of

our journey. uh I think uh uh while you know I think we've made a good start and I think that but and we're I think we're going to create build some models out put some models out there which are

world class in in in in their category and and we've all we've been doing that over the past few weeks and we hope to do some more but I think the important thing is that these models can actually

reach the next level only when there is usage and and there is usage at a large scale and and I I think that one of the challenges and I and I don't know the answer to this question but one of the

challenges is that we are actually looking at we are actually looking at competing with free right so if if if if if you know and I and I think in in the real world nothing is is is free so and

and if if if all the if all the fraudia models are available for free in any other industry it probably called dumping right uh but but here we we think that this is uh this is something

that is uh So I think that's something that we have to figure out uh how do we actually kind of over time right uh create an ecosystem uh where uh there is uh I mean you know I mean and I've been

the reason we do multilingual is a deep uh you know uh thing for uh you know inclusion and and getting everybody involved in there but uh but it's it's it's interesting right uh that um that

you know we have to figure out that in this era I think and I think that I believe AI probably the most interesting thing that you could compare it to is actually uh nuclear technology and the

world is really has the halves and the have nots and that's that's really where we are at and uh and I think that uh you know uh the question is that u uh you know in in in AI I think and I think I'

I'd openly say it despite all of the things that we're doing uh you know of the US and China are far ahead of us, right? And that's a that's a fact that we have to uh that we have to accept.

But but I think the the then the question is we are at a cusp. Which side of this uh divide do we fall? Do we actually become a digital colony or do we actually become in in in in the in

the nations that that actually have this technology? It literally is that stark. &gt;&gt; So give us give us the uh three key things that uh India needs to do. uh or the global south needs to do not to

become a digital colony. Give us three big things. &gt;&gt; I think see I think one of the things that we have to look at some of these technologies as as Romesh was saying

earlier uh it is not necessarily uh you know the largest model uh that matters but how you are able to orchestrate uh many models to do extremely sophisticated things. If we put focus on

those kinds of things so that you know most things that we need to do governance we need to I mean I for the first time I believe you know I know UPI has been a great success story in the

country uh but I think most other things in our country are actually harder to do uh than than than than in other parts of the world and I think with AI for the first time I think the citizen every

citizen can actually get access can actually you get their things in their lives done simply and with ease and with and that's something that that you know that's something that that uh that we

can do and so therefore the important thing that we need to make sure is how do we make sure that Indian models are used at a large scale and of course it needs to be good if it's not good nobody

will use it but still you know you have to figure out how do you uh make sure that and that's because it's the same thing you you you were saying that right I mean I If you look at it where

&gt;&gt; data is going to make it better and better and better and more sophisticated &gt;&gt; and if you're and and who gets to use the data it really it really does matter right I mean if we were sometimes we

were very happy that India is the second largest user of chat GPT really what does that mean it means that we are exporting our data and importing intelligence and if you go back 100

years it's like we are exporting cotton and importing cloth &gt;&gt; and they'll be there they'll be selling you products at very high cost tomorrow &gt;&gt; whether it is yeah and And I you know

today it's free right tomorrow what it will be we don't know but but but I think this is a and but if you are not in the race you don't have any options. &gt;&gt; Yeah.

&gt;&gt; And that's that's that's the truth of the matter. So and uh so I think that we have the one of the things that I really think is and I was talking to to Gorov just before we got on here. He is you

know last year Deep Seek came out with a model and today there are 10 great Chinese models right? I mean can this can can this be the this year can it the same thing happen in India I think this

is a this is but the one difference which is in China and we have to think about it is you can only use Chinese models in China that's and that's not the case here and that is that something

we need to think about and and and and of course that's not our model that's not what we will do by default but that's something to think about if you really want to uh be a great player in

this in this space Um so uh you know first of all um thank you very much Vive for that uh perspective that outlook and for having done some uh great pathbreaking innovation and uh you know

one of the key things with the AI mission has done is really to put uh uh opened up data sets through AI kosh uh it's uh provided computing power to a lot of our startups and researchers at

low costs and uh I I think India has a lot of talent. So I I personally uh feel that there will be a lot of uh disruption happen happening. Uh you know the race is never won by the first

mover. Uh Clive Osborne did the first laptop. Uh it went burst. He won burst. Actually it was Apple uh which won the race and Alta Vista did the first internet uh Alta Vista was sold at zero

cost zero price and actually the internet race uh was eventually won by Google. So I'm quite sure that slow and steady like server will always win the race. Uh so I have just no doubt that uh

uh and uh we'll make sure that you win that race. So don't worry uh all Indians are behind you. Uh we have uh Dr. Jenny Tennyson uh the you know Jenny great welcome to India first of all great

pleasure to have you and the frontier AI labs uh you know you've largely consumed uh the publicly available internet. Uh the next frontier is going to be private data held by governments, hospitals,

enterprises. Given that this data is often about communities, not just individual, uh how do you access these data sets and how should that be governed? Who negotiates on behalf of

communities whose data is at stake and what's next for the frontier AI labs? &gt;&gt; Thank you very much. And it is a delight to be here although slightly bewildering to be on domestic panel. So I I honestly

&gt;&gt; you you're very much domestic for us. &gt;&gt; Okay. [laughter] I I will feel domesticated. Um uh I actually work for an organization called connected by data which is a

campaigning group for communities to have a powerful say over data and AI. Um, and as already mentioned, access to data is really key in our kind of future for what AI looks like and in particular

those kind of contextdriven context specific small data sets, the bizarre model that has already been talked about. we we need to have a data infrastructure that supports not just

the creation of these big frontier models, but also um the more agentic systems that we're seeing coming and the and the systems that query on demand. Um and there's lots of challenges with

building that kind of data infrastructure, technological ones, financial ones. Um but the ones that I want to focus on are the ones that are to do with people and that are to do

with governance. Um, this kind of data is very often the type of data that people feel most connected with. It's data about their health. It's

data about their finances. It's data about the benefits they receive or the or the income that they get. It's data about their languages, their cultures, their land. Um, and it's often being

paid for, the collection of that is often being paid for by public authorities. Um people are naturally concerned about how that data gets used, how it gets

shared. And in public attitudes research, we not only see the privacy aspects, which people talk about all the time, but also concerns about how it's used ethically, whether it is used for

good, and where uh whether it's used equitably, whether the benefits that are attained from use of that data. And that includes the financial returns from use of that data returned to the people who

are um who originally provided it or that feel ownership over it. And this matters because democracy and democratization is not just about more access. It is also about control and who

benefits. And if we don't tackle those risks, then people will withdraw consent. They will stop using public services because they're worried about how data might be collected. They'll

emit information. They'll provide misinformation and that will I mean if we just care about data that will actually undermine the quality of the data that we use

and the big challenge here is that our current data protection laws which are you know based on the same kind of thing across the world are actually based on um a model that's not fit for purpose in

the AI age. We need to have um we need to have laws and controls that provide protections around collective and societal harms. And we need our data infrastructure to be built with data

institutions, the organizations that can balance the interests of the people with the interests of those who want to use that data and can bring that benefit back to

those people. And that requires us to have more participatory governance mechanisms, things that bring in people's voices in making decisions about who gets access to data, how it

gets used, and how the benefits from that return. Um, so that's the bit that I'm most interested in. We've got a research symposium tomorrow on participatory AI, which uh you're not

all invited to because the room won't hold it. Um but I I really encourage you to take a look at some of the mechanisms that we have for bringing people's voice into the ways in which we decide how

data and AI is used. If if we don't get that right, we will undermine trust and we will not get the adoption that we need from these technologies. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you so much. [snorts]

Uh thank you uh Jenny. And I now turn to Dr. Gorav Agarval who's uh uh heading Reliance Gio uh in terms of technology one of the most creative people around u Gorov I wanted

to ask you uh Reliance Gio has done some pathbreaking work in uh taking mobile telephon DPI to the grassroot level uh why have Indian companies leading companies particularly IT companies, you

know, I mean, they're sitting on huge cash balances. Uh, look at TCS, look at Infosys. Uh, why haven't Reliance Gio and all of you uh taken the lead to make India the champion of AI? Uh why don't

why have you not acquired more computing power? Uh why have you not pushed for technology? What is the bottleneck? Is it regulatory incentive structure trust deficit? What is it? Why haven't you

been uh why shouldn't you have done the first uh few LLMs instead of server doing it? Why should a young startup like server uh beat Reliance Jio at this game? Shouldn't the first multilingual

uh uh model have have come out of Reliance Gio? And why are you people lagging behind? &gt;&gt; I wish I knew the answer. [laughter] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm happy for what Vive has done. Uh

the reason I'm at Reliance actually to change that. &gt;&gt; The reason I joined Reliance couple of years ago is exactly for that reason. &gt;&gt; Uh I used to be at Google Deepind. I

felt Google has thousands of people like me and the reason like I'm doing my bit by joining Reliance to do the same here. uh I I think what happens you know I I've never worked for an IT service

company so I don't know whether I should speak on their behalf but I think other large companies I think uh you know it's it's just a little more Indian it's not even about companies I think we find

you know we we feel satisfied very soon I think you know you know you go to our academia I mean most of the academic professors they have done PhD from the top colleges

most of them have PhDs from external great unities But we don't create the same kind of innovation in India. Yes, resources are one reason but I think it's just that

that aspiration loses way somewhere. I think we have to sort of rekindle that and that's what I was talking to about. I think their success sort of rekindles it for a lot of us. Uh it's not like you

know what serum is doing we are not trying to do we are in that race. Uh and it is like a healthy competition. I I had a mixed emotion when Sir rolled out so many great models. I'm like I'm happy

for India but I'm yeah we are a little behind. Hopefully you know every day I'm like looking at their their Twitter handle to see what next our challenges and hopefully you will so so it's a

great competition. Hopefully you know this will you will not have this question by the time we meet next &gt;&gt; and you will be asking Vive like you are a young startup why are you not

competing against Ryan? I mean you have no baggage [laughter] and V and I will actually relish that competition. &gt;&gt; No no I no I really look forward to that

day and I really want to compliment Reliance for having hired you from Google. So you must you must demonstrate that you are better than serum. I mean uh we we can't you know at at the next

AI meet uh Gorov must demonstrate that you've done remarkable disruption work in this field. So I look forward to that. We still have some time and I you know I've kept some just to add sir

though they can do much more but they have some amazing stuff showed in their geo expo stall in hall number five and uh those of you who want to see what they are trying to do must and the expo

is so designed it begins with serv from hall two and ends at go hall five so the whole [laughter] range is there the whole &gt;&gt; no no that's why you know I raised that

question because Reliance Jio is a very innovative very farreaching company with deep pockets and uh with very deep pockets you know and uh u if anybody can do it it's uh Reliance

Geo so uh it's it's got a unique culture so it can do a huge amount of disruption but I I've got time I've kept some time because uh I've grilled them I want some of you to grill them these four

panelists you'll never get this opportunity again so grill them as much any ladies here who want to &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Go ahead.

&gt;&gt; Question is for Mr. Singh. Such an amazing event. When will we have it next time? &gt;&gt; First just started the three more days. Enjoy. Enjoy where it lasts. At least

when it done next time I will be sitting there and not doing it. [laughter] Okay. Anyone? Any lady here? &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Okay. Yeah. Please go ahead. Sure.

&gt;&gt; So, first of all, congratulations on the great event. This question is like why we are taking so long to compete with why we are late. &gt;&gt; I would don't think that we are late. I

think uh the whole thing has come around like uh uh in technology and this space when was the AI came in 1956 and we have just seen last two years of Chad Gupty moment and trying to judge

the entire history of evolution. what is what we are seeing now is just the beginning what may evolve will be much much more different much more impactful so I don't think we should judge the

entire journey of evolution of this technology over the last almost 70 80 years by what we have seen in the last 2 years there's much more to come and uh teams like servio

will try to show what more is possible then it's not the question will not be the why we are so late &gt;&gt; no I think it's important to say that you know in technology is better to be

uh not a second mover even but to be a third mover you know in the long run you'll be you'll benefit from all the experiences and actually uh you'll make a society far more equitable far more

accessible technology so to my mind we are not late at all uh we'll benefit from all uh uh all that has been done in other parts of the world we'll probably use less uh computational power but

we'll do better we have we skilled our software we'll do better optimization and we will ensure that this technology is taken uh to the people below the poverty line. It's important to ensure

that we are able to incorporate them as we go along in this process. Okay. On that just on that note, by the way, Gio was last in mobility and &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.

&gt;&gt; You know where we are. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. That's &gt;&gt; great. Uh love the conversation. This is a question for the entire panel. Now this entire summit stands for

responsible AI and ethical AI for everyone so that it compounds trust but so far we've seen that it's been a wild wild west situation with private companies taking the lead in future what

is the gold standard or the ideal standard for us a government plus private approach government taking the lead with more regulation or is it status quo

&gt;&gt; anyone can answer &gt;&gt; so uh I would ask Kabishek uh to respond to this and then probably gor and &gt;&gt; it's it's not either or it's not the either the private sector or the

government sector what we have demonstrated in a DPI it's like government private and civil society like the work which institution like is spirit and uh all did foundations and

all for making the India stack possible cannot be discounted it's not only government and private it's like a whole ecosystem that comes together to build impactful solutions during covid you

remember sir was there he was leading when arrog was built or the coin platform was built. It was not it's not that it was an NIC product or a government product.

It required a lot of people volunteers in the private sector who joined in the best of private industry joined in the the best policy makers joined in who enabled the whole thing. So the role of

the government is primarily to be the enabler and the real work is actually be done by the private sector. &gt;&gt; So on that front by the way like I had uh the engagement group on child safety

in the age of AI for Abhishek Singh. So it's his his body I I chair that group. So it's always together. Vive &gt;&gt; that's my other aar by the way. &gt;&gt; Vive any point? No, I I think that uh

you know uh when you look at it, it is not government versus this thing. We all it is has a whole of society approach that needs to be there and I think that &gt;&gt; uh uh we know I mean for example I mean

we are saying that we built a model but certainly we built it because of uh that we the India AI mission has actually given us uh this the the these GPUs to actually train this model right so that

is something that so therefore I think that government at very critical places has to play a very important role the private sector absolutely must take things to the next level and I think

&gt;&gt; so I think the best example of what we did in DPI because digital identity was created bank accounts were opened between 2015 and 17 550 million bank accounts Aadhaar was seeded mobile

number was seeded then private sector took over they competed so India's only country where phone pay competes with Google paym competes with uh you know Amazon pay uh then all these startups

started doing uh insurance, stock market transactions, uh credit, all that. So, it's a lot of private sector play on top of the digital interest layer. I spirit played

a key role uh when we had G20 and the G20 accepted that the way forward is for the rest of the world is through digital public infrastructure. Uh yeah, please madam. I'm a little biased towards

ladies in this panel. &gt;&gt; Okay. Thank you very much. Um just a question in one of the panels we were listening to they said well when it comes to development of technology on

the one hand you have India and the other hand you have ch sorry you have United States and China and then there's the rest of us right and one of the things they were discussing was when it

comes to development maybe certain countries should collaborate together in order to do it faster so my question to you would be on the one hand of course it's very important to have an India

only models and you know compete there but would you be looking at and are you looking at collaborating with some other countries ries around Asia or some other you know regions which would help to be

faster and therefore have this balance a little bit better than what we have today. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Yes, of course. In fact, if you remember the G20 declaration, one of the key

highlights of the G20 declaration was the global DPI repository which was set up which was deployed and as we are discussing on the various working groups in for the AI summit also one of the key

outcomes that been talked about is to create AI commons a you repositive AI use cases that can be deployed and there's more that will be coming in the next two days. I see the organizers

looking at us because the next panel is ready the next session. So I will leave it to sir to conclude. Okay, la last question. Last question. Quick, quick. Yeah, please go ahead.

&gt;&gt; Galvanizing discussion. I you know, thanks for such a galvanizing discussion. I just wanted to have your inputs on how do you see uh the story moving forward where um you know

startups and industry play a huge role in high-end capacity development in our higher educational institutes so that we have more um talent who's hacking into the foundation.

&gt;&gt; Okay. Okay. Got it. Abishek. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Like one way could be that give them exposure to to what is needed. Like any engineer who is graduating, he should know how how coding agents work,

how how to how to actually work with models and all. So curriculum needs to be upgraded, training tools to be provided, lots of uh AI lessons across disciplines because AI cuts across uh

humanities, economics, medicine, law, all sectors. to ensuring that it becomes part of every every &gt;&gt; and not only higher institutions you have to start teaching AI from class 3

onwards now it's very important so ladies and gentlemen we are at exactly 4:30 we want to end this session thank you very much for this very lively vibrant discussion thank you

&gt;&gt; please everyone be seated uh thank you everyone for joining us and sharing such a wonderful session on India's AI session So this is a svenir from India AI impact

summit team. &gt;&gt; Please please move out of the room. We have to prepare for the next session. Please. That's impossible.
