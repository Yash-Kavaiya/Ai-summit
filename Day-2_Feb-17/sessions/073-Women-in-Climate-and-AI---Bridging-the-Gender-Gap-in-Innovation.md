## 📝 Transcript

women uh women's economic empowerment from UN women. We have Mr. Shalab Tundan, regional head of operations and climate change from IFC. [snorts] Um and I'll be the

moderator for today. I'm Zooie. U may I request all the panelists to come in front for a quick picture. Okay. Um so I'm just going to dive right into it because I think we've been set a

good context of the kind of ecosystem work that we've been doing uh in the field of climate um and gender right but here I have a very distinguished and diverse panel to talk about this topic

um I want to first start off with you Puja uh since you're from Salesforce and actually building uh products um on the ground right um We so I know Salesforce is at the forefront of building um agent

force, net zero cloud and so on. Um but but we also have to put this in the context of the realities um in the community. So for example um in South Asia for example we have about 30% of

women in the labor force participation right? uh we have stark realities like 30% I mean women are less likely 30% less likely to even use mobile phones

currently right than men so when we're dealing with these realities um I just want to first um understand from you that through net zero cloud and through agent force uh Salesforce is simplifying

sustainability for startups right but apart from looking at carbon u mitigation and uh tracking ing carbon outcomes. Uh how do uh you report through the these on gender inter uh

inter um gender intentionality of climate investments uh through the companies or the supply chain operations. &gt;&gt; Thanks Julie. And you are right. I think

we've also discussed this before that there is a deep gap in the workforce itself. What I will talk about is if you had to look in at outcome, you would

essentially have to separate into a database for evidence-based decision-m on one hand, which then enables action, right? So the tools that Salesforce has are on the data and analysis layer. So

what this essentially means and I'll talk through both of the ones that you mentioned as the net zero cloud and agent force. NetZero Cloud is a very direct fit when it comes to being able

to get a bird's eyee view of what kind of gender representation exists within an organization. And while this is a fairly vague concept, I think examples really help bring this to light. So for

example, the lowest hanging fruit of course is always going to be how many women are in the organization. What percentage of women in a workforce are women, right? So after that you have

deeper questions which is if you segment this across levels in an organization what is the difference then and we'll all have seen this in our own professional lives that even if there is

more equal representation at the entry level there is significant drop off as you get higher and higher and as older people say there is a glass ceiling right what a tool like net zero cloud

helps you do is aggregate your data and really see what the different points of drop off could be. And this also goes deep enough that you can also look at what is the wage ratio, what is the pay

gap at each level, is there a pay gap at the board level, is there a pay gap at mid seniority, is there a pay gap at entry level? So all of these are essential to enable companies to take

the right kind of decision because a lot of these are implicit biases which don't even get acknowledged until there is a database supporting it. So that's on a net zero cloud. Agent force is a more

it's a tool right. So it enables you to do what you need to do. So this could for example if you're an investments organization you can then assign weight to gender you can figure out a different

scoring system for the investments that you make through agent force. You can also get it to implement guardrails. So asking questions like this year have you made enough investments into women led

organizations. So these are guardrails that can be easily incorporated but it is a customizable product and it'll eventually depend on the end consumer. &gt;&gt; Yeah. No, I really like the point and I

know we were discussing this earlier that um you know things like wage gaps and having less women on the top are not issues in silo. Um they definitely affect how um any product is going to be

built and used as well. Right. It it affects the decision- making on the top. So thank you for bringing that up as well. Um that's great and you talked about how these will impact investment

decisions in the end. It depends on what is the use case for example. Um I'll I'll probably come to you Shalak uh next with that segue. Uh so IFC one is running an accelerator for women led

startups called if she she wins and the end goal is really to channel more funding into women led startups in climate right and uh I mean we are imple implementing that accelerator so we know

that a large part of the accelerator also has a lot of AI solutions right um I want to understand and given the context also of IFC doing this historically there's still a large

credit gap right Now for women about 1.7 trillion USD right now for women also we know that less than 3% of venture capital funding goes into women led startups. So what do you think are the

de-risking mechanisms to um to just look at the this filling up the gap right now? What is IFC looking at? &gt;&gt; Okay, thanks and and and I think Puja we'll probably use your uh tool as IFC

does gender based investing. So at a [clears throat] very high level uh the problem that we are talking about here is lack of credit by womenowned uh entrepreneurs MSMES etc. Just to give a

context within India there are about 64 million MSMES 20 25% are womenowned and of that 90% only rely on informal credit either they get it based on collateral or otherwise there's they don't get

money easily. That is the problem and scale we are talking we are trying to uh tackle when you talk about VC funding and all that's a very small sliver of equity capital going for uh startup

that's a separate problem we can talk about the shei uh uh uh program separately on this sphere what we do is first of all the starting point for all of IFC and world bank group investments

we have our own internal targets 60% of all our investments and advisory have to be gender tacked and by gender tagged we mean there has to be a strong element of uh uh gender embedded in all our

investing. Capital is ultimately we believe that capital is one of the tools which can change behavior. So if you have if you give money along with a gender tagging which forces other banks

and institutions to deploy it for women led entrepreneurs to deploy it in a meaningful way. I'm sure you you all have heard about the term greenwashing. So we don't want

gender washing here. That's why tools like yours are and develop detailed KPIs around how many women own women jobs you created? How many women in leadership you created? How have you created

safeguards for the care economy? Have you made the working environment safe for the women? Have you provided access to technology for the women? Have you provided access to credit for the women?

So all these aspects are a detailed part of the KPIs for gender investing when IC rolls out and that's how we work with partners to push it. Risk sharing instruments are all just products that

come later. You know first let's develop the ecosystem around it. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Great. No thanks for sharing that. Um with that I'll come to you Amar. Um you are as you and women run u

accelerators for women led startups. uh here there are two things that I would like to uh ask you two-part question one is uh we need programming in like mainstream programming for women led

startups to get them into the ecosystem with the right support etc. So how do you see uh programming specifically for women led accelerators coming up? uh what does that ecosystem view look like

in supporting uh the second one that I want to ask is what are the leverage points that you see right now because you work across the region you work across South Asia Southeast Asia here is

where the climate ecosystem is shaping up one in certain countries it's still very nent um and so is the AI ecosystem it's just building up so uh this is a very uh interesting intersectionality to

look at so what do you see are the leverage points right now where where are the entry barriers and where would your uh uh interventions help? &gt;&gt; Sure. Thanks for that question. Uh Zoe,

I think just a two word answer to what those um leverage points are uh is are data and intentionality and I think we have heard about both of these things since yesterday. How the data needs to

be gender inclusive and all innovators need access to data that is gender tagged. Uh and there needs to be intentionality. So it's just not just about having the data but what are you

doing with the data and how can uh companies be more intentional uh in in or not not just companies but any AI interventions are more intentional in having a gender impact and that's where

what you said Puja and what what sir said I think I think comes in very well. I'll just speak a little bit about UN women and who we are and what we do. So we are uh the UN agency dedicated to

gender equality and the empowerment of women. So we work on programs, policies and standards that uphold women's human rights and ensure that every woman and girl lives up to her full potential. And

we do this through multiple ways uh through increasing women's political participation and leadership, ending violence against women, engaging women in aspects of peace and security

processes, um economic empowerment and and etc etc. I won't go into all the details but this involves working both with governments and with private sector to to promote what we call institutional

solutioning and I think that institutional solutioning is really required right now Zoe as you mentioned that some of the climate ecosystems some of the AI ecosystems are still nent and

are getting developed so it is important that um you know institutional solutions are are um incorporated while they get developed. As far as supporting women in climate, women in AI goes, um I think UN

women has always held this position that we don't want to treat women only as beneficiaries. Uh but they are also holders of knowledge that can be used as we as we um you know navigate this

transition. So we have been working on um entrepreneurship support programs specifically uh for women across across South and Southeast Asia. Uh so we just had a program last year which was

focused on ASEAN where we supported uh women across multiple climate tech initiatives. Some had direct AI implications, others had future AI implications. So for instance when I

spoke about data and intentionality um so as far as intentionality goes we often hark back to a framework called the webs which UN women has developed with the UN global compact uh which is a

set of seven principles that helps you think about women in in leadership in the workforce uh in the marketplace in community and things like that. So that's the framework that we refer to.

Uh but when it comes to data, we try to work with all of our entrepreneurs that we support to to to ensure that through their uh work they are generating data that is gender

inclusive. So for instance, one of our entrepreneurs was uh an ESG automator kind of an entity. So when they conducted field visits um to to do their ESG due diligence, we tried tried to

ensure that their data collection tools had a very specific gender angle and not just about women getting um getting reached but what is the impact that's happening on on them so that all of that

can be used later on maybe not right now maybe 6 months down the line to to develop and design more gender- inclusive um interventions. &gt;&gt; Great. And we need this at the ecosystem

level for sure because then that's where it percolates the gender intentionality percolates across all of the effort that goes in. Right. Um I'll come to you Samita now. Um and uh I one maybe just a

two liner on what resilience AI does for everybody first and then I'll come to my question. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much Joey. First of all a huge round of applause for bringing the

conversation of women in tech. Women in climate it is a very hard intersection all of us are here women in finance these are very hard subjects it's not a very easy science so thank you so much

for having us and making us possible &gt;&gt; um my name is Samita I represent a company resilience AI and what we solve is natural disasters a show of hand for floods have you ever experienced heavy

rainfall nice that's a good representation so next time when you are worried about flood and it's an organization that you talk about. Uh think about a tool that

gives you in 30 minutes for every structure that you are in. It can be your office, it can be your child's school, it can be a building that we are in. We give you the answer to what is

the exposure to a natural disaster in 30 minutes using a machine learning tool and AI of course at the core of it. It's built by four women who have coded uh from various aspects. the practitioners

of literature, urban planning, architecture, of course, technology and students of natural disaster for a very long time. &gt;&gt; Great. No, thank you. Um, so I'll come

to the question and we we've heard from uh the developers of tools uh AI tools. We've heard from ecosystem level approaches of uh how do we uh shape this conversation? and how do we build the

right framework so that large uh scale financing goes into the right direction etc. I want to learn what happens on the ground, right? Because one is women leadership. Uh that is the case with

resiliency because you've built it as four women coming together. But also when when we're talking about on the ground, uh we know that women are disproportionately affected by climate

change. They're going to be dis disasters. Um how does resilience AI make sure that these realities are reflected in your models right uh we uh we make sure that women are represented

in the data women are the ones collecting the data and are represented so that then we have that variability uh of impact being reflected properly like how are you doing that

&gt;&gt; perfect that's a very interesting question um what is AI AI is very simple think of it you know pabytes terabytes of data coming together at the same time. What a human brain would take a

longer time, it does it in shorter time. But I always insist you don't remove the human from the loop. So the way resilience 360 works is there is a human assisted loop. Um now humans have women,

men across genders. We represent all genders. The reason is because natural disasters does not discriminate a gender. uh it unevenly definitely treats it because of the geopolit geo

conditions that we live in. So for example, a mother who is um left behind with her child during a flood is not it's getting she's getting more affected because she's left behind. There has to

be a way to find the child a safe place as much as her. Uh while the male of the family is also trying to find another safe place because there are elderly in the houses. So it's a it's a

multi-dimensional facet that comes across when actual uh when a disaster really happens to us when nature is not kind. Now the way resilience 360 interprets is three layers. Layer number

one is um when we do our compute we run the compute in a way that we recognize schools we recognize Angenwaris we recognize in rural America you will have to recognize community centers. The way

it is built is that we recognize the places which has a higher concentration of the population that he's usually left behind. The elderly, the women, the children. We also definitely recognize

male counterparts which are gig workers, construction workers. They left get left behind as well. But these what we call are vulnerable hotspots. So we recognize the hotspots very early on in the

system. So for example if we get uh the entire opraadi pandan we will be able to articulate where are the schools where are the police stations where are the anganaries is there a construction right

now happening and there are workers there that's the first level so recognize the con uh mix the second thing that we do is who should be tackled first um for that we do do

surveys which is called ground truthing after the recognition we run a survey where not just women everybody collects the data but these data are more nuanced around soioeconomic vulnerability.

Social economic means what's your income level? If you're an artisan, you're a woman who is working in craft. You're a man who is working in craft, what is the loss of livelihood that you have? If

you're in a warehouse and you're a promoter of the warehouse, how much business will you lose tomorrow if the inventory is gone? So, we calculate that at a asset level to be able to give a

synthesis or what we call from intelligence to insight, which he and I were talking about. We tell you that okay if your warehouse is gone this is the amount of damage so and you are in a

high risk so you evacuate first &gt;&gt; even if the school is in a low risk zone we say you evacuate second the third is the system is a software you need a laptop that's all you need to access

this system so it's 24 by7 accessible it's literacy at a scale but literacy that is decision- making literacy that is actionable only then can you solve a complex science like natural disaster

&gt;&gt; great uh so you are looking at the entire socioeconomic lens while building the model and that's that's really good to know. What I wanted to understand because now working with so many women

led startups uh what I've realized is that gender intentionality can be very expensive as well. Um it is expensive to build up models that because uh getting this data is expensive. Um uh also from

an investor point of view once you go seeking money uh it's not necessarily looked at as a positive always right uh not to say or most of the times but it is a it is a barrier that's kind of

documented um so how do you look at these two things in terms of practicality and cost and building these so first of all I personally believe that

you we have three people in this panel who are intentional about investing in women both from the grassroot. I come from rural India and I know that SMMES are hugely funded. The problem is that

uh the literacy among women about wealth is still lean but that's the problem we can solve if we know the problem. It's not that funds are not available. We are the country

is absolutely intentional about bringing women to a place in the workforce where we we are able to contribute. Um so I I believe that generating that literacy of what does it mean for you know why

should you have micro finance assets like IFC why should you have access to these money is a very important conversation to have and it has to be at a mass scale. It cannot be done by just

an institution. As a startup, u the investment in women led startups has moved to 8%. But that's in the consumer business. Women in tech and women in climate both

the nature of which is highly complex is still at a very low scale. There needs to be more investment. But I must call out at the same time that there are funds like Kalari Capital which backs

us, Vanicola. There are funds like Colossa ventures. There are funds which are intentional by saying I want to put more money in in woman-led complex structures like climate and tech. Uh so

that's a welcoming thing but we need more of it. I will not shy away from saying that it is not needed. It is enough. It is not enough. Uh the third and very important part about uh this

conversation is please build an ecosystem. Everybody uttered the word. Uh but the problem that we have is we all understand and appreciate ecosystem. We are we are an outsprung of an

ecosystem. Uh but we don't execute it very well. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So the trick is in the doing. Uh my only thing that we see in our organization is

we have u an equal representation of men women and we want to bring transgender in the equation and the second thing that we are doing is retaining the women in the workforce. So the trick is in the

doing all of us have to take that responsibility singularly. I think then we are collectively a better ecosystem. Right. &gt;&gt; So can I add to this a little bit? Uh so

&gt;&gt; access to credit and you mentioned what how can we increase that the data is not there. I think &gt;&gt; as all of you mentioned climate disproportionately uh affects gender AI

is also I've read many reports AI is also disproportionately affecting gender especially in the developed world maybe even here but AI itself will also be the solution for increasing access to

credit. IFC works with not only a lot of VC fund but also with a lot of fintech companies. They are all realizing the power of uh cash flow-based lending, the power of non-colateral lending, the

power of lending to firsttime credit users and therefore they are they have found a white space which can be monetized by really providing credit to women entrepreneurs and so on. So the

trick is to get a lot of that data that you are generating every time you touch a phone or every time you do a UPI payment that's all data that will get captured in the AI IML tools which will

feed into the fintex for improving credit. So I'm fairly positive that AI itself will lead to a solution for improving access to credit. But at the same time as you rightly said skilling

is key. If the if if at the women workforce level we don't skill enough for using that AI properly then then there's again a danger of getting left behind.

&gt;&gt; No that's a that's a great point and and actually a perfect segue to come back to you Fuja. Um I I think both these points is what Salesforce is working on right from your AI for impact uh initiative

where you're looking at how do you create uh good from AI right uh the second portion of it is also you're working and there's a whole emphasis on skilling for AI as well right and we

doing one of the projects and I'm sure you're doing multiple other projects in this area um would just like your thoughts on how also reflecting on Shalab's thoughts on how this is the key

to bringing like AI can solve for uh bridging the gender gap. How do you look at it? &gt;&gt; It's an interesting question because AI also has the potential to deepen the

gender gap. It also has the potential it is truly a matter of where capital flows at the end of the day and what kind of policies are made. Right? But if you had to think about gender representation as

a large complex solution, there's many moving parts to it. One in fact that we probably will not discuss today or at any panel is &gt;&gt; how men have to actually actively

contribute to this, right? &gt;&gt; But and it's critical that is the largest missing piece and we need to at some point look into it. But taking a step back, I think Amity's approach

makes a lot of sense even in the context of AI when you say okay equality of outcome is based on equality of capability and equality of opportunity. Now AI is an essential tool and will

continue to be an essential tool for both. When you look at the capability part, you have mentioned the skilling program that Salesforce runs particularly in tier 2 cities with a

focus on including women. So that is on the capability front. But of course this is required across different themes. You need it in education, you need it in workforces. It's capability building is

a large complex exercise in itself. AI of course also is going to be a mode of education. It already is a mode of education. It will continue to grow as a mode of education and hopefully that

will increase access to education if nothing else and will enable self-arning which might help lower some barriers on the opportunity front. I think um what you said earlier on this kind of

gender intentional investment would also be really critical in doing this. Right. We women focused programs which really look at increasing capital flow to women, increasing the ability of women

to generate wealth. I think that is very very critical and AI will play a role here which is essentially looking at analyzing investments looking at your decision processes historically looking

making sure that this kind of rule is incorporated into your decision making by saying okay have you spoken to these many women how many women led organizations have you invested in year

on year is it falling is it increasing what might be the reasons so AI can enable that process also That's true. No, great. Thank you. Um I'll come to you Amar now. Uh and on a

slightly different angle here. Uh your uh your work is at a regional level, right? Um and we seeing that uh the the climate and AI solutions that are being built one of course they should be uh at

a very local context but they can also be scaled up very quickly across regions right it can be picked up so so a data solution climate AI solution that's built here in India can be replicated

quickly in Sri Lanka can be replicated quickly in Thailand uh and there can be lower uh barriers there uh in the scaling up if we have the right uh platform a regional platform a

multilateral platform uh how does your work uh lead to that? &gt;&gt; Yeah, thanks for joining. Before I answer that, I would just like to reflect on something that my

co-panelist said. So I think when it comes to a disproportionate impact of climate change on women there's actually UN women research that notes that uh in a worst case climate part scenario about

158 million more women and girls globally may be pushed into poverty as a direct result of climate change and 240 more million million more women and girls will face food insecurity. Um and

the number for men is almost half of this. So that kind of shows how um the the impact of climate change is gendered and to what you said Puja how you know AI also has the potential to deepen

gender inequalities. Now I think we heard on some of our earlier panels today how all of us we have inherited some kind of gender bias from our predecessors and undoubtedly we will

knowingly or unknowingly pass it on to our next generation. what we need to be careful of that we don't teach it to our machines and we don't teach it to our AI and that is where the data and

intentionality that I mentioned earlier also also come in um and AI actually becomes a tool for for good rather than rather than deepening um the the gender divide. So just just th those thoughts

but coming to uh your point on uh you know uh taking a more regional approach you're right so UN women and specifically I I work on regional programming so these are um across South

and Southeast Asia and we work with um you know groupings such as the ASEAN uh for example uh to to align country level approaches to climate change or or to AI and we kind of think of five broad five

broad pillars. So I know we are short on time so I just quickly mention them. Maybe I can come back to them a little later but one is developing a regional vision or developing a regional enabling

environment so that all country policies can uh you know can align a little and groupings like the ASEAN can help do that because they often provide guidance to countries on you know frontier topics

of of policym. Um, second is expanding access to affordable finance and I think uh enough has been said about that so I won't I won't spend time on that. Uh, the third is again I'm using the word

but strengthening innovation ecosystems uh and that does not just mean entrepreneurship ecosystems. It also means research ecosystems. It means um you know data capturing ecosystems. Now

we talk about the census for example which is which we're talking about right now in India. But [clears throat] there is also an MSME census right. So how do we how do we ensure that everywhere we

we develop those ecosystems from a gender perspective. Um the the fourth is devising a diverse and regional talent pipeline. Uh because whenever companies or any um intervention has to scale, it

needs local talent. &gt;&gt; So how can that talent pipeline be be developed? And last is not losing um the focus on evidence uh accountability and learning. uh because at the end of the

day we have to be sure that what we are doing is meeting the goals that we intended to to do. So how do we bake in you know learning mechanisms and and um and accountability and evidence

mechanisms from the get-go uh so that we we are ethical in our deployment of of AI and how those guardrails are set from from the get- go. &gt;&gt; Sure. Great. Uh no that seems uh well uh

rounded and structured in approach. Uh I want to come to you very very quickly Samita. Um we we've heard about the ecosystem approaches and and resilience AI um is is a startup that scaled up.

You've had your funding rounds and so on. How easy is it for you to uh explore and tap into these uh market linkages for your u AI tools? &gt;&gt; One must know where to look. Yeah,

&gt;&gt; it's a very important uh part of entrepreneurship. Even if it is a small and medium crafts person, she or he has to know where to trade, how to get the raw material, how

to source, how to sell. So, one must know where to look is a common message that we land for any idea that has to scale including startups like us. It's much more harder when it is scientific

evidence-based startups. Uh things like EV, things like natural disaster. This has a huge component of science. It's not very simple. Uh in those cases, we say uh collect the scientific evidence

and invest a lot of time in research. Um research which so teach the machine beforehand. Be inclusive about women, children, marginalized beforehand. be inclusive about how does it u impact

vulnerable communities how does it impact industries beforehand teach the machine beforehand rather than making it that's the true definition of inclusivity the second part of it how

have we leveraged the ecosystem we have I would say been very fairly successful in knowing where to look so with United Nations we have been deploying this in 75 villages in India where women and men

volunteers from village councils and prahans have come forward to use a technology like this. All they need is a laptop. It has become a part of their village council conversations. Flip the

script. Organizations like a hospitality major in India which has 52 hospital the resorts in India. They're using the same machine to understand. Okay, I have my 52 resorts in multiple places of India.

Can you tell me what is at what grade of exposure? Am I compliant? &gt;&gt; Am I business protected? Are my people protected? And can I manage crisis better? They're using the same tool. Now

that wouldn't have happened if we did not know where to look in an ecosystem. We know that the biggest impact that happens in natural disaster are three. The people we are displaced the

businesses trade. So look at the small and medium businesses. And third is the value chain industries. So we have gone after solving this in natural disasters in three very critical countries which

constitute 50% of the natural disasters of the world. My submission would be look look better know how to look better. &gt;&gt; Wow that's that's a great message to

leave any entrepreneur any solution maker with. Um and last Puja I'll come to you for very quick thoughts. Uh I wanted to learn the role of philanthropy in this whole um aspect of climate AI

and gender and this intersectionality because we all know that we've spoken about private capital coming in. And we've spoken about uh entrepreneurs and um and private companies uh leading uh

solutions but we all know that this gap is very very wide and we do need philanthropist coming in we do need this money coming in uh at least at the beginning uh before when the systems are

getting set in place right um Salesforce has a large uh program around this uh it also gives uh a lot of these tools at a very subsidized rate to nonprofits and educational institutions. Uh just some

thoughts on this the role of London. &gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely. Um so Salesforce has what it calls the 111 model which essentially says we'll give 1% of our time 1% of our equity 1% of our product

to this type of cause right if you look at equality or equal outcome as a multi-layered issue we are trying to tackle it at every part of this value chain. So of course like I was saying

earlier it is a high focus for us to ensure that skilling on AI is inclusive across genders across regions so that it doesn't become a gated good in a sense that it is not only for those with

privilege to access. Similarly what we are looking at is providing our tools at a subsidized rate to nonprofits. And here when we do this kind of selection, it is very very purposefully gender

weighted. It's not a good to have. It is a must have. It is a gender weighted way of doing it. And now we've scaled our tools across I think 64,000 um nonprofits globally. Now the role of

philanthropy of course is far greater than just providing tools. It requires interventions in every way possible. You need to think about child care on one hand to ensure that women are more

represented at the workplace. You need to think about interventions on data collection which is also really critical. If you're collecting climate data from the grassroots firstly that

data needs to be funded then to make sure that it's gender inclusive that needs an additional degree of funding. Like you said these are expensive problems and every kind of funding that

can be unlocked needs to be unlocked for something like this. No, thank you. Great. Uh, I think we've we've spoken about a lot of things on this panel. I think it was very wide uh

diverse uh discussion. I just have about five to six minutes. Probably one or two questions from the audience is what we can take up. Uh if there is anyone who wants to ask okay

for Thank you. Uh I think it it was a question both to Salab G as well as Sam G. I think there was a lot of conversation around the opportunities

you've spoken about but in terms of the challenges around the data uh for example the community data around where uh some of the flooding is maximum impacted or where the heat uh island

effect is very high and for you Shalab like in terms of you mentioned that there is this gap in credit but is is there data that is needed to substantiate that women are perhaps

better more creditw worthy and stuff like that. So are there any challenges that you face from a local data perspective that we still need to push for?

&gt;&gt; Yes, absolutely. I think the the data gap definitely exists. There is uh for example there are slivers of credit where there is good data. So when we talk to let's say chairman of HDFC bank

etc. They say when we give loans to for housing to women generally the credit profile and the repayment profile is much better than men but we need it across all aspects of credit and that is

slowly getting built up as a lot of the fintexs are working on it that is slowly getting p built up so if you have a startup idea to build up the data stack for this I think there'll be a lot of

demand from a lot of the fintexsu in this space and that's what that again links to the point I was making earlier To increase the credit which is not backed by collateral, we need a lot of

the data to substantiate the repayment of loan which would include things like behavioral profile, things like payment profile, things like cash flow profile and so on.

&gt;&gt; Perfect. I I won't touch finance today. [laughter] I I'll stay on the science uh for natural disasters. You said the urban heat island effect. You also mentioned

how do you understand whether the flood is in a vulnerable location? Um we have a different thesis into this conversation. We uh believe that data is abandoned. We believe in it and that's

the fundamental way that the model has been designed because if you start designing an AI model or a machine learning tool with a belief that data is not enough there it it can go into a

rabbit hole from where you can never come out. Uh so when we started our work we believed that okay when we think of urban heat island effect you just don't need temperatures do you? You need a lot

of other variables there. Can you use proxies? And proxies are always when we say something as a proxy, remember in the world of AI, it has to be at a 95%

equality. It it has to mimic. It's not that it's a bad data set. So practitioners when they come and start building an AI tool and start applying it to solve a problem, there are three

things we do better. Number one, we ask the right questions. Number two, we know where to look. And number three, we understand and value that data will never be enough. So you use with

proxies, but you also then ground truth it through survey intelligence. But by that time you already have your first level intel which is let's say at at least 90% accuracy. Now your journey is

from 90 to 96% accuracy is a journey you can cover. That's how we have done urban heat island by the way. We do it at 96% confidence. We have 8.9 million structures in 200 locations all over the

world. It has taken us time to build but we knew where to look and it came because of decades of experience among the girls and the boys of this team. Okay. Uh my next question is for Amma

sir. So earlier you expressed the concern that how our predecessors have passed this biasness of men and women uh amongst our and how unknowingly we might also transfer it. And you might also

said that we need to uh train the AI in a specific way so as to make sure it it doesn't do this same biasness. However, uh uh from what I have learned is that the

AI is specifically trained on the data sets and data sets are more uh specific on human humans which are making the data sets. So an in a indirect way we have actually transferred our biasness

to those specific data sets as well. So my question to you was that is what might specific methodologies that you would suggest that we can train our AI in such a way that we can modify the

data sets in such a way so that we reduce the biasness. &gt;&gt; Right. So as as I mentioned as some of these infrastructure is getting built it is important to look at data and

intentionality from the get-go. So I absolutely agree with you that uh the way AI is being trained right now is probably on data sets that are already biased. But which is why there are

efforts ongoing uh from the UN system side and from other entities that are working on the ethics of AI to figure out how can um you know trial data sets be developed and deployed um in such a

way that AI tools can learn from them and even if the underlying data sets are are maybe biased, how can AI itself be used to recognize that bias and counter that bias as AI learns. Uh so maybe

maybe some of my other colleagues can speak a little bit more but yeah &gt;&gt; there is this whole I'm not an expert on this but there is this whole research going on on something called sentiment

analysis and EQ analysis which captures some of the nonh hard data that may be there and that's where trying to remove the biases. &gt;&gt; Yeah. uh if you're familiar with

anthropics models for example which use constitutional AI which essentially there is a set of rules which guides the output I think that is the simplest response you have here but that of

course is something that can be gamed and people have gamed it to make sure that they get very different outputs so I would say it's a process of one having this kind of constitutional approach to

it and two over time figuring out what the misuse arising out of this kind of software is eliminating it one by one in addition to what already has been.

&gt;&gt; Uh great. Thank you so much. This has been a lovely session. I'm sorry we can't take more questions but you can meet the speakers offline. Um I I mean I really thank you all for such a for

being such a lovely audience. We've enjoyed the session. Um and yeah, I really have to close because we've been given strict instructions. Thank you.
