## 📝 Transcript

A very good morning. Such a privilege to be addressing all of you here. And um let me begin by acknowledging this partnership. The Royal Society, United Kingdom, Department of Empowerment of

Persons with Disabilities jointly convened by the Quantum Hub. What we see here on the floor ahead of us, a civil society organization, one of the world's oldest scientificmies

and a department from government of India. When all three of us subsets come around to a theme, it definitely tells us that there is something very important in the question of AI and

disability inclusion and that has moved from the margins to the mainstream. It is no longer a niche concern. It is a government imperative. Um 200 million That's a number that's a

very conservative estimate of the number of Indians living with significant disabilities based on WH's global prevalence figure of about 16% though our census which is widely uh quoted

data and the only data available 2011 talked about 26.8 million a figure that everyone experts or otherwise acknowledge as severely undercount and the gap between these two numbers the

200 million as per WH and the 26.8 8 million as per the 211 census is not a statistical curiosity. I think it is a measure of invisibility and the acceptance of disability in a society

like India 3% now that number is in some of the lowincome settings the proportion of people who have access to assistive products and in the high inome countries

I'm told it's anything between 80 to 90%. for a country like India in today we are somewhere in between probably closer to the lower end in the rural areas

3.5 billion another number it is the WH's projection of people who will need assistive technology by 2050 and not a very distant future and this is the generation being born today so the

question here is not whether AI can help it manifestedly can. The question is whether we can design, deploy and scale AI solutions in the way that actually reach the people who need it the most.

Not in London, not in San Francisco, not in New Delhi, but also in Lur, in Shiliguri, in Sambulpur. So I believe that India stands today not just as a consumer of artificial

intelligence but also as its architect with the India AI mission. We are building the digital rails for a billion aspirations. However, as we discuss data, compute and sovereignity, I must

draw an attention to a critical demographic that comprises of these disabled people that still we don't have the actual count of. What I also want to um ask the audience to give a thought to

and the panelists please is about the risk of algorithmic exclusion. So if a voice recognized model cannot understand a disrupted speech which is known as daisarthic speech or if a hiring

algorithm flags a neurode divergent candidate as unfocused because the eye movements are far too fast we are not just failing to be accessible but we are automating the discretion so this is

something that I would want all the minds in this room to put a thought to uh we of course are at that point in life and a stage in society where we are moving towards uh mandatory

non-negotiable guidelines for the ICT products which would include websites portal apps both government and private sector we are talking about technical standards we have an Indian standard we

need to make it completely mandatory which is completely non-negotiable and that has been the direction of the Rajiv ratory case and we as a department and as stakeholders are constantly striving

to ensure that we do come about with such guidelines that are um acceptable to the industry as a whole but actually completely enforcable and that there should be a mechanism to ensure that

that enforcibility plays its part very very strongly and I think with that we also need to understand that AI should be AI for all which means that not just solving

complex problems but building resilient AI ecosystems that are scalable, that's economical and that spread to the wide corners of the country as a whole. That is a very important aspect that I would

like AI entrepreneurs, inventors and innovators to really think about. Uh we as a department have been anchoring startups in the AI field. We have a strategic partnership with the assisted

tech foundation Bangalore. We also need to highlight the important work that our national institutes are undertaking using AI. The NIPID in Sikandra developed the Indian test of

intelligence which is a culturally conceptualized IQ assessment tool and is now exploring AI enhanced adaptive screening. We are also have very important startups that have shown

commercial products like Annie of Tinker Labs. We also have Tester Labs who have created KBO. But the key to AI to bring about real change is to produce solutions that reach the length and

breadth of the country and something that I repeatedly will um bring to focus in this discussion. While India's digital public infrastructure has put in place a great

powerful advantage, we need to also build on it further. And I think um it's immensely powerful to feel that how a visually impaired person in a small village in Kerala can now access

government services through voice in the language that he understands. A hearing impaired farmer in Telangana once they get realtime captioning in Telu u on a 3,000 rupee or a 5,000 rupees smartphone

is what would be required. I'm told in a report uh by the Royal Society that um in the UK people with disability would probably spend a,000 pounds annually u or per month but in India a AI solution

which is costing more than 5,000 also needs to be reworked. It needs to be economical and that is what I would urge all all of you to really put your minds together and think about it. Um thank

you for very patiently listening to me. I look forward to the discussions today and let's make AI truly accessible. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much Manik ma'am. Uh so

before the next presentation uh we have a request from the photographer here that can we have a small uh speaker and panelist photo so that you may get it at the end of the session.

&gt;&gt; Why don't you also come in for the speaker? &gt;&gt; Yeah. I think also should also come in for this photo. &gt;&gt; Join in for this photo.

&gt;&gt; Yeah. Next to me. &gt;&gt; You want me to Right in the middle. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Um I would also like to point out that the sign language interpreter is standing on that side of the room. Uh now we can uh now I'd like to call Professor Allison Noble, vice president

the Royal Society for the technical presentation. Thank you very much and thank you very much for the quantum hub for um inviting us um and also for for the the Royal

Society to partner on this. Can I have the the next slide please? So for those of you who don't know the Royal Society is the National Academy of Science for the UK. It's been going many

many years. It's it's known for its fellows. of our most famous fellows um is in fact um Steven Hawkins who of course himself was a a disabled um scientist. But the Royal Society beyond

having a fellowship also and supports grants and publications also does some work in science policy and I was going to touch on a piece of work in science policy that um that the the Royal

Society produced last year. Next slide. the report and you've got the QR code here. This is actually the executive summary of this report. Um it's its goal was to encourage more of inclusive

development and adoption of digital assisted technologies and this is across work, play, rest and care. As also has been touched on by the earlier speaker, there are about 1.3 billion people

globally experience disability. Um and of course we do know digital assistive tech has been developing um and does help them become more independent. AI is adding to that and it's a real

opportunity but we've also got to be thinking about how it it it will be adopted in the um correct way. So there are known on ongoing barriers. the high cost, limited availability, low

awareness, lack of trained personnel to help people use the technology and of course in inadequate finance to be able to afford. Next slide. So the methodology that we used to

produce this report um it had an e expert international um committee um there was a survey up to about 800 people and focus groups. It involved um also a survey of of members of the

British public and in fact over um 100 experts were involved in the evidence gatherery for the report. We also commissioned pieces on disability data and also um small data and how you can

um be using that within the context of AI and also there's a a case study analysis looking at the UK, US, India and Kenya to look at the state of art in this space.

Next slide. Just to summarize this this slides really is is the highle summary of some of the outputs and it comes under the titles of include access and improve.

Um and there there's important under include that technologies must be designed inclusively and must involve the end users in terms of access that we need to be better at providing digital

um um assisted technology that's affordable and that we have the digital infrastructures to be able to use the tech. And another a third pillar here is the improve is in terms of disability

data that it must be high quality and representative and there is a long way to go to be able to achieve that. Next slide. So looking at the recommendations um

under transformed disability data collection here it's important to shift from the narrow identity based definitions we use today for disability to ones that really represent functional

challenges and limitations um of the individuals and we all know this underpins a lot of AI work that better data leads to um better technology design and also pol polic policy making.

Another recommendation, can we go back? Um, is to recognize smartphones as an assistive technology. Um we have things like um white sticks, your hearing aids, but today smartphones are not deemed to

be um an example, but they are very much a vital assistive tools and that government should treat these smart um phones as like other assistive technologies.

And finally, embedding co-design from day one involve disabled people um at all stages of development and that means that the tech solutions are going to be grounded in lived experience.

Next slide. And just to place that in the words of one of the engineers who was involved in in this report, Dr. Vince Surf um who said often people who make software don't have intuition about

how to make it accessible. Putting a blindfold on does not give you intuition about what works or or of or how for someone who is blind. You really need to understand what does and doesn't work.

Next slide. And now to place that in perspective, I'm going to end with a short video which was from some of the participants in this this report who are going to be expressing their views of

technology in their own worlds. Can we play the video please? How would sister has made a big impact to my life? I would argue it's the other way around.

The the less I notice uh the digital assisted technology uh the better. Assisted technology has enabled me to have a voice. I can also go on the internet which I couldn't do

before. &gt;&gt; Um, Sophia uses her headrest her head to type. So when she wants to sell something, she uses her eyes. &gt;&gt; That's right.

&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; I can't use any bank because I can't use a phone myself. This takeaway is my independence. I would like a mobile phone that is I

also would like something that says what I am thinking. Hi, my name is Sahira Khan. [music] I am a freelance artist and creative. So, I use my iPhone laptop and I use this

every day. The big barrier is when there's no Wi-Fi or I have no data that's really difficult to access anything. I might not have insurance for my iPhone or my laptop. And if it is

damaged or broken, I know it's quite expensive to get this amazing person because they would know what to look for. They know what perspective is. If

it's a hearing person creating the technology, the hearing person needs to understand what are the needs of the people, what are the access. It's so important. It's so so important

that disabled people are involved in the designing of assisted technology. I think I can tell it straight away if they haven't. I think has a I use it all the time. It just it

can't be a solution to every single problem. And people helping people is not always going to be necessary. Thank you so much uh professor Allison

Noble. Uh now we have an exciting multistakeholder panel uh for the introductions and the panel itself. I'd like to hand over this to Nipple. &gt;&gt; Thank you and thank you everybody for

joining us here. Uh am I audible? Is my mic working? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Can everybody hear me? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay. I just need to put my head

down and speak, I guess. Yeah. I think we need mics with the air as well, I guess, that recognize uh &gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Thank you. And that's a challenge for you to come up with the

mic with the air maybe. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Uh but uh thank you everybody for joining us here. And I think it's great that at a major AI impact summit discussion on disability has been

integrated. Disability is such an intersectional issue and often at these major international conversations it's forgotten. So kudos to matey and kudos to DPWD and the Royal Society as well

who have partnered with us on this event and thank you so much for that. Uh I would like to thank Manit ma'am who gave a very powerful speech on what the government is doing towards disability

and technology and I think one simple example of how much he has embraced technology is that if you tag her on LinkedIn you'll always get a response. So thank you so much. I think you'll get

100 tags after today and I would like to whatever you can keep sitting as well if you want. Yeah, you can button whenever you want and uh thank you so much

professor Alison No as well. What a wonderful presentation on how technology is empowering persons with disabilities and I think my takeaway was really from that video where it was said that when

we really look at any technology we can find out whether people with disabilities have been used in decision making in it as well you know to see how inclusive they are. So I have four

powerful panelists with me and I have very limited time. So how we're going to go about it is that we're going to give three minutes to everybody and I'm going to ask one specific question to each and

every panelist there. Survi there in the front row. Can you raise your handi for the panelists she'll be having a timer for accessibility requirements for Amar and also mention what the timer says

after 2 minutes uh when two minutes are up so that you can wrap up in three minutes. Oh, you can see it. Okay, great. Sorry. And we're going to start with the first

pan this year, Dr. Andrew Fleming, who is right in the middle. His team in the T20 World Cup has almost lost all matches, but they ended up winning them all. So, I'm sure he's charged up here.

Uh Dr. Andrew is a British SHI commissioner to East and Northeast India. And uh apart from that, he also lives with a learning disability. I was on a panel with him at British Council a

couple of weeks back and I was really impressed with the passion he comes in uh with towards learning disabilities uh in that sense and he's a big embracer of technology as well. You can find him

believe it or not as Andrew 007 on Instagram. Am I right? &gt;&gt; UK &gt;&gt; Andrew 007 UK &gt;&gt; Andrew 007 UK. So he is the true James

Bond for disability. &gt;&gt; Uh Dr. Andrew uh my question to you really is that on early education uh you know drawing on UK's experience with and your own experience as a lived

experience of dyslexia and dyspraxia. How have you seen AI interventions in early education empower persons with disabilities? Uh yeah, over to you. &gt;&gt; Sure. Um if I think back, there's a

phrase, isn't there, that school days are the happiest days of your life. And I can tell you that mine in the 70s as somebody with neurodeiverse uh profile but not recognized at all, it was the

most miserable and unhappy days of my life. Um, I famously remember when my head teacher came on my last day of primary school and told me I'd be lucky to get a job picking rubbish. Luckily,

she was wrong. Not that there's anything wrong with picking rubbish, but um, it was very, very difficult. I remember the first time that anything even remotely electronic came into my

classroom was when I was 11. Um, and um, only the most clever kids were allowed to go near it, so I wasn't allowed to touch it. So uh that was my first experience with uh anything like this.

But you know I look ahead AIdriven interventions in early education have been revolutionizing support for children with learning disabilities in the last decade or two. I have a child

who's also neurodeiverse. So I have that experience as well as my own um experience and I've seen how this has impact um children under UK special educational needs for disabilities

framework which is led by our department for education. Recent advances include adoptive learning platforms that tailor content to be meeting individual needs, speechtoext tools and real-time feedback

systems. So as somebody you know my profile is dyslexia and dyspraxia my child's my my youngest son is uh dyslexic and also has a really witnessed firsthand how

powerfully a AI powered reading aids and organizational tools have been able to foster much more independence much more confidence and much more academic progress.

And these technologies complemented by traditional support provide personalized scaffolding which reduce barriers and enable educators to intervene more effectively and compassionately. Um so

this is this is this is this is how I see it in the UK to now. Is everything perfect and right yet? Absolutely not. There's still a long way to go. there's a lot of inconsistencies

um and um you know a lot of things that have been designed to support people um with disabilities may not as I've already come across been supported by people who um actually have those

experiences um themselves. I think what is really um important though in the UK and as I've seen different different ideas different pilots come and go different ways my son has been helped is

that you know some some some some initiatives have been stopped because scalability or other issues of fairness as you mentioned ma'am um you know haven't haven't been quite right. So the

lesson is responsible failure is part of inclusive innovation especially when vulnerable groups are affected and I think if we keep that in our mind wherever that will also be very

powerful. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. Um I'm going to go to Augustia. Uh Augustia is the director of concept engineering at Meta and a lot of meta's

interventions in terms of accessibility I think uh are because of him. So thank you so much for making inclusive technology and what you're doing towards it. Uh August I want to ask you uh two

questions two interrelated questions. Uh one really is on accessibility and privacy. uh you know there's the there there's this thinking in civil society especially that accessibility and

privacy are enemies of each other and to get one you need to sacrifice the other so what really is the right balance uh between the two and how do we ensure it and a second question is on AI bias

because a lot of people have been writing to me specifically after you know we named this panel that AI for disability inclusion that why you not talking about bias as well so as AI

scales and becomes embedded across everyday environments this amplifying default exclusions by learning from mainstream data. So, how can AI companies really get away from that AI

bias? What is AI bias? And yeah, over to you. &gt;&gt; Excellent. Thank you for the very kind introduction. Um, I think we'll start with the privacy question. Of course,

this is a very touchy one and there's some guard rails maybe that I shouldn't cross, but I'll do my best. Um, I actually want to pose a question back to you in the audience and I don't know the

answer to it, but I think it's a good thought experiment. Suppose everybody in the world were blind and somebody developed a technology that gave one the ability to see. How might that be

received by society? It would probably be considered a grave transgression on privacy because cultural norms would assume that vision with with light was not a thing. Um, but over time, as long

as the technology were democratized, I presume that society would adapt. Um, I don't know whether this is a morally right or wrong thing, though. But I

think that's what would happen. I think we're at a very interesting crossroads right now where the development of technologies, particularly with uh AI and LLMs, has the potential to do

amazingly good things. provide people without hearing the ability to understand speech, provide people without vision, the ability to understand what's going on at a

distance, but also it opens up a lot of uh very compelling questions, right? People have a societal understanding that when they're out in public, they're probably

not being recorded. And that may be an assumption that is of the past. Um, I know that society will eventually take on. &gt;&gt; I think we have a bit of time.

&gt;&gt; Okay. So, I I don't I don't know when it will happen and I'm not even sure where the right balance is. I do think that, you know, both sides of the conversation I'm

not trying to equivocate here, but I think I think both sides will probably be right to some extent. I think that the AI enthusiast camp uh has made analogies towards for example cell

phones, right? when cell phones first became a thing and cameras were smartphones maybe cameras became ubiquitous there was a lot of concern about the privacy ramifications of that

but society's kind of adapted um I think that the pro privacy camp probably has some compelling things to say about that as well um I'm not sure all that societal adaption is a good thing I just

read an article in I think it was the Wall Street Journal about how people don't dance in public as much anymore right because they're worried about being recorded. Um,

so overall I think the future will be different. I'm very enthusiastic about, you know, seeing my mother who cannot see, have the ability to be independent

and get from point A to point B with an autonomous vehicle. But I do think that there's going to be some interesting ramifications on privacy. And I don't have an amazing

answer for it. Uh, I think your second question is around bias. Um, and I think I don't have to wax too long on this because I think it was answered beautifully during the keynote. Um,

nothing about us without us is a phrase I've heard a lot in uh in the context of developing assistive technology, right? Building with people who are actually going to use the stuff is the best way

to make it good. Um, I think a model is only good as good as it's training data. And so the critical thing is to make sure that you're involving people with disabilities in the planning process of

how you train and that you're collecting training data that's relevant. Um I also think that it's extremely important for people who are designing technology to not think about the

disability community as other or out group because I think there's actually a a birectional benefit here. Um, when we develop technologies that meet the needs of, you know, what a mainstream designer

might consider the corner cases or the extremes, we actually make it better for everybody. Um, and there's so many examples of that. In in the United States, we call it the curb cut effect.

If you look at sidewalks, there's divots in the curbs. They're ubiquitous because of legislation to protect the rights of people with mobility issues and wheelchairs. But anybody who is using a

stroller, shopping cart, luggage benefits from it. Um, and so I think there's actually an economic incentive, even if it's not apparent in the short term, to technology companies developing

AI models to make sure their training data is inclusive. It's not just about good press or good PR. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much.

There's some problem. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah, I just hold it. Can you give him a hand? Can you give him a hand? I'll just hold it. So, hi Amar. I'm going to come to you

next. And uh thank you so much Austria for that beautiful presentation. I don't think Yeah. Can you hear me? Yeah. Uh can you hear me now? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Is this better?

&gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Uh thank you so much August. I think you answered both those questions beautifully and you also concluded by saying that there's a business case for accessibility in AI.

Uh there's you know the before going to my next speaker I'm also going to say there's there's a legal case for accessibility in AI because if you don't uh make your software accessible this

person is going to sue you. That's our uh co-ounder of mission accessibility. Amar, thank you so much for uh joining us. Uh what I would like to know from you is that you know both as a lived

experience as a person with a visual disability in India and as a lawyer with a visual disability, how has AI really empowered your life and uh what are the challenges you still face while uh uh

using various AI tools? &gt;&gt; Sure. Thank you, Nepun. Um AI has the potential to either include people at scale or exclude people at scale. Right? So when AI came into my life, it really

offered me four things. Access to information. So for example, as a lawyer, I was not able to read handwritten documents earlier. I was not able to consume information embedded

within screenshots. I was not able to consume information which was screen shared on a team's call. But with the AI coming in, I was able to do all of this. What this offered me is a professional

competitiveness and I was able to prove that I am a person who can deliver service with excellence. Right? Information about accessibility of the environment around me. Right? Whether it

is reading signboards, whether it is identifying objects, whether it is access to environment, information around navigation, uh both in my professional life as well

as in my personal life or social life. When I'm in a conference, I'm able to read the printed documents that are handed as part of the agenda papers. when I am in my personal life, if

there's a girl with blindness who wants to test pregnancy without telling anybody else for the for the uh for for keeping it private, the person is able to take a screenshot from the result and

scan it and understand what it it is conveying, right? Uh so in that sense AI has been a great enabler. But I'll also point out what are the current challenges. In terms of current

challenges, one problem that we face is lack of inclusive training data sets, right? Or or a discriminatory design. So for example, when facial verification was designed, it was assumed that it

would work for everybody. As a result, the EKYC did not work for persons with disabilities. As a result, people with blindness were not able to do facial verification, biometric verification in

some cases. that prompted me to go to Supreme Court to get a judgment out on that. Right? Um so those are some of the uh ways in which AI can exclude. But what is the way forward if I may say so

right way forward has to be because there is a strong law. Today the problem is not absence of law. The problem is absence of enforcement mechanism and that is what we need to fix today. So

making sure that at the time of procurement and contractual commit uh uh commitments it is ensured that accessibility has to be ensured by design. Accessibility audits,

accessibility conformance reports are a must without which the product should not give uh get access to market. Also the fact that people with disabilities should be involved as part

of testing and design are some of the key components that we should focus on to make AI more inclusive. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Uh our last speaker is someone I wanted to come to last because I think

everybody in the disability sector today knows him. Uh Mr. Tupar Mundday from who heads disability in Maharashtra. Uh he's really a people's officer and I think uh he's shaping up the dis shaping up the

disability ecosystem in more ways than one. And uh you know I was just interacting with him before this panel and he was telling me about how AI has really played a major role in terms of

governance in Maharashtra specifically for disabled people. So I would love to know how you using AI sir and uh what uh governance in that sense and what can other states learn from you?

Uh thank you Nepun. Uh uh yeah as your speaker has spoken and everybody knows uh is a futuristic technology. Uh but it has it own challenges uh about it inclusiveness, accessibility,

availability, affordability. Uh all these we need to include by thinking by design. Uh particularly for persons with disabilities. uh as uh Amar was saying law is very

powerful uh but implementation is a challenge particularly about uh whether it's digital content or accessible websites or portal that's that's a big challenge for the persons with

disabilities to access services uh leave on just information. So unless the persons with disability get services which he or she is expected to get uh either from the public sector or the

private sector uh uh the tool will not be uh truly enabler and empowering in true sense. What in Maharashtra uh we have been doing is uh using uh technology to the large. uh now we have

designed uh uh one single portal unified portal uh for persons with uh disabilities in Maharashtra. It's about to be inaugurated in a week's time but it is end to end solution for each

persons with disabilities whether he wants to access all the services of government whether he wants to avail uh some scheme to apply or he wants to uh know about what schemes are available

for persons with disabilities. not only in the persons with disability department but different other departments. Now the portal is called uh uh Danga Sahay portal and it's available

on Dangai portal.go.in uh once you log in then you can profile once some details information is shot by you and once that he does uh the the portal does profiling you are popped up

with uh uh the information that what are the schemes you are eligible for automatically. So you come to know these are the schemes you are eligible based on the information which are fed in the

system and you can directly apply on that. So while applying also the again the portal or the application does not call for the information which are already fed in it fetches from the back

end and the information which is available with different portals of the government is accessed by API. For example, UDI data is accessed by API. Uh even uh other card data is accessed by

API. So you don't need the government doesn't need to ask for that data just only number or something basic information will seek and system itself will fetch that data based on that uh

that there will be u uh prediction or there will be analysis of the profiling and the person will be able to know what scheme she is entitled for where is it available uh what are those criterias

for eligibility what are uh who are eligible all those things will be available at one click that is first pass Second is what we are doing is as uh this sector is very diverse sector

and we need all institutions, private organizations, citizens organization to be partnering with us so that we can really empower persons with disabilities and as act itself in sizes that NOS's

and institutions need to be empowered and they have to be uh collaborators and they need to register with the government so that they are implementing uh uh as per the law uh of Accessibility

availability or uh persons with disabilities act what we call 2016 act. Now to do that we have all institutions registered there or we have the information who have been dregistered or

somebody has a complaint about it they can really go on that and uh use that we have already started with uh um chatbot it rolled out in month of November and it is a grievance redressal

chatbot information chatbot now for last since 7th November we have got more than 5,000 grievances of which almost um except 300 all are resolved within an average time taken for them resolving

grievances is 5 days. So we are tracking that we get the information we are analyzing that gear or agreeances or more and you'll be surprised to know that most of the grievances which we

received are about discrimination about accessibility in the services. That's why the solution uh with the help of a and other tools. I think this is just the beginning uh where uh this portal

can really work as a one stop solution for all the u issues uh the person with disability wants to deal with the government and the institutions. I think there is a lot lot many things to do lot

uh lot more uh thinking is to be done but I think we have begun and we can give go a long way forward. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much sir. I'm going to open it up to the audience

for one question. So I have a question sir. the uh person with disability in India as statistics say 70% live in a rural area and more than 70%

of all the disability uh statistics are unemployed. So how AI can uplift the person with disability in a aspect of employment and they can be uh more streamlined in a employability aspect of

uh inclusion of AI through that. &gt;&gt; Sure. Thank you. There's another mic so we close questions after that. Yeah, take me. &gt;&gt; I'm sticking my head out here. Uh I uh

designed uh for Aadhaar. So I've been reading some of the transformation of a new app and uh that Supreme Court judgment on face authentication which I believe some eight lakh people don't get

access to are some of the things which are very difficult problems to solve and we are thinking about it. So I'm a designer by background and I'm leading that effort.

uh one of the things I wanted the panel to talk about anybody is the whole uh idea of multilingual and multimodal. How are uh the technology people looking at how you can combine both these to uh

enable the access whether uh of of whatever kind of uh disability this is some of the direction I'm thinking of and I am my personal exploration through the kind of experiments we are trying

inside UIDI where I am currently consulting is uh can AI help reduce the cognitive load code of switching modalities and uh extend the language. So I would like any comments and uh I've

earned a lot of bad karma every day with my design decisions and &gt;&gt; yes thank you. You want to answer the employer question. &gt;&gt; Okay m so yeah uh would you like to

answer the how can AI lead to employment opportunities for people with disabilities? &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Okay. because you are at an AI at a

company having AI. So, &gt;&gt; all right. Yeah. Um I have a I have a cheeky answer to the employment question. I think that the uh common narrative around AI and the labor market

is that as AI advances, it's going to be able to automate any job and people won't have jobs and work is going to be harder to find and all that stuff. I don't want to trivialize that. Every

change has every change in the world has uh friction but I think AI actually provides the potential for a huge amount of the population that has been

artificially excluded from the labor market to participate. I reflect on my parents. Um I owe a lot to both my dad and my mom. My dad is conventionally probably considered a big ingredient to

my success. He was IAT concour 1968 gold medalist physics. So of course I got a lot of really good stuff from him for my education. My mom, if you look at the resume, she went to undergrad soon

purchase and has essentially been a housewife since. Not any problem with that. Dedicating your life to your family is amazing. But many of the skills I have that have led to my

success in the workplace, be able to communicate, connect with people, come from her. My mom was blind. And so when she was in high school and undergrad, there were so many opportunities for her

that were denied. The ability to access the classroom, the ability to get notes from the teacher, or the ability to take standardized tests were denied to her. And as a result, she did not get those

educational credentials that perhaps my dad and many others had. So, while she's very proud of where her life took her and I'm very happy that I got to grow up with her, I think there's an alternate

history where she was the IT gold medalist equivalent and had a amazing career. So, I think of it this way. How many people in the world right now are not working that would like to and

there's some artificial barrier? I think almost all those barriers can be fixed with AI. So, that's that's my answer. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Anybody want answer the second question?

very briefly please. &gt;&gt; Uh multimodal authentication works very well and beautifully. Uh we have examples where uh tech companies uh in global have you know included multimodal

authentication methods because that this includes diversity of people and if you have multiple modes of authentication many people with different diversities are able to authentic authenticate

themselves without relying on a single mode of authentication. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. uh any closing remarks from you before we're going to uh launch our polit today

before that any closing remarks from I think the key to uh listening to all of you makes it very very profoundly clear that for AI to move ahead in a country where we are still building our

AI stack we don't need to retrofit like the modern or the far developed AI countries in the world we are still nent and I think right now if we whatever AI technology um solutions we are providing

we have to make sure that they are affordable economical um widely spread to the rural areas because that's where most of our people with disabilities live. It should be economical because it

should be used. We all know that um we have this great infrastructure of the digital public infrastructure available there. People use smartphones. So people can use any kind of AI based phone based

app to improve their lives and help in their disability. And there is no technology without having people with disabilities being a part of that designing team. So nothing without them

for them that goes out very very strongly and resonates. I was just thinking that um in public procurement if we can start having um companies ensuring that they give something known

as that it's a disability um certified product that it looks into all aspects of disability in a way or something known as disability impact assessment certification that could be

something where the government can move forward I think on that thank you &gt;&gt; thank you so much ma'am and ma'am we spoke about public procurement we're going to come to you for that and much

more through the accessibility collision that uh we are launching at TQ. Uh the accessibility coron is really an alliance of disability organizations coming together across the country

across disabilities. What we noticed is that uh what unfortunately happens that most organizations are working only on one disability and it's not really an intersectional approach. So uh we've

already had an election for the accessibility collision across the 20 uh 20 plus founding NGOs and Mr. George Brown has been selected as a president. And uh uh this is the logo which we are

unveiling. Uh I'll just read out the image description of the logo for people with visual disabilities. The logo features two distinct purple puzzles being brought together. On the left, a

solid hand holds an outlined piece with a rounded tab. On the right, an outline hand holds a solid lavender rectangle which are matching indentation. While the pieces are shaped to interlock

perfectly, they maintain their individual identities through contrasting textures and style. The acronym TAC is cut into the base of the solid piece with a folding the

accessibility collision centered below. Uh this collision is not open just to disability organizations but also any private sector company that's working on disability. One of our main focus areas

initially is going to be on tech. Uh before which we go beyond that. So feel free to get us get in touch with us if you really want to partner with us. There are just 24 seconds left. So thank

you everybody. I want to thank the sign language interpreters as well from RTC. Thank you for joining us. Thank you so much for being here. Uh and I think I'll request every I'll request

everybody to let the speakers first pass uh from the that gate and then you can go out. &gt;&gt; The India AI team is just giving uh some momentos to the speakers. Yeah,

&gt;&gt; sorry. &gt;&gt; She's saying the speakers are deep first, but we're going to get momentos. something on the table. See

what weave. &gt;&gt; A leader who inspires. A team that turns vision into reality. A moment when courage meets action. That's when change begins.

It's never an easy path. But it is always a brief run that makes the difference. In a world ready for change, every insight is a spark. We turn these insights into opportunities that stand

out to drive transformation, deliver unique outcomes, and build lasting trust. With people, clients, and communities at the heart of our work, we bring together diverse perspectives and

skills. Our inclusive culture inspires confidence and empowers change. A reflection of our core values, guided by innovation and purpose. We help solve real world problems

transforming obstacles into opportunity because &gt;&gt; Hello everyone we request you all to please uh the delegates to move from the second case that's the end of the gate

and leave space for the speakers to leave from the first one. We have another session in next 4 minutes so we request your
