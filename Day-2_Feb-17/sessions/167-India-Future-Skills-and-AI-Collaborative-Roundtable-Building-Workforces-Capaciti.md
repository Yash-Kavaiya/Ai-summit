## 📝 Transcript

Hello everyone. Thank you so much. It was a great session. We had a great amount of learning with that session. With this we start the next session. Requesting everyone to be seated.

Please. Requesting everyone to take your seats. &gt;&gt; Excuse me. &gt;&gt; Can we please pro uh I encourage that everyone can have

networking but we can we have to start the next session of us are generating uh under future skills and AI. My name is Pratima Harit. I lead uh corporate citizenship at

Asia-Pacific for Lenovo. I'm based out of Mumbai. Our focus is on um technology for the underserved and STEM education largely working on skilling. With me are esteemed panelists uh CSR leaders who

are my peers in other organizations. Most of them or all of them in fact are from the technology company. And before I introduce you to them, I'd also like to say thank you to a visionary whose

name is Bomik Sha. 2013 he started CSR box. Um if you want to see his journey over the last uh decade plus, you should visit CSR box booth in the hall number one. It's an exciting place. A lot of

stuff that you can see there. I'm also thankful for my partners. I can see Shilpi in the audience here. I can also see Lakshina. I saw some time back but welcome to this as well. Uh while we are

here I would also take the opportunity to introduce uh the leaders by name and I would when I ask you the questions I would request a 30 minute 30 second not minute 30 second uh spiel about what you

do as an organization and how do you support skilling in CSR. Uh starting with my um extreme uh left I did introduce you to Bik B and after that we have uh Perminda who is from Kindr and

then we have Shepra from IBM Hmon from Readington Antra from Micron she's flown all the way from Singapore this morning and Anurag from Capgeemini. So um to set the context all of us in

some way or the other set up pilots on future skilling and AI skilling at least two years ago and while we have been doing that we're looking at a system level transformation uh in AI for future

skills and this panel is going to discuss exactly that what are some of the policy changes that we should be looking at what are some of the changes that the organizations are trying to

bring in not just from an impact track but also from an outcome perspective how are we bringing inclusion and long-term um solutions uh that can help create an ecosystem and with that and without

further adu I'm tired of listening to my voice only I'm going to ask a question to ship and I can see Anurag nodding his head so you want me to move very quickly to the questions uh so Shipra this

question is for you how should industry and academia jointly design the pedagogy uh for future tech and AI skills that translate into measurable uh workplace uh interventions and productivity not

just certifications. &gt;&gt; Yes. Uh thank you. Good evening everyone. Um I'm Shepra Sharma. I lead CSR for IBM India South Asia. Uh pleasure to be here at such an important

forum, one of the largest in AI across the world. Um at IBM one of our major focus is education and workforce because today businesses one of the major challenges is getting the right people

for the right job and that's where the majority of our investment is. We also provide our technology for ideas of innovation. So every year there's a topic and there's a global RFP which

NPOS, government organizations uh or even academic institutions can apply for. And then also how do we we uh we use our talent for uh social impact. Um in terms of your question, I think

one of the most interesting things when we talk about future skills is that the future itself is not predictable anymore. Uh the bar keeps moving uh from AI to geni to agentic AI and can go on

and go uh go on and go forth. But uh the whole idea is that we have to prepare our learners to adapt. So that I think is very very important and I could uh share an example in this context to make

it more tangible is the work that we do with AICT. We are working at a three-level approach here. Number one is curriculum integration. So uh at IBM we have a goal to scale 5 million people in

AI, quantum and cyber security by 2030. We announced very recently. And uh one of the things that we are doing through our platform is integrate AI courses into the way uh you know into college

curriculums. We have great examples with uh Nan Mudavalan in Tamil Nadu. We working with Gujarat knowledge society along with CSR box and that way not only the students even the faculty get

prepared. So that's level one. Level two is not it's not just important to provide the content the school uh or the colleges already do that at an uh you know academia level they need hands-on

training so project based learning and providing internship opportunities AICT has a program of 60 hour of internship and through IBM skills build uh they do like 20 hours of uh hybrid learning and

then uh pick up a project we have IBM mentors helping these students convert them into real life projects. And at the last level is infrastructure. Uh we are setting up an AI lab inside of the AICT

uh office in Basant Kunch where we will provide uh space for research in AI and responsibly how do we build that up because trust responses uh and responsibility are very close to IBM. So

in a nutshell I can go on but I'll probably pause here. &gt;&gt; Thank you Shepra. And while we are on that question about learners uh I'd like to just move to you Anurag uh because

you speak uh and has spoken a lot about faculty development. So while we are talking about active learners in the form of students uh my question to you is around faculty capacity building

which is central to building a sustainable um AI and future skills ecosystem. So in your view what structured models can industry adopt to support uh faculty immersion programs

and continue capability enhancement so that institutions are able to deliver uh industry aligned uh learning at scale. I mean on one hand you have students but how do the teachers or the faculty how

do you train them to be able to take that forward as well? &gt;&gt; Thank you for asking this particular question. The other day I wrote a an email to uh our scaling partners uh

telly asking them that uh when I look at recent plug-in which got launched which in so many ways made our uh some of our entry- level courses in the skilling uh uh spaces redundant completely uh

software testers software developers uh Java Python C++ these were the entry- level courses that we were running through our digitalmies and we realized that we won't be able to I'll say

uh employ these young people whom we'll be training because suddenly you'll you have these plugins which will enable companies to do some of these entry- level work without any human interface

there which in so many ways also made me think that uh when you look at so many engineering colleges all around India and uh every year they are producing 100,000 of students they're trained in

I'll say computer sciences is with a specialization on software development or software tester testing or on uh something else. they all will need to reorient their program there otherwise

what's going to happen in coming days or coming months uh will be where you'll have number of young uh people out in the market with their degrees in their hand with the skills which are obsolete

and and this in so many ways requires us to work at a mission mode to ensure that our curriculum our pedagogy our teachers our faculties are trained exposed and may and and we make them

ready to face the future there or handle the future there. This requires one we all need to collectivize our energy. So it can't be uh the job of Lenovo, Edington, uh micro uh uh uh Kindle

and others to do this. We we all need to combine energies to ensure that we reach out to all these tier three tier four colleges there. Ensure that their faculties are trained in the future

skills there in those domain that the market is going to look for. Uh simple stuff like prompt prompt engineering is going to be uh something which will be in demand. It

requires handholding. Do we have faculty who can understand that particular thing? The moment we recognize some of these skills which are needed by by the market and we start putting in our

energies to prepare the young people for those skills that's where we'll we'll we'll this we'll win the the the fight uh for these young people otherwise with the present skill set that we are

training on and that's where faculty training we started we did did some work on u training our uh faculties is to make them ready in understanding adult learners that these young people are.

But domain wise we never thought that we'll get challenge. Today we are facing challenge on domain itself and that's where there is a huge amount of need to work on curriculum, work on content,

work on methodologies, work on uh uh preparing these faculties who may be attaining the age of 50 55 where the whole uh orientation to change will be very difficult. So how you bring in the

agility in their mind will be another thing that we all need to be thinking about. &gt;&gt; As you can see there are interesting perspectives about how uh learning

changed when you brought in project based learning and then while you're doing that there is a need to upskill and reskill the um the faculty as well. I'm just going to take a little twist

and come to you Antra because we are talking about learners and both you and I have worked together on a STEM funded program largely for women and my question to you is that gender gaps in

STEM and technology uh they continue to persist. I mean whatever little bit we do is like a drop in the ocean. Uh and this persistence is there not just in India but also across Asia Pacific as a

region. Uh so based on your uh experiences and initiatives, what are some of the practical ways that you can see organizations create and enable sustained partnership, career

progression and leadership opportunities for women uh particularly those who are from the vulnerable and underrepresented communities. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much Pratima. This was and

this is something that we think about on a daily basis because for us at uh Micron Foundation we do very specifically look at underserved communities and populations to

understand how do we support them to come into careers of the future and actually the interesting statistic is that uh last year uh the the global gender gap report said that at the

current pace it'll take us 123 years to achieve gender parity. So small number I'm sure we'll all be around to see it. So that that's great. But in view of the current situation, it is important to

see what are the options and challenges uh that we have. One thing that I that I keep sort of reiterating both to uh our teams and to our partners are is that women is not a homogeneous hole. It

doesn't it's not women in general. Each type of category that you sort of belong to provides an intersectionality in how you see technology. So are you low income? Are you coming from a tribal

population? Are you coming from a particular sort of region which which is more patriarchal? Right? So a lot of the access to technology issues are really really front and center. Uh but what I

think is hopeful is that AI can actually provide that sort of once in a generation reset opportunity because this can actually make women leapfrog the conventional sort of you take one

step, you take two step, you take three step to climb up. you can actually leaprog that completely. So from Micron Foundation, we look at STEM and technology pathways and how do we

support that in order for uh underserved communities as a whole to be able to access careers of the future. But and in specifically in the context of women and AI, let me just give you three examples

of things which we've seen to work. One is that we need to think about end to-end design. Much like what actually Andra you also said, we have to think about what does the entire continuum

look like. It's not one program, one project, but what does that entire continuum look like from how do you get girls into STEM and AI at a high school level, at a university level, get them

into those jobs and provide them the access to networks to allow them to continue in those jobs. So in um in India as an example uh we are working with UN women on the W SEM program which

allows uh which actually supports girls for from ITI to get access to AI literacy and other technical training. But what it does crucially is it looks at confidence building because it's not

a g so right now I don't know how many of you know um so do what is the percentage do you think of of girls in STEM in STEM education in India 10% 30%. Anybody thinks it's above 40%.

It's actually 48%. It's actually 48%. It's a really interesting thing. It's 48%. How many what's the percentage of girls in STEM jobs?

Now that's below 20%. So that's yeah, it's at 18%. It's actually really shocking. So what's happening in the middle? It's not a lack of access to like curriculum, right? It's a lack of

access to both confidence, it's a lack of access to networks. So that's what the Wii STEM program is about. It allows for access to peers, access to job partners, access to confidence building,

even basic things like CV writing. uh a lot of these things are about how do you transact at an interview level. A lot of the uh times this is something this is sort of a gap that we are not looking to

fill and in fact we have if any of you are going to hall 14 please do go to uh the w stem booth which is there there are amazing girls from the ITI in Gujarat over there and you can have a

lovely conversation uh with them about how they are using AI. It's actually quite fantastic um because they are the generation that can leaprog. I think that this is this is a once in

a-lifetime opportunity. We seeing similar sort of learnings in with our work in Singapore as well as our work in Europe where and you would think that this would all be different but it's

actually very similar. Um so just to sort of wrap up and say that this is uh uh an opportunity that we can't actually afford to miss. While we are talking on inclusion and you've brought we

discussed about the uh STEM gap uh I'd now like to also speak to Hmon uh you do a lot of work in rural and per urban uh contexts from skilling and therefore my question to you is you know um enroll

figures do reflect meaningful impact but then what are the outcome based uh metrics that we should be looking uh to evaluate the real success of AI and therefore particular particularly in

terms of uh would it be employability, would it be income progression? What are some of your thoughts on that? &gt;&gt; Thank you Pratima. So uh we from Readington uh I think we are in a

distribution business globally we are doing a distribution for all the tech parties starting from Microsoft to all the I think the phones which you are using. So we are a leading distributor

for all the tech uh player. So in terms of our foundation also we are focusing a lot on on scaling. skilling is close to our heart. So I think when you said about enrollment irrespective of a

skills or whatever skill it is I think enrollment number doesn't say anything it only says okay the program you got you mobilized few and they enroll in the program I think the real outcome if you

ask me so the real outcome start with the economic mobility or it will start with their how the sustain economic opportunity they are getting or how we are going to do some inclusive access

especially for the tire two tire cities while I'm talking from Tai to Thai cities why I'm saying this because recent past I think along with our technology partner Microsoft we we

launch AI learning center across five different part of the country and which is majorly on triutity cities so uh what we did there as as you said so enrollment I think it's not going to

help us so how we are going to monitor that so one is which is very mandate for the partner I think all will agree we are skilling we all are working so the partner partner needs to train them and

they have to assure assured placement opportunity to them. So but if you ask me in terms of AI I think the placement only the placement will not work. I think whether they able to get a job in

the AI roles which I think is still a challenge in the market. I think over the period they will get it probably down the line in a one year or two year. So I think the partner or the partner

like us we need to track them whether they get the right kind of opportunity after when they complete the program. So this is one area I think we all need to think of at the same time whether the

income which they earning it is meaningful for them like I think in some of the cases if you go on to try two or try three colleges sometime their salaries are are very very minimal. Yeah

if you see them even after doing the tech program so that is one I think one is very core while we do any skilling program especially in so whether it leads to the employability which is one

portion. Second what I believe is that when you're working in a per urban area especially I'm talking in the per urban area as Anurag also said yeah the faculty development I think we need to

ensure because when you reaching to these colleges even the students are there even the branches are there but faculties are not empowered so how do you going to struct uh structure your

foundational AI skill to advance AI skills while doing that journey how you going to train the faculty there so once you moved out let's say after 3 here at least the program the continuity will be

there and while doing this are we adding new employees to the college seriously you are putting some effort there if they are getting new employer or even though we are getting new

employer at the same time whether the hiring you have seen there is a hiring demand is there so what we also thought of I think we started that also in many of our program wherever we used to go we

started upskilling the local ecosystem especially the micro businesses or or the smallest all the small businesses. In our case, they are the channel partners. Yeah. Like Lenovo we are also

partner for them. IBM we are also partnering. So we have almost 10,000 to 20,000 channel partner with us where the staffing will range for 20 to 100 100 onward. So we started upskilling them

also especially on AI skills so that when they're going to start the businesses at least they know how to do deal with the product. So these are the thing few things I think we've need we

are going to add probably that AI will help especially in the tie three cities if you're going to add this on a program especially the project based learning when we are saying so the economic

mobility I think it's the one area which we need to think of otherwise it's going to be what we going to do it's just you finish your curriculum and then you again move that even after lot many

courses are available in the program so in my opinion I think it should start with employee economic and mobility and then it leads to the inclusivity also and the same time how we are leveraging

your ecosystem how we are upskilling them so then I think we can create overall impact uh which we are all expecting how we're going to increase how we are going to do as an AI for all

thank you &gt;&gt; thank you Hant an interesting perspective him and I were talking in the pre- panel discussion some time back and I ship we missed you but I think we

as when we are working on project based learning one of the elements that's coming out very strongly is innovations uh both IBM and Lenovo do hackathons and I think the rest also I'm not sure but

uh I know about IBM and Lenovo doing it and from those hackathons are coming out very innovative ideas and that then means that our students are getting ready towards looking at

entrepreneurship as well. So while we are talking about future skills and AI, we also need to think about does employability only end there or are we looking at future innovators and

therefore what are we creating as an ecosystem just food for thought and as I discussed take this I'm going to segue neatly into uh talking to Perinda. Permindar is not a CSR leader he

represents policy makers. He's part of Kindle and represents government affairs. So Perindra for you the question is largely around um public officials. How do you think um training

for public officials in AI and cyber security would strengthen the government readiness? um as an organization as Lenovo has a responsible AI committee and I'm sure all of us do in some form

or the other and yet you see uh you worry over the night to say how are government officials or how is government of India looking at cyber security as we are building our skilling

programs and then therefore how can industry-led CSR programs support this capability building in a practical way &gt;&gt; I think um &gt;&gt; I think very pertinent question for

those of You know, for those of you who don't know about Kindrill, um we are a four years young organization. We are we spun off from IBM in 2021. We are a $15 billion organization listed in New York

Stock Exchange. Um in India, we have about 28,000 colleagues, highly talented colleagues. And what we do is we run mission critical systems, systems that cannot fail. You've got telecom systems.

The moment let's say you send the message in the background there could be network latency there could be a cyber attack happening but the moment you click pay you know that transaction has

to happen you know it's a mission critical uh system uh similarly in aviation we run Bangalore international airport we run uh na international airport now so the moment you know so

it's a mission critical environment that's what we do banking and financial services airports aviation manufacturing systems and public sector So very interesting question and I think

it's a very um uh uh we we published something called a Kindle readiness report and I would encourage each one of you to Google it Kindle readiness report. It's right there on the top. Uh

what we did was we we looked we surveyed about 400 business leaders globally and one of the key findings that came out is out of the 10 roles that we had that we have in the market including public

sector nine out of 10 roles in the next 12 months are going to dramatically transform. So in case of public sector officials when we started you know when we are interacting with public sector uh

the very interesting segment that came was is how do you as the government is thinking about Vix Bharat 20 247 as they're looking at advancing their systems how confident are the public

sector government officials in using AI and cyber how uh informed are they when they are making decisions ians, how uh informed are they when they're creating architectures. So when we talk about AI

readiness for a nation, I think government officials and public sector and AI readiness in the government is a big one. Now intersect this with CSR. I think this is

where as companies we have access to the latest uh innovations that are happening to the latest technologies to the large language models. So what we did was we we thought about this we went back to

the drawing board and we said that look you know here are these problem statements. Now how do we solve that and how could CSR be u be a change maker? How could CSR be a compounding impact uh

how could it create imp you know impact a compounding impact and that's where we spoke to this organization called karm yogi I got karma yogi now what I got ky yogi is there's a learning management

system all the government officials they are getting trained through karm yogi most of the central government and also state government now and we said that if let's say some interesting content could

be pushed at karm yogi And if public officials in addition to all the other courses that they're doing if they get you if they get very practical and not we're not talking

about very technical but we're talking about very practical skills on AI and very practical skills on cyber I think so we've recently launched this we recently signed an MOU with them uh this

last week we also uh you know announced uh couple of courses with them and the interesting feedback is there's a lot of hunger amongst public officials because this is a this is a new area and just

like everybody else who's there right now in this AI impact summit there's a lot of uh you know questions from public sector officials also saying that oh you know if I let's say go to chat GPT or

anything or any you know AI model if I if I use this the response that I'm getting can I really use this in the organization is it is it safe stuff what kind of data can I share if I have to

adopt AI into the organization how can I do that and then as I'm using AI to develop design and design systems how can I do this responsibly how can I really take the use of benefit of AI and

and how can I protect you know using cyber so very interesting um uh piece that now that's now emerging and I think the impact through CSR is just manifold thank you Thank you permander and as I

will just move next to the I I like to call bomik the sutrahar because he's been one person who's been able to bring uh the industry the academia policy makers together uh and try and weave a

fabric that really helps uh what he likes to call AI for better bharat and therefore my question to you bomik is from a national systems perspective because you work with all of us uh what

governance architecture should you think uh India should be formalizing uh to ensure strategic alignment between CSR investments? Perminda spoke a little about it but also from public policy

priorities and invol evolving uh skill demand in AI in some way all of us have spoken about it but from your perspective as the anchor where and how do you see this moving?

&gt;&gt; Thanks a lot Pratima. Uh namaste. I'm Bomi and I lead CSR box team which is largely a purpose-driven organization where we work with philanthropies, private sector, public public sector and

uh nonprofit partners to really enable purpose-based program at the grassroot level through systemic partnerships. Building on that um fortunately India has a very good social

sector investment available to do anything which is which is required for the any sector to move in the right direction. We call it CSR as a compliance right now. But we must

appreciate what government thought of 12 years back that if we are able to speak in this panel today about AI future skills, the credit goes to the government which brought in the changes

in the companies act by bringing mandatory CSR otherwise I don't think that we would ever be talking about CSR AI and future skills together in 2026. So first of all let's thank the system

which really thinks of how features should be and how we enable partnerships coming from the lens of uh how we work and how we integrate public private sector partnership and that we

understand the pulse of the sector from the needs and supply lens. Uh India is much mature when it comes to AI and future skills from the activity lens. There's there are lot many things

happening in campuses when you talk about future skills and AI but there are couple of challenges which we have observed and then I will try to sink in that what architecture it looks like for

us to be really have a feasible model which work which can work in a country like India which is a federal federal structure as well from that lens uh there are three clear outcome which we

have seen in last three four years of our analysis and the way we are seeing next two three years trajectory for future skills through CSR and couple of other system enabled things. One, most

of our investment has been geocluster based. Most of the projects have been programs and interventions have been in a couple of priority cities. This might be a priority for a particular corporate

partner of philanthropy or maybe some government strategic alignment from the future perspective which which is anti-development for us when it comes to AI itself because AI is

supposed to be inclusive but sometime in a disguised manner probably we are leading or we are going forward making AI an element which is excluding certain set of beneficiary who should be

technically primary target and nobody is to be blamed for this. Nobody is intentionally doing that. It's only that probably we are not able to pay attention to that side because we all

have our own different priorities. So one is geocluster based thing. Another one is that we are very much into pilots because we all of us have to start somewhere and it starting always is

about pilot programs. So most of the campuses will have a periods in terms of number of hours. It's very periodic CSR program in a particular uh se particular campus. Then what happens that when it

comes to scale while CSR has its own limitation private sector philanthropy has its own limitations the institutions are not ready to take it to the scale because we never paid attention of

building capacity of our institution and it's not about just engineering colleges. We also need to because we all are sitting here we also need to think about that our 90% 95% focus is still

engineering colleges. Think about a country like India where engineer tech education is just 5 to 7% of the entire education system right and over higher education doesn't talk to technical

education technical doesn't talk to higher education right now and that's that's happening in center as well as most of the states as well. So if you we just look at things from the computer

science, electronics and uh to certain degree communications these three right think about medical research AI in medical research we are not paying any attention to that entire segment which

is India's forte when you talk about science right we are the pharma lab of the world so we are probably not able to understand that how do we bring together this opex education institution to think

about AI from a centralized architecture lens which is very much missing and if we miss the bus for next five years we will not have the demographic advantage we will not have the science related

advantage or education advantage which we are currently talking about we have been able to partially address technical education from the lens that there are lot many things happening there is AICT

which is the opex body and they are taking care of it through state level DTS and other uh skilling missions the problem which we force is that technically we will

uh left behind if we are not accounting for higher education and other streams of education when it comes to AI. uh so governing structure that can be there and beautiful analogy which I think if

if somebody is listening from government of India the way we had a GST council at the OEEX level when we rolled out GST in India we really created an OPEC body which is technically representative of

estates all kind of financial institutions which are there in in the country and a few private sector nominated nominees who really enabled you to think for next 10 12 to 30 years

architecture for entire tax regime in India Is there a possibility for India to look at that kind of governance governing structure for AI? Because if we are not

able to do it right now, we'll really miss the bus. So can we have that representative structure from industry, from states, from center and all type of education institutions together in that

governing council which really takes care of where is the demand coming from, what type of demand, which institutions needs to be enabled, how do you build capacity of your other institutions and

the organizations which are taking care of institutions. The point that Andra brought in those who are in AIC what probably they might not understand what is the

requirement of the sector. So we have to connect academia with the industry and this industry has to then pivot something to really bring in that kind of new architecture.

Thank you, Burmik. And uh you know when you were talking about technical education and engineering and all that was just thinking what about schools and therefore uh I'm just going to segue

straight into uh asking this question of permander. Um what are some of the design principles uh that you think should guide the introduction of uh AI education in the public schools to

ensure that it is responsible it's age appropriate and aligned with uh future workforce needs and I'm particularly asking you this question from two elements while I'm sitting here wearing

the hat of a CSR leader I've been a parent of a 22 yearear-old per girl who has doing her masters in a prestigious college she was asked to uh write a research paper, evaluate a research

paper. 25 students in the college, all of them underwent um an AI app that looked at their research paper for plagiarism. All 25 failed. And I took me two months to get her back on to her

mental well-being because you're doing your masters, you're in your second last semester, your grades are mattering, and then you realize that you flunked because AI did this to you. So for me

therefore the question from a parent as well as a CSR leader perspective is how do you keep your children motivated in a scenario like this? &gt;&gt; I think I think you touched upon it. Um

I think there's there's this bit there's this whole focus around building AI competency um versus uh behavior around AI which is which you rightly touched upon which is

ethics. uh and I think as uh as you know uh we recently you know started an initiative which is uh in introduce foundational AI in schools and we just launched uh this pilot in in UP in

Vanasi and Aayodhya uh we are looking at impacting about 50,000 students across 100 schools and and what we you know while we were designing this I think one of the key things that we came back And

I'm mindful of the time as well. Um, one thing that came back to us was should we focus on competencies or should we focus on um the behavior and I think at a school level the moment we we say you

know design in introduce foundational AI it's got to do much more around ethics. It's got to much to to to to have basics of AI rather than competencies of AI. I think I so I think fundamentally that's

one. The second key part that came to us is that look you know why why I chose maths and not not biology. I'm I'm an engineering graduate is and for most of us in the audience and on the panel is

because my maths teacher was able to explain maths in a much simpler way and I was able to you know uh understand math from her pretty well. So I think this focus the moment we talk about

schools I think the natural progression is around teachers. So how how the moment we talk about designing uh AI interventions in school AI

foundation in schools it's got to do much more to do with how confident are teachers around um AI foundation how confident are teachers around um you know explaining AI ethics like you

rightly said you know if you're working on an original research design you you cannot I mean it's it's it's a behavior um uh uh question. So I think those are those are two aspects. We're trying to

scale our interventions you know uh on AI in schools. We did very interesting stuff which was on cyber security at grassroots and this is what we did was we we said that look all the technology

is now going at grassroots but now as technology is also going at grassroots there's this piece of digital vulnerabilities also coming in. So, so we've got all the moms, you know, who

have the phones and they came back to us and said, "Look, I feel very confident now on technology, but I'm also a bit scared about look, you know, I've got my bank linked to my mobile phone and

you've given me this very amazing technology, but how do I safeguard myself?" So, we started something called um called Cyber Ruck. So, we said that look, we're going to uh impact about

100,000 uh women in um in rural areas. And then when we started implementing that interestingly they came back and and and some of the moms they came back and said look you know I feel confident

now you know I can fend off all the digital hackers but look my elder one she's the one who's almost on the phone so I so can you do something for her as well so we created something called

cyber senic which is you know uh which is we we said look we're going to go and impact about 25,000 students on how they can protect themselves on cyber. So I think these are some of the experiences.

It's been it's been phenomenal. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you Perendar. And uh we have like what 8 seconds to go and I just 8 minutes to go. Oh great. Okay. So uh

some of us here in our roles also represent Asia-Pacific and ASEAN countries and therefore um you know when Andra and I worked together on the STEM funding program with AVPN we came

together because each of us realized that what we were doing in India reflected some of the other markets that we were working in whether it was Japan whether it was Indonesia women

empowerment STEM education having gender gap was something that was relevant there and therefore um I'm directing my question to you Shepra First um in the global south context because you also

work across Asia Pacific uh what scalable models do you see first of all any scalable models and if you so then what are the scalable models that you see that can ensure future tech and AI

scaling reach underserved regions and without compromising on quality thank you for that question and I'll probably answer the second part first the number one thing which is important is

democratizing access to information and that is something IBM has taken very very seriously and investing millions of dollars and uh we've taken uh commitment to skill 30 million people across the

world. So today the platform that we have IBM skills build.org runs across 160 countries and that itself speaks to the content which is there uh there are more than 1,000 courses. It starts from

high schools. uh there is a se a special segment for college students where they can even download more than 700 IBM software free of cost as long as they have an institutional ID and then there

is anyone who's 18 plus. So we also working with the vocational center uh you know education segment. So it's uh globalized content but localized through partners like CSR box and others who

help translate it also in the regional languages when it gets implemented. So I think that's a success model that we have and um uh and so standardization of content and this and uh so converting

that into micro credentials that are accessible anytime anywhere. So learners can even learn on the move and we do understand that the current education system is not up uh you know doesn't

prepare the uh learners for the workforce. So that kind of bridges the gap. So that's one. The second thing on the scalability and if I've seen any model so at IBM we believe in a client

first uh client zero approach um we have something for I'll take an example of our CSR box uh CSR and uh that's a geni assistant uh because today the way our education and workforce development

programs are growing and I just shared the scale with you and the context it's really difficult to have a team of that size to manage this level of uh the volume of work and so we have customized

all of that in in the Jedi assistant to solve many of our problems so that the team can focus more on what what only people can do like managing our stakeholders designing programs and the

lot of mundane work you know gets kind of digitized using AI so that is really a client zero approach so before we kind of go out with solutions and we have uh success stories with our ask HR bought

and several others where we test it internally first and then go out. So the uh the approach we apply for our clients is also what we are trying to apply for our communities. So I think examples

like this are not only scalable, they are reliable, they bring in trust which I think is so important because data is a fuel for AI and unless we kind of filter it, test it internally at the

scale and the volume, it's risky what we put out there. So Shepra, if you see me nodding my head very severely like this and smiling, it's because Lenovo also does something similar. This is the

first time I'm not able to open my mouth about Lenovo because I am speaking to you all. I will do that later. So Antra while Shipra spoke about uh scalability and leveraging uh you and I have spoken

quite a bit on some of the markets where uh we see the digital infrastructure lacking. India was in that space about five six years ago but we see where India is uh but there are markets like

Indonesia, Philippines where there is potential but we know that the digital infrastructure is very similar to what India was 5 years ago. So from your perspective uh what are some of the

design principles uh or the delivery mo models that you look at uh when you are trying to build programs uh where digital infrastructure is lacking. &gt;&gt; Thanks so much Pratima and I think let

me sort of take that from the AI angle more specifically right because we are at the AI summit. Um so one one thing which I think is really interesting is that AI is a great leveler right now

because there is no geography that has figured this out. there is not one country which sort of already knows the answer to how they are going to be inclusive of the entire population. So

that's a really important sort of place to start. Um so there is a huge amount of opportunity for south south learning of course between different countries and India already has such amazing

models out there and I I was telling you about the UN women we stem model and there are others but what what the opportunity here is actually uh is to not recreate the wheel when there is a

problem that is being solved in one country we're trying to ensure that we are being able to like replicate it in the context of another country and you'd be surprised to know that we are not

only doing this south South south we're doing the south north so for the first time in my career I'm actually taking models from India and Asia and like telling Germany about it telling Italy

about it and being like this is how we are solving for this problem because the problems are very very similar about how do you actually build access how do you ensure that there is integration now the

integration is a second part of this because um a lot of the uh learners that we are working with across Asia Pacific and Europe look at AI as this sort of alien thing that they need to sort of

engage with but if you in introduce it in familiar environments whether it's poly techchnics ITI schools to your point at even at the school level where you know how to engage with it

responsibly then there is a certain amount of um impetus that that gives you also another part of this that is sort of really important to s think about is context uh whether it's AI learning or

whether it's other kinds of uh skilling many times we have this sort of one-sizefits-all model key curriculum let's just put it out there, people will figure things out. It doesn't work. So

even in in the AI curriculum that we are working with across different countries, we're contextualizing it to the learner segment that you're dealing with. So if it's say women returning to work like in

Singapore, we are working on women who have career breaks and then are trying to come back into the tech workforce. It's very hard. It's very hard for them to access those jobs. So what is the

kind of and even if they do access those jobs the LinkedIn data shows us that most of the jobs which are going to be replaced um are actually the jobs which are currently being held by women. So

how do we ensure that we actually get them into the augmented AI roles so that by the time they're coming back to those jobs they are already being able to come to like a certain higher level of uh

earning and learning. So these kind of contextualizations are really required um and there's a lot of potential for us to do the leaprogging that I was talking about uh across both south south and

south north. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thanks. &gt;&gt; If we finish the panel we will give you the mic to ask the questions. Thank you so much. uh BMIC in the essence of time

uh I'm going to move to you with this question and because we are on global south uh in the context of the global south um we know India CSR can articulate a lot of lessons learnings

and unlearnings uh so do we have a distinctive value proposition in AI skilling and institutional capacity building that reflects both um inclusion and and implementation capability that

we can take to the global south &gt;&gt; uh thanks Ratima uh I think based on the work that has been done in last four five year with various kind of players in the entire AI and future skills

ecosystem uh including uh support that the entire system gets from India based AEX body AICT and the state level nodal agencies uh there are three C's which technically are very important for any

country to be ready for AI and future skills canvas one you already mentioned capacity building and capacity building not just for the academ uh uh faculties how do you in change the entire thought

process of the institutions which are operating on the continuum because if you are not able to ingrain those that mindset of how things are changing, how job markets are shifting and you are not

directly connected with the industry it's it becomes very difficult for you to map what is changing because we are really as mentioned we are just stuck by our curriculum as an institutions. So

it's very important that you get connected with the industry understand the right pulse of the sector and build capacity of the entire system to be ready for that. Another one is

collaboration, private sector collaboration with the government and public institutions to understand how they can help to create couple of pilots and pilot to scale which ultimately

strengthening your systems and institutions. And the third one is about collaboration. Private sector collaboration and convergence work together in terms of how do you converge

your private sector capital philanthropic capital to leverage your pilot and pilot then becomes part of the system where government don't have to invest a lot for the pilots but you

technically take learning from the pilots to strengthen your system or build a new system so capacity building collaboration and convergence probably will be the right key words for all of

us &gt;&gt; mindful of the time and being respectful of the panelists uh I was supposed to ask question number two to Hmon and Anurag. Uh so I'm going to take a minute

more because we started this panel late and I'm going to ask both Anurag and Hmon I have to ask this because it's related to collaboration. Anurog you have great examples of collaborations

that you have done with other CSR organizations as well. Uh and Hmon you and I have spoken about collaborations as well. So uh just 30 seconds from your view Anurag what have been your

learnings and Hmon from your view where do you see that collaboration going for your organization as well? I &gt;&gt; I'll I'll take exactly 30 second collaboration is needed. I as I said

earlier there there's a need to come together and work on this. The the the challenge is huge there. uh all of us sitting in AI summit will will talk about how good AI is but if you look at

the other side it it will scare you and if if we do not combine our energies to work together it it it we we are going to destroy oursel there from capabuni side I I I feel really happy that we are

working with around 20 plus corporate in various skilling program or various education program there any other corporate who's willing to collaborate on this I'll be more than happy to join

in and do this for so there's this there we need to keep our egos aside. We need to keep our uh I'll say some of our uh selfinflated identities aside and we need to converse together to bring in

the good thing that's happening in some other uh places there and do it everywhere. What Bomi said we have done enough of pilots there's a need to uh take it to the scale and do it together.

Thank you. I think as Anurag mentioned uh I think we also work with many of the corporate especially in our CSR program. So the recent past which we partnering with

Microsoft one I think the collaborations help in terms of uh reaching out to the masses I think you can't do alone with your the limited fund which you are having. So if you want to scale at a pan

India level as Pomik also said we all said we need the collaborations. So I think the like-minded partners like Nura me and lot many people are trying to make the collaborations which could

reach out to the largest. So I think the this is the only I can say about the collaboration. So if you want to scale collaboration is required apart from that there are lot many things but I

think basis of the time I would like to stop myself and run over to you. &gt;&gt; Thank you Hmon and uh just from this perspective I want all the audience to know that you may have your views and

your opinions on how collaborations should work. Remember that we as CSR leaders and as policy leaders and even as advisers to corporates on CSR we trying our best to see how we can

collaborate and it's important for us to remember that if we align faculty readiness institutional governance industry demand and responsible design India will not only bridge the demand uh

but it will also um uh bridge its own AI divide but also be able to um create an inclusive AI pathway for the global south and we should use this as a positive perspective to think about.

You're free to have your views and to ask us responsibly questions that may be relevant but let's not make it argumentative or an activism process. &gt;&gt; I think before we break there's one

important announcement for just one minute so that we conclude the session on a high note. Yeah, thank you. Thank you. Uh thank you very much panel for the first of all for

the really really insightful session. Thank you very much for that. So uh uh we spoke about uh bridging the AI divide uh but as we all agree right uh the real impact begins when we move from the

dialogue to action right so to moving and that what's exactly what bring us to this moment that for as part of this uh social impact commitment uh Kindrill has a meaningful initiative AI partshala

right uh which is implemented on ground by bhat cares and CSR box so we are here uh to launch that program that AI partiala which is designed to bring AI learning into classroom especially where

uh access and exposures are limited right so this initiative basically it's focused on what exactly we had discussed today right that we bringing foundational AI literacy among students

right focusing mainly towards the uh school level elementary level AI inclusiveness for example uh enabling AI ready educators also right the teachers steering we all discussed right we have

to enable the teachers for that and promoting the ethical and responsible AI right that's all very needed at the elementary level these younger age when the students are very vulnerable about

all the risk and all the need to understand by the ethical implications and encouraging them to apply the AI knowledge not only just learning applying the knowledge of AI in building

projects and prototype and strengthening the future for that so uh that is all which this program AI partial is about right so we are targeting as of now already Burundan mentioned about that

that 50,000 plus learners are targeted by this program and across thousand plus educators that's all being targeting to enlar AI knowledge and we are targeting more than 250 schools for that right so

for that I just uh want to call on the stage Mr. Perminder Singh Kakaria vice president government affairs and public policy for Kendra India and APEC region Miss Guruja Makun director global

citizenship and sustainability India and nation miss Gdanjali Gore social impact leader CSR Kindle India global citizenship and sustainability and Mr. Bhika trusty

bharat cares to launch Are you [applause] going? Please

May I please request May I please request speakers to See?
