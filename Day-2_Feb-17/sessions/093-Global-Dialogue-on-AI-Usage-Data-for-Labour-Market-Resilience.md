## 📝 Transcript

15 minutes you will hear a keynote address, a presentation and a panel discussion on the subject. Before we get started, I request the panelists and key speakers to come on

stage for a brief photograph. Thank you. &gt;&gt; I think the presentation would require you to I can do his remarks and then all of you

can come back. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; And now without much ado, I invite Turing award-winning computer scientist,

Professor Yoshua Benjio to deliver his opening remarks and set the tone for this session. Professor Benjio is the scientific director of Law Zero, the founder of Mila Cubac AI Institute and

the chair of the international AI safety report. Over to you, Professor Ben. [applause] &gt;&gt; Um, thank you. Thank you for having me. Um, thank you to the Oxford Martin AI

governance initiative and the center for the governance of AI for uh this chance to talk to you all. um on a subject of great importance for a lot of people of uh labor market resilience and I hear

that we will converge to having companies uh share usage data that's going to help us study this uh this issue. So that's that's fantastic as far as I'm concerned. Um just put things in

perspective uh last August 71% of respondents to a US survey said they were concerned that AI will be putting too many people out of work permanently. So this is this is one of the most uh

sensitive topic for a lot of people. Um in January another poll showed that more than a quarter of UK workers were worried their jobs could disappear the next five years as a result of AI. Um,

we've also heard leaders of frontier AI companies saying this technology could wipe out half of all entry-level white collar jobs in the next one to five years or even every white collar job by

the end of 2027. I think that's pretty uh short, but even if it was two or three or five years later, that's uh really uh huge change. Of course, no one has a crystal ball. Um but this is

exactly why we need to study this these uh questions scientifically so that uh there'll be real incentives for governments to mitigate uh what can happen uh in particular for those who

will be hardest hit by those impacts. uh even if we don't know exactly how AI capabilities are going to evolve in the future uh some of the scenarios basically the trend continuing um show

that uh many jobs will be replaced um and so based on the precautionary principle policy makers should really prepare for these risks um so I'm going to say a few words about

what the international AI safety report that I chaired mentions about uh this question of labor impact. Um the the report um is supported by 29 countries, the EU, OECD in the UN and involves 100

international experts. Um it's making a synthesis of the science behind the question of emerging risks in uh the most advanced AIs uh as well as their mitigation.

And so the report notes that around 60% of jobs in advanced economies and 40% in emerging economies are exposed in other words at risk um for what's coming with general purpose AI. Um that the impacts

will depend on how AI capabilities develop as I said there's uncertainty about uh this um and how institutions respond which is why we're having those discussions because we can still steer

the future in a direction that will be good for people. Of course, there are disagreements about how fast the capabilities of AI will uh grow. Uh but if uh you know even if they they come

slower than what some some of those predictions are um the stakes are so high for um people in the world uh we need to start thinking about this. Uh also we have to think about this

globally because the um the adoption gain the adoption the productivity gains will vary across countries, sectors, occupations and tasks. Um so uh we see already some specific areas where um the

demand is uh reduced because of automation and of course others like machine learning expertise where you know the need is increasing but but I don't think that the people who used to

be let's say translators um or uh answering uh uh service uh requests will turn into machine learning. researchers. So it's not so simple. Um if you look at how

different economists predict different futures regarding the labor impact, usually the reason why they disagree is because they disagree on um how fast AI capabilities will grow. some

at one extreme think that you know AI has achieved the maximum that it could and in in that scenario of course uh the impact will be fairly minor but I think it's plausible that the trends we've

seen in the last five years will continue in which case the impact will be major and some economists go for that possibility but really we should be agnostic about

this and we should prepare in case the trends continue. So there are more and more studies piling up showing an effect um for example declining employment for early

career workers uh in the most AI exposed occupations. Um and the other thing is there's a delay between AI having the capability of doing the

task and the the markets and society uh you know absorbing that capability and actually replacing more and more um jobs for for doing these things. And then there's also a delay for studying these

phenomena by economists and others uh to inform u uh public policy which also takes time. So the problem is the speed at which these things are happening. Um so

the other thing to keep in mind is power dynamics. uh because well people who lose their job will be worse off at the same time automation is going to make some people

much richer. Who well the people who own those machines the people who uh the companies that that are designing those most advanced models and those advanced models where are they? Well mostly in

two countries in the world. So there's a real risk of all kinds of inequities growing both within each country depending on the sector in which you are but between countries and uh these

global inequalities um should be the subject of international coordination and discussions like like we're having at the summit here. Um access either control of these most

advanced AIs or access to the most advanced AI is going to become a decisive decisive competitive advantage. Um countries without reliable access uh

would be facing a dual disadvantage at the same time struggling to generate wealth nationally and uh uh needing to support a growing number of unemployed workers. So that could be a real fiscal

crisis for some countries. And right now each country is looking at this, you know, in their own way in a fragmented uh approach. Um I I think that the only way we're going to be able

to face this is with a lot more coordination internationally. countries need to form alliances with others with shared situations, economic prospects, similar values, security

needs, uh complimentary strengths so that they together um have a better chance of uh helping to steer AI in a direction that's going to be as the title of the conference says, you know,

good for the people, good for everyone. Um, I want to mention as an example of this, uh, last week, uh, Germany and Canada signed, uh, an agreement to work together on developing AI that will be

ethical and safe. Um, and so we need this kind of thing to happen much more. Um, and so we need the sort of dialogues that we're going to have today here. I look forward to hearing the discussion.

Thank you for your attention. Thank you for your address, Professor Benjio. You've given us all a lot to think about. I now request Bhat Chander, an economist at the Stanford Digital

Economy Lab to deliver a short presentation on the subject. Thank you all very much. I'm just going to start by recapping what the research shows about AI and labor markets and I

hope that'll be a useful starting point for the panel discussion to come. Okay, looks like you can see this. So, let's just start by talking about how AI exposure has been associated with

employment changes over the past few years. So, this is recapping some research that I did with Eric Bolson and Ryu Chen. Oh, okay. So, we were asking, are we

already seeing changes in the labor market driven by AI? This is going to be in the United States. There's been a lot of discussion about AI, how AI might be impacting the labor market, especially

for entry- level workers. So, To to study this, we collected payroll records for millions of workers through December 2025. And the results that we found are after

accounting for other macroeconomic forces, our preferred estimate is that there's been a 16% relative decline in employment for young workers and jobs that are more exposed to AI. That

started around late 2024, early 2025, and we haven't seen a reversal since then. We have not seen nearly as much impact for more experienced workers. Uh perhaps

some that's that's occurring more recently, but overall we've seen a pretty concentrated impact on young workers here. We've also considered other alternatives that might explain

some of this. Uh in particular, interest rate changes. And it turns out that interest rate exposure gives very different predictions about labor market impacts compared to AI exposure. Now, we

don't have a clean experiment for studying how AI is impacting the labor market, but we think these are important facts to document as we want as we track this going forward.

So, that was how AI exposure relates relates to employment outcomes and we found that it predicts declines in employment. But what about AI adoption? So, this is new work that I'm doing uh

with Bala Klein Tisink at King's College in London. And here we want to look at firm adoption of AI. So exposure is more about technical feasibility of automation but adoption is about actual

implementation in the economy and the driver for exposure is more about AI model capabilities where it's about adoption is more about return on investment regulation culture and costs.

So in this new work we measure firm level adoption across 40 plus countries using online job postings and we want to study how this relates to employment changes.

So just to give you an idea of where we see adoption globally, uh you see some countries that are leading the pack here including Israel, Japan, India is pretty high up there as well. So this lines up

with other research as well on where we're seeing adoption and we've also seen very rapid adoption over time. Uh so that's driven by the information sector in particular and we we see this

across countries as well. So I think the important question here is how does that relate to employment? And let me put that in the context of the broader research that's been uh done

on this topic. Overall, we find this interesting dichotomy between work that studies how exposure relates to employment changes and how adoption relates to employment changes. The work

that looks at exposure has overwhelmingly found that exposure predicts declines in employment. Whereas the work on adoption has uh found very mixed results. On net, it probably comes

out to about a null effect on employment changes. And so I think there's a question important question about why we get different results here. And I think this relates to the topic of this this

session about why we need better data to study these questions. So let me talk about what data we need to try to figure out what's going on here and why we get such different results. So one

explanation for this is that even before adoption firms anticipate that they may not need as much headcount and so because of that they reduce their hiring in anticipation of current and future

AI. And there's some survey evidence that actually suggests that this is the case. Another uh op uh potential u idea here is that we we are measuring adoption

very poorly. And one example of that is nearly half of AI usage at work is on personal accounts. It's not on enterprise products. And so if we measure it this way, we're not going to

do a good job of measuring the impacts of adoption on employment. Another possibility here is competition. non-adopters could lose market share and shrink. Uh there's some evidence that

that's what happened with industrial robots. And maybe we're seeing something like that with AI as well. And then the fourth option is that we're just capturing other things that are going on

in the economy. And so we're actually not doing a good job of measuring the impact of AI either on the adoption side or on the exposure side. And so we need better data to tease through each of

these four different possibilities. For anticipation, we need to collect better data on beliefs about AI and employment. So how are executives thinking about future AI capabilities and how is there

that impacting their employment decisions today? We need better firm level usage data to get better measurement of adoption and we need better measurement of productivity

effects of AI so that we can get a better idea of uh how how much competition is driving some of these forces as well. Now the other option is that there all

these changes that we've documented are being driven by other factors that are happening in the economy and I unfortunately I I know that this this isn't that satisfying but ultimately the

best evidence will just come with more time. If we see these trends continue and we don't see any reversal in those trends that's going to be suggestive quite suggestive that it's actually

being driven by AI over time. So with that, I I wanted to just give you all a recap of the research in this space and hopefully that'll lead into the panel discussion.

&gt;&gt; Thank you Bat for that enlightening presentation. May I request you to take a seat here? May I also request our esteemed panelists to join us on the stage, please?

Joining us today is Dr. Shamika Ravi, a member of the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister of India, Ambassador Philip Thiggo, who serves as the special envoy for technology in the

Republic of Kenya, Hector Derwa who is the director of public policy at Microsoft's Office of Responsible AI, Bharat Chander, who you just heard from, and Pamela Mishkin who is an independent

researcher currently working at OpenAI. Moderating the session is Robert Trager, the director of Oxford Martin AI governance initiative and the international governance lead at the

center for governance of AI. Over to you, Robert. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. Uh thanks so much for the speaker to the speakers and and also to the panelists for joining us. Uh so I

think uh we're we're really set up uh for an excellent discussion today and we'll start uh Shamika with you if I if I may. Um so I think there's a study uh that's almost two years old now uh that

says that 92% of knowledge workers in India use AI in their in their work. Uh so how does India plan to use AI to augment jobs while also transitioning those who are negatively affected?

Thank you. Uh well, India does have one of the highest uh adoptions if you look at uh firm level data. Uh there is a great degree of uh openness but also optimism in terms of what AI can uh

achieve. We still don't quite know what is it going to do to productivity in terms of measurement. Uh but the signs uh for a country like India appear to be one where

you know because we have mild uh connectivity issues when it comes to uh many aspects of the labor market particularly if you look at services like health education

uh its application uh the chances are it's likely to be used for a lot of traditional problems solving uh in fact uh I don't know how many of you in the room know that the

fastest growing sectors in India uh are a tech fintech health tech edtech and solving very old traditional problems uh by adoption of technology for existing problems. So there is reason to believe

that the exposure is high but there is good reason uh to believe that uh it will lead to a better outcome for citizens as a whole and the labor market uh is also likely to adapt uh in

accordance. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Uh I'll turn next to Ambassador Tiko. Uh so I think that uh there's a paper by the World Economic Forum that says that 52% of jobs in

Kenya could be automated. Uh and there's certainly also the possibility of new kinds of work being created. Uh but how do you see uh the possibilities for different stakeholders, especially

frontier AI companies to help governments in improving their understanding and and transitioning affected workers? Thanks so much. Um and I think for us is to understand it's

it's it's 52% of what? So it's 52% of 15%. Uh because only 15% of our economy is formal. So that's really the number they're looking at. A majority is informal. And so I think for me that's

really the potential like India we we are looking at areas that were previously underdeveloped in terms of the labor market and labor economy. So food if you look at the food systems and

the food system plug farm to come, farm to fork, farm to plate, farm to bottle. Um so we see that as potential there opportunity. Of course the second part of around artificial intelligence is the

potential to make smaller medium enterprises exponential and we've seen it in the case of fintech for example tech or the same as India where we seeing companies that were previously

would require almost 100 employees now doing almost 10 employees and and being very exponential. It's no surprise that Kenya right now become it's the largest VC destination in the continent because

we're seeing those types of investments um going into the country. What can governments do? I think potentially is there's actually a potential for regulatory challenge and and government

should always look at how does regulation enable um efficiencies and productivity but also having the sufficient guardrails and my team is part of Yeshua's report and and that's

what we're looking at. So potentially looking at what can we do understanding the potential of AI but also ensuring that we have enough graduates. I think the second point is understanding the AI

stack. When you talk about uh labor, it's also the understanding where the value goes ultimately. Uh because currently I don't know if you've seen the data, Kenya is the number one user

of CH GPT, right? But but it doesn't mean anything in terms of labor or productivity. So I think for us is also to understand that how do people make beneficial use of technology in a way

that delivers economic dividend, economic value. So I think that's where we really need governments to step in. Thank you. Um Barat, I'll turn to you next. You've

presented some some data. I think you know all of it interesting. The the impact on young people uh which is very dear I think to to all of us uh is is some of the most interesting. Uh let's

say um I believe that data was for the United States. And so I'm curious if you are in a position to tell us or or perhaps uh speculate a little bit about impacts elsewhere in the world.

&gt;&gt; Yes. So the the data that I presented was primarily about the United States. uh there is some research that has been done on the UK but for the most part we really don't know very much about what's

going on in other countries and that was why uh like I discussed we're collecting this data now about AI adoption in other countries and how it's impacting employment there but unfortunately today

we just don't know very much about what's happening in other countries because the data hasn't been collected &gt;&gt; yeah no no speculating

&gt;&gt; well um So, so I if I were to speculate, I I mean I do think there are a lot of jobs in places like India and the Philippines that people have traditionally thought

might be more susceptible to AI. Now, I do want to say that we have uncertainty about the future because there are historically there have always been new jobs that are created and people have

shifted across the economy to other jobs that are growing in in demand. And I think the question is, is AI going to be different from what we've seen in the past or is it going to be similar to

what we saw previously with prior technologies? And I think there's a lot of uncertainty about that in part because the capabilities are progressing so quickly that will AI be able to do a

lot of the new work that's created as well. And I think that's really where the uncertainty lies here. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you for uh for answering the the follow-up question.

Much appreciated. Um, I think I'll turn now to Hector and ask you, um, you're at Microsoft and Microsoft has has published a paper, uh, measuring the applicability of generative AI to

occupations, uh, and associated data with that. And so I'm interested how you see the the future of uh, of data sharing by companies and uh, the uses that governments can make of that.

you hear me? Yeah. Uh, thanks, Robert. Um, and thanks for inviting Microsoft on this on this panel. Um, it's a topic that we've known for a time. Um, our colleagues at LinkedIn since 2014 have

been publishing what they call the economic graph. The economic graph is a privacy preserving map which basically provides um some index on the global labor market. Um and so they turn

aggregated signals into practical insights for policy makers, describe hiring trends, but also like labor shortage in certain sectors etc. And it it has been a really useful tool for

policy makers whether it's at the government level but also regions, states, cities, municipalities etc. are now all using these tools and I think I think we need similar economic graphs

for AI diffusion. Um I I would say there are two strong prerequisites to do this well and this starts with measurement discipline. Um I remember the paper in 2013 from Frey and Osborne uh published

by Oxford uh which was basically stating that 50% of the jobs in the US were at a high risk of being automated by AI. I think the the mistake that these two researchers made that they were actually

looking at the jobs and occupations and not at at jobs as a basket of tasks that are different from one another. And so we really need to start with measurement discipline and and and try to build this

shared evidence on where AI is used, how it's adopted, but also where gap persist whether it's skills, infrastructure, language, coverage, trust to try to mitigate these gaps. I think the second

important thing is methodologies and this is where the right norm to build these kind of tools Robert is is privacy preserving telemetry. So basically what scales across countries is a small set

of repeatable aggregated indicators anonymized taxonomized um and comparable over time. So government institutions can actually steer scaling policies in the right

direction. So now coming to um our work with consumer copilots. Um so we published a usage report for 2025 which analyzed three 37.5 millions of conversations

excluded uh education accounts. And so basically we were using machine classifiers um not human researchers to read the user content. Um and so this system extracts highle summaries rather

than relying on raw personal text. So we can learn about patterns basically without learning about individual situations. you can all access it on the web. Um, and and this re this research

really focuses on on why context matter for labor market signals. So on mobile for instance, those of you who use consumer copilot, it's interesting, but on your phone you actually use it for

health users. On your devices, you mainly focus for on work technology and career advices. And so this split is exactly I think where policy makers um need to lean in.

It's just not whether AI is used but where in daily life and work it's being integrated. Um and so for labor market impact the right UNISK is really tasks. It's not job titles. And so the copilot

framework labors labels each conversation um by topic. So what it's about and also like incorporating the intents for example searching for information versus seeking advice um

which is I think a very practical way to observe whether AI is being used for augmentation versus end to end automation um and it you know of course varies by

role sector company etc. And so I I guess you know this this first report is is a useful tool for economists. Uh it shows when and how people are using copilot. Um and generally speaking I

think each lab uh holds a part of the information here a part of the labor market usage signals. And so here I want to call out the world bank work on building a genai usage index aggregating

all these signals. Um I think ambassador you will agree with me if I say that it's more it's useful for you to have GDP kind of figures rather than financial reporting. Uh and so that's

that's that's actually what companies such as mine have been contributing to. Um why it matters. Um I think we published the AI diffusion reports earlier this year and it shows that

across the global population one individual by six is actually using genai which is a good thing. The problem is the divide between the global north and the global south where

we have 24% of the working adult population in the global north using these AI tools versus 14% in the global south and this gap is only widening. So I think this is why these conversations

and these efforts are are so helpful. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you Hector. Pamela I'll turn now to you. So, uh, you're in industry and you've done, uh, research on these exact topics. So, I'm I'm

curious how you see, um, the the things that, uh, let's say, global south countries can do now to get smarter on, uh, the sorts of data and analyses that that need to be done to mitigate labor

market impacts. Hi. Um, yeah, I'm Pamela. Um, I think that I mean I think the first thing I'll call attention is this kind of like with this word resilience because I think

that resilience really isn't about I mean predicting the future might be like one part of it. Um, but it's primarily about like how do we sort of plan for all possible scenarios and all possible

situations. Um, and you it's kind of thing where like you don't wait for a flood forecast to build levies. to sort of start to plan for like what if that happens. Um, and uh, I think it's

important because if we sort of like wait for this kind of like usage data to show something and to like understand exactly what we should predict from it, it might be too late to actually sort of

like proactively plan for what a sort of just transition looks like for workers. So, I think it's not only about like does long-term equilibrium look look okay, are there more jobs in the end?

It's really what does that period of transition look like? Because that's something that's like quite consistent throughout history that like transitions are really hard. losing your job is

really hard. Um, your job changing also is really difficult. Um, so I think like one thing uh that sticks out to me is just um sort of choosing two to three concrete workflows that really matter

locally and measuring them and distilling from that um data about like what we really want these tools to look like and how we want them to impact workers. So that might look like

something like public service delivery, BO customer support, um or like healthcare worker support, things that we think also like look very different um in the global south context than they

do in the US for instance. Um and so in those contexts, can we sort of measure the impact of AI? um and really say uh like given that what what is like likely to happen and what is the sort of

predictive validity we should attach to things like usage data for the kind different kinds of impact that it might have because just like saying people are using this in a context and I'll maybe

say more about this in my second question but um is it doesn't really tell us um is it substituting is it actually delivering productivity gains um but if we do these kind of like

detailed studies not just on places where we're like worried about work but also where like the tools could have real power to deliver better support and better services for people. I think

we'll like end up seeing a lot more this is like and I think it's like important to focus on these places where global south use is probably like likely very different than the US use. So one

instance is in healthcare delivery. Um in the US there's sort of lots of regulation that exists around like who can deliver what kind of healthcare at with different points of service. If

you're in a context where that doesn't happen, I think the power of AI to actually drastically improve outcomes for people is much higher. And so um actually measuring that and sort of

figuring out how to put the tools in the hands of people to realize those impact those positive impacts is a lot more important. Um and also that data can then be used to actually train better

systems and like be much more deterministic about how you want this the world to look um rather than kind of like responding to the data that the companies will give you. Um, one for

example that I think also like usage data is the questions we want to ask about usage data is not just like how is this being used or like how is the tool being used but also how is usage data

being used and so how do you sort of like keep more of that those questions in the hands of the global south to ask is important &gt;&gt; great thank you um so ambassador to go

Kenya has uh launched the Kenya artificial intelligence skilling alliance uh which it says uh is focused on skills development, innovation, opportunity

creation and policy collaboration. Uh could you tell us a little bit about how it decides where to focus its efforts for reskilling and opportunity creation?

&gt;&gt; So I think a couple of things and and Kaiser I think you know in our view was very much to understand that industry still continues to lead in the development of this model. So I think

the first premise is that industry needs to advise um government and the entire ecosystem where this technology is going as much as it's unpredictable at least we know some foundational elements don't

change and so I think one is how do companies make investments secondly how do companies reimagine the entire workforce of the workplace uh we we know now for sure that CIOS don't talk to

CTOs don't talk to CEOs don't talk to CFOs so the labor market is kind of broken in terms of the industry level but also we've had challenges traditionally around leadership whether

it's CEO level, seuite level or board level. So we've been having serious issue around transition even before AI uh created this disruption. So I think for us is to understand how to reimagine

and re-engineer industry itself. And when I say industry, it includes governments, it includes um private sector. So it's civil society. So it's and research institutions and education

institutions. So I think for us we are looking at it as entire um whole of country approach to this. The second part of course is and this is something that I think the usage data speaks to is

the current currently in the global south we really have broken labor market information systems. That's why you can't find data um simply because I think that there's been years of

disinvestment in the labor market and the data that advises jobs. We can't give job reports like the way the US does. So, so part of our understanding now is how do you using AI and using

these capabilities begin to create capabilities around data to understand the labor market as much as it's nuanced as much as it's changing. I think without data you cannot necessarily do

anything. The third part of course is the investments in people and that's what I think Kaiser does is how do you have the long-term investments but also understanding you need to reskill and

upskill but also understand you need to create a safety net. uh and again the World Bank and you're right so we talking World Bank around social protection around potential job

disruptions of older populations so for Kenya for example we have an anomaly median age of 20 and then an aging population of 60 so if I look at sectors food sector 60 years

old farmers and you have tees uh who are the innovators who need to innovate around the food system so I think for us that's what we're trying to do with Kaisa is manage all these problems but

also understand that you have a societ society that is part of this transition whether they're 20 years old or 75 years old. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Um Shamika uh so India uh has

um recently established a high-powered standing committee on education to employment uh to audit the impact of AI on jobs. So um we've been talking a lot about data

and the data that um that governments could get from companies. What's your view? what what data is needed in order to make these decisions effectively. &gt;&gt; So, you know, partly uh the kind of

digitization efforts that have been happening uh within companies such as no.com, you know, which are basically placement agencies, the search cost uh has fallen very significantly on account

of this kind of a matching uh value which is created. What we are going to see is that so far the government has not gotten into those aspects of uh the labor market. You're going to see the

government increasingly get into that. But I think there are far more again fundamental problems such as uh low skills. Uh it's not and I think technology has uh definitely a very

important role to play there. I think AI solutions will be very helpful but uh we are uh yet to see fundamental replacements for basic education you know uh basic cognitive capabilities uh

and I think there AI tools will be you know in incredibly helpful uh we have in many parts of the country acute shortage of teachers quality of education remains a critical concern uh and similarly of

Even in healthcare we do have acute shortage of teacher doctors as well as nurses uh of medical practitioners, paramedics. So I think you know the the general belief now is that we have to

get the education sector AI ready. We have to get our human resources uh which is young population. The median age in India is uh 28 point something. uh and I was looking at Barat's results. Uh it's

the young people who tend to get displaced first. Uh but you also have uh a great degree of openness and and the probability of adoption also is related to age. So in a lot of these results

beyond the averages, I think we will have to look at the distribution itself and the distribution is is is still a work in progress. uh and I think as uh we begin to collate and put a lot of

this uh data together uh I think we will have to do some kind of a bal cost uh disease analysis for every sector of the economy uh because that's that's the kind of uh impact we're likely to see.

&gt;&gt; All right. Uh thanks so much. Uh so um I have uh quite a few other questions here but we'd also like to open it up to the audience for questions today. And we have uh a couple of people with

microphones uh who will be going around. Uh so um maybe just while we're waiting I see a number of hands but the the microphone will get Oh okay. Great. Yes. In the back.

Hi. Um so I mean there's a conundrum which I would like you know the panel to solve. So either it's frontier tech or it's jobs right but the role of economic planners and we've seen that in the past

uh all all the contemporary tech in case of Singapore they managed frontier tech as well as jobs in case of India banking system we managed computers as well as you know the jobs in case of UK when the

mechanical carriages arrived the then frontier tech uh we could see that the role of economic planners when they do not do it properly disrupts the entire ecosystem. Now in case of India, we've

done that pretty good with the digital public infrastructure. So the questions are threepronged. One is for Shamika ma'am that how can India depart its DPI efforts to the global south which needs

such economic planning sophistication efforts. Second is to Oxford Martin. How do you all plan to take on such uh initiatives? And third is to uh Bhat that what research is there on this

particular front with the role of economic planners especially in the global south increases. &gt;&gt; Thank thanks very much. Um right so the two folks on my right Shamaka do you

want to start? you know after the G20 the G20 meetings of 2023 uh there were 60 countries that put up expressions of interest uh to adopt some version of India's DPI right whether it

was Aadhaar whether it was the UPI etc uh there is and almost of course all of them were from the global south bar in Japan uh so there is already a great deal of effort which is underway uh in

terms of uh expanding this but I think again uh you know based on larger questions that you're asking you know it reminds me of a conversation that happened in the Indian parliament I

think 15 years back when the finance minister at that point said you know what are you talking about a poor woman in a village using a cell phone to make a payment right and and here we are and

mean it happened a lot faster than we anticipated so I think uh thankfully now within the government there is a great deal of not just an openness I would not say great understanding still because uh

I think uh that's still a work in progress. Uh but there is a certain degree of humility uh that we do not understand many aspects of this technology and what it's likely to do

and I think that's a great place to start. Yeah, I um I I think one of the primary roles that government plays uh right now in

the modern economy is acting as a social safety net for people who face various challenges whether those are economic or otherwise. And I think uh part of what we need to think about today is are the

social safety nets that we have developed whether in developing countries or elsewhere are well suited for potential job impacts that we might see with AI and in addition to that they

also play an important role in education and I think there's an enormous opportunity there as Shamika was mentioning earlier to use AI as a tool for education where people can upskill

towards the types of work that becomes uhre inreasingly demanded in the economy going forward. Uh and I think that's a very underdeveloped area where we could do a lot more work to help people adjust

going forward. &gt;&gt; Great. Uh who is next? Somebody should have a microphone but I can't see. &gt;&gt; Should pick somebody or &gt;&gt; Yes, I think so.

Uh let's sure. Let's go right over here. &gt;&gt; Yeah. uh just want to understand like since we have various countries uh have a different culture uh to follow and when AI comes into the picture for basic

educations so how we are balancing that considering the fact like AI has uh major other impacts as well con you know demonstrating the data so how exactly it will be impacting so that it can be

democratized among various cultural aspects of different countries like India India has a very different culture than US. So how we can incorporate the culture which US is following can be

coming here in India as well. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; How will be balancing? &gt;&gt; That's a great question. Uh who would like to take that? Uh maybe Hector Tiko

uh both of you I'm sure will have maybe and you can talk about the multilingual evaluations also. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And I think and that's the answer basically. I think a lot of us now are

looking to build um around local language um models. Um of course not every country can do it. Uh but I think part of what we're looking at if you come into the African continent is

larger collaboration because a lot of these languages kind of spread across we we are colonial borders but the people spread across countries. So I think this is something that a lot of us are doing

it. Second part of course is again and you said it, it's about training and building local talent because when you build local talent and local training then you have culture and context in the

models and I think for us that's that's something that we're looking at and it's not saying we shouldn't collaborate or cooperate with with with with other cultures because again global culture.

So I think I I like to separate that be locally have local context but also be interoperable with global context. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Yeah. Do you want to talk a little bit about the drive to have

multilingual multicultural evaluations and and model generation? &gt;&gt; Yeah, sure. Um, I think that's that's a great question and if you look at the pre-training phase of an AI model, we

use a technique called web crawling technique where basically I crawl data on the web that is available and 40% of the data that we crawl as an industry not only Microsoft is English data

basically and so we definitely have room for improvement on two sides. uh one side is simple performance to be honest like how an AI model is supposed to be performing well in a diversity of

languages if we're relying only on two three languages in the pre-training phase that's an issue but also from a safety perspective and and that's where I relate very much with the point with

the point you've made on on culture and context like if you translate safety benchmarks for instance from one language to another you lose the context in which these safety benchmarks were

built and so it's It's so important to do this work with communities in different countries to forge these safety tools and safety evaluations in Hindi in Tamil and that that's what you

know so many interesting organizations are doing right now including ML Commons including Saride IoT Madress and so this is a critical topic for multilingual capabilities as a whole not only

performance &gt;&gt; yeah maybe I'll just quickly mention on that and and I think uh those of you who'd like to speak raise your hands And then Nick you can pick somebody. Uh and

in the meantime I'll just mention that I think there was a striking example that Khali Kabali used yesterday uh where she said that um in India now uh it is not permissible to know the sex of a newborn

baby before it's born. Uh but now anybody can load a sonogram that they get into chat GPT and find that out. So that is a really I think nice example of the sort of things that we we need to be

careful about. We need to be sensitive to cultures. I mean that is simply one example among countless. Uh but this is I think really a challenge. Absolutely. Um good. So uh who is our next question?

&gt;&gt; Please. Well, I have a very specific question is uh which red line did you note that should be applied to the uh labor topic in order to guarantee labor resilience?

&gt;&gt; Which red lines applied to the labor topic? That is an interesting one. Uh would anybody like to take that? Um yeah, I think anyone who like says they know the answer to that is is

probably lying. Um and like it's in part because it's just like a very economic you know culturally dependent thing and there a lot of these issues are very different not even just country to

country but blockto block. If we think about different states in India, education is going to look totally different. Um and I but I do think that like it's useful to do some you know

detailed scenario planning of like what is the most extreme kind of thing we could think about happening and what are the sort of like more median things and doing this across sectors as well is

quite interesting um and in then in the face of each of those scenarios what would we do and I think that what often happens when you do this exercise is that a lot of the solutions look very

similar across different things you know like fixing our social safety net isn't something that we only want to do in the case of you know widespread unemployment And it might be something we want to do

earlier or might be something that we want to sort of like have clear trigger conditions and not like that sort of phase in over time. And so um I realize I didn't entirely answer your question,

but I think that like part of it is that we should, you know, we can prepare for the worst without um necessarily like knowing that we'll end up there. And often that's like easier also to reach

agreement on. If you're sort of like framing these things as this is a far-fetched thing that you know might never happen, it's easier to get us to sort of agree of like okay well in the

case of that happening here are all the things that we'd agree to do. &gt;&gt; So I I think uh unfortunately I it's my job to slowly bring the panel to a close. Uh so um we've we've heard really

um I think uh partly worrying if we're honest and partly inspiring uh things from all the panelists to whom we are great very grateful and we'll thank them in a minute. Um but one thing that they

certainly all agree on is the need for data uh and the need for governments to be able to respond to labor labor market impacts and there are um interesting and subtle reasons for that and there are

also sort of really obvious reasons for that. You know, when you talk to governments around the world about how they're going to respond, usually the word reskilling is very prominent. And

reskilling programs actually don't always have a great track record of success. Um, sometimes they can be effective, but they haven't always been in the past. But how are we going to do

reskilling if we can't a answer the question reskilling to what? It was just a few years ago, I think. now uh seems almost a lifetime but a few years ago I think we were all telling our nieces and

nephews uh that they should really get into coding that that was the main thing you know and now of course we know that probably before any other job is automated it may be the job of coders.

So uh certainly as uh was very helpfully pointed out I think we need a certain amount of humility here but we really need to figure these things out and and to do that uh we really need we really

need uh data. Um maybe I can just mention uh that there uh seems to be um a um a collaboration uh between uh the Indian government and and companies perhaps uh to announce later this week

that they will that the companies that that is will be uh sharing uh usage data on on models and and committing to do that. So I think that is a great first step uh something that uh we hope will

continue. We hope the companies will coordinate so that they can share data uh which is uh can be pulled and and thereby uh researchers gain an overall picture of what is happening uh in the

economy. Um but um I think some some reasons to hope there and some of the folks on this panel although maybe they aren't uh taking full credit uh have been deeply involved uh in those

efforts. Um so uh with that I think uh it's my job to say please join me in thanking this excellent panel. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; really enjoy watching
