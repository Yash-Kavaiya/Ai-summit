## 📝 Transcript

for me as I was coming out here thinking about three lost people in a family in one year. &gt;&gt; So John, if I was to, you know, double down on the on the adoption piece and

especially the predictive side of things, you know, one one hurdle that that we see in the deployment of predictive tools specifically and I don't know if you uh have a an opinion

on this is regulation of predictive tools, right? uh do do you have a view on like how does the FDA look at it or globally like you know if the one is an AI solution that says you have or don't

have cancer the other is an AI solution that says you are there's a 90% chance that you will get cancer in the next two years right like from a regulatory perspective you know since you are in DC

like is there &gt;&gt; yeah so I I was thinking about this there's sort of four models three models that are driving things there's the EU model there's the England model there's

the India what's going on in the US. Um, we're all making these investments and I I think it's a function of time before the the advanced predictive capability um becomes the standard of practice. Um,

that's why we're all here. We all want to know. I I I'm guilty. I'm a American man. Canadian born American man. I never went to the doctor. I was afraid they're going to find something and I didn't

want to know. And I figured I was young enough back then that I didn't want to know. I started going to the doctor five years ago and I go every year and I go for

other screenings. I got everything going on. Um but but I want to know now and I also think a big part of of the demand for that predictive capability um where the return on the investment may not be

completely visible now um is that if we're educated that we can get that kind of predictive capability that will tell me what I'm predisposed to. years ahead of time. I wasn't ready when I was 40

years old and I'm a lot older than that now. And and what I feel like is is um this technology is going to make it so much easier for a 40y old younger person to say I want to get in front of my

health. There are things I've had a heart issue. Um I've got all the spots surgeries that go with that. Um I want to know now and I got I got my numbers last week and there are some certain

things that that I want to know now because I'm passing on dessert this week in India because my blood work said I should pass on dessert. So I think the

predictive um offering um the more normalized these AI models are and they become normalized in our everyday life it will it will sell itself. That makes sense.

&gt;&gt; I think I think on a lighter note having to part dessert in India is &gt;&gt; torture. No if you can do it then you know you you you deserve to you deserve good health. [laughter]

So uh so no so just uh you know Kitika you know you are both a builder and a user of of these technologies and you know one of the few in the world uh is it real like do you see the impact of

AI in your practice today or uh and especially if you could touch on your thoughts on the prediction side of things but we we'll get to that but do do you do you feel the impact in your

practice like have the number of patients you cater to increase number of diagnosis you made increase or you know one of those metrics do you actually see it

&gt;&gt; I think uh what's amazing about AI is how much we both overestimate it and underestimate it I think I mean there is there is that problem with estimation on both sides uh and I think when we talk

about um you know and and um thank you John for like sharing some things which were extremely personal so I think I I think what you did with that is also brought in a real human component to it.

So I think it really helps us sort of absorb how it's going to be when it actually touches a human life. And from that perspective uh when I say underestimated uh you know I work on

breast cancer and that's my primary area of work and we've been trying to look at uh development of of exactly you know some form of screening for breast cancer. You spoke about how you had to

delay the screening by a couple of years. We don't do screening uh because it's impossible to do screening in India and yet uh you know breast is one of the most common cancers in India. So how do

you deal with a problem like that and we've been working on trying to see if we can triage patients and yet uh you know it gives me goosebumps to think that my model is going to be used in the

absence of a radiologist. Um so I'm I'm okay when it goes to clinical trial but suddenly when I'm applying for licenses I don't want to do that. I'm not sure I'm confident to do that. This is a

model that I have built. So I've been through all the processes of building it. I know how it's working. I've tested it. And yet there is that you know fear somewhere. So that's where we are

underestimating what we can do with it because imagine what it can do at a population scale. Forget about what it can do at an individual scale. That's what we fear most often. You know we say

what if it misses cancer here. But then you know you you multiply that by the number of patients you can possibly catch and I think you'll see the effect uh really multiplying. But why I say we

also overestimate it uh is going towards the prediction right like you know you do have a lot of papers which talk about how you can suddenly start seeing the cancer two years before it happened. uh

but most of them don't really cover what if you know how many of those do not turn out to be cancer right so how many false biopsies are you sort of um also sort of uh putting into the system how

many patients are you putting through the the the whole anxiety of possibly harboring a cancer so I'm going to talk about it also so not just as a data scientist uh which is where I wanted to

be sort of um you know uh I don't want to be underestimated but as a clinician where I'm I'm scared of the misses but also as a patient right because uh if I'm told I have a 60% risk of harboring

cancer I'll probably get heart disease in the next year right so so just out of anxiety so how do you how do you balance out these things uh I think so it's it's a very necessary thing there's no

running away from AI it's here to change everything and everything that we know about practice uh but we need to all sit together and draw out the guardrails to ensure that it's deployed in a safe

environment and that's where we'll see value. &gt;&gt; So critica if I was to kind of you know put you on the spot and say that you know if you had a magic wand and you

could build that you know rule so that states that this is what we do with a 60% probability of cancer kind of output. What would what would you do?

&gt;&gt; I think that's a very difficult question but uh uh See, I think where it helps, I I'll change that a little bit into where is it that we can actually harness it. For example, and I think public health

is a very good example of where we can harness it. Uh so if I am able to say that I'm 90% sure that this patient does not have a cancer, then suddenly I'm I'm going to increase uh the probability of

being able to screen more people than I ever can. So I' I'd sort of rather focus on the on the negative than the positive in terms of being able to triage out patients rather than triage in patients

into the system. That's where the value lies. &gt;&gt; So so I guess I guess like a a a key takeaway could be like from that on the on the percentage. So this is the

threshold problem right that most AI solutions face is that where do you draw the line right what is positive what is negative. So uh you know we kind of push for this thought that maybe you create a

I don't know category like you know above 80 is positive below 20 is negative and 20 to 80 is I don't know do whatever you would have done without the AI.

&gt;&gt; Yeah the whole uncertainty estimation and then trying to sort of yeah push it in that direction. &gt;&gt; Correct. No awesome we can uh you know I can I can keep grilling Kika on this uh

all day long. Uh slight background I've known her more than 25 years. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; So school together &gt;&gt; school together.

&gt;&gt; So uh so no but I'll on that conversation I'll switch over to you Aurorva. you know, as an investor, what do you hear, right? When you when you listen to GE uh talk about the, you

know, the immense potential of AI and then you listen to a clinician, right, talk about again the the ups and the downs and and no kind of consistent narrative, right, that says that, you

know, you do these 1, two, three, four steps and you get to AI monetization. Uh, how do you how do you look at it as an investor, right? you guys I think are trained to do high-risisk high reward

and you know that math but would love to hear your perspective. &gt;&gt; Sure. You know at one point you're talking about people who are changing the world and then you talk to people

like me who are talking about irr makes us look very small but uh you know I think we have some role to play in the ecosystem &gt;&gt; look small with large IRS

&gt;&gt; uh well LPS like to believe so but u you know we started investing in health uh vintage 2016 2017 uh where we did 19 odd health tech investments there was no AI there uh and I would say that was good

vintage to invest in health because it was not sexy at all. Um when we started doing that we we made various investments and you know luckily they've done well then we stopped investing much

uh because we did not find a right to win for a lot of the investment a lot of the entrepreneurs who were coming and what they were doing if even if you look I mean then there was the covid madness

which I think has to be ignored u 20 even last two years right 23 24 each year us saw about 10 billion of investment in healthare in health tech each year. Last year which is 25 that

went up to 15 billion. So that's a 50% increase and 60% of that was AI related. So there's genuinely a belief in the healthcare investment community that AI could be one of the right to wins for

these new companies coming up. If we look at the companies in the west, lot of it is focused around cost optimization. U so you know the fancy word is ambient clinical intelligence

which is basically uh transcription and B2B workflows. Uh and you know there's a lot of money to be made there a lot of money to be saved there. uh diagnostics of course uh is is a favorite and you

know you would know more uh and you know the rest of the panel can talk more about that but that continues to attract money. Um there is drug discovery which is great sound bites uh but they are not

seeing too much investment yet so that's a theme which is yet playing out and we'll see where that goes. Um but those are the themes which are playing out in the west. Um India on the other hand uh

has been a market which focuses on distribution and reach uh which is where value is unlocked. Um if you see the models in the west they are the large LLM models sitting on cloud uh and

requiring large uh uh uh infrastructure investments. But when we look at some of the companies which are now coming out of India, they're creating SLMs which is small language models, very specific,

very deliberate. They are not uh requiring too much uh memory. They're not requiring too much uh uh storage. They're not requiring too much uh electricity to run. Uh which is a great

opportunity for point of care devices. Um which is where we see there's going to be a huge opportunity. And a lot of the entrepreneurs are not talking about how they're going to disrupt the west.

They're talking about the global south. So they're talking about the you know the emerging markets. How are we going to make a dent in the big emerging markets today? 80 to 90% of the costs of

uh the hospitals there is really importing uh products from the west which are expensive capex. here. Now we're talking about very lean devices maybe not million dollar imaging devices

but say 50 to$100,000 devices very cheap with AI imaging enhanced capabilities so that it can take care of 80% of the problems that exist. Uh so that is a big opportunity for me and those are the

themes which are playing out. So Purwa if I was to just uh you know double click on the whole India uh like build in India for either India or the global south you know uh do you truly see there

being a billion dollar revenue company healthcare AI company focused on say South Asia Africa maybe you know Southeast Asia etc like do you think that is truly possible Well,

it depends on the substreams, right? So, if you think about it, u if it's purely purely data analytics, it's very difficult. U it is going to be uh ROI accredititive uh it's going to be EITA

positive, but would the revenue throughput be there? I don't know. But the minute you start talking about devices, I think the scale and the the unit economics there could make sense.

Um also you know we talk about we we also think about the disruption and you know how fast these companies can make an impact. So hitting that billion dollar revenue mark u is is you know I

think we're more in the range of the 100 million revenue mark and if that kind of plays out in the TAM uh I the total addressable market then that's of interest uh because then those companies

uh uh can go on to either IPO or get a strategic sale. &gt;&gt; Got it. No, thanks thanks for that. Uh I think we'll come to you Adash. Uh so uh Adash you know you're your your your

background is and correct me if I'm wrong but essentially you you build analytics tools at ro uh for use by ro by others as well. Uh what do are you able to do today using

AI that you could not do five years ago? There are lots [clears throat] of things which we can do now. Sorry with the so five years ago if if I talk about uh where we were it was most

mostly retrospective analytics you know uh everything is reactive uh you and then the models are pretty siloed and static. uh but uh with with the in last five years and then I have to count last

two years with with the advent of uh generative AI that is that is a different ballgame but if you if you don't talk about generative AI for a minute there's so many things now which

we can do not because of uh this exponential expansion of the technologies but also from the maturity which also comes uh from the data aspect. So, so the in in healthcare the

maturity is much more better uh in terms of u uh data interoperability and then uh that fueled lots of things uh three years ago when we started looking at how we can improve and optimize uh not only

the diagnosis but things which comes before and after the diagnosis. So if I could just hold that thought you know you mentioned that uh data the interoperability is good in healthcare

whereas you know improving so whereas you know we kind of is is that also because like you are inside ro and you know you make all these amazing machines and you know they talk amazingly well to

each other and maybe it's the uh it's a it's a part of a story but uh if you really want to create uh uh end to end system awareness when it comes to diagnostics You cannot only rely on the

data which is coming out to the machines. You need to have a end toend data coming out from the patient history, patient journey, uh the data coming out from EHR systems and EMR

systems and then you will be able to you should be able to connect that to to get uh get a you know very uh rich data points uh for a for a patient. So it's not only yes it helps uh if you

are working with a company which you know uh have these instruments you can actually influence how to make the data fair but uh it's not only that it's it's about a whole ecosystem of the data and

the idea that yes there are things which we can do with this data which are really valuable. Can we just take the data coming out from the instruments and look at the patient demography and

figure out something interesting right earlier if &gt;&gt; do you also think other sorry I'm cutting you would just uh you know I like going off script

uh do do you also think that with the advent of LLMs and you know all the all of the power that they have we don't really need very good data anymore to draw insights or or would it

still Would would you still want like you know the type of data that maybe a deep learning model or a you know one of those traditional models required?

&gt;&gt; Very interesting question but uh from where I look at uh the data which we need is it it serves very completely different use case and purpose than what Gen AI and then LM can do. So it's good

in the summarization of the patient summary. It's good in uh uh creating a bullet points out of 30 pages long and it it is good to be taken uh by uh uh a radiologist and and a and a doctor to

look at uh the the uh cases which it is which it prioritized. But when you talk about uh non LLM AI it we still are at at a very nent stage where we actually figure out uh the real uh value which

this data holds. So we so it's it's kind of a two different stream from where &gt;&gt; examples maybe you know like or an example of a non LLM uh based model &gt;&gt; if I have to give a non LLM and then not

talking about uh the propriety uh AI solution &gt;&gt; this is this is not being broadcast on YouTube all over the world &gt;&gt; okay but uh but I I I'll give you I will

give you something u if we talk about uh errors which are happening in a in a diagnostic machine right uh if we want to detect an issue automatically before it happens or uh the the sample starts

from patient and ends up in a diagnostic lab. Can we make sure that we track the sample across the path and then figure out if there's a problem with the sample the the temperature are not maintained

and the morbidity is going well or or it's insufficient uh sample and then can we reduce the wastage which is happening at the diagnostics end and can we optimize uh the supply chain can we uh

you know reach out to the customers before the issue happens so that the continuity and the optimization remains there these are all non AI non LLM uh you know use cases which still needs

very extensive data very high quality data to actually make a difference in a health ecosystem or don't thank you very very beautifully put you know like these are you can't I don't think at least you

can feed like days upon days of time series data into an LLM and then expect it to give up maybe you can I don't know but uh I'll I'll maybe you know jump back to to you John and uh uh you know

let's do some examples right the next next bit uh let's talk about some examples of of AI uh so John from your standpoint at GE you know what are some of the initiatives that G is running

either commercially or through the foundation uh that use AI or that are driving the adoption of AI &gt;&gt; sorry let me speak to the foundation part of it first um I helped set up the

GE Healthcare Foundation and we um those of you who remember when GE Healthcare was part of big GE, we by by necessity and by pride we we felt like we were the most compliant company in the world

because we were really we were so big. We were the most scrutinized company in the world. So um as we spun off and we're now this sort of freestanding we like to joke we're a 125 year old

startup uh kind of kicked out of the and on our own and we're loving it. It's great. Um, but at the same time, I looked around and I was like, gosh, all these other medtech companies have

foundations. We don't have one. We never really thought about it. Um, so I went to our CEO. I said, hey, we need a foundation. You know, it's just standard operating procedure that a healthcare

company would have a foundation. And then we had to be compliant which means we did not create a foundation that pushes our products has to be very separate bright line between the

foundation and the business model. Um and so um we focus on maternal health and training so staffing and things like that. There can be some you know adjacency certainly but but uh

it's it's not like a business model for us. It's it's a do good in the world model. We're trying to make a change in an area that matters. We are doing metrics right now to make sure that we

can see if we're our our foundation's having an impact. We're just two and a half years into it. So, we have a long way to go. So, I don't have a lot to say about AI with regard to the the

foundation because we're still new. I'm trying to drive a process where we measure it and AI will come into it probably not through our products but more of our workflow. Um, on the

business side, you know, I was thinking as I was listening to the speakers here, um, And you and I, you helped trigger this thought when we were talking before. Um,

you know, for years, GE has had a great business model when it comes to mergers and acquisitions, be business development, right? If you look at the core of our

acquisition strategy and we're we're growing in the healthcare space, our we're capable now of making more acquisition acquisitions than we than we used to.

The the DNA all of these acquisitions is a adjacent contribution to the power of our technology. So the Mims acquisition, the BK medical up in up in in Norway, Denmark, um these are the the new

mindset that we're thinking is is we've got the generator, we've got the engine, as I said before, we don't compete anymore on slices and power. We compete on software. And so everything that

we've done in the last couple of years especially at the core of the acquisition is a strong capability to improve our technology with the benefits of AI and and and I'm not I don't think

we're alone in that. Obviously I think all medtech companies like you want to be able to do your due diligence and sift out who's not strong in that space and then you go in and you make your

your your acquisition or your business development. So I I think our our business model on the side of a company that's now in a position to make acquisitions everything about it at its

core is AI. &gt;&gt; Nice. Interesting. No, it'll be it'll be fun to see two and a half years from today uh you know where the foundation is reached.

I think I think the um the u the uh it was a term you used the small language model um that can be attractive to companies that are in a niche space

right so if you want to go tackle cardiology or you want to tackle oncology or within oncology is it a breast cancer pursuit um the small language models can

have a lot of traction companies that are our size um because they're so complimentary to the patient outcome um and that drives the business model and I think like on small language models uh

you know contrary to how the world is going a lot of our customers healthcare providers across the world still like things being on prem right a lot of regulators still are very shaky about

you know data leaving their their countries and you know There's this whole theme around data sovereignity. Uh so small language models make that also easily doable, right? You could run it

on a computer this big. &gt;&gt; Not just regional though, but but disease state. Yeah. I mean it really and within a disease state, you know, in oncology, you have hundreds and you can

really make an acquisition to hone in on liver cancer or breast cancer or or any sort of sub disease state within that broader category. &gt;&gt; Oh, awesome. Thanks. So uh Kitika you

know would love to hear examples of your work uh and also maybe a little you know insight into what you're doing at uh you know I think it's one of the country's largest AI centers of excellence that

you're starting. So I would love to hear about that. &gt;&gt; So uh are in so I I'll divide that into sort of what's already in deployment um then what we're building out and then

what we hope to do in future. So most of what we've sort of already built out and is in deployment currently mostly at clinical trial stage uh has been image based EI. So lot of uh you know breast

cancer work u where the aim again so it's it's it's entirely directed towards the public health of the country. So we're asking questions like can we just triage mamogram so can technologist plus

AI actually say that this is normal does not need to be looked at by a radiologist. Uh this is something that's in multic-enter clinical trial stage at the moment. Um we're doing this for

chest X-ray. um where again so this is a commercial AI model which just says all this is normal and uh so the preliminary read is done entirely by AI um and then we're doing this for diabetic

retinopathy where um you know this is a model where which which already has trial license sesco trial license uh largely for community screening and this has been built out on lowcost cameras

the handheld types um you know because this had to be done because the world uses the tabletop very high resolution cameras which you know that AI just simply

doesn't work in the community. So we had to build out uh AI for all of that. &gt;&gt; Quick quick thing on that you mentioned so as you built an AI algorithm for diabetic retinopathy but you still took

it to the CDSCO for approval. &gt;&gt; So all of it goes to Sedesco for approval. So unless till the time it's in clinical trial phase and you're just offering it as a research tool uh it

doesn't need a clearance. But if you have to offer it as a tool for clinical use, it needs sedco approval. So in fact, this was built with the ministry of health. So it's the ministry of

health through Vadani AI that built it with as it still needs to go through all the layers of clinical approval. So &gt;&gt; wow, that's that's that's very impressive. So you so you mentioned

there's there's Mammo, there's X-ray, there's diabetic retinopathy &gt;&gt; and and it's it's it's as tough for us. the MAMO uh clinical trial license got shut, you know, shut down because

there's no predicate device. Um, so I had to go back to for an MD22 license. So, so it doesn't make it any easier to build it in government. It's it's it's just as complex for all of us. Uh, the

the ones which &gt;&gt; I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing. &gt;&gt; No, I think um I think that's true for regulation in general, right? You want

the regulation to be strong. So you but but as a as as somebody who builds it out, it is a pain. But but I think it helps to know that that pain is happening for a reason. So I suppose

it's a good thing. &gt;&gt; Incredible. We'll just pause for half a second. Uh Mr. G Vira Pandyan, if you could please join us on stage. No problem.

So I've had a flight delay and but thank you for making it s. It's amazing. Um we'll maybe do a few questions between us and then we'll end with your your remarks. Um yes so so critica uh so yeah

again so so mammo chest x-ray diabetic retnopathy what else? &gt;&gt; So these are all the image based sort of tools and I think image based tools we've reached a certain sort of level of

confidence and I think the the major takeaway from those have been sort of uh deployment focused sort of tools which just help with our workflow. I think that's what helps with the adoption the

most. Uh the second lot of tools that we've been sort of focusing on building out again is workflow focused where u you know if anybody's been to an average as OPD you know how many patients there

are right? You're seeing like 200 patients in in the two minute in the two hours that you have allocated for OPD. So what is it that we can do to ease this out? Can we do a patient

summarization outside so that uh the doctor already has a summary inside? Can we sort of ease out some of the um some of the investigations? So, can we do a cough analysis so that again you have a

preliminary report of the cough before you meet the doctor? Can we do some um you know CDSS that runs in the background so that uh it assists the doctors in training uh to to kind of uh

go through issues like respiratory diseases uh diabetes and hypertension etc. So those have been the areas of focus in terms of you know what is coming out a lot of focus on um SLMs

again um also because of you know how conservative it is on the energy right so I mean it it's it's about it's partially about the data security which also is very important but also that uh

you don't want to deploy these huge GPUs you can't afford to do that everywhere you can't use that much energy so so so that's been a bit of the focus But I think the you know I would say very

exciting area is also discovery of new things like you know like you were mentioning uh which is you know for example in breast cancer we've been trying to ask um you know we know that

there is a rural urban divide we know that India's had protective factors against breast cancer we've you know traditionally we've had very low incidence of breast cancer and suddenly

that's changing so can we actually find out what's changing so we we went ahead and we we asked people about 80 questions each. Uh this was totally some were totally anecdotal questions like

are you wedge or non-wedge? Do you use deodorant? Uh and then some of them were known risk factors like uh like do you have a family history of breast cancer? And we came out with these really

detailed sort of uh questionnaires and we're trying to see if if that can actually give us insight into um into what is causing breast cancer. Although that's you know of course that's a very

big question to ask and I don't know if we'll ever get to answering that but can we at least identify risk factors so that you know some of them may be modifiable and then can we identify who

is it who is at high risk so that we can selectively offer screening to that population. So, so to the question you asked on can we just use LLMs for it. Uh, LLMs are also trained on some data,

right? So, unless you actually give them detailed data like this, um, I think what you'll get is garbage at the end of it. Um, so that's that's that's basically what we're doing. But Vither,

I think I should put you on the spot and I know you have u sort of an experience with with using so many different AI models. Maybe you can answer that question before you move on.

&gt;&gt; No, sure. So, happy to. Thank you. Um so we deploy AI across the world uh you know developing countries, developed countries. So you know we have the privilege of working with some of the

world's largest radiology providers. Uh and there are uh you know six use cases that stand out at least in our work. Uh the first is stroke. So in any hospital you know stroke care generally becomes a

very important part of of the ER workflow. So patient comes in suspected stroke gets a CT scan done scan comes to us we run you know an AI model on it and then if there is stroke the neuro team

is alerted the radiology team is alerted like folks are alerted and basically says that read this scan first uh because doorto needle time is what is most paramount uh for stroke care that

that is one use case you know going lower uh chess CT scan so a lot of the world unfortunately not India but a lot of the world now has lung cancer screening programs where you know CD is

used to screen for nodules in the chest. Uh that is being done by AI. So it makes negative rule out much faster. So if a radiologist goes through a you know like 500 images and concludes there is no

cancer. If you have an AI looking over you also saying that there is no cancer, the likelihood that something is missed is very low and you go faster. And the converse, right, you miss lesser because

the AI will tell you, hey, look here, look here. Uh, of course, has to be balanced out. Uh, but that's the other chest X-ray and mammos are amongst the world's most widely used. In fact, uh,

India has possibly one of the most advanced AI based tuberculosis screening programs on the planet. uh just through our platform around 5,000 they're not even patients right citizens are

screened for TB every day using AI no human in the loop nothing right there's an X-ray that is done and AI advises the tech that should they take a sputum sample or not um then mammo again uh we

we are used by the government of Singapore right all Singapore citizens get AI based mammo screening done uh US is very interesting ladies are paying for their own AI uh to

be used by by the by the radiologists. It's it's $40, $50. It's literally marketed as the cost of, you know, a week's worth of Starbucks, right? So, they say one week worth of Starbucks can

get you a better outcome on your mamogram. Um going lower cardiac disease uh you know very advanced calcium scoring on a regular CT scan can be done uh spine MRIs are being automatically

reported. So in our world you know we look at it as body part modality pathology right so for every body part for CT MRI ultrasound x-ray CT and for every disease state there could be an AI

solution and that's uh that's kind of our ecosystem our world uh very different stages of adoption very very difficult to implement like our biggest hurdle honestly is security it security

uh nobody wants to lose their job because they decided to uh you know deploy some fancy AI uh in in their hospital and that led to whatever god forbid some kind of ransomware attack or

something but uh but yeah we have we have that uh the privilege of working with some of these awesome organizations my shameless self-promotion aside uh uh Apurva

you also run uh healthcare organizations right you have single specialty clinics uh in in the Mumbai region are patients asking for AI like and I'm assuming you you cater to varied soioeconomic data.

Can you share some insights there like what is the patient perspective? &gt;&gt; You know u I think any doctor out there knows that a patient has already triaged their illness the solution the threeear

pathway just by using Google right um and our doctors have to spend a lot of time uh making them unlearn what they have learned and are very sure of. Um Chad GPT arguably is a little better

because it it at least reads your diagnostics reports. So um so patients are AI uh whether we like it or not. They don't care about what is the privacy of the whole thing whether the

large models are using their data or not. I mean they should but they are not yet doing it. So I think the the adoption on the patient side is much higher than it is on the provider side

right now. Um when we talk about the doctors they are very interested in the there's a difference. The younger doctors are very interested in using They said I'd have to do less of the

admin crap, right? So, they're very happy using it. The elder the the more senior doctors are asking questions about liability. Uh what if I lose what if I follow the advice and it is not

right? What do I do there? Very valid questions to ask. Um but on the whole, do I see it as a binary solution? Listen, we do IVF uh cycles, right? Uh we have people who have

been married for 10 years. They don't have a child yet. They have just enough money to do one more IVF cycle. They've pawned off some of their house jewelry to do that.

When they are taking that decision, they look into the eyes of the doctor that they trust and they ask, "Will this work? Will I be okay? Will my wife be okay? Will my child be okay?"

I don't think we've reached a stage where they can trust chat GPT to do that. So um I don't think it's a binary future. I think it's a hybrid future. I think it's a future where we have to

believe that u AI recommends but the doctor assures uh and I think that's the direction it might go. So you know Purva uh I have a bit of a different you know take on it and I'm not sure if people

have observed this in your organizations but uh I I certainly see it in mine where completely unrelated right very what you're talking is very high implication last IVF cycle no money left

etc but there is this trend happening that oh uh you know why are you saying that you know this is whatever 50 ml filled with water oh oh you know chat GPD told

You know so there is this interesting trend of like while on one side we know that chat GPT cannot take responsibility liability accountability all those things on the other hand you know it has

it's also becoming a way to offload some accountability I don't know if you if you but from a patient's perspective you know again that because the doctor can't turn around and say that uh you

know it's Chad GPD said it that's why I've given you this this medicine right so I don't know maybe this is just a random rant yeah good so you are right in saying and then uh probably critica

will know better so uh what I see is like if there's if there's an AI solution which uh predicts flu nobody gives a damn but if there's an AI system which is recommending whether you should

go for a chemotherapy or a surgery for a for a stage three cancer Then everybody's suddenly concerned about their data, their privacy, their diagnosis, their prog. So it's a it's a

uh change in a mindset and then I I agree with uh you I saw this uh trend where lots of uh people have this in mind that if I start using an AI, I will have a plausible deniability at one

point of time saying that oh yeah I did it but uh yeah I took uh recommendation from an AI system. So it's not only my fault. Okay. And it's it's a mindset. Uh it's it's a mindset. But uh uh because

uh the way complexity has been increasing uh in in AI solutions uh they are becoming a blackbox with deep networks and all those now LLM is also one of them. Uh LM is also you know uh I

think uh we we need a minds change in the mindset when it comes to how we are using it. how we are being used and then how uh uh we are perceiving the system the whole system not only the doctor or

the radiologist but the whole system where AI is integrated at uh every milestone. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. So uh &gt;&gt; just on the plausible deniability

perspective right I think &gt;&gt; we as a country uh as a human race will have to figure that out. uh forget uh healthcare right talk about autonomous cars one has to realize how will that

happen if an autonomous car knocks over a person is Google responsible because it's way more um you know how does it work I think there will be a larger framework which we come upon uh which

which uh will which which will be adapted for various sectors as of now u I think human in the loop is a given and therefore unfortunately there's someone who is in the neck but uh so I think

we'll have to figure that out. &gt;&gt; I think maybe it's a good thing. Uh but with that uh you know I would like to invite uh Shri G Vapan uh commissioner health and family welfare department and

mission director at the NHM the government of Andhra Pradesh sir would love to hear your thoughts uh and uh then at the end if we have time you know questions we can do a question answer

with the audience. Good afternoon to all. Uh sorry for uh being late. Uh this session on uh uh diagnosing the future with a enabled system.

Uh is talk of the globe not not just uh talk of our country alone. So as a public health administrator uh I am seeing from uh implementation point of view uh shall

I go for my presentation or &gt;&gt; then it will be better. &gt;&gt; Yeah in case you would like to stand you can see the presentation or this is fine however you would like.

&gt;&gt; No problem. Yeah, actually uh I prepared a presentation a very short uh brief presentation about how uh we are ready from uh uh public uh health institution point of view. So that is the focus of

uh today's presentation. So what uh we mean uh AI ready system in uh government setup or in uh health sector we have experts from uh health sector

and they are dealing with different uh uh diseases specialities different domain of health sector. But what do we mean by a ready health system? uh a health system uh from uh uh government

point of view because government deals with uh uh the most majority of the population of the country. So as a responsible uh organization uh to ensure uh uh healthy state of the citizens, how

uh fully equipped our institutions, how uh organized our data, our program, our information. So we have lot of problems, we have lot of challenges. We are facing

these issues day in and day out. And if you look at the system what we implement across different levels of uh healthcare services whether it is at primary or secondary or tertiary. Uh we doesn't

have uh uh the seamless data flow. uh we say it is interoperability but we don't have uh interoperability across all uh levels even within the same level even within the primary healthcare we don't

have interoperability between uh woman health and child health or between uh within particular section say non-communicable diseases even between within the cancer

we don't have data flow between cervical cancer and breast cancer So we are dealing with same gender but we do not have organized and centralized data which talks about

woman's health from uh cancer perspective. So that is the problem we are facing that is how our system uh existing. Then finally we do not have uh standards which govern the whole system

how it should be run how it should be used how it should be implemented. So there is no proper standardization though we we have standards recently brought out by ABDM thanks to uh

government of India they brought some sense to the whole data ecosystem in government institution but still we have not reached its uh uh mature level. Then finally

whatever you do, whatever technology you talk about, whatever system you discuss, finally the person who is handling need to be thoroughly aware of what he is doing or what she is doing. uh that is

what our colleagues are discussing the co-panelists are discussing that how we make our workforce skilled those who are aware of a whether the A gives the right recommendation or it is guiding in the

right direction. So everything finally has to be decided and judged by the person who is handling it. So uh the trained health force workforce in the system is not fully ready in my opinion.

So, so what I feel that uh if we are not ready where are we where are we standing so we are having lot of uh problems across uh different layers but how we

need to overcome these challenges finally how we need to make the system a ready so that is our concern every day we are talking about how we make our uh people ready for adopting a that is

why I think the whole uh summit is being organized to learn and we we need to after learning we need to find a way to uh adapt to the system how to align with our priorities how to align with our

goals so that is a major uh concern so in our point of view from say I'm representing government of Andhra Pradesh it's one of the province of the country so when I take a decision as a

mission director of national health mission in my state or as a commissioner uh who is responsible for execution of different health programs or family welfare programs in my state. So I need

to look at my system see if you look at the journey of the whole uh government sector across different departments. I'm just taking health department as an example. But if

you look at our journey, we used to face lot of problem with manual records. So whatever we we uh collect, whatever we enter, whatever we use, everything is manually recorded. Then we thought uh

computerization is the big solution. Computerization is going to resolve all these issues because we are not able to collect the data after collection. we are not able to

analyze the data after collation. So we have lot of problems. So we thought computerization or digitization is the big solution. We brought digitization. We computerized everything and now we

are making everything uh entered online. We are not using manual system as we do in the past. But have we resolved all our issues? Have we found solution? Have we got a big relief out of whatever

challenges we have gone through, whatever issues we have experienced. No, it added another uh big issue. It become a big burden. So it is called a digital burden. So now we are using all these

technical terminologies that digital burden paradax. So it is not resolved what we want to resolve what we want to achieve. we are not able to reach that level. Instead, contradictly we moved in

opposite direction. So we are uh struggling to resolve this digitization issues. Everybody is crying. If you go to my asha, if you go to my medical officer sitting in PHC, if

you go to&amp;m village, everybody complains to you when you visit that we are entering too much of data. Always we are looking at only mobile application. Always we are looking at portal all our

performance is being assessed based on whatever data we do. So what finally it is giving the government finally people just enter the data they are not entering the reality they are just

entering just to make their performance greener in the dashboard. So the digitization did not bring a solution to the system. Instead it made another big problem. But at the same time we should

not be pessimistic. We we should not criticize what we have done in the past. Digitization is not a uh just reason for our struggle. So now what I feel as a public health

administrator having experience of handling different departments in a different capacity from my subcolctor per time to district collector or to the present position of

commissioner. So what I felt digitization has laid the foundation to make use of the great opportunity coming before us in the name of AI. So the A is going to be a greater tool effective

tool to gain whatever we have lost in the process of digitization whatever problems we faced in the name of computerization. So I am looking forward I am looking

confident that now I can make my digitized data whatever data I stored whatever data I have collected whatever uh data I made my people to enter now I can analyze all this big data can be

easily analyzed using AI tools using AI algorithms so I'm not saying AI as another software application or it is not another software tool or digital tool to uh deal

with my available data. So what I learned from different experts, people sitting next to me, I've learned a lot from all the uh experts around the world. We continuously learning,

continuously reading lot of new papers. We are continuously interacting with a lot of experts and learning lot of things. So finally what I could understand is that AI is a great

opportunity. It has to be added in every layer of our program implementation. It should be added as a fabric of the whole implementation canvas we are using for uh uh whatever uh uh outcomes we intend

to achieve. So a has to be used in an effective way not like u a mobile application or engaging some IT agency to do this application with a feature. Actually I have done all those mistakes

initially when everybody was talking about AI I want to do something AI to my department. So what I did I just got some IT agency created some AI doctor and just the AI doctor what it did did

it just guided the person who approaches my office or open my portal to identify the right facility which facility they can uh reach nearby wherever they are standing wherever they are sitting or it

will tell to which specialtity they should go if they have some illness okay so it is at the nassent stage we can give that kind of solution to the people who are facing problem at that point of

time. But now a is maturing. So when it gets matured so I should also ensure that its maturity goes into the system finally it is bringing uh a greater benefit to the people because finally

what as an administrator I want it is not I am in my personal view that I am not creating a a smarter uh tool using a finally I want the healthy people to

feel that they are completely benefited out of the whole ecosystem. So that is how we are approaching AI in our state. Already we made certain attempts. Uh we already conducted one met

hackathon in which uh I should appreciate the proactive uh vibrant participation of a lot of uh startups and industries. We got around 192 applications for my met hackathon.

Finally we could uh select 20 use cases. Now it is in the stage of implementation. Uh we gave physical sandboxes, we gave digital sandboxes for different uh finalized use cases and it

is just started last week. So we hope we get good outcomes out of these pilots. uh uh as at the government level we are also thinking very big in terms of a program called Sanjivvenini in terms of

uh creating digital health profilar yesterday only Mr. Bill Gates visited our uh state and we had very good interaction with his team and we are thinking big and we are

aiming bigger things to happen in our system especially in health sector. So I uh welcome all of you to partner with our state already we partnered with a lot of collaborators a lot of uh

developmental partners. So I make this appeal to all of you who are present here. Uh you are welcome to the state and you are feel free to present your uh solutions whatever uh uh ideas you have

you please come to us present to us. So depending upon the the the level of uh your system uh we have our own evaluation system. We have our own uh committees of experts brought

from different walks of life from IIT, IMS, IA, from Gates Foundation, from WHO, from UNP, from so we have very good team of experts to assess whatever you present. uh I think as I said at the

beginning finally we want to create a healthy society so I uh welcome uh everybody's partnership uh in achieving bigger code thank you &gt;&gt; thank you so much sir that was really

insightful especially bringing on the ground realities for all the audience I would request Dr. Vidu to give just 30 second remark to as the concluding remarks for the session since we are at

loss of time now. No &gt;&gt; I think uh thank you thank you everybody for making it so engaging. Thank you to the audience for for sticking around people are standing and all it's very

humbling. Uh thank you sir for for you know acknowledging yeah like the humility again flows through like you acknowledge that you tried to make the app and all that. So

uh I think uh yeah I think this conference is testament uh to to India's place in this in this whole thing like I was walking through the whoever here has not been to the exhibition hall please

go just to see one what Indian startups are capable of uh two what Indian big companies are capable of and three what the world is willing to invest in us right like this uh the Indian AI summit

happening for the first time ever Google has a stall that is maybe you know 30 times times the size of this room if not larger and also so yeah uh I think you know as the as they say in the movie up

time I say now it's up time is here so that thank you so much everyone thank you &gt;&gt; I think that's a great closing up time is here thank you so much to the

esteemed panelist it was a very insightful and engaging session I now request you all to kindly stand for a group photograph so we close the session now with this group photo thank you

everyone
