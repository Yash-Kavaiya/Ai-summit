## 📝 Transcript

uh who who may join us in in a couple of minutes member of secretary ICD Mr. Sanjay Sanjiv Jan chief operating officer Mr. Tulika Pande scientist G and group

of coordinator research and development in cyber security ministry of electronics information technology government of India and now I introduce our moderator Mr. Dr. Vijay Swaminatan,

CEO Draw. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. Um, super privileged to be here. When I first got the list of all the panelists, I was like overwhelmed. How am I going to moderate

12 plus people? But when I kind of peeled the onion, looked at we have the perfect setup. This panel is designed with uh supply in mind, demand in mind, government regulations,

enterprise perspective, education perspective and so on. So um my name is VJ and I'm the CEO of a company called Drop. We focus on uh labor market intelligence and work redesign.

When I started preparing for this panel, five things sort of came to the surface. One is AI is changing every day. Um even yesterday there was a news about open

claw and things like that. Um perhaps we now know that AI is not impacting jobs itself but the tasks underneath that that seem we seem to know that the second one is AI

transformation needs to be possibly approached more from a workflow perspective to understand hey marketing is designed with these 10 workflows out of this two can AI can impact so there's

a workflow perspective coming in I think the risks And uh the cyber security aspect of it is lot more critical than uh what we thought. Uh I think that is also coming up. And the fourth one is uh

our understanding of readiness is slowly getting better. Suddenly engineers are talking about creativity right so uh and the soft skills that normally we tend to ignore during the digital era. We focus

a lot more on hot skills. And I think this is probably an opportunity where government, institutes, companies, uh, and all forms of AI passionate leaders need to kind of come together.

Um, so the next 30 minutes or so, uh, with these five forces in mind, I've designed some questions and hopefully we we can have a lot of fun. I'm going to begin with, uh, my first question, which

is something I'm seeking an answer to. The term workforce readiness is often used very loosely. I've been researching all this for two years and I still don't know what it is.

Right? So workforce readiness from the context of Genai talent imperative, right? Uh that sounds so cool but what what does that actually mean? So I'm going to ask Indrani to give her

perspective on that. &gt;&gt; Hey thanks Vijay and wonderful job done in setting the context and the framework. uh and since we are kicking off this session uh we're really really

on behalf of all the panelists I am actually very privileged to be part of this conversation um and I'm sure all our panelists are and so let's have fun as Vijay just said so Vijay just as uh

you started your conversation as what does workforce readiness mean honestly I think in this room everybody is using the term but may mean different things right and I'll just talk about my own

experience in terms of how it has evolved I was for a long time a chief learning officer for Microsoft India and when I was looking at workforce readiness for to be prepared for the

Genai world for me it was skilling only skilling right I mean which courses which certification how do I make sure that people are skilled or they know what's coming up next

forward like two years back I joined the AI strategies I'm now the director of AI strategies in Microsoft's consulting arm and uh I work with a team of engineers who are working with Genai on a daily

basis on complex transformational jobs for different customers globally uh the top 500. Okay. So then that made me rethink on what is actually workforce readiness because no longer it's about

what people need to do or what they know. Uh it's about how you use AI in your day-to-day work and life and how you can get an outcome which you own. Right? So I typically take workforce

readiness in three layers. First is the basic AI fluency right you need to know which tools come up how does it help you to do your day-to-day job whether it's coding then geni pops up in terms of

GitHub copilot if you are doing uh documentation or you are doing uh even research you have it right but that's table stakes it's similar to in 1990s when email came in it was nice to have

but now can you think of a world without email so it's It's important. Digital literacy, I mean AI literacy, fluency on tools is very very important, but it's just the starting ground. Layer two,

which makes it a little bit more interesting, is how do you redefine tasks, right? Because it's now the readiness comes as an employee, I will look at the task or look at the workflow

and say, how can I do it differently? Not necessarily how efficiently, but how can I do it differently? where can I delegate the work to the AI totally versus where do I have to be in the loop

right what kind of interventions are required from me so just understand that when we designed uh our roles different roles that are there in the market geni was not there so it's not the competency

gap it's basically the task itself has not been refreshed whatever to make sure that you know you are able to address so that's the awareness that how do you redefine the task

And the third layer uh which is often overlooked by many organizations and it's becoming more and more critical is the entire governance layer or you know validating the outcome of AI right this

is where it really where individuals know and they have the readiness to say where do I trust AI exactly and what is it that I need to question AI for and can I literally be custodian of the uh

you know end product that AI is giving after validating all the outcomes. So it's more like in the earlier days when governance happened or security happened there multiple teams managing it it was

more reactive may not be reactive it was proactive too but different teams it was sitting in the policies. Now imagine that entire decision making is in the hands of a person at the you know last

mile connectivity and he has to make he or she has to take those decisions always so it's democratized. So in summary basically I would just look at uh readiness is not only skilling in

terms of the digital um or AI literacy is not also reskilling it's about how you use AI complement it with the human judgment to get the outcomes which you are proud to own right and I think the

measure of success would be can organizations really trust these individuals who are taking that stake and making judgment with the AI more than just knowing AI.

So that's how &gt;&gt; fantastic. Thank you Indrani. I think the three layered approach is a bit comprehensive and also something new for us to ponder on. Emily, what do you

think? You come all the way from Chicago. Thank you for that. Um and one thing uh I would like to know from you could be the global perspective on this as

well. So thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you BJ. Well and you said it's complicated. It's not that complicated apparently because I agree with everything that my colleague here said.

So see uh we are in agreement on it the workforce approach. So yes I represent Isaka. We are a global organization. We started as IT auditors. So I think you'll see our approach to workforce

readiness is reflected in that. We um are in over 180 countries and we have about a dozen really strong chapters here in India. So um we agree that table stakes is knowing how to use the tools

but that um really to have a comp workforce it needs to be um a professional who has been trained and knows exactly where AI is appropriate and where you need to keep the human

aspect and then create systems um that do that and obviously then the result um it needs to be defensible. So that's where a ready workforce is able to defend the result not just say because

as we know um it could with increased speed sometimes uh comes increased risk. So when you have a result that can sometimes be very confident and very competent but wrong um you have to

defend it because you can't say to your boss or to your client, oh well that's just what the model produced, right? it has to be um defensible and um you need the human aspect to look at that. So

that's what I I mean when I say you can tell that our roots are in um IT audit because uh we do believe that there is a big role um for the human aspect and auditing and assurance um and governance

so that we can limit the risk. &gt;&gt; Just a quick follow up on that. I mean a lot of what you say falls under the explanability of the model and uh is is that just referring to the right set of

source data or is there anything beyond that like in terms of what you would call as explanability of the model. So I think it is beyond that right and obviously it varies from industry to

industry and position to position but I do think it goes beyond that and going back you asked me about the global aspect you know I think India has come a long way and is obviously evidenced by

the fact that we are all here is at the forefront of this discussion and there are many governments um who are putting frameworks around this um I think we're seeing the beginning of that um but

there there is room you know for more than that and um Thank you so much Emily Jagish. You have done it both from a large team perspective and now you're running a

smaller team doing lot more things within the context of humanized AI. Um your perspective on what is readiness. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you Vijay. And uh um I I think you know and I'm glad you

brought that up. I was the chief strategy and growth officer at Tech Mahendra uh with 170,000 people um to now in the last one and a half years a startup on agent KI which is 19 people.

So um it's a little different um but um the challenges are similar and I think workforce readiness overall u is not probably a one-sizefits all. Obviously the things that uh Emily and Indrani

said make absolutely relevant sense but if you break it down I think each one has to break it down to the organization's relevance and then the role that you play and that's how I

think it will make a difference because if you look at uh the role that I played in techm I'll just take my example um I was responsible for a company that we had acquired called Satyam and therefore

the whole enterprise business was my responsibility about 55% of the business and there my role was more to tell the customer how we can help his business. So reading

about the industry knowing what the industry will define that readiness is for me to be able to talk to the customer and explain to them what my team can do what what we can do.

Internally I would always be attending and making sure that the internal message is going. Now in a startup I think the roles completely changed. I need to understand and make sure

everyone on a daily basis understands what does the anthropic announcement mean to us. What does the readiness? So what does that readiness mean? That readiness means the speed at which you

need to learn and the speed at which you need to embibe knowledge has to be super fast. Obviously you need to know the AI tools whether you're going to do a particular tool to accept knowledge read

make your summaries all of that is available. So like you were saying right when we were chatting that is this um one man company building an applica company is never heard of and now

they're being bought over by open AI. So that's the kind of thing that I need to make sure that I am aware and the team's aware. So when we talk about workforce readiness I think it's got to be a

little more role defined because uh a CEO's workforce being ready is very different than the product heads readiness versus the business development. But all of them have one

commonality in the AI world. The awareness of tools, the use of tools, but also the applicability of the ecosystem around it. So if you're not don't know how to apply to it, you'll

all go to the same chat GPT, you'll all go to the same Gemini or you'll all go to the same deep and get the same answers. The people you're telling to have nothing new to learn. So you know

and and this is so democratized that the guys when we started and I'm sure you know you will recognize from a vipro background that um when we spoke to the customers 20 25 years back the the guys

would listen to us now they know more than sometimes the people who are telling them because they've gone through the same deepseek and same chat GPT before I went there to the meeting.

So now you need to go and understand and make sure your teams are ready that what is beyond this. Can you create a culture of curiosity in your workforce? Can you create a culture where people are not

are ready to fail? And that's I think the workforce readiness that one needs to look at. &gt;&gt; Beautifully put uh Jagish. So um I think we probably got a little bit of a

context. Thank you for the three layered approach and uh thank you for highlighting the soft skills also. Perhaps we'll switch a little bit gears to

understand uh what the industry is seeing on a day-to-day basis. During our panel preparation, Sanjie said, "Hey, you know, this um demand perspective in terms of uh uh you know, you are living

this on a daily basis. as things change your customers uh may start asking you questions on what is the role of AI and what you're going to execute and also you are facing

the challenge of uh workforce readiness at scale so um where do you see the predominant gaps when you are uh faced with multi-billion dollar execution points pretty much on a daily basis good

to &gt;&gt; sure thanks thank you Vijay good morning everyone uh from my perspective let me talk about a little bit on the individual side for each one of us. We

speak about workforce readiness. When I graduated, I studied mechanical engineering, industrial engineering. I don't think I was ready for the IT industry. I did not study C, C++, Java,

nothing. But I think I'm doing fine. And so, so is each one of you. So, so the first point I want to make is uh what's very important and which I believe our academic institutions are doing a great

job while we can keep talking of the gap is they are preparing us to face uncertainty. They are preparing us to have something called common sense which to me is our natural intelligence which

actually supersedes artificial intelligence. I think I just want to make sure we don't undermine with all that's going around every announcement. Uh we have all at least in my case uh

survived or rather thrived Y2K. [laughter] Y2K helped us grow the IT industry. We also thrived postcoid. I think COVID was a transformative phase for the entire digital transformation is

what I would say. So the first the point I'm trying to make is transformations keep coming. I think we as humans have a lot more intelligence. Now let me tell you what it means from a corporate

perspective. Therefore so when I deal with in Vipro we have 230,000 people 66 countries 1200 clients scale is massive. So the way we deal with this, we need to have a very efficient skilling engine as

Indrani rightly said and in her role what she does for Microsoft. I think it's very important to have the workforce which is really having the learning agility and the learning

agility starts with unlearning right starts with saying that I don't know what I don't know and I'm looking forward to learn something new and I think Jagdi spoke about it creating a

culture where you are actually given opportunities to learn to fail to relearn and to do what you want. So the way I think I drive that in Vipro and from our perspective is the technologies

keep coming and we have to adapt to it. Now the way we look at the workforce is there is a role the role has various tasks as was rightly said. So the tasks are the one which are actually getting

eliminated and the tasks they get eliminated. The roles get transformed which means you have a little more time to do actually things which you would not have possibly done in your regular

time. So actually it frees up your mind to do things more, do things better, do things smarter and do things differently. So we have actually looked at our entire workforce. We have uh I

don't want to say categorized that sounds very uh differentiating but we have asked everyone to look at their tasks in the role in four areas. One is what will get disrupted with AI.

Second is what will get enhanced with AI. Third is what is net new that will be created with AI and fourth is what will remain human only. I think these are

four components we want every individual in the company to map for themselves. So this actually is helping us create new roles. For example, we will have some announcement saying that software

developers will go away. But the point is software developer will not go away. They will learn prompt engineering and they will be called prompt engineers. they will actually instead of doing

software coding they will be able to prompt and do much more better job in releasing their codes faster. I think that's the point. So I think the framework we apply is very simple. I

call it mindset, skill set and tool set. When I say mindset, it's about do I have an AI first mindset. Do I have the mindset to learn quickly, fail quickly and you know pilot things. Second is

skill set. Skills are changing. I think in every forum you go including the world economic forum they say the shelf life or the half-life of skills is shrinking. Whatever engineers today

study in the year one in the university will not be relevant by the time they graduate. Whether we like it or not but it doesn't mean that what they studied was not right. I think what it just

means is they have the basic foundation and they have to just have the ability to learn more and more. So I think learning is lifelong. I think that's a big thing. It's not that you have a

degree, you graduated and I think now you are good for life to retire. I think those definitely that era is over. I think skill is the currency and you need to kind of continuously refresh your

currency on an ongoing basis. So that was on skill set. Then coming to tool set. Tool set is we have a terrific partner ecosystem. Whether it's Microsoft, IBM, Google, AWS, you know,

whichever company, everyone is doing a great job in coming up with tools including Anthropic which actually help us do our job better. So therefore, our role as corporate is to get those tools

in the hands of our employees who are able to play around with the tool that suits them based on the role they play. An HR person may need a different tool than a person in the delivery team, than

a salesperson, than a finance person. So people play with the tools and they actually come up with what we call the use cases proof of concept and then once we feel success we kind of productionize

it. So very simply put again from our perspective things demands keep changing but as long as I know I have a base of my employees who are actively skilling looking forward to the mindset skill set

and tool set approach I think we'll be fine. I think we will I'm sure after few years we all would have done you know different things and we'll have new new roles and new industry actually come up.

&gt;&gt; Fantastic. I think the mindset skill set and tool set is a great framework as well. Um professor let me tap into your thoughts a little bit. So we are entering feels like sort of a sci-fi age

and one undesirable effect that could be um something that artic and the workforce readiness as well. Are we going to produce the same thing because we are all using a homogeneous set of

LLMs and as a result what is the room of creativity and original thinking and I I attended a few sessions yesterday and this concern came up in two or three academic uh scenarios or are you seeing

that is that is that a worry for you which means how would you change your evaluations? So, so Sanjiv beautifully brought the demand perspective. Maybe you could

throw some light on the supply perspective. &gt;&gt; Yeah, thank you so much. I mean you started this session by dis by saying let's have fun. So for fun sake, let me

disagree with everybody who has spoken. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; And my disagreement is that we won't be able to train our workforce to be ready. &gt;&gt; Reason is this. Uh when artisans were

working in guilds, they trained people to carry forward what they were doing. Then industrial revolution started and we saw some of our muscle work has been taken up by the machines. So we'll train

the intelligence to operate the machines. Now what do we train for? The machines are going to operate themselves. And kindly take a look at why we here in this room. Because

the processing speeds have increased and memory costs have gone down. And this is only the beginning. This is going to really exponentially rise. So everything that you train yourself or somebody else

actually machine will be doing it. So what do you train them for? I guess we need to reverse the way we look at our workforce training. Instead of starting from basics which we are

currently doing and you enter an engineering or a design education, we first learn the basics of the trade and then slowly you move up ladder to take up more complex problems and solve them.

And I would argue we need to reverse the training and say start with the complex problems because that's the human part which AI is narot and from there you see which tools at your present preparedness

in your domain is available to help you. So the problem remains with me as a as a as a student as a as a workforce but the solutions as the time evolves will be taken in different degrees by different

kinds of AI systems. So the training is we start right from first day and that's what we are trying to do in academics. Now first day you come to class and say hey what are the problems that interest

you and how do you think you should approach it and then you start looking for tools and mind you that was the way of education in ancient India in the gurugal system we didn't have any

curriculum the student came up with a question a problem and the course started later on we globalized and we just borrowed curriculums from the west and we have lived on that I think that's

a time now AI is giving us to probably break all the shackles of the structured curriculum and allow it to be individualled while working on a complex problem and therefore the seek tools and

the ecosystem provides it. That's my &gt;&gt; Thank you. Can I ask one quick followup like is there anything specific you either experimented or in your teaching last six months that you said

hey this really works because one of the um listening to both uh both the two questions it looks like we're going to expect a lot from humans suddenly right so u there was a comfortable rhythm that

we were settling down in terms of hey as long as I make sure data is there in 10 systems my job is okay but Now listening to all of the panelists here, it looks like we're going to expect a lot which

means at the grassroots teaching level we got to change certain things. Is there anything that you think worked well in the last 3 to six months for you?

&gt;&gt; I think I would say a couple of years because we were watching this trend coming and the tools that we were using to train our students like softwares, hardwares and we were seeing this trend

as changing. So what we've started doing and uh is that first day of the class students are given a framework in which they have to go and observe problems. So they go out in the society in the campus

or in their families and they observe problems and they bring those problems and present the problems in the class and I tell them solutions are boring problems are interesting and as they

present the problems they form groups themes and they start ruminating on what can be done and from there they raise questions of what they need to learn which tools they need to pick up and

then we guide them. &gt;&gt; That's very very rewarding to understand. Thank you. I think one promot you have the tough job now. uh because uh one of the areas

where even I personally struggle is all right we have to learn certain set of tools and we have to have AI first mindset and then there is an explanability component that is which

means so I got to do a lot more I understand that um but I also need to keep my existing job uh and survive this uh winter weather whatever you want to

call it um I don't want to use any other stronger world. So I think we can survive this but we have to survive it. So what could be a blueprint of in a very granular way these are the five

skills or 10 skills. I know I'm giving you a tough question but I think that clarity doesn't exist even if you ask in the software world beyond prompt engineering or context engineering

you're not able to go deeper and I think you could add a little bit value there. &gt;&gt; Yeah thanks in fact a very good morning to all of you. uh the interesting part is that the question is almost a counter

to what the professor was mentioning from the [laughter] top down approach actually. So uh let me just get a bit more into the technology side of it. So what happens is that AI

actually is moving from nerva of uh narrow intelligence to a general intelligence and the key aspect over here is the LLMs are more conversational in nature till recently and then the

last two years slowly it has become more taking up complex jobs and the related aspects. The most important part over here is this transition period is mostly like a kind of spectrum of paradox. The

paradox is more likely from the perspective of the employer side which he was nicely mentioning but at the same time the paradox is also there from perspectives like you know what uh a

worksop effect and various other aspects where in you know production uh versus whether you know understandability and those kind of paradox which actually exist over. So uh one of the key thing

uh during this transition which we have to understand is that this transition may be for a shorter period of time because we are moving from a level one intelligence in artificial general

intelligence perspective to a kind of level two wherein it is able to have a more complex problem solving capability. So during this particular transition maybe it may be there for one or two

years but then that paradox exists for that particular period of time. But the key thing which we have to keep in mind is that uh AI till now was an assistive in nature which is slowly moving to a

supervisory role and maybe in long period of time it can become a kind of a moral or emotional stakeholder and and this particular transition is likely to happen in the in a very short period of

time and in this place I feel that there are two key things from the skill set perspective which we'll have to look at. One is from the technology perspective wherein I can actually say that we need

to have AI builders, we need to have AI orchestration and we need to have AI literacy. From the builder perspective, I feel that you know India is doing a pretty much good job in placing a lot of

hardware infrastructure. For example, Ira almost about 538 petlop is actually thrown open for people to actually build AI and those capabilities. At the same time, AI course is also integrated into

this particular ecosystem and there's a lot of data set which is also put over this. students and the people who were aspiring to enter into the AI building capability they can actually now do

various activities like either fine-tuning rack models agendic AI how actually they work across and then they create workflows across many of those aspects they can actually work on to

such platforms specifically on India specific curated content that's some that's one most important thing which we'll have to look at because there are lot of regional problems which we'll

have to address from that perspective from the AI orchestration Actually the most important set of skills which has to be created is now mostly into the context engineering but over here the

context engineering will also get into an end to end workflow which has to be more sector specific. What I feel is that AI there is one additional aspect which has to come up. It's like a

T-shaped approach which I call it uh something like uh everywhere we see something like there should be two or three domains which someone specialize and there's a broader understanding of

all the knowledge across actually. So as long as you know the sectors come out with more LLMs and more models actually which have this T-shaped approach then more reliability will come into many of

these particular models and and that's one of the major advantage of bringing these models into the real sector specific use cases for example whether it is for manufacturing sector or

whether it is for healthcare and uh from the Indian context I really feel that uh we have a very big advantage overcoming the legacy systems like the China is having for example in the Indian

context. I feel that the manufacturing legacy systems need not have to be totally retuned for the AI purpose because we are actually coming up with the uh electronics and related

manufacturing sectors newly and we will be able to quickly embrace and adopt more of more of the AI technologies into our system actually. So that's one aspect which I look at and the third

thing I feel is something like digital literacy may have to be slowly converted into a literacy and that's where you know exactly like she was mentioning about fluency and maybe ethical aspects

of AI has to be brought in and I also feel that people have to now also look at the supervisory approach of how to see things from a supervisory perspective and then break down those

task into feeding these agines actually. So that also will become a kind of digital AI literacy which has to be trained for the people across. The second aspect which I want to highlight

is more about the India specific context. Over here there are three parameters which has to be looked at. One is about the infrastructure. The infrastructure in terms of AI it

requires mostly the cloud systems which has to be connected across and there are a lot of problem statements which actually goes into a kind of uh cloud which actually is located far away. But

in India there are many schools for example there are about 52,500 colleges and about,100 universities which are the and about 6 and a half lakh villages which are spread across connectivity is

a serious problem. So I really feel that the skilling also has to be also looked at from the perspective where in building some of these AI as a box systems which actually can help colleges

to actually work out the AI models with the local perspective as such uh from the digital reach language is a key aspect vernacular AI is something which we'll have to more explore and then

figure out more uh how to post problems in local languages and also how to get results in local languages. That's something which has to be worked out and uh mobile technology is something India

has really embraced. If you have noticed recently about 97%age uh of the youth is actually is on mobile. So we we need to have also solutions which is actually mobile

friendly in that particular context. &gt;&gt; Thanks Pra. I think the T-shaped model is a good model for individuals to think about where you still maintain your specialtity and then get exposed to all

these other areas. Tulika, I'm going to little bit focus on you uh to understand what is the role of cyber security frameworks on all this because the complexity of cyber security

is increasing day by day. If open AI brought some challenges, open clause made that 100x more complex. So it'll be great to hear what what what kind of frameworks you're thinking in

this new age. &gt;&gt; Thank you for the question and uh if you permit me I'd like to just add a few point to uh tweets readiness. Yeah. What's what's important? It's not just

workforce readiness that we are looking at and what the response that I just heard from my colleague from Cedak the readiness and how we're looking at uh technology per se. The one point that I

somewhere would like to re uh submitters. Um and I I take it from uh well Sanji G that humans will remain the masters because of the um ability to uh you know on the fly be able to respond

to any scenar scenario situation that may come. And uh the technologies are our extensions right. Our hands got extended with different and our legs got extended uh wheels and we went on and

now we have uh a replica of I mean we are saying whatever we are thinking and taking a decision on. So the brains have been sort of replicated with artificial intelligence right. So the evolution of

intelligence has reached till our brains right but we still have to reach to the heart the empathy part and so be it your question on workforce or be it a question on the cyber security aspect

that you're bringing we still are uh very importantly looking at the one thing that was mentioned keep the human in the picture right at the center of any discussion of adopting any new

technology uh accepting any or leaving any. So the point is when we are looking at humans and when we look at the issue of uh cyber security what I have realized is I

need to focus on how the humans the human behavior is evolving. It has it is very important for me to be able to map your brains to say hey you were white you were thinking something beautiful

positive you turning gray and now you turn black so when I look at technology today and when I look at the problems that we humans face across the globe it is just about understanding how we uh

with the technology are evolving and we analyze the distancing between people the distinction seen amongst communities is uh is romanticized in a way that hey go and buy a good phone or go and buy a

better AI model better tool and we can go on bringing these different models to say this problem of yours will be solved if you buy and so and so so we are still marketing machines

hardares and softwares uh over the human you know core human nature of being at rest being peaceful being happy uh engaging doing nothing very important

and very difficult and still smiling because I'm able to converse with nature I'm able to live with nature I'm sorry I digressed a little but I felt it is a key point for us to remember in the end

we'll only be happy uh when we will remain human when we will only be uh happy with another human who will be able to empath you know resonate with what we're thinking what we are planning

and all of that right coming back to the point of security now this is a double-edged sword right any tool any technology is always that and if you if I look at the iceberg model then we're

only looking at the top the applications the different tools that we're using but the actual artificial intelligence is actually below down below we will have to look at the uh source resources from

where these of course today we are accepting LLMs but in the very near future this will be microlms and smaller uh models that we'll be using so the point is who is focusing on that we need

to focus on the resources that the LL that the AI will work upon we need to look at those models of u analysis that we are currently borrowing so machine learning models are what we are looking

at and there are exactly three of them and not more than that. So even if we get very dynamic I still doubt on every solution that the AI gives is 100%. None of us will ever be able to say none of

us caos sitting here or others will claim I guarantee 100% security because I've applied the following principles brought in the following processes and these are the tools that have given me

the data based on which I've done this. So the point is it comes back to that human who's sitting there. It's his intuition. It's his judgment that we will again end up relying on. Therefore

when we talk about skilling when we talk about uh the uh you know we it's a beautiful uh picture of a mindset a skill set and then of course the tool set right so the tool set is at the end

luckily you know that is the beautiful model you've given because that comes only in the end how you use it is again your intelligence and instead of just looking at metadata instead of just

looking at the data sets that we are collecting and we have these large data centers can We look at the intelligence because we only need that intelligence to be able to perform an action at a

particular time for a very short period. Can we look at how to build those tools which will allow us to then understand how humans respond and we have reach up to the reached up to our neural

networks. we are able to completely replicate our neural uh you know neural network but can we now look at that one extra component that is needed to be able to give me the tool which says I'm

able to read your mind to say hey you're turning from gray to black now there are several tools that I saw when I went abroad uh which is able to tap it is not you when looking at the typic speed it

is able to judge you uh it is not you because of the Irish study that it does. So we have these smaller such efforts to help humans. Unfortunately, you know what hurt me was many humans have lost

their jobs because these tools were ruled used against them. They were used to pull them out from their jobs because they were able to check that they had failed in complying to some of these

required principles. Right? So the point is the tools the technologies are here to help us not to harm us &gt;&gt; and and that is where uh you know when I look at cyber security I have many more

points but let me let me simply let me simply say let me simply say um it's a like I said double sword I mean we are using the same tools to safeguard for the defense uh and the same is again

being used by those who are using AI &gt;&gt; to bring those homorphic models of you know they are able to evade detection. So where are we going with the machine human uh

&gt;&gt; interaction &gt;&gt; interaction or shall I call it the romance? We need to I really telling you why the romance because we're happy with the toys that are there with us. We need

to go deeper to understand how it will impact a human race itself. Somewhere that question is there. &gt;&gt; Thanks. Thanks. Uh you started somewhere but uh great great perspective.

Are you listening to all this or are you worried or are you motivated because you now have &gt;&gt; worried uh not for myself.

&gt;&gt; Got it. &gt;&gt; Because I'm from the government. &gt;&gt; So I have &gt;&gt; you now have a huge [laughter] &gt;&gt; but I'm worried for all the people I am

responsible for. &gt;&gt; So how do you think governments can approach this? &gt;&gt; Yes. Um that was on a lighter note but yes that's uh I was just thinking that

you know how many people we are Uh Sanjep G was asking what do you do while you know I said governments are inf famousamous for not doing much we status coist but can we uh I have my

diary entry and I'll maybe just make it a bit personal because after yesterday's entire session I thought something and then I just pinned it down and uh I'll share that with you. uh but uh and I

don't know if I got the topic wrong because I thought that we are discussing on um we are only worried about ourselves [laughter] each one of us is worried about

ourselves. So Sanjiv G is worried about Vipro, you are worried about your workforce, you are worried about your workforce. I thought that we are going to talk about the future workforce that

is the people who are still not in the jobs and how do we prepare that generation. Fortunately, there was something which you came up with a disruptive pattern and I immediately

thought of my child uh who's um eight and a half right now and how their school is trying to teach in a very different way of u creative uh thinking like uh um like there is a app which is

helping them make books right and that's an AI based app so they're not telling don't use AI don't use chat GP it's called bri books so there uh the children are encouraged to create their

own comics and they are able to choose their own characters, put their own. So, you know, end of the day an 8-year-old has a book in his hand, you know. So how are you using how we are inculcating the

higher order thinking skills and luckily for them they are starting young but for us who are older and we thought that's such a you know uh so much of a headache because we have to still

continuously upskill ourselves but the younger generation can actually take care of themselves and that me being in the government makes me worried about all the students all the workforce

Because the primary concern of the government is being able to provide jobs to a lot of people. How do we make our youth curious? So we have to look at all the aspects. We have to look at the

human aspect of it, the resilience aspect of it, the technology aspect of it, the partnership with academia, the industry partnership, all the aspect of it as a government. And every time I

think what is it, what is that one uh brick that I'm missing in this building, you know, because that should not be missed. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean this was this is Monday

right and I'll just read this because I promise uh status uh AI impact summit uh that's a I'll just read it out must be grateful because few months back even as late as

the regional conference on January 12th and 13th I did not imagine attending this conference at all and now I'm here speaking in panels and also being appreciated for my candle and honesty

after all what I represent the state of UP Uttar Pradesh where I'm from is much bigger than my limited canvas and I must rise up to the challenge and do my best to take my state forward in this

endeavor. Status quoist harm by being a mammoth choosing to stay put when the world demands agility. One cannot be left behind in the race even if it is a rat race.

we may say, but this one ain't even a rat race. As a race for survival, a quest for superiority and economic growth, and also a chance to leaprog and be a change maker for millions who are

dependent on your initiative. So I think if today each one of us realizes how fortunate we are to be sitting in this uh beautiful bharat mandapam and you know being a part of this panel

discussing how the future should be. We should we must do our part. We must not leave it to somebody else to do it. We must look as our chief minister I said if you know AI if you know any

technology teach five other people do not wait for any big thing to happen start small you are not able to guess the five courses climb the mountain ahead do that one course don't know

where to go after prompt engineering at least start with prompt engineering start small grow big and that is what I would want each one of us to do and also the government that's why we in Uttar

Pradesh we started with a skills first approach we started training our employees at multiple levels. The three layer approach uh the tools approach for our

secretarial staff a use case a more uh uh knowledge based approach for for a middle level uh you know people like me and then for the topmost leadership we had a knowledge like a use case based

based approach. So I think that is where we need to uh say and we have to start where I mean I think I tried to summarize it for everybody. Thank you. sitting next to you. I do see a lengthy

write up but thank you for summarizing that within uh thanks for joining us. Uh hope the flight delay was okay. Uh so the constructs that we have been discussing are the role of human how do

we think about skilling upskilling and also the role of government in preparing the supply to meet the demand. So I wish we had more time where I could summarize this the missed part for you but any

quick perspective? Uh unfortunately I'm told that there's only a couple of minutes left. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Um you know of course I've written like

a big book on this human edge in the AI age. Um so I have a lot of perspectives on this. See I I just the flavor of the conversation I got. See my my view is that uh look you know we need a wakeup

call. We need a heavy wakeup call. Uh we have to be very very very prepared that jobs are going to go at mass scale. Okay. So no amount of emotional angst

is going to prevent that. It is inevitable. Okay. But it's not all lost because in a while uh and my analysis is that over the next 15 years 35 50% of all jobs will go and it will be much

higher weighted towards the services sector which is more than 50% of of our economy. So we have a much bigger risk. Now at the same time there is a huge opportunity which is that every industry

will get disrupted which will create tremendous amount of entrepreneurial opportunities and that is the opportunity and the large enterprises that many of

us represent will get disrupted but equally it will present opportunities for hundreds of thousands and millions of entrepreneurs and that is what we have to prepare the future as you very

rightly said it's about future skills we have to prepare them for Now there are a couple of points. Now the thing about tools I think it's such a overplayed overhyped conversation.

It's such a overplayed overhyped conversation. It's maybe not even 5% of the opportunity or issue. Which youngster needs to be trained on AI tools?

Who they are AI natives? It's like 50 year olds who maybe need to be trained and even then just getting train AI getting trained on using AI tools is like a week-long training and we are

just hyping it up too much. It's like a it's nothing. It should be just a basic thing. Now there are two very important factors. The first is in the short term which is the next two to four years five

years. The biggest thing which we need to train on is context because actually domain the technical skills are the ones which AI is going to eat up most rapidly. So technical skills

that we train the the the computer science education is actually going to become the least relevant education and it is about the domain knowledge. The second is that look any this thing about

human will always become relevant is a highly overstated it's a nice moral science statement. It's not a reality. &gt;&gt; Got it. Got it. &gt;&gt; It's not a reality. Eventually it has to

be human not in the loop. Human of the loop. It has to be about constant creativity. And then that's I stop there. &gt;&gt; Thanks Nathan. Uh we do have to wrap it

up here. Uh we we got some great constructs. Thanks for this opportunity. Thank you so much. [applause]
