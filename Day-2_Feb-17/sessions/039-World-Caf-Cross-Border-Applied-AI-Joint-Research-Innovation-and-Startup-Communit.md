## 📝 Transcript

including myself, startups, industry, government, civil society and also foundations. Um, each of them are very essential to making this collaboration across borders

work. So, let's use this space to listen, connect and co-create practical pathways forwards. There's a bit of a lag. I don't know

what the point is. All right. So the goal today is so we want to uh we want to have inputs from everyone. It's a collective intelligence um sort of exercise to

agree on how we will work together. Uh what kind of ecosystems and enablers we can uh think of that can allow us let's say I'm from Norway and India. How can we work together? how can what are the

means that can be made possible so that we can actually focus our efforts and agree on dos and don'ts and what is sovereign friendly and sovereign safe. So this this is the goal and those who

contribute will also be invited to sort of be acknowledged as part of a or co-author a four-page policy brief that will be the outcome of this session. So the agenda for the today so like I

said the world cafe the purpose is to gather collective intelligence. Um so it's very important that we make opportunity for everyone to speak and give their opinions. So it's not just me

talking and you listening. So it's a very sort of a flat uh uh setup here. So every table. So we have different tables here. So since we don't have tables, we we will have conversations in each row.

Um so 1 2 3 and so on. Mutz will give out numbers for the each of the tables later on. So you will start by introducing yourselves. So you become aware of your

expertise on the table and then you'll appoint the table host. So one of you will actually mediate the conversation and guide the conversation ensuring that everyone's included. Due to time

constraints, there will be no formal rotation in the room. So, usually there's rotation, but we won't have that. So, capture your insights in a shared QR document uh sorry, document

results from it later on. So, the agenda for today is as follows. So, we move from purpose to practice to action. We begin with um a four-minute lightning pitch by Alexandra Beckorf who

will frame why crossber applied AI matters. Now uh this will set up the first discussion on interest, trust and shared opportunities. Anil Sharma from TCS will

then share works in real world collaboration leading to a second round of collaboration uh uh second round on collaboration models. from Nokia will explore how to remain

technologically open while safeguarding sovereignty informing a third round. And finally Anand Kamanvar will give his vision of AI silk roads linking government startups and applied ventures

and finally I'll outline the next steps for what will happen after this so that we can continue with the momentum. So with this I would like to invite Alexandra to give her first lightning

pitch. Alexandra would you &gt;&gt; uh you can do it even that but it's up to you. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I think so. &gt;&gt; Good morning everyone. Um my name is

Alexandra Beyb. I'm uh talking to you uh from the vantage point of one of the largest research and technology institutes in Europe, Cintf. We also have high impact collaboration here in

India as well as in low and medium income countries in the world. And we pursue a dedicated strategy to broker international networks for collaborative solutionsoriented research for

innovation including in the dynamic space of AI. We also set up a number of deep tech startups in this space. &gt;&gt; There we go. &gt;&gt; Now, most conversations about AI focus

on how smart the models are. Uh but the bigger shifts happening right now is something else. AI is becoming a coordination layer for society. It's starting to help complex systems adjust

to each other. Not just optimizing one things, but balance many things at once. We're seeing this in energy where AI helps managing electricity flows between regions with very different energy

sources, renewables in one place, fossil, hydro another. And that's not just prediction, it's real time coordination. And this idea goes beyond energy,

industry, logistics, climate response, all depends on systems that must constantly adapt to each other. So the real impact of AI isn't only that machines can think, it's that we're

automating how systems interact. And once coordination becomes automated, the question is no longer just about performance. It becomes about who can participate, who can shape it, and how

safely these systems work together. If AI is becoming the coordination layer, then a key question is who gets to shape the coordination? It only works when all participants have

the capacity to make their own independent choices and shape their own life and future. We call it agency, not just access. It means local teams can adapt systems

to their own realities, question AI outputs instead of blindly trusting them and adjust how AI behaves in that context. And without this, countries don't take part in the coordination.

They are simply coordinated by systems designed elsewhere. We can see what agency looks like at a national scale in India. India is investing in it in its own AI compute

and developing models grounded in its own languages, data and societal needs. That's not just technological progress. It's the ability to shape how AI works in areas like public service,

agriculture, and industry. So capacity building is not a side topic. It determines who helps design the systems that increasingly connect our economies and societies.

AI systems are not involved in one shared environment. They're being trained on different data under different rules and based on different assumptions about how the world works.

That's normal. Countries have different infrastructures, regulations, and priorities. But when these systems start interacting, those differences don't disappear. They collide. And that's

where risk comes in. A mis mismatch between AI environments can turn into systemic instability. Not just because one system is wrong, but because they were never designed to work together.

Take energy systems. An AI model trained to optimize a highly stable grid with certain market rules may behave very differently when connected to a grid with different constraints, supply

patterns, or regulatory structures. So the risk we face isn't just bad AI. It's misaligned AI systems or ecosystems interacting in tightly connected systems. And as AI becomes more involved

in coordinating critical infrastructure, these mismatches scale from technical issues to society societal risks. So if misalignment create risks, this the answer is the answer to centralize

everything. No, global coordination does not require one authority controlling all AI systems. That would just ignore ignore local realities and reduce agency. What we really need are shared

mechanisms. Shared testing environments allow systems to be exposed to conditions beyond their original context. And here I think about digital sandboxes but also physical laboratories

that we run among others. Interoperability standards help systems understand each other technically. Crossber validation means models are checked outside their home environment

and mutual safety principles create trust in how systems behave. Systems remain local shaped by national priorities etc. But they learn how to work together. And a good example is

countries using joint simulation environment to test AI systems together. How they interact under stress without giving up control. It's about alignment. Let's so let's

diverse systems cooperate safely. So just a little bit about what we do in Cintf AI impact depends on coordination and many of our projects address this at complimentary levels. Read builds

coordination into operations clear creating learning feedback loops. Enfield ensures that coordination is safe and sustainable developing trustworthy and energy efficient AI that

can operate reliably across domains. data packed uh tech tackles the governance layer compliance and data spaces that allow organizations to share and use data responsibly without losing

control. Adito scales the planetary level building shared digital infrastructure so countries and institutions can coordinate decisions using common models and data. And

through the EU project open Mod for Africa we extend this model globally supporting open global collaborative model in that enable eight African countries to coordinate energy and

development decisions using shared tools and data together. This is what real AI impact requires. systems that learn together, act safely and share responsibly. Thanks for listening and

hopefully we find partners for new projects. If India was to join the European framework program for research, that would be a fantastic uh enabler. Had I had more time, I could speak about

similar topics on digital twins of the ocean and the intersection of uh environmental protection or supply chains for critical rear earth materials, but there has to be some

limits. Thank you for listening. All right. So, it's now now time for the room to take action. So, this brings us to the first round of the World Cafe. So, you'll have about 10

minutes. So, I'll moderate that um depending on how much time we have left. So uh so our guiding question for the first round is how do we manage different interests across research

startups government and large firms while still collaborating effectively across borders. So at your tables focus on trust across jurisdictions data intellectual property accountability and

how we can include startups and small and middle uh u small and mediumsiz enterprises. So you can start by introducing yourselves, appoint a table host,

someone who is who can mediate the conversation and let the conversation flow. There's no formal rotation like I said. Most importantly, everyone can and

should contribute share concrete experiences and nuance insights in the shared document. So let's begin. So you can &gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay. So you can

Yeah. we have 18,000 people in India 18 of the biggest research and development hubs what we have we have factories here I mean we have more or less all the

functions actually we have all the functions of the corporation here present So we are here and we will be happy and we are market leader for it is very strong.

My colleague Sadar is very keen on this international support collaboration. Are you involved in quite talking about what really is

the understanding is quite unnatural. There are as many definitions of ecosystem as there are people that you are asking. uh so we are trying to harmonize that

and then now I'm also running this AIA factory initiative called for the north of Europe so we have Latia Estonia Finland and Denmark well together private sector and

public sector and we are going to biggest EU Why not Sweden? I know

but that's great. We'll have another opportunity for this. So I'd like to welcome Anil Sharma. He's the global head of TCScoin co-inovation network to deliver the next presentation. Anil

brings lessons from global AI collaboration. What works what doesn't and how part partnerships can scale across borders. So Anil, the stage is yours.

&gt;&gt; Okay. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you Sager and uh good thanks for having me here. Uh I just want to give you a set uh can you hear me well? &gt;&gt; Okay. So I just want to give you a uh

philosophical question. See what is the purpose of AI right? What should AI do for us? I think see and in TCS we have this thinking right when you look at knowledge work. So what is knowledge

work? The work done by doctors, engineers, marketers is all knowledge work. And what should AI do? Right? So if you think about uh somebody like a good marketer, what

is an like an average marketer and the elite marketer? An average software engineer, elite engineer. See, there is a many order of gap between these uh capabilities. See, one uh paradigm shift

we want to address is can AI really bridge the gap between elite skills uh average skills and the elite skills. That's one paradigm. uh there's one thing to about think

about how AI can impact uh the work whatever work we do the work we do today as knowledge work would change in one year time three year time uh but uh this paradigm should not change I think

that's something which we believe in strongly second is if if you look at India as a country we have a lot of communities right and there is an access barrier uh for everybody to even

participate in services like if you look at rural population they cannot access services. uh and if you even look at other areas where we think we are very capable but our understanding for

example when you uh when you visit museums right most of us just pass through the paintings which you have artifacts right so this is one project which we did with monk museum in uh

Norway Oslo and the idea here was uh not to build AI which say for example we learn how monk paints painting not to train a model to essentially learn how the monk would paint and then allow

other people to create uh painting in his style. But that's not uh a paradigm which would be accepted in a culture in Norway's culture. I think this when we're building AI collaboratively with

other countries and other cultures, we have to be very sensitive about what is possible and what is acceptable. I think the paradigm here is uh the idea which we build here was very simple. See most

of us like to draw right now. If the question is if I draw can I ask monk to show me what paintings he has drawn and that idea really worked here and I think the um so idea needs to be simple and

this removes access barrier for most of the people who go and discover art. Now if you look at most cultural institutions in the world most of their artifacts are in the vault. monk only

has 3% of their artwork uh uh in the galleries 90% of it in the world and this system which we created allows people to experience most of his collection today

right so and I think uh when you're building AI for culture it is not that you can just build and scale so we went through several lab pilots in Norway with real users so there was a lab one

we learned from it lab two we learned from and then it'll be scaled out in a full exhibition in this June. So anybody who is visiting Norway, you should be able

to see this uh exhibition in from June to December of this year. So this is one example. Uh this is another example in India. Uh how many you know what is Kuma?

&gt;&gt; Right? Most of you. So in the Kuma 2015 is where we got involved with the community there. So we actually created a momentum in the city of Nanasi and then we deployed 15 interventions and

that was probably the most digitally enabled kumla in the country and what we done is here we want uh this kila to be the most AI enabled and accessible kumbla. So what we doing is again here

it is about not technology. The technology which we are using is from MIT Nanda. This is a very promising initiative in the world which is rethinking about uh when you will have

billions of agents on internet what does the internet of agents look like right then you have to solve lot of issues about trust incentive uh how do you transfer money securely uh

and things like those. So this is a very good architecture which is being now developed by lot of players in the world and we are also particip participating in this architecture. So anybody who is

interested professor Amit Rascar is doing many sessions in uh India summit. Uh the idea here is simple like lot of people who visit Kumla uh they are not very literate they speak

many languages. So idea is can we build a personal agent for every pilgrim who comes to Kumbua. So this is essentially augumenting how people can participate in what you call an experience economy

or can in can access can access u services like transport, home stays, health and things like those. Uh I think there are design principles here for India which is we even if you do we have

to be privacy first right. We we need to take consent. We need to build it securely and we have to build it around trusted systems in the country. So the India DPI

uh diger and all those are very trusted systems. So we have going to build this over those systems. So we have now built demos again here because this is going to go live with 50 million people. It is

not easy to get it correct. So again going through lab pilots. We're going to do a lab pilot with 10,000 uh students. And this year and next year we will use lot of experimentation to get it right.

This is an example of uh uh what we're doing. I think this is question you had asked what does it take to do cross cross uh country collaboration. MIT is a technology build in US we bringing it to

India and making it relevant. Uh Mango was an example of we as a creative technologist and a culture institution working together to create which works in country like Norway. But the idea

there is you always need to have uh regional partner a local partner who understand the cultural context and also the understand the user very very well. There is has to be uh great incentive to

work together. There has to be trust built out and it takes time. Uh again human centricity right even if it is AI we have to make it really humanentric otherwise this does not work with

people. I think that's the message I wanted to give you. Thank you all. [applause] &gt;&gt; Thank you very much, Anil. Um, next on the agenda was actually another round of

world cafe, but uh we're going to uh keep that for later because of the lack of time. So, I would directly like to invite our next speaker um who is Pari and Pari is the senior

vice president at uh Nokia on strategic government and industry. It brings clear perspective. Sovereignty is not an isolation but control over critical layers and openness is not just a value

but an economic strategy. So with that I'd like to give the word to Paci. We'll uh talk from his point of view. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much. &gt;&gt; Hello everybody.

Yeah, as it says, my name is Bosi and before going to the actual topic, I want to say I love India. It this this came up uh yesterday's dinner discussion. I have been coming to

India almost every year, sometimes multiple times per year since 1999. I know some of you were not even born at that time. It was very different. It was very different place at that time and it

has been fascinating to see how the country has evolved, how the infrastructure has evolved, how everything around uh the different industries and others have been changing

and we were thinking earlier that I mean is this concept going to work here? I mean because we are not having those tables and of course it does work because this is India everything is

possible. country and and the wonderful people inside it. They just find a way to make it work. But now more about the the topic itself.

Uh for me this all comes down to ecosystem thinking. How many of you think that you have a

good definition or definition that you feel familiar what is ecosystem? raise your hand. I'm sure that you have all been thinking but you you something that you feel that

yes this is my definition &gt;&gt; good I think that is good and also a little bit the challenge public sector the different government agencies are having they definition of

ecosystem private sector players different industries different companies different uh associations. They having their definition of ecosystem

and as we are ending up talking on a headline level that leads to confusion and then complementing that confusion with all everything what is happening in the geopolitics at the pressure for

sovereignity we have a perfect soup uh in our hands defin my definition and I'm not saying that it would be the right one but my definition of ecosystem

is it's a trustbased get together of everybody who is interested in about the topic. You don't set borders. You don't set limitations who is able to

play who is allowed to contribute. the value is distributed transparently and fairly within that ecosystem and that has been sometimes a little bit

even painful in in certain conversations because the world where we are coming most of us is somehow dictating or directive that I mean I'm the biggest company I have the most money and

ecosystem should not be led by that thinking it should be I am a good member of ecosystem I have good idea that everybody are able to benefit philosophically it's almost the opposite

ends of collaboration it's it's not me me it's us let's do this together and and it is giving us who are who are having that trust to join in this ecosystem is giving us wonderful

opportunity to innovate to inspire each others and boost the success beyond the individual companies, individual agencies who are participating.

I am worried in this AI era that especially the startups academia are left behind easily and I was listening very carefully our friends uh

talking earlier and even the previous panel it's it's difficult to find that highest quality compute power if you are early stage of your company in ecosystem you can allocate that good in in a

different way based on the perceived value for the whole thing. I see tremendous opportunity for all of us to work as an ecosystem. Oh, now it did go too far. This is now

getting really I mean real time latency is off. Uh this is just an illustration about ecosystem when it when you turn it as a technology when you turn it as as a stack

and and now specifically for this AI market the world has seen the representation of the most powerful companies we have seen valuations in the wall street that we have not seen before

it's of course also changing the expectation how it is going to work and I think and I'm not here to disqualify any company or actually opposite I mean I'm admiring if some has been that

successful but it's not necessarily always the easiest when we are talking about the sovereignity and the ecosystem modularity is the key to be successful as an ecosystem open interfaces you need

you it needs to be as I mentioned open predictable and fair, open, predictable and fair that everybody with in the ecosystem can connect there and that's the best way

also to protect your sovereignity. It is it's it's clear many countries also players in the private sector they have learned that I mean I want to keep some part of my data in my own hands.

This is the answer here. you can define the systems following that principle and satisfying that need as well and I don't want to go for company marketing not at all but this is how we

are doing it uh in Nokia we promote open interfaces open interfaces in traditional telco world and now in AI era I'm regular member there in European Commission talking

about how to do it in practice. Ecosystems again, how we are forming ecosystems around the most compelling topics and making sure that they are really

following the trust foundation and being fair for every direction. Internal openness, it's very important as well. I mean how the culture inside

the organization is supporting the openness, how it's supporting the innovation. We are we are very used like the private companies are used to I mean said I mean

I'm the most powerful one I'm the most powerful also the hierarchy within the organization has been quite strongly dictated. I have been protesting against the

hierarchy in the organization for for 10 plus years. Sometimes successfully, sometimes not that successfully. But I mean it's fascinating when when you know that you are in quite high in the

organization and you are having that environment where the individual engineers or whoever within that group is daring to come to you and share the thoughts and and really I mean seek for

that soundboarding. It's it's very rewarding. And then of course the communities and the standardization how we are able to make the standards which are connecting uh the different

members of the ecosystem together. That's it. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thanks so much Pasi. I think we'll move on to the last speaker to of today which

is Anand Kamanva. So, so Anand is at the intersection of government startups and deep tech supply chains.

helping turn research excellence into real world deployment through collaboration. Uh and he will be talking about his concept of AI Silk Roads and very fittingly Anand as you all mean

know means joy. A reminder that our shared goal is progress and that benefits everyone. So please join me in welcoming him for the closing remarks. Good morning. It's great to be back in

India as always. Uh let me start by giving a quick uh 30 seconds of context of what applied materials and applied ventures is uh uh very quickly. So applied ventures

and applied materials sits at the uh intersection of the semiconductor industry and physical AI. We make the equipment that makes the chips including the Nvidia chips, the AMD chips, the

Intel chips, the HPM memory chips and uh and so on. And we also make some of the biggest uh TVs or the equipment power some of the biggest TVs in the in the world. So every time at Diwali you go

from a 50 in to a 60in 65 in uh we are the technology that powers it. Um as well um quickly I head applied ventures. We are the corporate venture arm of applied. We have been investing in this

deep tech sector before it was sexy. Uh we have deployed over half a billion and we're looking to including in 19 countries including uh Norway, Finland uh and India uh among other things. Uh

I know we are short of time so let me be direct right there's a whole discussion around like uh what is a national AI strategy and there's no such thing as a national AI strategy. I think it is all

about global AI and how you position uh uh within it. Right? So a lot of the people talk about oh the like the algorithms are coming from somewhere else but keep in mind the data is all

local right the data is somewhere so you need and obviously the compute is expensive so you have to work together as uh collectively to make this um happen right so most people think that

the bottleneck in AI is the models or uh the GPU compute and uh data centers and power uh I think you're going to hear a lot about it during this conference I don't think that is the biggest issue I

think the bottleneck is trust right I think trust has to move across borders right if that doesn't happen none of this AI uh stuff is going to happen there's also one other reality we should

probably also be very much focused about right one is um if you see this whole AI and the semiconductor industry right it has it was the semiconductor industry was pretty benign or flat uh and maybe

under the radar for the last like few decades people talked about Mo's law and here and there But last few years the stock market is watching the right the the uh the the whole semiconductor stack

has changed right we were internally modeling semiconductor industry to hit 1 trillion in 2030 the good news is it's going to hit this year okay [laughter] 1 trillion of annual spend in that uh in

the semiconductor industry it's going to happen this year okay so and it's and we expecting by 2030 we'll be off we'll be out to around one and a half trillion and I can bet you we'll be wrong uh we

we're underindexing it by a wide uh margin but underneath all of this AI and data centers right what you what we are worried about and at least I'm coming uh looking from the Silicon Valley side of

the world is there is significant and we're not even seeing the we're not even feeling the effects of it here but I can trust you in couple of years you'll see the effect the entry-level jobs are

going away by huge margin right I have a kid in college and I don't even know what to advise him because advice changes every uh every three months Right? And it's not about just coding,

right? It's about marketing, legal, finance, customer support, design, operations, everything is changing. The last I coded was maybe around 20 years ago. But over the weekend, I was able to

use cloud to create a fully automated audio transcription. Right? And it did a better job than what my 20-year-old what I as a 20-year-old could have been uh doing it. Right? I'm telling you, this

ch has changed it so significantly that we don't even know what's going to hit us u uh uh badly. So the question for India is not will AI change work. I think the question is India be ready

before the disruption becomes visible at scale and that's why this whole crossber discussion is uh is important right u at applied ventures right we have been &gt;&gt; okay so at applied ventures we are not

talking about this only uh academically right we have been doing this joint venture funds with various regions right as I said we have invested in 19 countries so we have created this joint

funds with the government of Korea we have created a joint fund with uh with Taiwan uh with the organization called it that's where TSMC was born and media tech and UMC some of these companies

might be uh this one right so one of the things we did see there and we learned there was right is we are we did this not just for press release right I we are not operating ating that it was

purely the architecture right the Korea brought lot of systems tech and manufacturing discipline they are the leaders in HBM memory uh if you guys have right and Taiwan is a big player in

the whole logic uh side of the world but India does bring in talent software and the ability to make this uh work under real life conditions right so that's why we are excited about the collaboration

uh in India so a lot of this framing is east versus west I honestly call it right this whole discussion is how do to make this happen right the the data has to stay local right there are

going to be data centers built in India people are going to complain about oh we don't have power for this we don't have power for that why are they using data centers it's going to happen right I

think the question is how do we adapt it and I think the people in the room are probably are going to drive this right uh in more than anything else so for decades right uh u we have been talking

about it and I'll just give an example of how we did it did this with the Korea and the Taiwan fund and we are hoping to do the Same thing with the European fund and as well as the India fund. Right? So

one of the things that we really did was we did not push for these companies. We invested in these companies. We did not push these country companies to move to US or Europe to grow. Right? We grew

these companies in Korea and Taiwan. Right? So for example in the Korea fund, we invested in six companies. Four went IPO, grew the R&amp;D, grew the IPA right in uh in Korea itself and the fifth one is

filing for uh IPO this year. Right? Very successful. But both strategically for Korea it has done well and we hope to create the same set of model here in India we invested in a company called

BBDN uh which is driving significant amount of business in electronics manufacturing. they have a big booth here at the uh at the uh event as well. Right. So in to end right I think

there's a lot of discussion around uh uh roti kapa and macakan I think we should definitely add a to it right um it's going to help transform and I and and I don't think India uh is going to

be left behind we are pretty bullish on what this is going to happen uh in every shape or form so in the end I would like to say like you know this whole crossber collaboration is not a nice PR or press

or a nice uh just event like this it is going to happen. I think uh we just have to be adopted and move faster than anybody else. Anybody who is thinking that oh I want don't want I don't want

to use algorithms from here I don't want to use data from here etc. I think we're going to be left uh uh uh uh behind. Anyways thank you so much and I look forward uh to this crosswater

collaboration. [applause] All right, I'll just talk about this. So, thank you so much to all the speakers for a wonderful presentation and thanks all to the contributors. We

didn't manage to do all the rounds that I had imagined, but um we would still like to write a policy brief. So, if you are interested in participating and contributing, put your contact

information in the shared document and we can have a meeting online or something later on. Let's get this conversation going. This was meant to create momentum. So if there are any

questions for the speakers, now is the time. We have about a minute. Yes. One first one there and then one here. Can you introduce yourself?

&gt;&gt; We do a lot of delegation. I come from behavioral science background. I'm part of a lot of innovation ecosystems. One of the primary challenges we see is everybody actually wants their products

to be researchbased which means collaboration. everybody wants but we have really hard walls and those walls have people bureaucracy a lot of things and I think AI is a big hope leveler

because it can get virtual it can get democratic it can get smart where ideas and really people who worked on it matter it'll not be about the AI efficiency that the person can speak in

but the technical expertise they bring in so I think we're at the right time but we still need structures where we could maneuver through all this like as simple as I just took a delegation to

Africa And the thought process absolutely changed when people realize Africa is just no more Africa. There's so much of Indian and people have got a similar background. So I think a lot of

more cultural cross collaboration what Pari was talking about has to be a little base to this because just technology just innovation alone may not be able to bring in the trust.

&gt;&gt; Do you have a question for the speakers? &gt;&gt; Yes. My question is at this point do we right now see something brewing in that direction because if you see this whole AI even the summit right everybody's

talking about the AI layer alone like there's a lot more below at a socioeconomic collaboration layer can we have more democratic ecosystem for startups to be part of where it's not

just ideas but actual collaborations opened up &gt;&gt; anyone would like to take that question &gt;&gt; I can take it uh for For me it's not conditional, it's an imperative. We have

to take that better into account and and take the responsibility that it works accordingly. &gt;&gt; One more question please. &gt;&gt; Uh maybe there may be some kind of a

&gt;&gt; Can you introduce yourself? &gt;&gt; Yeah, I am Subar Raju. I am a founder, mentor, good sava. Good sava means good service. It is a combination of goods service as well as good service. It is a

supply chain optimization company. Actually there are a lot of conflicting uh paradigms are operating at the global level. Like one paradigm is not invented here. The other paradigm is uh

duplication of effort. Human we will all have same technological availability. One can do the other can also do. So that in is an also issue. We'll have a commoditization of technological

availability and accessibility and uh we all invent the same things here in Sweden or India or somewhere China is a some kind of a duplication of effort. Can can you take the question please

because &gt;&gt; yeah yeah here how this collective intelligence is possible and uh is it not a confl or things some in your at your country level at your company level

there is conflict of interest and how is this collective intelligence &gt;&gt; we can we can have one word from all the speakers so we can start with Alexandra &gt;&gt; or maybe you want to

&gt;&gt; well I I I think it's impossible able to coordinate all activities and I think duplication of effort is also part of competition and one my biggest worry in the AI space is the monopolization that

there will only be five five uh companies extracting all the data from all other countries. So so competition is good. Uh I also think um trusted trusted third parties like a foundation

like my own can bring together ecosystems and uh then hopefully also make space for startups. So that's my &gt;&gt; thank you Anand. &gt;&gt; I I think we just have to be ready for a

world where the cost of intelligence is going to be zero. Okay. It won't be like you know I have to have the access to the best people and the best researchers. Right. The question is what

do you do when everybody has the same level of intelligence or access to the same level of intelligence that the world superpowers have right what you can do with that is is mindboggling

right so I I think less worry about who is who if you were to ask 3 years ago or 5 years ago Google was going to win everything you ask today open AI is going to win if you ask tomorrow

anthropic I don't we don't know right the world is changing but remember if the cost of intelligence is going to zero So what can we do with it and how do we make ourselves more productive? I

think that's &gt;&gt; we need to move on to the next speaker so that Anil could you have the the final word. &gt;&gt; Okay. So I think see my view is uh there

are always going to be geopolitics right. So for that reason people may want to build a duplicate effort but see when the market matures I'll just give you an example if you know what Toyota

and Suzuki did in India. See they have licensed a mid-market car here like if you know Artigga and Toyota Romeo is the same car &gt;&gt; right the idea there was that why see

why do you spend 3 years creating a mid-segment car which that is already proven so I think eventually at some point of time uh this we have speakers waiting outside if you can quickly

finish it that would be great &gt;&gt; we also have photographs for everybody &gt;&gt; it's all set &gt;&gt; thank you so much thanks so much put in your contacts and We'll stay in touch.
