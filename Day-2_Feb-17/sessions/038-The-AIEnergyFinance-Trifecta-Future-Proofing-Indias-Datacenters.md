## 📝 Transcript

Thank you so much. Uh a very good morning everyone. Okay. So today we're going to speak about the AI energy finance trifecta. So the future of AI will not be written

in code alone. It will be written in power plants, in power grids and in capital markets. Today's session will actually take you through the journey how they will actually work together to

shape the future. Next slide, please. Next slide. Sorry. Just give us a second. Okay, I'll manage without that. That's

okay. previous slide please. Perfect. So the fundamental truth is no AI without energy. AI is driving

unprecedented consumption loads. A conventional data center consumes around 10 to 25 megawatt. But an AI hypers scale data center consumption can actually power up to 100,000 households.

It also requires massive planning infrastructure updates out and the typical utility planning doesn't happen anymore. You have to think ahead how much of the electricity will be there

and I'll focus on how localized it is in the coming slides and you'll see the difference. Having said that, can also have a transformational impact on energy.

It there are studies which have been done which say that if you can unlock the efficiencies that AI can deliver for energy and in other sectors your uh emissions

can actually be neutralize what comes from data centers by 2035. This is the estimation done by IA. So what so what you can which I was showing from the previous slide is that the AI is

transformational for energy and it cannot be done without energy. So there's a very deep relationship between the two. Coming to the data center consumption,

what you'll see out here is the data center electricity consumption is set to double by 2030. Just to give an idea, this is around how much Japan's electricity consumption is today. So you

can think about how huge that impact is going to be till 2030. Then consumption is highly concentrated in three regions as of today. US, China and Europe.

Even though the infrastructure is concentrated but the growth is global. So that presents an amazing opportunity for all the emerging markets which represent a massive untapped potential

for future capacity. Countries with reliable affordable power will be best placed to unlock the data center growth. These data centers can also be anchors for new emissions

power projects going forward. Please go to the next slide. So how can AI be the solution? AI if you really look at this if you give

the right data and we'll discuss data in a bit but if the grid data is there the AI can actually help in balancing grids that that are becoming more complex decentralized and digit uh and

digitized. It can improve forecasting and integration of renewable energy which will reduce curtailments and emissions. It can also help in fall detection by

pinpointing the issue where it lies, the intensity of the issue and a study shows the impact can actually reduce the outage duration by 30 to 50% if AI is used for that and obviously it can help

us optimize our infrastructure. How much infrastructure has to be added? Is it being used efficiently? Are we making the best use of our resources? that all AI can deliver. Next slide.

Having said that, even though it offers a transformational impact on the power sector, it is not being utilized to its fullest right now and we have a long way to go. So what are these barriers which

come? The first data access access to data because companies may not necessarily share data. It may be because of competitive reasons. It may be because

of confidential reasons. Secondly, we all know the problem that we have with quality of data. You know it may not be complete. It there might be a you know you might even say accurate and the

coverage. So data uh also the quality is there but The extent of digitization also varies from country to country, region to region and sector to sector. So as you can see there are number of

problems and one of the main things which will be is a skills and training. So the person who's using AI in energy will have to be equipped to analyze data run models but also understand the

energy infrastructure. These are specialized skill sets which will be required more and more. And lastly the barriers. Uh there as we go forward we can see the

regulations opening up. We seeing it in a number of countries but wherever data is there for a security reason it or safety reason those regulations will always remain stringent. So we may not

be able to use it there. Next slide please. Now I was uh said in the first slide that I'll talk about where the location of these data centers right so we

discussed almost 85% demands comes from US China and Europe historically not only do they come in these countries but even in these countries these data centers are lumped together they are

very closely built so historically data centers are highly concentration in spatial terms posing significant challenge to local grids. There are six states in the US

where data centers actually consume 10% of the total supply with Virginia leaving at 25% of the state electricity. That all goes to data centers. So you can see the impact.

Electricity grids are also under major strain right now. Estimates show that unless these risk of electricity grids is addressed at least 20% of the data center which are under construction

right now will face a delay. Another problem which is there is the lead time gap. The transmission infrastructure takes around three times more time to get in place than the data

center. So if you build in a hurry you might have overstock but you're delayed you'll have stranded assets. So you know there is a very uh tight balance which has to be taken care of when you start

building infrastructure for data center alone. Next slide please. Okay so again these are all studies estimates show that if data centers increase the way they are they will

contribute around 3% of the power sector emissions by 2030. Now all technological companies and data center operators want to grow but in a sustainable fashion and there are number

of things that we are doing to make it happen in that way. The first what we have right here is about the PPA. If you say there are 68 gawatt of clean energy PPAs which were signed in 2024 out of

which 68 sorry 26% with data centers. So as you can already see that with the growth the growth is for clean energy. They are cognizant of

the fat and they're taking that into account. Next slide please. Uh okay. Another alternative that people uh that uh companies are considering is colllocating the data center with the

generation assets. So you can see a few examples where uh you know this has been tried out. There are number of strategic benefits for something like that. There are no interconnection delays, relief

from grid congestion, energy security, but it does add to the capital cost and operational complexity because the people who run data centers are actually not you know the power generators. So

there is another skill set there but this is something which has been tried out and it has enormous benefits. Okay. So we see that and you would have read it also in the papers when it comes

to peak hours there's stress in the system. Now this may not last for long. It would be only 3 to 5 hours but data centers need to take care of that and there are number of ways that they're

trying to address it. One is on-site batteries which give them the relevant flexibility given the short duration of stress assets. Cooling accounts for 10 to 30% of the data cent's load. This if

you pair it with thermal storage can be another answer where you shift to off peak times. Also workloads can be shifted what is known as virtualization. They they've

started scheduling on grid condition uh conditions prioritizing times and also collocating with lower congestion periods. So this is a playbook that they have for adding flexibility.

Okay. Now coming to the third aspect which is the financing. Global investment in data centers has nearly doubled between 2022 and 2024. Estimates put that cumulative investment

between 2025 and 2030 would be $4.2 trillion. So these are huge numbers which are coming up. And the interesting fact is, you know, if you actually look at the

S&amp;P 500 companies, of the $16 trillion increase in market cap since 2022, 12 trillion was from AI related companies. So there's a huge investment momentum uh

in AI happening. But u having said that when it comes to projects of data center and we were having discussion in the speaker lounge before this how it is still an emerging economy uh sector and

the financiers consider the risk and therefore the financing of data center will really be pushed if those risks are mitigated because it's still recent in a few countries next slide please

and that's my last slide so we spoke about AI energy finance and how have to be going together in the future and uh responsible scaling. So in a matter to sum this entire thing up, the

intersection of AI, energy and finance lies the defining challenge of this generation. How to power intelligence, finance its scale and do both of these

in a sustainable manner. Over to the session now. Thank you. Thank you so much money man for that fantastic overview. While u matey is ensuring that we are pushing the

boundaries of the India's digital sovereignty is ensuring to fund the infrastructure for a longer hole of power. So now ladies and gentlemen it's now time for

the next speaker and maybe please welcome with a huge round of applause Miss Sarasati Chandra Shakhar executive director REC limited. Can we have an applause ladies and gentlemen please?

[applause] Good morning ladies and gentlemen and the dignitaries and the das. Uh it's a privilege to talk about my company RC over here. First of all, what is it that

we are doing? Uh why we are here? First of all, thanks man for that uh excellent introduction regarding the world scenario. Now how it is happening in India first we'll understand about that

current status India stands at 1.7 gawatt and in the next up to 2030 the projection is somewhere around 8 gawatt and what are the key drivers we have AI and cloud 5G data localization and all

those things are happening how India is pushing the AI revolution infrastructure status has been given for the AI data centers. So in that case you the getting a finance it is going to be

easy for them. Next is there is a draft national policy data center policy which has been given. So that gives a 20-year tax holiday and permanent establishment status. There is an India AI mission

which aims to build the GPU clusters majates are not leaving behind. They are also proposing so many incentives for the AI revolution. Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu,

Maharashtra, they have proposed so many incentives. Now where IC comes over here. See RC is not only RC is in the total value chain. RC is funding the power generation

generation and now we are going into the data centers also. So what is RC? I will just give a brief introduction about our company. It's a public sector enterprise CPSU under Ministry of Power. It's a

Maharatna company. We were established in 1969. Whenever the government wanted growth was there initially it was pumpset electrification. There was uh lot of requirement for the

pumpsets at that time was there. We started with a mission of pumpset energy station. Subsequently in 1998 we registered as an NBFC and it's a long journey. 2008 we have conferred with

Navaratna status. 2010 we became an IFC infrastructure funding company and 2022 we have been given a Maharatna status and we have a we are an NBFC. We are uh for into the infrastructure sector also.

So how what are all the uh various verticals is financing generation all types of generation hydro solar wind energy storage hybrid e-mobility green hydrogen and everything

is financing all the verticals here and where as I told earlier wherever the government expected growth was there we are a preferred partner for all the government programs. See uh energy is

the backbone of any country. Once the energy consumption increases, the GDP of the country also improves and thereby our growth increases. So wherever the energy has to be pushed we are under

ministry of power and for all the ministry of powers's uh government programs we have been the nodal agency for Rajiv Gandhi Gramin Viditaran Yojana Dindal Ramjot Yojana RDS scheme now and

Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijar Yojana Soagya and now latest uh last but not the least now India energy stack. So is well into India energy stack. Now you see for PM Suryagar MU Biji Yojana also is the

nodal agency. So that is where stands. So I will say is closely associated with energy and also growth. Now how is going to help in this particular or is going to participate in this particular um AI.

So see nor normally in India energy stack re is the knowledge partner and doing the work and similarly and we would like to be the preferred finance partner for the AI sector also

as she rightly said as Miss Mani rightly said there are lots of um challenges but then when a panel like this sits here they will definitely find out some good solutions for accelerating this. So now

um how we are going to go about it um see as I told you we are funding the whole value chain. We are financing the generation projects. We a lot of power requirement is there and a lot of green

power requirement is also there. So has already funded around 64 gawatt of renewable energy projects and has funded um almost 120 gawatt of thermal projects. So you can see the scale in

which can fund these projects and not only generation now has has always financed transmission and distribution projects also. So as Mmani said key how the lines we have to plan the lines

transmission lines the distribution lines come into that particular place well in time. So RC is into all these sectors. So it becomes easy for us to uh coordinate and then make it possible.

Now come coming to the data center. data center is the ultimate uh uh what to say ultimate uh user but as rightly said by mi it is not only an user it is going to be an enabler because once using AI

we'll be able to um um this thing or gr grid also this we'll be able to do that also now coming into the financing aspect of it um you can ask you have normally

experience of generation and distribution generally you are into power sector. Where is the sector expertise in infrastructure financing? See, we started in infrastructure

financing in the year 2022 and we have been for the past three years we have been funding infrastructure projects and you'll be definitely happy to note that almost 10% of our loan book is in

infrastructure. We have funded various sectors. We have funded metro projects, Mumbai Metro and Chennai Metro. Now the latest one we have funded airports. We have funded ports. We have funded

highways and now we are going into the digital highway that is the AI data center. What what is the uh benefit? Benefit is we are funding the entire value chain as I have already told you.

We have a core competency. We are financing all the power infrastructure projects wherein we know the intricacies. um mi showed a slide that 68 68 64 gawatt how the PPAs have been

signed 26% is towards data center so when we do a project appraisal we see all these aspects so we see that the factors uh which are going to help uh execute the project in time are there or

not that we definitely see and we are a maharata so and a loan book of 5.82 82 lakh crores as on 31st December. So this is not a small one. So we have deep pockets. We'll be able to finance many

of the projects, many of the data centers. And as an infrastructure status has already been given, it is easy for us to do this. And now what is it that will push the customer to us or the

customer will be happy to do with us? Customer wants a flexibility. So you want a bigger tenure, you want a flexibility. So what we have got is we have got a different project appraisal

terms and terms here. We can give a tenure of say around 15 to 20 years. That's a good timing for any finance um for a project finance and then we can go for a structured repayment. We

understand the sector initially maybe there is uh the contracts are to be lined up. So maybe the structured repayment will definitely help the the lender borrower. Another thing is ease

of doing business. See if the customer we are always near the customer. We have 20 regional offices across the country wherein the lender is near to you. So whenever you want anything we are just a

doorstep away from you. We'll be able to talk to you immediately and then do the right things for you. So, so this is what uh mainly we I wanted to talk about. So I now over to the session the

sess I think the panelist will be in a position to do more about this particular session. Thank you. Thanks a lot. Thank you so much Mr. Sispi for that

insightful address. And now ladies and gentlemen we've come to the highlight of today's session which is the panel discussion. And uh the topic for the panel discussion is the AI energy

finance trifecta future proofing India's data centers. Now may I please request the moderator of the session Mo Sheriff to please proceed. Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. Thank you for the

speakers for the very enlightening introductions. So let me it's my privilege to moderate this session and to introduce to you this very distinguished panel. So to my

uh left, Miss Shashi Prabha. Uh she's the general manager at SBI and the head of the their center of excellence on new green technologies. Then we have Mr. Si.

Oh, sorry, not in the right order, but that's okay. U who's the director of public and health sectors at Microsoft. Okay. Then sorry uh we have Mr. Ravish

Gupta who is the uh managing director of PBVNL right distribution company in the power sector. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; Then we have Miss Vali Natarajan,

executive director at REC and uh we have Miss Rushali Go. Sorry if I mispronounced some of the names. I'm I'm not Indian. Uh who's the global director for climate and climate and operations

at Google. So without further ado, since I think time is short, let's move into the uh questions and I I will ask our panelists if they can be really, you know, brief and to the point and respond

in like less than two minutes. Let's have a first round of questions, then we see if we have time for a second one or if we let uh people a chance to to ask some questions. So uh first question for

uh Google [snorts] this is regarding the oper operationalization of clean energy at scale. I mean as we have heard earlier really it's of the essence to have you know sufficient energy for

these data centers that require massive amounts of it and this energy has to be has to be green right and I one figure I I saw as I was preparing is 60 to 70% of the cost of a data center actually comes

from energy so the large hypers scale operators are now moving beyond having like annual renewable matching towards real time and location specific clean energy. So from

uh your experience at Google, what operational and grid level constraints you know limit the scaling of such models uh in in fast growing markets like India and what policy and

regulatory interventions would be required to remove these obstacles. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Uh first of all, thank you for inviting me over and thank you for everybody who's patiently listening and

standing. I appreciate all your patience. We'll try to make it worthwhile as we speak. Um so from a Google's perspective, you know, you saw all this all the uh stats there and so

data centers, AI and hyperscalers are at the leading edge um of some of the transition we are seeing and I think we look at it as a both a privilege and an opportunity of how we can do it in the

right way. And so you you mentioned a couple good things. I think one is you need clean energy at scale. So clean why clean energy because we know it's faster. We know renewables are actually

faster to deliver um than in countries like India um they're almost at cost parity in certain places and it's also in a way in a way sustainable that can operate at a longer across a 247 cycle

if you do it right so clean energy at scale is an important one the scale part of it is I think where the the question around going away from annual goal matching comes in so what one of our

philosophies is is can we have clean energy 247 that's around the clock in the areas we operate and I'll that up for you. Why in the areas we operate because we think it's our you know we we

need the power but it's also then what can we add to the grid that can help generate more power for the community that it operates in. So it's not just extracting from the grid but actually

generating and putting back. Uh why 247? Because it's a data center you need 247 but the good thing of 247 is then you start looking at different technologies that make that 247 cycle. So you need

solar, solar wind, solar wind and batteries or some sort of a storage system to kind of go through. I know people like nuclear but that's still a decade plus away. So let's talk of what

we have having you here today. So you asked me about that uh what's what's real and what's here. And so that's the other piece that we that we look at. Um and so going you know when you take that

construct and going to your question around what what would be helpful from a policy perspective and where we are I think in India it's a great opportunity because we've learned so much across the

world and can you all take that experience and circumvent those problems so one of the biggest issues in the world has been uh you know grid grid infrastructure can you know how how good

is a grid how quickly can you do the interconnects what is the clearances and how quickly can you get all the permits done and then how can you take and give back to the grid in a much more

efficient way. I know you talked about demand response, load balancing, these are all fantastic concepts but to get them operated at scale is something where you need a lot of public and

private partnership. You need us to come to the table but we need the policy makers and um all the ministries to come and help with that. So that's a big piece of it is how do you improve grid

efficiency, grid interconnects. The second is scaling up the clean infrastructure in the first place which is can are there new technologies are there incentives are there financial

incentives to go and back different kind of battery storage hydro stoages you know which are new which are risky and I know you're you're from another hyperscaler and we are willing to take

some of the risks but you know it's a partnership into which technology and financing and getting getting the right return so to me the grid infrastructure the right technology are the two two big

ones and the third one is is I think we we are all at a point where we are seeing a faster turnaround on these and so how do you how do you figure out different innovation that can spin

faster? Thank you so much. Thank you for being concise straight to the point. So uh now let's turn to SBI and the kind of financeier perspective

uh and focusing on the bankability of these data centers. So from your perspective as a as a lender, what makes a good uh data center project, you know, from from that perspective, are things

like energy efficiency, renewable integration, resilience, are they influencing your credit decisions or are they still, you know, like secondary considerations?

&gt;&gt; Uh good morning everybody and thank you for having me on the panel. uh from a finances perspective I would say that uh uh for uh bankable uh data center project three important pillars are

there first [clears throat] strong pillar is the uh revenue visibility do we have the certainty of revenue is there a uh strong anchor client having a preferably a hyperscaler having

a long-term agreement uh and what is the demand demand pipeline is is there a firm demand pine So once the answer to these questions questions is in the affirmative we can

say that the uh revenue visibility part of the project is sorted. Second important pillar is power. What is the availability of power? What is the reli reliability of power and what

is the long-term uh price stability of power? So what are the sources of power? Uh do we have a adequate procurement structure in place? What is the redundancy? Do we have a resilience

mechanism in place? What is the backup arrangement? What is the uh tariff sensitivity? If all these issu while financing any data center proposal, we look at all these.

So if these are reasonably satisfied, we would say this is bankable on this front. Third and last front is regulatory and execution risk. Are they adequately

mitigated because any project has to be I mean best case scenario you would like it to be completed in time and without cost. So uh what is the status of land acquisition? What is the status of

necessary approvals and uh compliances and do we have the support from state policy? So I would say in summing up I would say that if there is certainty on revenue

and power and if there is risk mitigation on execution we are good to go. And last one part of your question was regarding the grid integration and

&gt;&gt; no renewable integration and energy efficienc So I would say these are already &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. So next question is for Microsoft. So sir in your u uh

experience uh regarding standards and oper interoperability and so on now that AI is becoming increasingly embedded in energy intensive uh digital infrastructure.

Uh what role do you see for u that you know that the government and the regulators should play in setting the right standards for transparency, interoperability

and accountability so that these data centers uh support the national energy and climate goals. Firstly, thank you so much for having me. very rarely that Google and

Microsoft sit together but certainly but but certainly for a cause like this uh we do uh I think uh a lot has been talked about AI AI is very foundational to economic growth I'm sure everyone in

the room agrees to it uh so much so that four days the country is spending on what AI can do right and my role when I visit a lot of government customers and healthcare customers the only

conversation we were having on AI that only tells that the demand is going to increase I think it's all about how view that more as a resource than as a source of demand generation. I think that

that's how I would put the entire conversation for today on but I think just answering to that question uh probably of course we have our own ways in terms

of both Google and Microsoft we are own climate offices we have our own policies in terms of managing how our data center operates in terms of you know making sure the water consumption is less

making sure there is a clean energy carbon free electricity and all of that but I think what we the government is probably have a clear set of frameworks and policies uh making sure uh where

they're able to balance both the both the growth part as well as the as well as the climate climate part right and I think three areas where we clearly see one is about uh having some trans

standardized transparency in terms of um uh reporting on um on the energy use on the water consumption level probably that would ensure that there's a little less bureaucracy and less strain on the

regulatory hurdles and there is there is much transparency in in the system right the second part is about the interoperability with the grid I think very very very essential as we in fact

we are working with RC in terms of developing a smart grid as well as Microsoft um and and I think uh what we intend to do is maybe as maybe how AI can help in the renewable transition

right and that's something that that we're working on I think the third part which is most important is how do we align with the climate goals right with the climate ambition. Um what we see is

uh can there be an incentive on carbon free electricity right given by the government uh can then be incentive on clean energy I think that's something that probably we would request maybe the

governments to come out with a policy which is which is as clear and as transparent um and I think I strongly believe uh as Microsoft I think we have a we have a very uh AI will be an

accelerator for energy transition certainly when we move to renewable and And I think we we definitely have a role to play in terms of you know making it cleaner and making it more sustainable.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you so much. So next question is for PVNMN. Um [snorts] so um how has the growth of data centers in India uh affected um how distribution companies plan for energy

purchases and supply and uh how the electricity is is dispatched and also I mean maybe to this day but also like you know as you see the the growth of uh of data centers demand. Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Thank you sir. Uh Uttar Pradesh EBL looks after the western part of uh Uttar Pradesh state as a whole right now is a surplus in energy that our availability is around

13% more than what our peak demand happens and the similar situation because all our power our purchasing is done at the state level state level the main issue is of the grid infrastructure

to carry that power to the consumer where it's needed so right now the growth area in Uttar Pradesh which is concentrated around NOA. So we have taken tentative steps of

course in partnership with RECC who are financing this. We are modernization we are modernizing the NOA power distribution system. We are going for N minus one redundancy system there around

19 new substations are being created. We are going for ring main systems at the level of our substations and 11 KB features. So we are planning uh like it should be completed in the next two

years and uh uh around the our infrastructure would be uh so that uh the actual load is around 67% of what the infrastructure is able to carry. So we have the wherewithal to manage any

outage and it will be operated through scattera. Uh the other part is that how the electricity is dispatched though currently we follow very primitive system. we do a day after planning and

then in case the load at some place exceeds that we go for load shedding but in this uh India energy stack process we we are starting a P2P system it's a very small system right now but the consumers

and consumers at a very minute level they are also uh now starting to trade energy and that is enabled by AI people can plan a week ahead and the with guard rails that how much the demand should

not exceed and how the price should not exceed and within that the AI is planning both the purchase and as well as the sale and it's doing it in the real time and right now we have

restricted it to day after but the potential is there to go go into the real time so I see a potential that within I think within 3 four years that system would be robust enough to take

care of large uh say solar farms and large data centers they can plan it together but finally the always uh will always need to be there to provide a safety net when when the this green

energy uh system comes up inadequate at a point. So we are planning for that uh in our UP uh uh data center policy. It's a state policy. The first eight data centers which built under that they have

a mandate for total double grid system. One of it will be financed by the the organization which is building the data center but the second would be totally financed by the Uttar Pradesh

government. So that is in the data data center policy that we are planning for dual grid system and by then we can be we'll be able to see how it pans out what is the actual growth and then we

can plan about it. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much. Uh so the last question is for rec. [snorts] So now um I mean we heard earlier from SBI regarding uh you know how they evaluate

data center um lending uh operations. So how about the green energy solutions for data centers? Uh what are the features of a robust bankable project? And then if you can maybe get a little bit into

the you know how you see the the risks uh for such projects in terms of reliability oftake and so on and and how um how developers can uh can mitigate those. Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Thank you so much and good morning to all. Uh as far as a lender is concerned uh now presently there is no mandate for the data centers. Now we are only at 1 1.7 gaw. There is no specific mandate

from the government that it should be fully uh energized with only green energy and all that. So they take supply from the response also which is a mixture of green and but time is not far

away because government regulations may also change because it's going to be our aim is to build a sustainable data center. sustainable has to cover the supply from green and uh the corporates

themselves who are building the data centers who are going to be upscalers hyperscalers and they have their self-proclaimed uh objective also that it should be a sustainable data center

so the definitely the procurement is going to be 100% from green so looking at that aspect now has been uh funding a lot of green energy projects but they have all so far been the offtakers or

discoms now this is going to be unique now we are going to get green projects which are going to come packed with the data center supply. So in that case we can't assess only the green energy we

need to look at the offtaker also who's going to be the data center. So the fundamentals of revenue visibility which as we mentioned that's not going to change for any lender that is the bottom

line revenue visibility. So more than because renewable technology is very very stable it has developed it's evolved and we do not have any constraints in funding any renewable

project. understood the technology. The thing is that when we look at the revenue certainity then again we have to assess the data center also it has to go hand in hand and secondly how is the

data center going to procure is it going to procure entirely from this plant which is going to come up or is it going to be a group of data centers which are going to come up with a plant which is

going to fund them all together and how strong those entities are is going to matter when I going to fund the renewable energy project for that data center because ultimately they are going

to be paying for them in case in case the terms define that even if the reliability falls slightly below whatever is the 99.996 and even then they have an alternate N

minus one criteria for taking an alternate power source then I'm safe. So in this case as a lender when I look at this thing I would like to have a project which has a very firm PPA and a

very f revenue payment from the data centers so that my project is safe and I get the revenues. Number two is the distance like when a data center is going to source its power from a

plant which is located somewhere far off. Now the green open access regulations are in place. So data centers can go for 100% procurement through these regulations in India. But

again the problem of grid infrastructure basically transmission infrastructure is going to be my problem. I have to accept this fact because data centers and the green renewable generations they can

come up within two years but my transmission infrastructure should not be delayed. So when a project comes to me, I would be looking at a project which would be ready with the

transmission requirements, bay requirements, transmission open access approvals and uh what is there you know it should not be a very far away from the data center consumption. I would

ideally like it to be colloccated which is very very ideal which may not be possible but with having a very lesser transmission line set up. So that would be a very safe project for me and state

regulations are very very polic Certaintity is very very important because each of the states have their own uh policy changes. Suddenly open access rules changes. Suddenly bankable

provisions changes. Banking of energy and their payment changes to changes because your data centers are coming up to peak in the evenings when the normal peak occurs. So they should be having

reliable power. So all these policy certaintities the transmission uh certainties for the renewable energy project is what I would be looking and I would also be assessing. So finally uh I

as a lender I'd be very happy to have a group captive sort of setup when a data center person and a renewable generation person they come together because data centers apart from the bigger

hyperscalers they're going to be even the smaller ones so they can get together and have a group captive and that would be a very very safe bet as far as lender is concerned and which

would be very easy for us to &gt;&gt; structure our finance products. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Very comprehensive response. So since we're running out of time, um we can take yes

maybe two questions from the room. So if you can introduce yourself, ask very short question and maybe who you're addressing it to. Thank you. Thank you.

Okay, let's take one more question and then we'll improve employment for those areas. Thank you. So, who would like to address the first question about

the &gt;&gt; Yeah, we have very little time. Anyone would Yeah, please go ahead. No, I think firstly thank you for both the questions. Um and and probably

anyone on the panel can answer the both. But I think in terms of models sir uh one that as I mentioned we work very closely as Microsoft and even with the other hyperscalers with the government

uh to make sure the the models developed here are very much local uh right and gone of the days where we could just do a a horizontal pitch saying that buy our cloud and or buy our AI model and we are

done with it right in fact so much so that uh we have our own foundry where we have 11,000 models in terms of depending on the industry depending depending on the use case you could just pick it up

right definitely we we are in touch with various power I manage power uh customers also as part of my portfolio uh in terms of coming up with our own models uh which is very specific to

power sector right uh and both Google as well as Microsoft and in fact all the large hyperscalers uh as part of our policy uh we are very much local here uh right uh which which means to your point

in terms of data residing in India it is very much residing in India. I mean without that core promise I don't think we'll be able to operate uh right so so very much it's about making it for local

here uh right and and definitely we work very closely with uh but yeah certainly that's in plan right as I mentioned about working with RSC to develop a smart grid yeah

&gt;&gt; thank you so much &gt;&gt; thank you so so much uh ladies and gentlemen &gt;&gt; maybe 10 second response 15 seconds uh the areas where data center could come

are largely shaped by the market forces But the government is having policies which can nudge them. If you go through the Uttar Pradesh data center policy, there are huge incentives for going to

Purwanchal region and Dakshin region and again there is the provision for half of the grid being constructed by government subsidy. So government is planning in case it's a totally green field area the

half of the grid subsidy will be given by the government. So government is nudging there but finally the market for forces will prevail. So let's see we are as looking forward to it. Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Thank you so much sir. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. So this was the powerhouse panel and a great discussion on the AI energy finance trifecta and I would request the media officials now to

please present our esteemed panel with a momentum. Can we have an applause please ladies and gentlemen? I hope you've had great
