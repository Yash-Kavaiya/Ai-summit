## 📝 Transcript

local AI uh here at the India AI summit. I think this connects very well the the topic of local AI connects very well to some other conversations that we have been having already including a panel we

had yesterday on AI readiness and open data uh and as well as lots of conversations continuing to happen tomorrow and and through the rest of the week. So just before we get started a

quick opening remark from myself and then I'll pass it on to uh some official welcome remarks and then we'll get into a panel discussion. Uh but of course across the world today artificial

intelligence is really being presented as a powerful tool uh and a really powerful tool for development especially. But one question that keeps coming back to us at Paris 21 is AI for

whom and built by whom? In many countries especially across the global south data systems are already under immense pressure. Statistical offices are being asked to do more do these

things faster but also with fewer resources. I think the mic is still on. Yes. But also with fewer resources while still responding to increasingly complex

policy challenges. And in that context, AI can offer a lot of solutions, but it can also widen already existing gaps. So this session and this conversation we are convening here today starts with a

simple idea and that AI only becomes truly impactful when it's grounded in local realities. That means local data ecosystems, local languages, local institutions, and most importantly,

local people. For official statistics, this matters deeply. Statistics are not just numbers. They are public infrastructure. They shape how governments see society,

how policies are designed, and how communities are recognized or also overlooked. If AI is going to be part of this increasingly new and complex infrastructure, it needs to be inclusive

by design, trusted by institutions, and useful for real decision-making. India offers a particularly interesting and powerful context for this conversation. The scale, diversity, and

leadership in the whole conversation around digital public infrastructure raises questions that resonate far beyond national borders. Questions like, how do we build these AI systems that

work across languages and communities? And how do we ensure that innovation strengthens, not replaces public accountability? Today's panel, we have people coming

from government. We have voices from technology, civil society, and international organizations. And together we'll explore what local AI looks like in practice, what has worked

and also what hasn't. Our aim is not to showcase the technology for its own sake, but to tell a grounded story. And to start us off on that story today, I'd like to invite my colleague from civic

data lab, Shuchita Roual, to offer some more proper opening remarks. Thank you. [applause] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Mercedes. And good afternoon, everyone. Uh on behalf of Civic Data Lab

and Paris 21, I extend a very warm welcome to our distinguished guest uh partners, friends and colleagues. I am Shuchita Raul. I lead public finance and gender initiatives at Civic Data Lab. Uh

at Civic Data Lab, we are on a mission to enable data change makers to leverage data and AI for uh conquering some of the most pressing humanitarian problems uh specifically focusing on vulnerable

communities. It is an honor to join to be part of India AI impact summit summit the first ever global AI summit to be hosted in global south. Our session today focuses or revolves around four

important keywords as I see it. It is localization, inclusivity, data and AI. To begin with, let's start with inclusive data systems. We all know and we all agree will agree that AI fuels uh

data fuels AI and AI is actually representing what kind of data we are feeding into it. So it becomes very important that all the AI starts from the ground. Uh and uh but sadly most of

the time the foundation of data systems exclude the very communities for which they are being created or for which they are being made to serve. And but have you ever wondered why? mainly because

data these are being designed in the boardrooms these are coded in the tech hubs and we still are following top- down approach and after doing all this we always kept wondering why uh AI or

why data systems are not inclusive why they are not able to or they misunderstand our local or regional languages and why they still perpetuate biases I think it's a time we need to

rethink and we must agree that inclusivity should not be an afterthought but it should an integral part of our design and um and these uh communities for which it is being

created they should not just be a mere representatives but also co-creators in the process and co-creating solutions is only the way forward as we see it and one powerful example that I would like

to share here is uh Bhashini a government of India's initiative a multilingual uh AI platform that actually supports uh voice to text and uh translation in most of the Indian

languages and we see that this is be that this is what starting from ground means basically touching the point which is very close to everyone's heart which is language if people are able to

communicate able to uh uh interact with the services in the language that are that they understand they definitely are empowered at least I feel empowered so uh I think and at civic data lab. We are

very proud to be part of this initiative and helping in supporting and strengthening it further. Another important aspect that I have already shared beforehand which is like

co-creating solutions. I would just like to talk a bit more about it. We all know that data given the critical and extensive nature of data, it is not one man's job. We all need to get together.

We all need to collaborate, partner, come together on a common platform where we start sharing data sets, use cases, insights and we all become partners or co-creators. And this is what has been

in our overall uh like I would say that this is the overall ambition in whatever work we are doing at civic data lab. Uh we have been forming and strengthening data and AI

collaboratives across all streams of our work. whether it is gender and inclusion, whether it is climate and disaster risk reduction, climate and health and so forth and we would be

happy to have all of you be part of our journey and happy to share more about this and discuss more about this uh after the session or maybe later on. Finally, I would just like to end up by

throwing few words which have been consistently put uh came across to us in our civic sabha 2.0 which civic data lab has convened last week. Some of these words are responsible AI, inclusive data

systems, ethical AI, collaboration, localized solutions, AI skilling, participation, accessibility, safe and trusted AI and data and AI collaboratives. And I'm sure in today's

session as well, we are going to delve deep into these topics and see how we can all meaningfully engage with this and come out with a common idea. uh we will explore together what

starting on the ground actually means in practice with all these distinguished panelists with us we would like to hear from their experience what and look at some of the examples

where local AI is actually empowering communities where we are falling short what is the way forward what we see as potential benefits challenges and gaps I look forward to our conversation and to

concrete ideas partnerships and innovations that will emerge out of it. Together, we have a unique opportunity to ensure that data and AI drive inclusive development and we leave no

one behind. With this, let's dive into the session and I now hand over back to Mercedes to take forward the conversation. Thank you so much and thanks again for joining us here.

Thank you so much Shisha. That was that was wonderful and a really good way to start off this conversation. like you mentioned, I think the points you hit on inclusion and inclusivity in the way

that we design is incredibly important. So, I look forward to hearing about our speakers on that. But before I do pass it over to our speakers, I do want to introduce them because I know you can

see well, you were able to see their pictures and their names on the screen, but not much more than that. So, let me tell you about how great these people are. Directly to my left, we have

Johannes. Johannes is the executive head. Yes, that is you. Wonderful. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Johannes is executive head of Paris 21. So my close colleague again Paris 21 is

the global partnership that is hosted by the OECD but we are a separate entity in what we do and we have our own mandate which is really on supporting national statistical systems around the world

particularly in the global south. Johannes is a development economist by training and also a former member of the UN secretary general's expert group on the data revolution. He's long worked at

the intersection of statistics policy and inclusive development. Directly next to him we have Dr. Sorro Gar. Mr. Garag is the Secretary of India's Ministry of Statistics and Program implementation

and he oversees one of the world's largest national statistical systems. An Indian administrative security service officer, my apologies, he has held senior leadership roles across digital

public infrastructure, social policy, finance and brings extensive experience in technology enabled public service delivery. Next we have Gorav Gdwani who is the

co-founder and executive director of civic data lab a research lab advancing data and responsible AI for public good across India and the Asia-Pacific region with over a decade of experience

deploying data innovations in areas such as climate resilience, public finance and health. He works to strengthen civic and institutional data ecosystems. And finally, at the end of our line here, we

have Sachi Bala, who's the deputy director at the Gates Foundation, where she leads work in India on gender equality with a focus on women's economic empowerment and leadership.

With experience spanning policy partnerships, public health, and equitable development, she brings a strong emphasis on evidence-driven and intersectional approaches to social

impact. Please join me in applauding our fantastic lineup here today. [applause] So, let's get started. And I'll I'll like to hear from you, Johannes, first um to maybe set the problem statements a

little bit for us because when we talk about local AI can mean a lot of different things, but what problem are we actually trying to solve when we talk about global or generic AI solutions,

failing to address different things in official statistics and and public decision-making? &gt;&gt; Thank you very much, Mercedes. Good afternoon, everybody. Good to see you

here. Um if if I may may I say this I I wouldn't put this maybe not too much into a global versus local conversation. I think the global conversation that we have is very important. We discussed

many things related to global AI and the problems and the challenges. I think it's now high time to discuss local but to see the benefits of this conversation of seeing what can local AI do and here

I have to say I have really to congratulate the Indian government in particular also your ministry um to put the question of welfare and to push the question of happiness. This is if you

run around the signs you see AI for improving welfare and happiness. This is the focus of the third summit. The other two summits were in the UK and in France uh important summits but this is the

first global summit as has been said that is in the south and focuses specifically on issues related to poverty to welfare. So I think the first point I wanted to drive home is it's

really something that we need to take on now very seriously of how local AI and data system can improve well-being and if I may can I speak please again about the STGS have you forgotten about the

SGS no we shouldn't I mean we still have the Monday to talk about the sustainable development goals and agenda 2030 leave no one behind we have seen some developments in the international arena

but Let's please keep us have the focus on the STGS. We still have a few years to go to achieve something. So the first point I really wanted to drive home is the contribution of local AI system and

local data system to improve well-being of all people specifically also in rural areas and who are living uh a little bit behind. Second point I wanted to say what are the key levers how this sort of

situation how can we discuss this? The first is access. the access question and as you know I mean um with many of the data systems and data conversation we had yesterday we had a conversation

about AI readiness getting um sort of the system ready and the data to be used for AI AI for data data for AI and I think that's something we really should see are we coming into as Stefan Vulz

professor in New York says are we coming into a data winter because some of the access will be closed or will be able to unlock data. I think this is a very important key lever to ensure that we

can access data that helps people and that helps a sort of local AI system to um really address uh problems that matter for local people. So access is very important. The second point,

capacity development. This is Paris 21. We are capacity development institution. We train and would love. One thing that I haven't seen just I'm picking this out. Um I'm a trained uh development

economist but in reality I'm an agricultural economist by training and what always struck me in agriculture was the role of small farmer organizations small farmer organizations to help

farmers to understand their world and sort of to be helped to give them the fertilizer the pesticides the education I haven't seen yet the small farmer organization helping them with the AI

systems and helping them to relate to those sort of using mobile phones to help them. I think that's something maybe we can we can look into further. So capacity development through whom

training is the second point access capacity development and last but not least it comes all over again and again is trust is trust. If the farmer let's stay to the farmer example doesn't trust

in terms of the thing that he gets from his wonderful mobile phone tell him he has to plant now if he doesn't trust this uh because he doesn't believe in the data and whatn not then we have an

issue. So the trust it will be key. Let me come to the last point. Um is the role of national statistical offices. I think the national statistical offices all over the world but particular in

this country can play an tremendous role in ensuring that local AI data system can support uh the fight against poverty and improve well-being. Um it can so do uh by setting standards by helping with

the quality control of the data and by also something which has come up uh very recently is to talk to different stakeholder groups. We often think about unlocking data from the private sector.

That's a big debate. We talk about public sort of all the surveys. Yes. But we also have citizen generated data many citizen generated many NOS's and can we sort of integrate that data after having

it quality controlled into sort of local AI systems that can really again help um supporting um uh the welfare of poor people. So in a nutshell um this is an important conversation that we need to

have. We are just at the beginning and now I'm curious to hear from my Indian colleagues what they say more precisely on the Indian situation. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thanks Johannes. I think that's a really

insightful way to to look at this maybe. Yeah, I agree. It's not necessarily a problem but you know the challenge that we have at hand here. Uh a lot of what you touched on here is really the

importance of grounding AI in local realities. Um so I'm curious to hear from the government perspective Dr. Arg if you could tell us a little bit more from that perspective because India

really is cited quite often as a leader very rightly so I think in this um especially for digital public infrastructure but what type of institutional or governance choices

would you say have been most critical in ensuring that AI enabled data systems remain inclusive trusted and fit for public use [clears throat]

&gt;&gt; uh thank you pleasure to be here um and also a pleasure to talk about uh inclusive AI uh data systems because that's really at the core of uh what we when we talk of uh the overall objective

of AI for welfare and and AI for all. Uh in fact uh one of the seven working groups of this AI summit is on democratizing AI resources. Uh I'm associated with that group. I co-chair

it along with Egypt and um Nigeria and in Egypt and Kenya. And uh we are looking at this issue and the fact remains that a lot of AI resources whether you look at uh compute you look

at models you look at data systems you look at talent uh they're not evenly distributed and uh that's an area that uh we've deliberated in the working group also to look at what what needs to

be done and this is all the more important because AI is now moving from experimentation uh to real public deployment And uh we are not uh no longer at an

experimentation uh level and uh some of the things that we've been discussing whether in the working group or outside is uh how data and AI ecosystems uh need to be treated perhaps as a data

public infrastructure. uh data in the sense uh a lot of data is generated uh as you mentioned uh by the statistical offices by censuses surveys but there's a lot of data which gets

generated within governments and outside governments and uh at least we need to be able to identify the data sets which can be put out in the public uh ecosystem which can be used uh for uh AI

development And uh data is the raw material for AI. And uh if uh credible and standardized data is available that will ensure that uh the AI models work in a manner where no one is left behind

which is also the goal of uh the SDGs uh towards data governance. What is also required is a standardsbased uh system and that is something that we are working uh intimately in the government

uh looking at how to ensure that the uh that the metadata is uniform that classification and standards are followed uh that uh interoperability is maintained uh that data is machine

readable uh so that it uh it becomes accessible and uh issues of access are critical whether it's for compute or for models and that's the reason what are the

different mechanisms uh there's talk of uh the edge resources uh edge compute there's talk of small domain models and I suppose a host of these would really help to ensure democ democratize AI

access uh and ensure that AI remains uh inclusive uh the other aspects are in terms of how we can uh how we can uh mold AI to ensure that access uh remains uh

inclusive and what I'm talking of in terms of ensuring that uh semantic search can be made much more multilingual uh because increasingly I think that's one thing which AI uh

ecosystems allows to ensure that voice becomes a means means of being able to uh search and identify and voice which is uh language neutral which is uh uh which is for which you don't need to be

a literate and you don't need to have a single uh language access I think multilingual access and voice access is something which AI in a way enables so AI uh we don't need to look at AI as

always restricting access. But I think this aspect of AI is something which will only enable greater inclusiveness and ensure that people are able to access highquality information, high

quality resources because of the inherent uh benefits of AI. And last but not the least is also in terms of strengthening safeguards. I think uh that's been alluded to and that's what

when we we talk of AI by design uh being able to ensure that uh u the uh data is uh is is one takes care of safety concerns and concerns of uh ethical issues around it. So what would be the

guard rails for that? I think that needs to be uh built in at the design stage itself. But that in itself should not prevent us from uh ex leveraging AI much more effectively. I think uh very often

the u u u the if I don't want to use that word but for lack of the doomsayers are are uh might talk about the uh harms of AI but I think we need to be cognizant

of the benefits also while ensuring that we have sufficient uh safeguards built in at the at the design stage. So I'll stop here but just want to add since we are uh talking in a forum which is a

partnership for statistics and I am um part of the statistics office in India uh that is something that we are working with across ministries across states to ensure that uh the data becomes

accessible and that uh uh data is uh is standardized and because if our data ecosystem is correct That's really the foundation and that foundation will ensure that uh AI becomes so much really

AI for all and AI in inclusive in all its sense. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much Secretary Gar. That's really helpful and especially the points you're hitting on about

inclusion. I think you've hit it right on the nail there. Um but I do think it's one thing to design these inclusive systems and then it's a real other thing to actually feel their impact. So that's

why I think uh maybe now we turn it over to to Gorov from civic data lab to to go in a little bit more on that angle. If you can tell us a little bit about how you've seen local AI actually empower

communities uh or maybe from the civil society actor perspective as well in a way that you can now engage with data in new ways. &gt;&gt; Thanks uh Mercedes for having me here

and thanks to Paris 21 for co-organizing this session with us. So since we are in the late afternoon session with your permission Mercedes, can I do a bit of a poll just to see the energy in the room?

&gt;&gt; I love the interaction. &gt;&gt; So raise your hand if you have used AI application be it your traditional GPTs and LLMs in not English and Hindi. Not English and Hindi.

Great. uh continue to keep your hand up if you feel everyone in your family especially your elderlys can use that effectively continue to keep your hand up if you can

find local information about your neighborhood for example SDG goals I'm also wearing the SDG pin as we were reminded by Johannes that SDG indicators we can get in the local language for

your local area through those AI models So yeah very few hands left. So that's the problem which we are trying to solve like if we have to make local data work for local population for the local

development goals we don't have the ecosystem ready yet and it has three major uh areas which we have to improve upon. Number one is co-creation. Some some of the times these models are

created as my colleague was explaining in research labs but not tested or not actually involved very uh from the very beginning with the local communities. So at civic data lab we keep saying when we

talk about the AI life cycle unfortunately the local audience comes at the tail end of it when we start testing those solution not from the very beginning they get seat on the table to

to have opportunity to say their concerns say what their problems are what are the kind of opportunities they want to uh achieve with help of these local applications. So ensuring there is

enough representation in the room when we are conceptualizing these AI models is critical. Uh and then we involve them in throughout the AI life cycle. Find incentives for them to be motivated

throughout the AI life cycle with you when you are conceptualizing when you are bringing in the data sets when you are early testing the models when you are actually scaling up the models and

and ensuring it's ready for the population scale. find incentives that they are involved throughout the AI life cycle. Second one is evaluation. We understand and Johannes briefly touch

upon it that there is global AI ecosystem and there local AI ecosystem and a lot is happening in the global AI ecosystem. We can see across the bhat mandapam a lot of conversation is

dominated by that. How do we ensure that there is a bridge between global AI and local AI? uh we don't want them to be in the locks with each other. We want them to work with each other and that's where

the participatory AI evaluation uh framework can help us enable that. So lot of LLMs, lot of AI models would be developed uh in other countries and would be brought into other geographies.

That's going to happen. That's the reality we are working with. But we need participatory high evaluation where local experts, local domain experts, local culture experts know what are the

biases in some of these models. Flag them well in advance before they are raised at population scale and help them curb all of this. And again, we find incentives for these experts, local

domain experts, local culture experts to serve us in that journey. That's the second aspect. Third is the skilling. Local AI is as good as the local skilling ecosystem. Who is going to get

benefit of it? We understand that still certain section of community struggle to engage in the digitization journey, struggle to engage with the AI journey as well. How do we give enough

opportunity of skilling to them so that they feel they have a seat on the table. They can participate with this information. be it your data sets, be it your AI models, how do we find that

space for them to skill and and and feel comfortable that they would have a secure job in the future as well. So that's what I would feel uh if you have to unbundle local AI, these three

elements co-creation, participatory AI, AI evaluation and AI skilling need to be unlocked parallelly to make it happen. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much Gorov. Um, I hear what you're saying, especially on the

the scaling aspect of it as well. And that's what's really key here. And so maybe if we if we want to hammer in a little bit more on that because I think it's important that we talk about

initiatives that go beyond pilots and and really looking at that impact and that success as well. But turning over to you Sachi because I know you have a lot of experience both within the Gates

Foundation and and in other areas as well working across different countries and institutions. uh but from your perspective at the Gates Foundation now what is one recommendation that you

would give to governments who are really interested and want to invest in AI for data systems especially keeping in mind something that actually strengthens inclusion in public decision-m

&gt;&gt; uh thank you Mercedes and thank you uh to the organizers this is a great session uh I also feel like so much has already been said you know I think we've I was just making note of some of the

words everyone has said around trust co-creation uh and uh I think what got said about skills is also something that sort of was reflected across the panel. Uh if I

had to say one recommendation and I'm I'm just going to give you the headline but I want to dig deeper into some uh other themes. Um I think we need to treat AI as an institutional capability

um and really look at inclusion in design uh and in the in the co-creation aspect at the outset rather than as a secondary or a you know tertiary area of focus. Um and I think something that we

must keep reminding ourselves is that AI is not a standalone tool. uh having dashboards and doing pilots is exciting and it it is something that could get people interested in uh focusing on the

the value that you can get out of AI. uh but it really sort of how well we are able to utilize AI and and really make it work for people is by looking at whether it can be embedded in existing

trusted institutions with trusted data and aligned with statistical standards all things that um Mr. Gag said uh but also looking at what is the use of that data and what is the use of that AI

functionality at different levels and that's going to look different at the national level it'll look different and at a community level it'll look different it will look different if you

have a shared device or if you have your own individual device so thinking about the usability I think is something that also needs to come in right at the outset um I can dig a little deeper

there but I wanted to sort of you know go back to what uh Johannes said about the lack of application of AI in agriculture uh and at the last mile in some form uh and some work that we've

been doing uh with the government of India with the national rural livelihoods mission is really making sure how can we tap into AI capabilities that that exist but make sure that we

are working with trusted frontline workers so women who are from the community women frontline workers who actually can be skilled and um be provided with the tools which allow them

to access data, access AI uh analysis and share that with women farmers and because it's the combination of being skilled on a technical area whether that is on

livestock management or on specific aspects of agriculture and cropping and it's coming from a trusted person who is also equipped equipped with the right information and AI powered uh tools. I

think that's really in a sense such a great use case uh of what we can do to make sure that AI is actually local uh and is being used by the community and actually then strengthening what what

the data systems are and how AI can actually you know continue getting better at responding to the needs of the community. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you. I like the way you

put that kind of two-way street into perspective as well. You know, the importance of having that trust go two ways and have important the importance of understanding and the skills as well

that come along with that as well as the access. Um, so all very important points, we've got just less than 15 minutes left in this session and I do want to open up for Q&amp;A. But before I do

that, so it gives everyone a chance to think of a question, a short and concise question so that we can take as many as possible. I want to ask one question to our speakers, maybe a little bit

provocative, a little bit pushing, uh, really on that local global nexus, um, which we all see maybe in different ways, but can we ever really have truly local AI in a world where foundational

models and platforms are really controlled by these big global actors. So, you don't have to answer that question, but a little a little seed to think about. And now, if anyone has

questions from the floor, I will come pass the mic to you. Fast hands. I see a fast hand there. If you can introduce yourself as well, please.

&gt;&gt; Thank you panel. Uh I'm Anubhuti and I'm from Nalanda University. Uh my question is uh from uh Ma'am Yu and uh um um Gorovs uh if you could answer how the government launched yesterday only Bat

Vista program and we see how it is integrating and uh it will be useful for the farmers to look up to the schemes and everything. How do we um make sure at this level when we we are

implementing this DPI structure on the local level how do we make sure that um not to criticize but uh I come from Rajir uh where my university is based we don't have stable internet connections

in such areas how do we make sure that the uh people are actually able to access uh such database and um they are able to reap benefit out of it so how do we make sure of that thank Thank you.

Thank you very much. Let's see if there's some other questions. Maybe we can bundle some questions here. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Um hello all of you. My name is Vinit Prakash and um I have recently uh

starting started an organization um quantum nebula. It's a startup. So basically the organization intention is to bring the combination of the AI uh and AI offerings and so that you know

we can we can bring up uh the processings and the another pattern on the quantum side because I saw the name quantum so I came here. So the question is do you think uh that uh the quantum

and the AI can bring the right set of uh you know use cases across the healthc care and the other verticles as well do you think so based on your experience I' I've done couple of research around and

I have a patent in quantum recently on the authenticity so so but but I would like to hear from the jury as well thanks &gt;&gt; thank you very much maybe is there one

more question. Yes, I'll see the hand right here and then we'll leave it up to the speakers to answer whichever. &gt;&gt; Hi, I'm Himali. Uh I'm I'm a data scientist. So my question is uh since

this uh session started with talking about involvement of community. So currently as I understand there's a lack of knowledge among digital users on how their data is collected and how it is

used. Even though the DPDP act is there but the legitimacy of it in the society is not yet there like people are not aware of how much data the companies actually have on them and what probably

company has more data on uh a person than the person actually understands. So how do we bridge this gap through community participation? I want to understand that.

&gt;&gt; Very interesting. Thank you for that. I think the community participation aspect is incredibly important for us to talk about um continuing. So, so uh speakers over to you. Feel free to take the mic

and jump in on any of those. &gt;&gt; So, uh starting for the first one on uh connectivity and internet uh problems in rural areas. I think uh one must realize that now we are entered a situation that

number one mobile connectivity is near universal. Uh it's more than 98 or 99% in terms of availability of mobile connection. internet connection because of the uh Bhat digital project uh uh

ensuring that optic fiber connectivity is there to every punchayat uh that also is near universal and a lot of these activities whether it's bharat vistar uh there was another one mahavistar which

was already in operation bhat vistar was launched if I'm not right not mistaken yesterday by the honorable prime minister uh so a lot of them are also don't necessarily require a smartphone

phone. Many of those activities are also available on a feature phone. So I think because of uh ubiquity of uh the mobile phone access is something which perhaps is not so much of a problem and maybe a

decade or two back it was but that's what I I would just like to flag that and leave it at that. On the quantum and AI I think quantum would have a lot more impact on the cyber security. Obviously

you have uh quantum computers and you'll have compute so much more faster but that's still something in the future but in terms of quantum infecting cyber securityurities more threats which are

real and I think at the same time there are enough uh uh work being done to ensure that quantum uh can also be used more effectively for good rather than looking at it only uh at what could be

the uh negative uh aspects uh of that and um the third uh point was on &gt;&gt; on on on data on I think data privacy is something which uh is is is topmost in terms of concerns that there are at an

individual level but I can say that uh each of the uh data sets that are collected especially by the government have very clear protocols behind them. I think what you are alluding to is the

data that is captured by a lot of the for example the social media uh aspects etc. And I think those are things uh which are uh which are work in progress if I can put it that way. uh but uh the

the first is obviously awareness has to be at an individual level and then uh comes the second aspects on what needs to be done to ensure that in case there is a violation and I think that DPDB act

at least has a framework around it and we can of course discuss how it will get implemented in future but I'll stop here. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much secretary over to

you Sachi. Um I'll just build on uh S's point from around uh data connectivity. Um and also add that you know I think why when we are building solutions in India and if we are thinking about what

happens at the last mile we're making sure that these solutions are not dependent on connectivity at 100% of the time. So I'll just reference like maybe a couple of tools that frontline workers

are using and that could be in the health space, it could be in uh the agriculture space, it could be in education. The way that these tools are currently being designed is that you

have offline capabilities. You are able to utilize them when you know you are in a even in a remote area and then once you have access to internet uh strong internet again or uh or data

capabilities you you are able to actually upload the data um online onto the cloud. Uh I think it's really important that when we design we make sure that we are looking at the you know

the last user. It's not for the average user who is going to be sitting in a city with 100% connectivity at all times. And I think it's it's really amazing to see that actually the

government of India has made that effort because of this idea around democratizing and making sure that we are actually uh getting the best capabilities at the last mile. So I

think you know the the way that tool the way we are looking at tools that the design and the usability of tools today we recognize that there will be these few instances you know there they may be

near universal connectivity but there might be some instances where uh data is weak or you know we are not using smartphones etc. But the way that applications are being designed and the

skilling that is being provided to the frontline workers make sure that that doesn't mean they are left out of that uh of this movement. I and I think that's a really strong start. Uh of

course uh you know as connectivity improves and as skills improve uh this is something that's just going to get stronger and stronger. If I can just add in 30 seconds to what

uh Sorab G and uh Sachi mentioned. Uh two things which uh and actually in both the use cases of connectivity as well as on um data security, data privacy perspective, there is a very critical

role of civil society organizations to take this knowledge localize it contextualize it for the citizens they are serving. uh one body alone can't ensure uh a a digital application or AI

application is reaching the last mile. There are series of intermediaries which we have to activate. So local civil society and local academic institutions play a vital role here. We just need to

find more incentives to support them. And second is again we have to make sure that information is localized. there is a need for multilingual aspect uh to be strengthened and and the project

Bhashini is trying to do that. How do we further see a larger uh landscape there where voice data could also be ensured because a lot of languages are not having scripts. So how do we uh ensure

that some of the uh DPP act laws are explained in voice for the local languages for local dialects is going to be a gamecher which we would see in upcoming years.

Can can I just add something to this conversation? Um and also to bring it back to um to the international level because uh I think the Indian example is super interesting for all over the

world. I mean we at Paris 21 work a lot in Africa and I was I mean if to be very honest um one point that I think we are not discussing discussing eventually enough is supply versus demand. For me

this is often a very much supply driven. We have AI, we throw it at the people and then see if demand is coming. Hey, we have to see what is the real can we turn latent demand. Can we make farmers

um citizens demand those services? So if we do this, what are people concerned about living in in rural areas, living in cities, whatnot, they are first and more foremost concerned about public

services. Public service meaning healthcare. If I go to a hospital, do I pay under the table payment? It says officially is free for all. No, but often you have to pay under the table.

Is there teacher showing up in school? Is there is there quality education? Is there security? Is there sewage? Those things matter for people. So how can we turn this latent demand into into

something I think that their civil society can help but also for profit sector and I think we should also and that's something maybe for the researchers here we could we could think

about a bit more is about what are the lessons learned from the ICT revolution. 25 years ago, 30 years ago, I was working for a research institute in Bourne in Germany and we started

research about ICT, information communication technology. Is it good or bad for poor people? I mean not in the sense of oh bad for poor people meaning uh does it benefit the poor? Have mobile

force benefit the poor more proportionally? I would say definitely yes. What were the success reasons for this? I mean many of the things that then also private sector has come up is

now look at Kenya you have insurance payments via mobile phones it's even more advanced than in rich countries so can we get those things in in the world as well and what is needed so I think we

have to focus also a little bit more on the demand make it effective &gt;&gt; thank you very much I think those are all really interesting uh ways to answer these different questions we've had all

very different questions as well covering different areas of of this debate here I know we had that alarm clock that went off and all woke us up a little bit uh and and is definitely our

cue to to wrap up here. So, just in wrapping up, um I think what we've come to hear a lot from all of our speakers is really this importance of inclusion. I don't think that's news to anyone, but

I think the angles that you've all presented here and coming from the different perspectives has really shaped how I understand inclusion in this space of AI and where the different

stakeholders and and different groups all play a key role as well as the the stakeholders that we have in the room, citizens, people coming from uh different types of institutions,

different countries and backgrounds as well. That is what can really make these systems, these solutions the strongest. And I think that's also where we can understand the demand as you're saying

Johannes, it's exactly true. I think a lot of times in tech the demand is uh preceded by the supply. Uh so how can we flip that and make sure that these solutions that are being invested in uh

both in terms of financial resources but also environmental resources, how can we make sure that they're responding to the demand that's out there rather than just throwing spaghetti at the wall to see if

it sticks. Um so we've got about 10 seconds left. Let's use that time for applause. Thank you all for coming out and thank you to our speakers.
