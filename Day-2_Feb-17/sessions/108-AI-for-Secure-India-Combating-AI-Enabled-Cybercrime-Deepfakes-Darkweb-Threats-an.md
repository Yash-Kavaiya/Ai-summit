## 📝 Transcript

If you want to be part of the music a play very significant role. So whichever the domain just you take you know they a play very vibrant and significant role from you know the end to end on the

current trends if you see this close to 1 trillion from the economy standpoint which is contributed by the IT now it's like a more than 28%age of the trillion in terms of the contribution for the

global economy which is coming over there actually from the estimated from the India standpoint close to 20%age a going to contribute in the bigger wing it's a 20% it's a bigger right I mean in

terms of the GDP growth for the you know the country and if you take a you know as a organization from the organization standpoint from the layman standpoint when just 10 years before there is a

demonetization right where we are crunch on the money the people are looking on the UPI the UPI payment like you know that right it reached the tender coconet side who is selling the tender coconet

at roadside he was the technology enabled And then what are the money transactions even fraction of you know the you know pisas where we are able to transfer and get things so there is

adoption change but however it's a transformation is it got into the bigger wing instead of the credit card debit card and then online banking now the UPI transaction is bigger and then wider now

this wave it may not be the wave right it's a transformation I can say the wave will fall down right but the a it may not it's absolutely the transformations where we are looking where we going to

add value in into the bigger wing and if you see this IT industry standpoint like always when the AA came of course it was there more than 20 years but it's when come to the layman that's what it is a

bigger impact it is coming to right when the open CPD coming to the pictures everybody started look like what exactly I want to do he and then from there just I can you know get things as a extract

as output I may not require to put my brains down actually on the specific area so from the you know cyber standpoint find like uh close to 40 to 50% of the organizations already be

optered how we can detect and prevent by using the AA component but at the same time you know the hacker also use the same AA component how they can in terms of do the complete harvesting of you

know what I think just want to get things in right that's like other side it's going on the in the biggest so we have a you know the great experience I can say it's a legend I I

work with you know all the leaders and really we wanted to hear from you know their perspective like what exactly you know the aim mean for a technology as a layman and then as organization and what

are the crime just where we have handled from you know the end to end uh so just would like to you know start from you uh you know specifically uh the people are thinking uh the A is for the

technologist that's for the business you know not for the you know the layman and as well as when Away you know came into the pictures just where we are thinking this is a angel but of course

from cyber side we have a devil also inside right so really love to hear from you they is for whom I mean it's for the lay layman or maybe it's for the technologist or for the business like

how this weapon is going to be used on that [clears throat] &gt;&gt; well I think that when a new technology comes cyber criminals are the you know

negative people they are the first to exploit any technology and we always say that uh cyber criminals at least in their domain they are a step ahead than the police or law enforcement it's a

fact you know so for example AI came and they are the first one to exploit this AI technology how they are exploiting this AI technology they are creating defect video they are creating synthetic

video synthetic image and through that they are you know committing digital arrest and sex tortion scam every scam is being operated now it's IBR enable you know they have integrated AI in such

a way that if call is coming from that is automated call but the the call is coming from it it appears to be that it's a genuine call it's coming from bank it's coming from any insurance

service provider the fact is that is completely automated they are using AI in such a way and that's why it's just one month back it was a it's it's a the figure was announced in parliament that

22,000 K rupees in 20 2024 in one year 22,000 K rupees was lost by general public in India it's it's a and and and more than 26 lakh cases reported and earlier the cyber criminals used to

be localized you know then they organized at a district level then at the central uh state level and then at the national level now they are internationally connected. They are

operating from a huge cyber scam at the border of Thailand, Mymar and India. You know this is a huge uh scam compounds. I mean multiple stories and they are operating from there and they are

targeting Americans, Canadians, Indians you know and they have recruited uh people from the social media uh based on their profile based on their uh their native uh if if they have to loot

someone from India they they will give this task to Indian. If they have to operate something inside the uh uh USA then they are recruiting from there and they are putting them in a scam

compound. They are seizing their passport and they they are getting them worked as a cyber criminals you know earlier they were recruited for some good job you

know some IT work some coder some you know cyber security guys but once they land up there they are you know pushed inside the scam compound and they are they are you know compelled to commit

the crime so this is the way the cyber criminals are operating and now this is it's very soberism you know that Internationally they are connected they are creating their own ransomware they

are operating uh a victim is somewhere else money is being withdrawn somewhere else negotiation is happening with someone who is in other parts of so now it's it's very difficult for law

enforcement agency and police to operate and and and successfully cracked because uh police they don't have expertise they don't have tools they don't have resource they don't have international

cooperation you know it's it's not only technical is not only crime related it's a it's a technically and legally very complex to operate. So now the police is fing facing the biggest challenge with

the introduction of FI the biggest challenge before law enforcement agency of police is that how to track the criminal. &gt;&gt; True.

No absolutely sir like specifically the last note what you have left it is how do we track this you know criminals uh because earlier if you take a robbery the physically the thief will be present

on the bank around the bank or maybe if you wanted to you know physical attack that's like always we there is a physical visibility of the you know the human being right now it's like all

digitally connected more internet and then more threats now it's like a more a coming to the pictures it's easy to m it like I'm from India another five minutes I may access from you know different

country so it's not so easy to you know connect and take it forward so with this note really you know I wanted to hear from you uh as yet shared this in terms of the real-time experience of what

exactly the challenges so where we have it but just other side really we want because just you crafted a lot of policies and then enforcement you know we love to hear u the practical stuff

like if you see the last year to this year the I4C's announced like a close to 200 100 percentage of you know the cyber fraud has you know increased even now just it's going up in terms of the AA

side right you grafted the policy and process and then guidelines for the country level like how you see in terms of the enforcement at ground level if that is in fulfilling to some extent we

would have avoided or maybe still there is a gap between the uh drafting policy and then enforcements on the ground level &gt;&gt; so first of all I'm Rakkesh Mahishwari

he was heading ministry of electronics and IT the cyber law, cyber security and data governance side. See the role of government for any policy initiative is to see that one

like AI for all equitable reach good usage but simultaneously to also ensure that the law and order that the harms to the individual harm to the society harm to the nation does not happen and

therefore the policies are written in such a manner that we actually require or want that the digital economy and digital platforms continue to comply. And in a normal scenario when they are

complying ideally government should not intervene at all. But when things go wrong once again at any level the law should be such that one it creates deterrence.

It creates possibilities of detection. It creates maybe through the platforms, possibilities of educating the users, creating accountability of the platforms and finally when things go wrong as to

be sort of governance function comes into picture and as to how exactly it can adjudicate or or maybe do something about whatever wrong has happened. Particularly in the context of AI while

lots of use cases, good use cases are there. In fact, including in crime prevention, fraud detection, the fact remains the the ease with which things can be faked,

deep fakes can be created and because of the very nature of the internet that the things go viral and hence the extent of damage that can happen is immense. commensurate ne actions therefore have

been initiated by the government and maybe subsequently when when maybe as and when I'm required to talk I'll talk a bit about the IT rules 2021 which has been very recently

just about 10 days back has been &gt;&gt; yeah no absolutely sir no really I wanted to you know come back on the specific those area like uh tier 1 to tier three of course subsequent

discussions we can have it s just as s had mentioned um in terms of the policy creations and the enforcements at the ground level really just I want to hear from u awareness standpoint right I mean

we cannot measure the sample from tier one cities what exactly they have taken over there right uh it has to go and reach on to bottom level of people of course it is going and reaching uh but

just I want to know like where we are now I mean in terms of the awareness level specific to the enforcement how the weapon can be used right So love to hear from you know the your side.

&gt;&gt; Okay. Thank you very much. First of all I sincerely thanks the organizer and uh cyber crime research foundation who has given me opportunity the research foundation for sharing this stage and

especially with the dignity. See uh I am a Dr. Sapna Benil professor Shiram College of Commerce and director institutional outreach as a point of education. I feel there is a difference

between theoretical and practical. When we talk about cyber crime laws, rules and regulation, the picture is in a different image. But when it comes to the practical aspects, it's altogether

different because the police station, they are not equipped with the machineries and technology. And at the same time, we don't have a ecosystem. We have UPI, we have lot of things right

now. We are doing digital payment. We have dizzy lockers. We have Aadhaar card. But yes, once again this ecosystem creating a lot of problem as well because uh cyber attackers they know how

to leak it and you know it was a time when we say a picture can define the thousand of words and that can be easily you can recognize but right now you can say uh fake video can change the liar

voice. So things are changing day by day and as the point of view of educator I can say there has to be some coordination between government educator and yes of course police systems rules

and regulations when the rules and regulation will match with the education sector and they will create a awareness maybe this problem can be solved. You better know a man in a Kpur recently

lost a one lakh rupees a fake AI video from someone pretending to be a relative and at the same time the second case recently happened you know the senior citizen in Delhi paid money after

listening the voice of the child okay he stepped somewhere and at the same time few more cases a tech worker in Bangaluru almost lost 1.5 lakh back rupees in uh you know recently this kind

of a scam. So so many things are taking place like hacking tools, fake identity, malware, stolen data, fishing emails and fake loans. Every day we are getting lot of lot of calls and it's very very

difficult defakes creating a lot of problem even current scenario. So we should understand key the things is changing only awareness alertness and third very important part is that

educate them in a very very specific ground level. So that can solve the problem as the best of my knowledge. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thanks. Thanks SA. I think you have

given a punchline in terms of to follow actually. Thanks a lot. Um uh Tarun just you know following up on Sapna really just I want to know she has touched upon the deep fake you know which has created

a lot of scam I mean of course it's not uh you know illate right it's like a well educated people just they are losing in terms of the money from you know the end to win so really we want to

know uh this is one is u on the AI um yes glad to have you sir So tan just uh you know we want to know like uh one is with the a how we can prevent in terms of the you know

incident second one is how I can detect the incident and third one is once the incident has happened really just I wanted to know like it's like a real or the fake or how it is and then from

where it is and just we want to know the root of this incident so that um furthermore any instance income just can be avoided with the right set of the mitigation step right so love to hear

from you like in terms of the foreign side like what are the key step how the A is playing significant role in terms of detection as well as a prevention &gt;&gt; thanks thanks Nathan so let me let me

touch upon the problem uh in brief before I talk about the solution see if we talk about a state like Delhi we have a population of 1.52 cr people we have a police force of 1 lakh 4,000 people

there is absolutely No way you can monitor 1.52 cr people with a force of 1 lakh 4,000. I am pretty sure that 50% of the people in this room would have faced an incident that you would have lost

your phone or maybe your wallet when you went to the police to complain it complain about it no FIR you would get a lost and found complaint and be done with it. You may get a message on your

phone saying that some inspector has been allocated for this case. 4 days later you'll get a message that the case has been closed. And the reason for that is that the entire department is

overloaded with cases. The third problem as Dr. Sapna also mentioned also mentioned the guy who has joined the police force you know if he really wanted to become a technologist he

probably would not have joined the force right I mean I'm not saying that he cannot become a technologist but that is not his moto that is not his career it does not give him that zest for life

right he wants to go to the field he wants to catch criminals he doesn't want to spend time learning a new technology and the technology is changing at such a rapid pace that he will have to learn a

new technology ology after every 1 two months and start using that technology. So if you look at the problem surrounding our police forces they are they seem to be unsurmountable. Right

now the solution to this what are what is the basic premise behind a crime. If you look at it every crime if it is not a white wolf attack it's a network crime. You talk about somebody stealing

your phone at the end of the day he has to sell that phone and make money. You talk about somebody stealing your wallet, you know, it's a network. Somebody, you know, you have all these

money laundering is a network. You have narcotic which is a network. These are all network crimes. How do you identify a network? How do you start building the patterns to

identify a network? And that is where AI can help. See, I'll take few examples. Bhartya Sahita has come out with a guideline that today if a person is arrested you need to do the forensic

image of his digital devices laptop and mobile phone because literally everything that we are our life is defined by our digital devices if I get access to your phone or laptop for maybe

1 hour I would be able to figure out 90% of what your life is and vice versa right so bharty sahita came out with a guideline that when you arrest someone you have to do an image clone his mobile

phone and laptop top and keep that data. Now that is huge volumes of data. Just to give you an example, you know, with income tax investigation units that we work with, when they go on a simple raid

on a single company, they get data in tune of 80 terabytes of data. How can you analyze 80 terabytes of data? And that is where AI plays a huge role in forensics analysis. So you dump all the

data onto an AI engine and let the AI start trying to find patterns within that data. Imagine the kind of patterns that you can identify and I'll give you a few examples some of the use cases

that we have done ourselves with revenue intelligence GST intelligence just using pattern recognition a very small AI model on the entire GST data of the country we were as per their own

estimates able to identify possible fraudulent GST transactions worth 5577 crores and this was just a 3 to four months effort so that is the role that AI can play in identifying patterns in

huge volumes of data and identifying these networks. So I think now I think I answered your question. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. No absolutely you know

thanks a lot. Thank you so much. Uh see the fundamentally uh you know doing the same activity it's like a one go if you have the same pattern if the a will help you to detect and then give you this

accuracy in terms of what went wrong and then how we can detect and then you know the prevented over there actually. So thank you sir. Thank you so much for joining. Um uh see from your rich

experience you know you you would have handled a lot of you know cyber cases and really just we love to hear from you uh in terms of the how the a can help you to hunt in terms of uh you know the

fraudisters or maybe in terms of the threads because uh now this other side the what people are using is a can be used to do the fraud right and just I'm looking on the both aspects like how you

have utilized or how you have a plan of in terms of using a component to detect or to hand the respective you know the fraudsters. Uh f first of all I will want to reframe

this question uh because you know being a council I'm not an investigator &gt;&gt; so I'm not here to detect uh there are times I'm in fact mostly I'm

representing the accused the condemned man you know because with all the presumption of innocence prove beyond reasonable doubt and all of that. So I would want to you know speak of an ideal

legal regime that I foresee with AI technology the policemen are there the judges are there all that is happening the accused is there the victim is there the complainant is there now I uh the

few points that I come to my mind first of all privacy is very important right to privacy it's a fundamental right recognized by the supreme court in Putaswami's case flows out of article

21. So privacy cannot be compromised first of all. Now as an exception to the fundamental right to privacy, one of the exceptions is uh crime investigation, crime prevention, terror prevention,

terror investigation and prosecution. So that's an exception. So first of all we must respect the rights of people the privacy of the people as an exception we must have uh enough technology law

enforcement to prevent uh criminality cyber criminality preventive prevention is better than cure and as my colleague said on the das it's next to impossible to investigate all crime that is

happening. So many people come to me and they say, you know, when a when a fraud is less than say five lakhs or 10 lakhs, I tell them just forget it.

Nothing will happen. Why? Why? Why should good money chase something which you will not get back? So one is crime prevention. At the level of crime prevention, I would say that people

themselves have to be cautious. First of all, be careful in your dealings. That's one. Now, an incident has happened. Then I would say from a victim's perspective,

what does the victim want? First of all, he wants a red wrestle. He wants his money back. That's one. And secondly, he wants the damn guy to be prosecuted. He wants that that guy who has committed

that crime on him and made his life miserable. He wants that man to go to jail. So effective prosecution, effective prosecution is where the police comes in, law enforcement comes

in. Now you know I hear or I have heard people saying that for example in the UK smalltime thefts up to say £10,000 no cognizance is taken. &gt;&gt; That means we can do more less than

10,000 &gt;&gt; because so so what do you do? What do you do? So then therefore the police has to investigate uh the crime properly. Prosecute the offender. That's the

another objective. Of course AI plays a role over there. AI plays a it's a double-edged weapon. AI will be used as a cyber crime tool also as a weapon also. And to counter it also

you can use AI both ways. So therefore I will want a legal regime where the correct accused is found and prosecuted. Now why I'm saying correct because the internet has layers of service

providers. It's very very difficult to pinpoint the originator of a particular fraud. So I will want you know the man who has committed the crime to be booked. And then last but not the least

where I come in the innocent man should not be implicated. You know we have we still I must say after 33 years at the bar and as a defense council I must say that we still have a very colonial

police force in the country. I'm not saying it. The Supreme Court has said it time and again. We still you know the whole police system is perhaps smiling and with a smirk that

the whole police system they they start working from a confession and they work backwards. So we need a we need a you know fairer system from the perspective of the accused also.

Fortunately we are a country where there's rule of law. Fortunately, we have independ we have an independent judiciary. Fortunately, we have the rights of the

man who is arrested. We have the victim also who is now being looked at with some sympathy in the criminal justice system. We are moving in the correct direction. But of course, systemic

problems are there. The number of policemen to the population, number of judges to the population, all that is there. Now you can't have you know a policeman protecting every Indian

citizens. So some criminality will obviously go unpunished but I hope that most of the criminality should not go unpunished and innocence should not be implicated and if they are then I am

there to look after the [laughter] thank you. Absolutely amazing sir very impactful input and that's what where we are bringing a sir I mean you may not have to have a proportional of

populations and police I mean we can reduce that actually and then from there we can you know add values amazing thank you so much for the great input uh so just coming I mean from lawyer to

police right [laughter] um so just I wanted to hear couple of stuff right when we debate in the cyber security you know side we see so that's like a national

threats I mean what are the a coming over there of course the valuation is there but however we we feel that is like a national threats since you know I have seen you like from the long time

you have handled in terms of the crime where the people the smuggling and then you know other cyber crime just went the physically now you are into the digital area also like in terms of the handling

all the a component and then how needs to be insured from you know the end to end standpoint Fine. So just really just I wanted to hear from you like a both of aspects from police to the you know in

terms of handling this AA like what are the prevention step where we can take it forward to prevent all the crimes. Love to hear your input sir because all youngsters are there I mean all all

young chaps right all zenzi I can see that like the entire life on you know mobile. So love to hear your insight. So uh when we were selected for the police you know the focus was completely

on swimming horse riding rifal AK-47 you know run 10 kilome it's a mornings physical and you know uh beat IPS or DYP or Sub inspector or constable at all level

anyone can enter you know uh he may be from humanities he can be from physics and mathematics and he can be a computer scientist as well. So 99%

uh policemen they are from the humanities or science background but this cyber crime is completely a different domain. Cyber foreigny is completely different domain. So what we

think by giving two three days training we can make them smart cyber smart. No, it's complete science. You will have to give at least 1 year, 2 year, 3 years rigorous training in cyber security

tools, cyber technology, cyber forensic tools and then this all big data platform and it's all uh you know technology. So for training uh police personnel which is not happening right

now you need at least 6 months rigorous course and only then you can train them unless and until police understand technology behind the crime you know I mean if for example suppose somebody is

committing crime through UPI so unless and until you know the structure of UPI how NP national payment corporation was what is the infra behind RBI any FT and RT yes

you cannot you know crack the case if some crime is happening through website if you don't know how the domain is purchased how the website is created how the payment gateway is integrated the

back end and how the criminals are using mule accounts and mu simology you cannot crack the case so that's why what is happening 99.99% police they are not well trained in

cyber domain they are not well and not only cyber technology they have to be the domain expert as well because if you want to investigate a case you should know the technology behind banking you

know how this ATM network and everything very technical &gt;&gt; so and that's why I always say that uh there has to be a clearcut a different IT cer in the police department

&gt;&gt; absolutely &gt;&gt; okay and only then we can solve otherwise it's very difficult for the police to crack this kind Of course the force is ready sir. [laughter]

No no wonderful. Um see in the current trend no if you want to hack or if you want to bring down those infrastructures I may not require to get into your laptop right. If I pull down the power

of your house if I pull down the power of your internet it's more than enough. So ultimately I want to disturb you right. I want to stop what you supposed to do that I can stop your water like

whatever the flows comes to your house you're going to take a bath. you cannot come to office. So there's a supply chain it is coming in the bigger way right as well as now if you wanted to

bring this ecosystems like I think most of the people you are aware right the entire power grid has been hacked people are talking about internet the power grid has been hacked and then it's like

a completely shutdown for this entire regions so that aspect now I'm finding all the mobile what is being used everyone hand knows up that is much more critical infrastructure for the country

because it's like a weapon right as it rightly mentions right to be forgotten like what they can tweet once it is done just you cannot take it back that's done it's like you know within your friends

within your parents and within other neighbors you can squirrel you can make a fight but after few days it will go off but the social media one command you leave it that's it forever it will be

there actually so with that aspects of I know that just you was a you know the foundation you know the member of in terms of drafting DBDB and data privacy and all things and So love to hear from

you like how because a need more data data privacy where we should not send the data. So love to hear from your perspective sir. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So when we talk maybe privacy is a

fundamental right. Therefore when the laws for the country particularly the DPDP act the digital personal data protection act which is which is which has already been

enacted which is getting into operationalization as of today. The whole aim is collect only what is really required. Don't overcolct be transparent.

uh store it only for the minimum period that is required for the business. If you are sharing it with anybody, there must be a reason and there must be a control.

&gt;&gt; But we say everything for Yes. Yes, sir. because we won't access the app, right? &gt;&gt; No. So, so, so in fact, as of today probably it's only I agree to the terms and conditions and that's it. But

tomorrow you will find you will get to know as to what data is being collected. Number one. Number two, in case maybe more is being collected or has been collected, you will have the

the rights to ask and confirm as to what data has actually been collected with whom it has been shared. And in case you are actually wanting that this data should no longer be processed further,

you will have the right to even get it erased. Lastly, for some reason or other because it's a cyber security issue. I mean it's a things can always go wrong. Breaches can always happen intentionally

unintentionally that it will be the liability of the organization who has collected processing this data to report a breach not only to the data protection board

which is coming up but to also to the individuals whose data has been impacted. So that means transparency, trust, accountability and possibility of financial fines which is all there in

the system. Amazing. Thank you sir. Thank you so much. And uh so just following to s you know the input u uh I want to hear from that responsible air right I mean how as you know war has

mentioned it's a double-edged sword really just I want to hear from you like how the responsible as a layman or as a technologist or maybe as a professional as a layman just how I can you know use

make use of this weapon very responsible way of course there's a lot of framework which is available but love to hear from you &gt;&gt; yeah very good question and yes

everybody wants to know key as a layman how we can take a prevention because it's a very very important part we all literate people actually you know come under this trap because we don't know we

always share the OTP like we use the public Wi-Fi and sometime we never know how to use the AI ethically and AI ethically it's a very very important part we are teaching cyber crime in the

colleges and schools but you ethical AI is still lacking. I feel like that the diploma degree and more awareness program can help a lot. There was a one share which was you know said by the

duchian So very important the rules and regulation. the rules and regulation and ethically we have to make such pathway so that the Genji can follow because if

we are not providing the framework definitely people will suffer and we are talking about Vixit Bharat right and Vixit Bharat and $5 trillion economy can be affected if we are not taking a step

ahead because digitally we are in power we are actually superpower but ethically yes most of the crimes taking place in India only you find 22,000 K rupees we have lost because of this crime and

every minute f 5005 crimes every minute every minute you know 55 crimes taking place so it's a very serious matter and this point of time government have to make certain rules and regulation

implementation should be very strict and the best part is that awareness and Yes, awareness, education and at the same time make the guideline for everyone and there has to be some two-way

verification and ethical aspects. That's it. That's it. I want to say &gt;&gt; awesome. Thanks Lam. &gt;&gt; Thank you.

&gt;&gt; See uh from where she left out in terms of the awareness play very significant role, right? uh but even though just as a layman how I can make awareness is so but however if you take this deep fake

and then in terms of the voice cloning even though you are you cannot make out like uh it's it's a real or it's a fake right and what are the techniques maybe as a layman just I can you know give it

in terms of just this are the video these are the glimpses it comes this a fake or this is a real right and because the voice is already it's everywhere right if this voice is there with that

they they can clone whatever they want to do it and if you have my photo and then my mannerism just all things also can be cloned and that can be give it over there right so that aspect as a

layman really just I want to understand like what are the key stuff you know they should look in terms of the deep fake as well as a wise cloning &gt;&gt; so see deep fake is going to become a

national security issue very soon maybe as soon as the 2029 elections imagine it's so easy to create a video I mean frankly if you are in hostile country. It's so easy to create a video of maybe

a a deep fake video of a cow getting slaughtered and the head of the cow in front of a temple or a pig getting slaughtered and the head of a pig in front of a mosque. It will lead to

riots. In specific states in the country, it will lead to diets. That's how that has an impact on your economy. And with social media, it's very easy. You know, it actually cost as little as

and I have seen it live. It actually cost as little as two and a half lakh rupees to make a Twitter trend the sun rises in the west go viral. So there was a time there were where the top three

hashtags in Twitter it was the sun rises in the west right. So you can create a deep fake video, make it go viral on social media. Half of our generation Z is on social media, more than half. They

will look at it and they will believe that this is the truth. Right? So this is how big a problem defect has become. And another challenge with that is as of now and I've evaluated multiple AI

models. There is not a single AI model which can detect a really good deep fake generated video and tell you that it's a fake video. So the only thing that we can as responsible citizens do when you

see something on social media or when somebody gives you a call you have to do the verification of that through multiple other sources. You know if you see something on social media if it is

actually genuine it would have been covered by some newspaper media vernacular or mainstream in the country. Right? So check it out. Check out search engines. If you receive a call from

someone who you think is your brother, sister or whoever, you know, do a cross check. call them back and figure out whether that is you know whether they are the same people or not. These are

basic checks that you can do. Technology as of now to detect deep fake is lagging behind. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Now of course that's a lot of technologies and then other sense also

keep coming and with this really I want to hear from you. um [snorts] earlier if you want to do hijack like I may not require to do myself I can hire a team and they can go and execute report it

it's done right so that aspect so now this ramping up you may not require to be part of any crime but you can hire the professionals they come and do the work execute they go away so it's a

cyber crime as a service which came into the pictures you can paying and know where you get involved and they also know where connected to the counterpart whom you wanted to make a attack on

that. So from the legal standpoint really just I wanted to see as a you know cyber crime services what are the preventions or have you come across any other cases like that has been you know

executed from end to end and who is liable whether it is who has executed or who has you know hired the people. So love to hear from you. Okay.

Uh we we have the law in place. In fact, the law the entire law of criminal conspiracy, you know, has been there since Lord Macaulay's Indian Penal Code of 1860

that if uh if people come together and they agree upon to commit a crime tacitly, explicitly, implicitly they are liable. uh so the liability mechanism is there in place and we have a lot of law

that has developed the law has gone so far in fact if you see the evidence act uh the there's a very interesting illustration that if a place was to be bombed

and there were there was a conspiracy between A B C D and E so it is not necessary for law to prove the agreement of criminality ity between all the five. So if A is organizing the

fund somewhere in the world, B is organizing the weapon or the bomb or the making. So all by their actions, you can prove a criminal conspiracy. So the law is there in place. Now if we apply it to

AI, if we if I apply it to the uh to the internet, the problem that arises the the experience that we have seen, of course I we derive the benefit of all that all the confusion from a defense

perspective. The problem is how to attribute certain acts to individuals, how to identify them. For example, you know, if you have an AI, if you create something, you know, why have why have

five people uh why hire five people? Why not create a drone or create something that that is not attributable to me? I have to only create it and put it into the internet and that that that drone or

that mechanism itself is committing a crime. So the attribution of an act to an individual is getting more and more complex. You know in the physical world you could identify people whereas in the

world of the internet AI cyber world you can't identify people and then we have problems of jurisdiction collection of evidence but the law is in place now. Now the law enforcement agencies have to

be smart enough you know to [clears throat] identify uh these hiring of cyber criminals because the best way to catch them is through the money trail. Money trail has become a very

effective means of tracking cyber criminality laundering etc etc. So there are see law also catches up with crime. It's the law is not you know not law is not so weak

&gt;&gt; it catches up with criminality. Yeah, criminals is helping to develop a law right one extent. [laughter] In fact, if they are not there, I mean we don't develop on that aspect, right?

Just maybe one, you know, 10 seconds follow-up questions are like since all young chaps are there sometime we think like if you do the crime from India it's like a straight away it comes and hit on

that right but if you do VPN to the some other country from there if you launch the people will think it may not come to our responsibility. So love to hear your you know 30 seconds of input sir

&gt;&gt; of course this proxy criminal &gt;&gt; because cross borders and interpol also come into the pictures right &gt;&gt; they do come into the picture but but you know it's very difficult to

prosecute offenders at that level you know what we what we hear what we read in the papers that so and so person is going to be extradited to India that's only a tip of the iceberg you know

somebody some young lawyer very interesting Interestingly he narrated to me that you know why are these you know nirv Modi and why are these few people being targeted you know because they

have they have defrauded the bank. What about those people who have defrauded private individuals private lenders and they have run away from the country. So these are you know problems. Extradition

is a problem. Collection of evidence is a problem. Sovereignity of a nation is a problem. So I guess you know mutual treaties amongst nations where you cooperate with one another interpol is

there but but interpol cannot really take care of all these problems. So we need to we need to keep evolving you know from a law enforcement perspective. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Absolutely. Thank you sir.

Thank you so much. And uh uh it's maybe I may take one more minute just 10 seconds of your input for takeaway for uh you know the and all the people just each one just I want to hear from 10

seconds just one takeaway for them like what they have to do and don't in terms of uh cyber crime as well as with the AIE &gt;&gt; for this I think uh government will have

to create massive awareness compare campaign among the public so that they could know how the criminals are operating what what are their mods appreny And secondly, government will

have to put much more emphasis on capacity building not only in police but in judiciary and prosecutors as well. And they will have to provide resource as well. I mean cyber lab advanced tools

technology you know and they will have to put much more emphasis in R&amp;D as well. R&amp;D regarding you know for example the current threat is defect. So we must focus on defect detection technology. So

do we have no as tarun told so no right now no there the best of the tools available that can give you only 80% accuracy not 100%. So it cannot be admissible in court of law and that's

why I think these are the things if government is focusing then definitely we will be able to uh control the cyber crimes. Yeah, I would just like to mention it's

not just about cyber frauds. It's also about so many illegalities which do happen in in the cyber world and we'll also like to say prevention is the best way understand greed. This is a normal

human p I mean behavior. So something which is giving you too much of money or or maybe exploiting your greed, exploiting your fears, exploiting your emotions

which is what we have to I mean which is what we need to overcome in the age of AI seeing is not believing. Listening or maybe hearing from your known sources may also not be truth. So, so maybe act

responsibly before what we say is a zero trust architecture. &gt;&gt; Only one line. Stay alert. Once again, I'm repeating. Stay alert. Stay aware. Stay secure. These are the three

fundamental aspects you should keep in mind. Definitely you can save yourself and your family members. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thanks Rau. Yeah. I I I think I [clears throat] have a recommendation

for the government not for the citizens. I I think the government of a country we have to realize that intelligence has to become privatized. It has already become so in US. In US you do not have uh you

know the intelligence is corrected by private individuals working in conjunction with the government and the operations are in hands of the law enforcement agency. India will have to

realize like the income tax departments of the country they have already done that they are working with private entities to gather intelligence and they are only involved in the operations. I

think all aspects of the government will have to follow suit. &gt;&gt; Yeah, we all work work together. We'll make that &gt;&gt; u we need a deterrent law to check cyber

criminality. Uh secondly, no crime should go unpunished. And thirdly, we should not be obsessed with uh you know catching hold of the criminal. Uh we must protect

the rights of the innocent man, the accused also. This the system has to be balanced. It cannot be a one-way street. &gt;&gt; Awesome. Amazing. And you know it's a wonderful conversation. We can give a

great applause to the entire leadership and of course a is a double swad right. how you handle is a matter actually. So that's way we can handle with a more responsible and more accountability to

ensure that things are taken care with you know the positive note. Thanks a lot. Thank you so much and have a wonderful day ahead. Thanks a lot gentlemen.
