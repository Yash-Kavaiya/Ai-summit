## 📝 Transcript

My apologies Rajiv it is IV we know that uh 27 years of experience he's executive uh director in bank of India sits on board of STCI sits on board of star dai great experience warm welcome Rajiv um

and you see Dr. Aikar here uh Aik he was the one who started who actually wrote the first AI strategy for India when he was with Niti Aayog he's a former data and analytics head for NITI Aayog

currently associated with uh with ISB warm welcome once again a finally my colleague my friend Dubo Kosh uh he leads a data and AI for a great consulting firm productivity which I am

also part of I am part of productivity India my name is Sachin Kyle I lead productivity in India look forward So uh it's a very interesting panel uh and a great session but the session's

topic is it's AI for economic growth and social good. So what I'm going to do is I'll make it a little bit of a lightning round for first one or two minutes to each of the panelist. I will request you

know if India has to reach the dream of Vixit Bharat by 2047 is what we say hopefully we make it to 2040 AI will play a very very important role. We all agree. But we also know that people who

are sitting here are only a fraction of what India is represented for India's economic growth and social good. If each one of you have to pick one sector just one sector or one area

then you have to tell us what will it take for India to reach that vixit bhara dream of each one of us. So let me start with Mohit first. Go ahead. &gt;&gt; Uh thank you. So I think in my view um

I'll actually name two sectors agriculture and manufacturing. Uh the Mahindra group we play a large part in tractors and farm machinery. For us to be a vixit bharat food sufficiency uh

for feeding with high nutrition a growing population and a young population uh we have to be self-sufficient in all the ways and I think there's a big AI unlock possible

and increase the yield of the land. If you look at it, India is still agrarian economy with 50% people living in rural and semi-urban India. And I think we can do a lot there. And the good point is

that there lots of data sets available or can be made available to bring together weather data, soil data, crop data, fertilizer data, crop disease data, farmer data, land data together.

Um I think there is some start in that but a lot more can be done. So to my that's a big one. And then secondly of course manufacturing make in India for India make in India for the world. Uh we

are large uh automakers making all kind of passenger cars, electrics, commercial etc. And there is a good opportunity to to scale up in many ways and AI again has a big big use case there in terms of

quality, agility, supply chain, u safety, many other things which we can talk about later. But to me those are two sectors we have to double up and there's a great great real opportunity

where AI is now feasible viable desirable affordable which 10 years I was still doing the same role maybe 10 years ago it wasn't either either of those four it was desirable but neither

viable nor feasible nor affordable now it's all and and hence the time is now and and we should do it it's India's opportunity in all the ways &gt;&gt; thank you Mohit let me go to Rajiv Rajiv

what are your thoughts and I know it has to be banking Right. There can't be any other sector for you. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Uh I have to be biased towards banking.

But then as Mohit rightly mentioned 65% of my population is in rural India, rural or semi- urban and same is case with my number of branches there. So 65% branches are been in that area. 50% of

45 to 50% population comes from that part of the country. 18% of the GDP comes from that part of the area. So that sector is the sector which is one going to be there. and banking being the

services sector that also is the second sector which we know with whatever innovative technologies which mo just mentioned whether it's a data imaging soil reports whether it's a land records

all these been doing that such type of data been made available to us I think banking becomes much more easier to reach to the last mile because until unless we change the life of those

people and bring them into the overall connect of the ecosystem the financial ecosystem we cannot achieve the dream of vixed bharat so vixit bharat I always say India The country is divided into

two parts India and Bhat. Now we have to address that Bhat part very aggressively to ensure that we are reaching that 2047 goal of fixing BAT. Thank you Rajiv and this is digital wide has to really come

down and very well said. So we have covered agree we have covered manufacturing and banking and for us to grow education and skilling is important but still I will ask a what is your view

what is one sector or area which according to you will make a huge difference for economic growth and social good. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. So education is is definitely

for sure but I also like to touch upon governance which which impacts the lives of the citizens and something that governments can use on their own. Today we see uh the urban India is growing a

lot and that means there are cities which are coming up. Now there are a lot of data that has been generated from the cities and and AI and using AI on this can really help in managing this the

cities more efficiently. It can be as simple as whether the garbage cans are being picked up regularly. AI can monitor that and and give some messages that something has is not pending.

Automated monitoring of the city, the roads, the footpath, whether there are encroachments happening over there. A very common use case that all of you would have heard is the automated

identification of uh of complaints on the crossing signals on the traffic signals like what sort of traffic violations are happening. So there are many cities which are already

implemented that. So chalance you do not need uh a a person to to go and uh identify like a policeman you can always use the CCTV cameras and identify what sort of violations are happening there.

So there's a lot of areas and I think this this really impacts a lot of the citizens and also then coming back to uh to education which is a very important theme that we look into and in education

we have to look into understanding of data and AI from secondary level school level to say the bachelor's master level because at different levels you are introducing the subject at various

levels of complexity. So if you have to build if you are a user you understand it at school level or at a college level where you can use it on application level then going on to improving at at a

higher level. So that it's a range of areas where you can apply it. So I will bet on governance because it impacts people's life and education because it helps in growing our base from there.

&gt;&gt; Thank thank you a uh Dr. Ry. You see I I [clears throat] think I must appreciate you ask me the last now uh world is AI I feel that for the vix bat don't forget I for the sake of a that's

my first point I want to say number one &gt;&gt; you explain this to us &gt;&gt; no you need intelligence that you get to artificial intelligence that's the point I'm trying to say that someone said

skilling and capacity that's that's but largely you see the uh I We must look at artificial intelligence as a tool for enhancing your productivity and efficiency. not look as

a jargon or anywhere we try to do that for a when we talk about a vixay barat we are looking for a comprehensive growth overall in all sectors all areas in the country there for all sectors of

people that's what we are looking into that sector there so I think we need to look at the application of AI and which include development of AI in a comprehensive manner there I mean we

have to focus on the area which enhances the productivity and efficiency of these different sector and that includes governance and skiing and all kind of areas there because today what we see we

all have been using the AI for I I think almost couple of years ago through the part the mobile phones area and their email we are using it so the more applications more things are there when

you got into the professional area where it touches everyone's social life it touches the core enhances the productive efficiency and that's what I have to say that use AI

for a comprehensive vixit bat rather than looking at different sector and there that and that is where we need to bring a balance between A and I also we have to bring a balance between AI we

can we have to use AI but bringing balance between AI that's what I I would say &gt;&gt; no thank you so much very well said I'll still sneak in one for thou doub what is

your uh take on that? I think uh they have covered mostly all the sectors right. I still believe that there is one more sector which is the healthcare sector where we will see a lot of usage

of AI and the healthcare sector we have to look at in two aspects right one is the drug diagnostics the drug discovery the diagnostic of uh diseases but also the rural outreach AI

will help to again reach to the last mile right you will be able to use conversational AI where doctors can't reach for them to have have a conversation understand or do a

preliminary analysis of the diseases. So I believe healthcare is another sector we will see a lot of usage of AI within India again to bridge the gap between India and bhat.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you. With these opening remarks uh you know let me go down deep now and Mohit you come from a very diversified group from tech. I saw there was a big tech mandra over there. Uh

auto, farm, finance, you name it, you are into those group. Uh but you also touched about tagri and as I talk about that you know if I may ask this group is there anyone in this sitting in this

room who's actually driving uh deriving farm income? &gt;&gt; No farmers in the room. &gt;&gt; No farmers in the room. Right. But everybody eats food.

&gt;&gt; Everybody eats food. Huh? &gt;&gt; Oh, there is a &gt;&gt; There is one. &gt;&gt; There is a farmer there. &gt;&gt; There is a farmer.

&gt;&gt; Family. &gt;&gt; Your family is You are not You are still working somewhere. But thank you so much. Huh? Claps for him. Great. Thank you. But the thing is 55% of India India

is still far farm country. I mean India lives in villages and what will do India good? Welfare for all, happiness for all. My Sanskrit is not good but that's what he

says in Sanskrit as well. &gt;&gt; So tell us Muh how will AI be a enabler for our farmers. &gt;&gt; So I think um there are three unlocks and some of these are happening and some

of these will happen. uh one is around multimodal AI right which is voice video data text chat all of that together it's taking shape but not fully and what we are seeing AI now is more conversational

because genai made that famous or some artificial generation of content to make a make a photo etc creativity but not that I'm saying a true multimodal AI that will that will open up many things

people who don't necessarily write any language um and they're on the field, they can actually use AI. I think we made some early attempts. We have a app called

Nidan where any farmer can quickly open their camera and show the disease on the crop and it'll tell you what disease it is and what pesticide or organic chemical what to use, what not to use

etc. &gt;&gt; So tell a little bit more in front of the camera what is the name of this app? &gt;&gt; Nidan Nidan. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay. That's by Mahindra Group or

Yes, it is. &gt;&gt; Excellent. Excellent. Also there's old platform called Krishi which is again digital agriculture which is a platform we have taken up for farming. We have

launched apps for sugarcane farmers using satellite data advising them when to harvest the crop. It's very difficult unless you know by gut field. It's very difficult what order to harvest a crop

of let's say 5 acre of sugar cane. The sugar cane farmer gets paid based on the quality of sugar in the sugar cane. So if I were able to micro grid using a satellite data and I can tell him that

you harvest A1 first, B7 second, Z7 next and go and keep selling it day by day to the Monday, you'll get the best cost rate. So around 100,000 acres of sugarcane farming is under that crop

harvesting pattern. Similarly, Chile farmers 21% better uh produce in quality in Telangana etc. So these are AI models which are helping get more but these are multiodel. That's what I was trying to

get to that that's one unlock. Second is multilingual &gt;&gt; and that's where you saw the tech mahindra stall that we're working on dialects of Hindi and local languages so

that it's not based on interpret interpretation. Of course, Dhni which has been sponsored by the government has worked very well. Microsoft many other people are doing a lot of work in that

space but can you go down to dialect level and you know make models which can work in all languages. So multilingual third is smart variables where can I don't need to necessarily use the phone.

How else can I use AI? I think all this will happen in the next three four five years and we're making early bets on this and this will unlock much much bigger in the life of and that's where

Duo was talking about could be education could be healthcare all of that I'm only talking about agree of course manufacturing safe cars making safer all that is part of it where our cars are

safer than they were ever before um and that's because of AI because a car breaks a lot before the human being is detected what's going to happen so &gt;&gt; when is Bahindra making a self-driving

car in India. &gt;&gt; You don't need to. Uh the idea is the idea is not to replace a driver, right? Unlike the western market where you want to sleep on the back street seat or you

don't want to go drop your child to the school. We want to go drop child to the school. &gt;&gt; I like that. &gt;&gt; The autonomy for us is safety, right?

Can I can I see that India becomes a zero accident country? It's not so right. If you look at it, thousands of people are yet on the road driving, you know, dying. So for us autonomy is

safety and that's all. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; That's very well said. Thank you. Thank you so much. So Dr. Ry this time I'll not take you last this because it's

important. See as as AI uh today we want to have a sovereign AI but it is only few months back we beat in Pakistan left right center in the operation Synindur. And what we hear is it is no more land,

air and water when we are going to fight wars. It is going to happen in many which ways we are going to fight it. Right? So as AI is taking its shape. What are the biggest cyber gaps which as

a country we should be keeping in mind. You know I give you a very one example. I hope you give me two minutes there. All heard about &gt;&gt; more on this one. This is more deep. You

please go ahead. &gt;&gt; Huh. I we have a uh the UK Russia Ukraine war has been going for it right from 1922. Okay. Many of you won't have noticed it when

the Cremia was annexed in 2014. Cremia Cremia was annexed by the Russia in 2014. There the tensions before that had started building between Ukraine and the

Russians. They had started building the things there. Ultimately Ukraine were part of the Russia and the lot of Russians lot of cultural values are same there. No they planned everything they

the the entire data about the Ukraine was moved out to either Europe or America. I I not go drill down more than that passed on over there because it was well thought that

Russians have a better uh penetration kind of a capability. You see Russians doesn't have a beta computer science. They don't have a computer science as a as a subject there. No, they have a

mathematics there. They teach computer science as a part as a mathematics there. They're so strong they do assembly kind of a language. All good old assembler there which used to be

there taking I mean two mega 2 megabit code they can thus compress it in a 20k kilobit kilobyte kind of a scenario they can do that. So it was well thought that Russians had some good technology there,

good understanding mathematics. So they started shifting the entire data from Ukraine to there and they amended that time GDPR was going on. They amended the entire data. Europe has a EU 29

directive to shifted the amended that directive for the Ukraine and they brought the data. And if you all also recall if my friends here or who are have some that

historical background [cough and clears throat] the Chinese and Russians started attacking the ozour left and right. Okay. The Chinese uh they infiltrated

into the Microsoft Windows in a Azour platform there. Now everyone uses the MS office there word processing everybody uses. So if you are able to penetrate into the world office you are able to

get into the entire system they started why because they knew that entire data is moved out. So the in a when you get to the physical kind of a war the cyber I mean comes before getting to the

physical war that scenario is there that part of is there I give you second scenario okay in the recent Iranian kind of a whatever we have seen about a month ago kind of a scenario

I was to go to Iran on 10th of uh January and I was to return on 14 Last moment the visit was postponed. Ambassador said no. How they banned the entire they uh cut

off the entire internet. They cut off the entire flights or airports were how did the photographs how the everything was being monitored. Starlink the Starling terminals were very small. They

smuggled into the country and they installed here and there. Everything was being shooted up. So technology is is now become so important in the entire scenario of the uh wars there or entire

geopolitical scenario. Look at the semiconductor. Okay. World knows that three nanometer technology is being produced by Americans and you need that kind of a technology for the artificial

intelligence from doing the large they produced it and the Americans have a complete control on that scenario. Now looking at the Taiwanese takeover which they expect 28 China will do. God knows

I'm only saying the public public. They took TSMC to Arizona. They took Samsung to Arizona. They build up the plant so that in case something happens they are not able to do and Chinese are

more interested in the Taiwan not because of Taiwan a small island there because of the TSNC Taiwanese semiconductor manufacturing company and that is the if China you called the

world manufacturing country I mean like we have a Chennai is the is the India's capital of the manufacturing China is the world manufacturing city there country there Taiwan One is the

semiconductor foundry of the world. &gt;&gt; That is the what is they say they talked about. Of course there are three four companies are there. So in this entire kind of a scenario tech is playing a big

role. You talk about the operations. Okay. Now gone are the days when the missile chase you with the heat map. Gone are the days. Today the technologies have been developed. I mean

they lock the radar locks it and picks up your GPS. Okay. then they start following through the GPS and together with the GPS they follow the heat map. So it's a unique combination. So today

what we are talking about when we talk about any sector whether uh the banking or you talk manufacturing or you talk health or you talk about any other thing agriculture you would say tech first

technoeconomical technolal techno health that kind of scenario you talk about so the technical part the technology part may be very small but then it drives the efficiency and productivity of the

system there that's what technology there so it has become a very very important aspect in this entire scenario of economic scenario and that's why I said it in the beginning when you said

one minute remark we need to look at what is necessary for [snorts] the I mean if entertainment is going up that is one sector it which leads to me the vixid bar sure

&gt;&gt; okay but then that is not the entire vix so we need to look at what priority areas we need to [clears throat] look at it part of it there so I think tech is a important aspect ect in the today

geopolitical aspect. &gt;&gt; No, thank you and today geopolitical is definitely very very key. Thank you so much for your work. So uh Rajiv, I'll turn to you and uh Dr. S made a very

pertinent remark about uh you know when it comes to banking uh and clearly for economic good uh financial inclusion is very important. Uh so there are two questions. How do you think AI is

helping us in the whole financial inclusion journey and second also part B is uh we all hear about keep reading in the newspaper about the digital arrest all these money being transferred and

especially to the vulnerable uh population and not only to vulnerable even to smart educated people like us it has all happened in all the households. So what is banking industry uh taking

help of this AI to prevent that? I think they are taking help of AI to attack us individually. What is AI banking industry doing using AI to prevent that? So two questions. Yeah.

&gt;&gt; Uh two questions. Let me answer one by one. &gt;&gt; One is a business part of it or you say how do banking reaches to the last mile to the farmers or whatever we are

calling. Now if anybody in the room sitting here if I ask if you want to approach a bank what do you understand? What do you think what what is going to happen? Bank is going to ask you with

sets of documents generally a PAN card then IT returns then lot of documents. Civil score is one of the documents number which all of us have remembered apart from our mobile numbers. All of us

know what is our civil code score now and but look at the places where new to credit a farmer or a person or a person who is coming from a village who has never availed a credit. How do I assess

it? So the AI is helping me a tool which helps me to go from this document uh lending which was earlier there to a database driven lending. Now I know I have lot of data there. I I can there

was talk about the farmers been there where he said about the farmers if you show the crop and what type of fungal attack or bacterial attack has happened and then they can provide medicine.

Similarly, imagine a farmer if he has to take a loan in a bank, a KCC loan or any small loan. How many rounds of to the bank he has to make. Now to make that life simple, I have a satellite data

which can tell me the image to the imagery, what type of crop has been drawn, what's the cropping pattern, what crop is there, what is the life cycle of the crop, how is the what were the last

three crops which are drawn here, how much is he able to sell it in the market. With those types of data available then whether the land ownership is his or not it is it

somebody's else land and standing on the field the farmer within zifi can take a loan in fact we sanction a loan in matter of minutes where the farmer doesn't need to visit any branch

&gt;&gt; are you able to give sanction loan to farmers within minutes &gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; because we know sal people you are doing all the civil score it is fine

&gt;&gt; so here there's no civil score required there's a different score cash flow based lending has been taken care &gt;&gt; got Okay, &gt;&gt; there is a person who in the sea high

sea a fisherman he's there going to the boat does he have a time to come to a bank branch and take a loan for his whatever catch is but we know what is a catch he's been selling how much is and

we have lot of transactional data which is been sourced to us so the amount of data which is flowing across the systems is huge on a daily basis if I talk about my bank own bank of India we handle

around three and a half crores to four crores data transactions per day now these are the volume of transactions which are there it's all data which is there. Now with this set of datas, if I

want to do a reach out to my end customer, it becomes very easy. If I use these tools, humanly it is not possible. But as Riser very rightly mentioned, we have to remember both intelligence with

artificial intelligence. We have all the intelligence, then we use this artificial intelligence. The man behind the machine takes a the models are built in the right place and risk models are

also put into place so that the system is not fooled off. Then we are able to take care of it. So lending reaching out to the customer makes very easy you understand what the jam trinity has done

to the entire country how people have come into the bank formal sector of lending had the jam trinity not been there Jandan Aadhar and mobile we would not have been there and with these also

came the ease of KYC now today we every bank you need to do a KYC I have Aadhaar data I have a today you walk into any airport you're using dig digiatra just showing your face a face recognition

system the banks are using these types of systems where I say alternate authentic measures not the only OTP or not the only PIN which I'm I can use those systems also to validate that and

that is where I use artificial intelligence but then coming to your second part of the question the frauds the risk which is associated with it can this be there where a video of a person

be shown to a camera and then taken a loan and applied for it no I need to have a inbuilt systems which can do then I mentioned around 4 crores of transactions happening on a daily basis

over a system. Now if that transaction particularly I get few milliseconds to approve a transaction. Now if I'm not able to validate the customer authenticate the customer and

authenticate the transaction during this few milliseconds the money can flow out from my system to anywhere and then the fraud can happen in the best of the persons know. So I need to put in real

time monitoring systems which are there then that's where the artificial intelligence come. We have EFRMS solutions which takes care of this data analyze the data know the behavioral

pattern of the customer whether the customer is in a pattern of doing this type of transactions or not and then control it and then throw alerts. There are mule accounts which we hear lot of

things. The accounts belonging to a certain place where he's not authorized to do that much of volume of transaction but still the account is rented. We lot of accounts have been rented out. Now

this these are mule accounts which will be used to siphon off the money from one part of the account to one part of the world to another part of the world. Now the systems are there, AI models are

there which help us to learn to the find out these accounts freeze them at the go. There's a integration which happens. I4C is one of the body of the government of India which integrates the banks the

regulator the policing agency the DOT all these are coming together to see that we are able to capture and restrict the losses which are going to happen. If I put in some data almost around 5,800

crores of amount was freezed or blocked or saved. I say I do not know cannot say how much has gone away but at least I can say that this much was saved but at least all of us every day we hear do not

share your OTP do not share your numbers do not click on unauthorized links but then the security aspects sir has been the core of our country he will agree to my statement the security of any system

is strongest as the weakest link and the weakest link in our areas we know whom we are dealing with he again we a farmer who who doesn't know anything on what cyber security is concerned and if he

clicks on something you are vulnerable to he mentioned Microsoft all of us use Microsoft or some some system some apps which have been downloaded which has your app also the banking app can be

infected through say and we can get infected today with implementation of so much of uh IT and other tools we have lot of vendor systems into place these vendors come across their systems also

are vulnerable now if I'm as strong as my vendor system. I cannot be saying that I have fortified my wall now I'm sitting very safe. So that's where the entire cyber security framework has to

take place. We need to know each one of us has to play the role. It is not that only the one who is providing the system has to play the role. Everyone has to play but then

&gt;&gt; at the end of the day the mark is AI is going to help all of us to handle it effectively provided we use these tools effectively. &gt;&gt; Perfect. Thank you. thing I'll come to

you Dr. I asking this questions but uh briefly if you can shell do you agree with what Rajiv said? &gt;&gt; Oh I 100% agree I 100% agree &gt;&gt; but what is government doing around that

also &gt;&gt; the government you see the government has done a lot in this area uh but I'll tell you the I mean uh AI we did we did started doing the AI I I was dealing

with the KBCS project in 19 1988. What is KB just for the &gt;&gt; so the uh government has done a lot framework are being uh getting ready the awareness has been created lot you know

in the country there are today about 14 54 kind of a startup they are dealing with the different aspects of the AI where almost 10% of the AI system in the world there that's what their systems

are there the country is very clear that we have to focus towards the I mean a a kind of a AGI kind of a focus we need to do. We have a we have certain weaknesses we have a gaps in terms of making system

tools there. So that focus that strategy is very clear in the country that we'll focus toward the application part of it and all the area which panel has talked about they the entire cyber security

policy is under modification &gt;&gt; to include the AI aspect part also there that's what uh this part is there so I think the government has done a lot but this is a dynamic area the challenges

comes up the government is also looking into this aspect there the very fact this whole conference conference has been arranged. Various aspects are being discussed that will certainly help the

government in framing out modifying those frameworks which are needed for us to do. &gt;&gt; Also heard Abishek talk about thank you so much. Uh Aik will move to you. uh you

spoke about uh you know uh the whole governance side of it but I would also still like to ask uh unless until and in the previous panel uh Amitav spoke about that we should start educating our

children about AI from class three okay that's not even when physics get started or chemistry physics chemistry maths is all it's one science right but he wants AI to start from class three so what do

you think we as a country need to do to skill our people uh skill our kids right from that that is one and second is what about professionals here not only sitting here but also around the country

&gt;&gt; no that's that's a very interesting uh question Sajin and um we have to understand that AI is something that we have to upskill ourselves on and that understanding is required so when when

we look into the education system as a whole I think particularly till uh class 12 until college level is heavily based on rot learning. Uh the critical thinking part is missing out in in many

of the cases. So, so, so when you are looking at into the education system as a whole, can the [snorts] student understand that AI is a tool available to them which can do some part of the

root learning for you? And those are things that might not be required. Like if you if you ask me today, I have done all the mathematics, addition and subtraction and division when I was a

kid. But do I do it on paper? today I don't do it because I know I have a tool available to me which is more accurate and which is more reliable at and and can be used all the time. So any

calculation that has to be done maybe beyond three or four digits are always done on a calculator. I think AI will will become our tool and that is where we are going through that phase of of

change where we are moving from say AI as a concept to AI coming in movies like say we saw a lot of references to AI and and people doing robotic stuff to something that we use as a tool and and

how can it help you in your education system. So, so when we when I look at it from from ISB system like uh I've been there for about more than six years now the uh the questions that we used to put

in in the exams were very were very different because it was more on based on what you can remember now you know the person will use a large language model or a GPT to analyze and then use

it. So on top of that how do you make the person think critically to do do that. So I think that is the part that they are evolving in and I think everyone is using. So we are not telling

students not to use uh use any of the large language models or any of the AI tools. We know that they will use it but how can their output become better. So instead of that previously if I tell

them in a business school scenario that you memorize something and and produce now [snorts] we can tell them you can create a complete business plan. We we give you certain elements of a business

and based on that how can you come up with a business plan look into the pros and cons look into which market it can be successful which market it will not be successful. So the the person

actually is getting much more deeper into those things. So I think as you see as um as technology improves we will go on to higher productivity levels and that is improving the productivity level

of the students or professionals will increase in the time. So if you're not upskilling yourself then that becomes a challenge. So but upskilling becomes very important. So that we have to go

from that uh that phase that previously whatever we learn till college is our learning rest of the next 40 years is the life of application. I think that phase has gone and we have to get our

mindset changed that we have to get into a continuous learning mode. If you are happy to adopt that then this is is very fine as a tool. &gt;&gt; So mit I also ask because you have a

university as well Mahindra University and I know you run a beautiful school by the name Muki Mahindra WC a great school as well and then you also have tech Mahindra hundreds and thousands of

people over there. How are you skilling your people on AI? uh lots of lots of it is based on maths. I think he's he spoke about the Russian model not not that it's inspired by the Russian model but

lots on sciences and maths at the basic level. So at Muki world school as well as the Mahindra University lots of uh courses on physics and then we partner very closely with Nvidia, Google,

Microsoft in putting labs there so that infrastructure is available for research then the business ideas are sourced from the rest of the main group. So whether you're trying to make our holiday homes

more joyful or our tractors more intelligent or cars more safer or logistics more timely or you know solar panel and renewable energy uh better in terms of power generation this across

the industry is 19 companies we have we source the problems which are deep and difficult to solve and then work with the students whether they are at undergrad level, grad level or PhD uh

and working with the partners like Nvidia etc which have the infrastructure available try and solve those problems and some of them can become industrial solutions. So that's how we're trying to

do it. I think lots of uh so knowledge is almost free. Applying it is where the art and sciences right everybody has access to an expert. Most people see it's very very interesting that 30 years

ago maybe when I when I needed to learn it is very costly. I had a lot of time right now knowledge is free. I I need to have time. So we need to figure out people how they use their time and often

time people are using most of their time and watching entertainment which is good for the entertainment industry but not necessarily people are learning. So I agree with what you're saying that you

know it is a very democratic force where MSME and SME have access to the best experts available through deep research etc in the AI model right you don't need to necessarily know somebody who knows

in whatever you're doing whatever you're making so products and services uh anybody if you are entrepreneurally inclined anybody can start likely a business has a better chance of success

versus how it was earlier who you had to hire the best of the CA the best best tax consultant the best expert all of that is now available So you need to figure out how to apply it. So applying

AI is where and that's why prompt engineering many other things people talk about that's where it is. It's not it's not the knowledge everybody has on tap knowledge. How do you apply it? So

focus has to shift there. Schools have to teach that. I don't know about class 3 um on who said it why but uh I think sixth onwards or 10th onwards applying AI is where it has to be. Uh so to me I

think that's what the and that's what we're doing in our um educational. Thank you Mo. Thank you. Yes. Yes. Dr. Ry. &gt;&gt; No. No. I see I I will slightly differ with the that proposition that we start

teaching. See look at it. Today India became a leading country of ITBO kind of a scenario. 35 38% market is with us world market. How did we get it? Because good old days time the English was

adopted as a language. We started learning as a language that is helping us. Today the structure is there. You go to the third standard, fourth standard, you ask them to remember the table and

do the multiple calculations there. They start looking at calculator and start doing 3 is to 9 watt and 4 is to 4 what that kind of scenario. So I think at that age we should not forget the

learning mathematics learning basic mathematics learning there. So when we talk about the AI education it's a larger jarens we are using. I think we should not sway away that's why in the

first said we should know what to do what not to do that is very important to do that we should not take away kill the ability of a child for a natural learning process and that's why I said

AI is more important than a that's what I said what AI education comes up the child at the age of even the 10th forget about the 10th class I'm talking about forget about the three years age 10th is

somewhere around 12 or 13 years of age or so those uh even more than that 15 years of age is that time &gt;&gt; he or she is a child is not expect to write a AI algorithm there but if they

know how to use the application of AI how to use chart GP or Germany that day will be difficult as AI said application part of it how to frame your management proposal how to structure your pie chart

I think those are important to teach them but while teaching them they have to use as Rajiv said you need to use the I mean a common sense and formulas and tools he used the word tools we need to

use it so focus education should be an applied rather than writing how to write the AI code that is what I I want to differentiate that &gt;&gt; no no thank you this is helpful now

you've seen bank of India who has done some scale work at a population level group is far ahead what he is doing on AI but then there are many clients of yours who get pallets but they have not

been able to implement AI at population level and for economic growth grow. It's important that we have spoken about farm industry, we have spoken about our kids, education, we have spoken about banking

but again the manufacturing, healthcare organizations as a whole, how do they adopt what and what are the barriers for these pilots to became scale? So such you will see that pilots often

are successful and the reason pilots are successful is because they work on curated data. They work on a very controlled environment right once you take this same pilot outside you will

face with the real life problems and the real life problems would be data right data is the is the basis on which all these AI algorithms run. You will have fragmented processes.

You will have governance controls and rightfully so, right? You need to have the explanability, the auditability of these models itself. So you will have these plethora of problems which

surrounds it. Now for one of our clients in the very early days, we started with a jai knowledge assistant or a policy assistant kind of a thing and the pilots worked successfully. When we tried to

kind of take it to the production level or the population level as you call it, the first problem that we faced was nobody knew what the right policy documents were.

&gt;&gt; Everybody had their versions of the policy documents. The second problem was a lot of these documents had sensitive information. So you don't know what to show and what not to show. And third as

I said right uh people wanted to understand how can you explain the output of these models? How can I trust these output of these models? So what we did was and if you look at

the model itself was not the problem. The problem was the operational environment. How do I take this pilot and make it successful? It needed us to look at the

data governance and I think Rajiv talked about it the data itself. We looked at the PII reduction. We looked at the cyber security or the security around that. And I think Dr. Ry also talked

about it, right? You need to have a layer of security around it. And obviously from a governance standpoint, uh definitely we need to explain the models. We need to make sure that the

audit teams were happy. So that's one. The second which we generally see in our clients are the culture, right? I mean scale is not a technical problem. It's a lot of an adoption problem

itself. People do not want to adopt a model because maybe they're afraid that it's going to replace their jobs. They do not trust the transparency of the models

itself. So they refrain from using these models. Uh and and how do you solve that? Right? It's a culture change that you need to bring in. It needs to be driven from the top as well as from

educated people from the ground level. And I think Dr. Circa talked about the entire skilling of people. How do they become more educated in this whole scheme of things? And I think if if you

look at both these two aspects, you will see that bringing this culture change, you will see a lot more adoption happening at at a population level. And you work with lot of captives also

global capability centers GCC you see they are doing it better than in some of the Indian companies. I would say that see there is another perennial challenge with the Indian

companies when these models comes and we are we are kind of working at these models which is very indic models right our sovereign models that we are speaking about yes when we talk about

the captives you will see that these captives work a lot with the English language and use the models which are available outside but when it comes to the Indian conglomerates

talk about banks right if it has to have a conversational AI going on it needs to communicate or the model needs to work on all different languages and that is something which we are changing right

PM2 which was released recently server mayi they're all looking to change this difference or this bottleneck that the Indian conglomerates would face but between captives and Indian

conglomerates I think both of them are doing a decent job &gt;&gt; and this is what is happening there are a lot of large conglomerates which are having their

captives so before moving to any follow-up so I would like to open it for Q&amp;A I think you heard I hear that's what please can someone pass on the mic but we can hear you go ahead and please for

question is for whom and what is your question what is your name first and what is your question &gt;&gt; hi my name is N and yeah I come from Delhi so I would tell I would and very

good evening for all of you as a panelist and I really like what we have been spoken about from Mohit Kapoor to Bulsharai very good evening to all of you okay yeah so two days back I was in

uh uh village nearby to Aligar in Atrai. Okay. And the road was uh okay like a distance of my hands okay that much was the road and now I'm sitting here I'm thinking about there are two parts of

India which one of the panelist was also speaking about India and Bharat. Okay. So I would I my question is I'll come to my question. So my question is that you know how can we equalize the difference

between that part of India and how can we make a similar competitive field for childrens of you know who are coming from that village and from &gt;&gt; how will AI going to help divide so Dr.

Ray you spoke about this divide uh give us in one or two [clears throat] minutes please. See the only one way it is possible to do is that that we must think of now providing accesses

delivering the services universally across the country there okay that's one and many pilots I have seen which are going on first of them is the face recognition system there today face

recognition system is very very it gives you one meter kind of a scenario accuracy there you do that they And the there are so many NOS's working for sending their photographs. But largely

we need to use the satellite system or the high bandwidth internet system even terrestrial for delivering those educational programs there. Educational program for example I give very simple

result to the village talk about that area. See the I mean uh fixing the puncher in a tire in a sophisticated cars. I'm not talking BMWs or all kind of I'm talking of Moitar there. See

fixing those puncher itself is an issue. When you go to the villages there, they don't know how to do the puncher fixing there. I mean many people know about it but cycle and the thing there are two

different scenarios are there. If we are able to create those skill programs there I AI based kind of a scenario model and broadcast those deliver those services at least those people will

understand how to fix up those punchers. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. punchers there repairing your car. I'm giving you same thing issue is there in terms of the repair of fridge fridge is a common kind of

equipment which everybody's own and I must tell you also there I'm not stating the fact &gt;&gt; forget about Delhi forget about the whatever area you're talking about I'm

talking about daily &gt;&gt; the electrician doesn't know between the uh earth and the and and kind of a live kind of a terminal how does he do that left may live right may neutralize

that's what they identify that so if you are able to create those AI based educational program and transmit you can create a separate channel it will help us to increase our employment again Vix

bar he talk about it okay you create those small program how to fix up those things and my friend Moit if he spends time creating the small kind of a program for every vehicle they come okay

every tire when they come out in 25 when they come off in 28 25 26 car will be same puncher will be same but 28 things will be slightly different there so if they come out that kind of a program

puncher look at how much killing will happen sometime you need only trigger I mean the guy who sitting sitting at the ground he understand those things they're much better than a common

engineering like I many of us they understand but you need a slightly trigger which AI can give it AI can create a model do this way that way and can create a model. That's what I was

talking about. Use I &gt;&gt; then create a &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you so much. Uh I I will have Yes, please. in the third row. &gt;&gt; Yeah.

&gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. &gt;&gt; I think we talked about economic growth and we talked about social good. Um so do you do you think and last mile connectivity but oh I'm sorry I'm prai

I'm from the secretariat. We're a policy focused organization. So my question is do we have enough policies to address risk and trust in India or is there still a gap and secondly like we talk

about digital literacy, data literacy, now AI literacy and so I talked about like multimodal you it's a time of deep fakes. So how do we get literacy to also reach that last mile connectivity?

&gt;&gt; So can I request Rajiv to talk about this because this may be very pertinent in your &gt;&gt; you rightly said we need to build trust. Uh one of us spoke about developing

models today. uh when I talk about credit uh dispensation and say that I look on civil scores I look on inter income tax data I look at the other things whereas to that I look at cash

flow statements or I look at how much uh crop you have generated I need to trust that data and start building a system on it so there has to be a clearcut policy guidelines prescriptions there which

creates the trust in the overall systems which are there so we are building on those systems whether it is from the cyber security part of it or or the adoption part of it the trusts are there

Some of one of the member here asked about how do I we educate or how do we reach out to the last mile education has been parting on but then today if I want to say that mobile app is available and

let the rural customer use that mobile app. How is he going to do that? If I put a small video there or if I if the social media there is something which helps him to scroll and say find out

that this is how it has to be used or this has to be there or supposing today we all know if a cyber attack crime has happened to me what am I supposed to do there's a number in India toll-free

number which I need to dial and the things will get sorted out the education has to be there so there are policies there which we have been built it's not that they are complete in all sense it's

a gradual process work in progress We need to build on these systems. We need on to build on these policies. But yes, the initial in framework has already been put in place and meetings

like these will help us to build on those frameworks to see how far we can take away this and then build on a robust structure which the country needs.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you Rajie. One last one. Fourth ma'am. Okay ma'am as a mic. Sorry about this. It is the last one and otherwise we'll be standing outside to &gt;&gt; you biased for this side. I think there

are people. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I'm sorry I can't see it. [laughter] Thank you sir. &gt;&gt; One last sorry about this.

&gt;&gt; I'm Dolly Hassin and I've been a consulting uh [clears throat] consultant and running a consulting company for last 25 years. &gt;&gt; Yes.

&gt;&gt; Um I have been dabbling with AI for the last 20 years now and uh I think we need to also look at &gt;&gt; what is the question please straight &gt;&gt; AI's role in the uh digital

transformation. Yes, we we've always been looking at AI for this sector, that sector, this this thing. But where can we really bring in transformational effort?

&gt;&gt; Transformational effect will come when we really look at problems and try to really um address them this thing. The point in question right now I'm asking very specifically is for the uh

aspirational districts. There are certain districts in the country. &gt;&gt; What is the question? &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's what I'm asking. &gt;&gt; Come to question then. uh in the

aspirational districts there has to be a massive AI application which can actually really transform those aspirational district. &gt;&gt; So for these aspirational district mo

can I ask you how can we make it more aspirational? That's the question. No, not aspirational districts are the ones which are the most backward districts of the country and they they have a lot of

opportunities there but those opportunities cannot be really uh kind of availed just because of lack of few things which is where we need to really bring in AI to really solve those

bottlenecks and see how we could &gt;&gt; call it. Thank you. Can I ask you working on that in northeast and there is a lot &gt;&gt; sorry about this ma'am it has been very

&gt;&gt; I think I'll keep it very very short I think finance healthcare and education those may be the three areas which have to be applied in all areas but more for for the aspirational I think AI has a

good play in all that &gt;&gt; fantastic &gt;&gt; on I I think it's covered the topics all three topics got covered um &gt;&gt; I think one hour was not sufficient for

this a big round of clap for this fantastic and big round of clap for each one of you have been a great audience thank you so much everyone Everyone I think we are ready for Vix Bat.

Appreciate this all of you. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you everyone. Thank you panel speakers for a insightful session. Everybody. Heat.
