## 📝 Transcript

He is the co-chair for JPAL's project AI evidence pie initiative. His work focuses on applying AI to real world development challenges. Today he will be speaking with us about his study from

Ghana on using generative AI to improve teacher hiring. A fun fact, David also co-organizes the annual Zurich workshop on AI and economics, a leading forum at this intersection and was the recipient

of the prestigious Uroho Yansen Award last year. Congratulations, David. Over to you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; All right. Great. Good afternoon,

everyone. Uh, so I'm David, professor of economics at University of Zurich. Today I want to talk about a decision. I think a decision that every organization will have to face today and over the

next 5 to 10 years inside of organizations. What is that decision? That decision is this thing that we call AI.

Whatever that thing is, how do we use it inside of our organization? This could be a government unit. This could be an NGO. This could be a company.

This could be an academic institution. And when you're asking that question, the very next question I bet is going to be, do we automate

or do we augment? Do we automate or do we augment? I'm going to be making basically three points over the next 25 minutes.

The first one is actually not a point. The first one is I want you to do some introspection and think about in your organization how you would start to think about how to

answer this question. I can't provide you the answer to that because you all work in different kinds of organization under very different circumstances.

But that's the first thing I I want to talk to you about. The second is going to I'm going to give you a very simple framework for how I tend to think about this.

Um and then third I'm going to give you some evidence from Ghana with an experiment we ran with an organization where we would where we were discussing exactly this issue. Do we automate this

thing that these tasks that we're trying to solve or do we augment augment? Do we have an assistant that helps people make better decisions? Okay, so those are the three things I want to discuss and the

overarching theme is going to point to the importance of evidence. And as the co-chair of the project for AI evidence at JPAL, we have had a long tradition of having what's called

evidence-based policym, which is a core belief that we think would be true not just yesterday, but tomorrow as AI sort of starts to penetrate all parts of the economy.

To engage you, I would like you to join the conversation by pulling up your cell phones because I'll be polling you in a little bit. But before that, I want you to we're

gonna start with the introspection. Okay? And [clears throat] here's how we're gonna do this. A little bit uh unusual

perhaps, but I want you to just close your eyes and think about your organization, your job, the goals that you have for yourself and

the organization. And then think about AI. Whatever that thing that you think is AI, whether that's chat or whether that's something that's much more

tailored, think about what is the one thing that I would like AI to do to help my organization perform a task or achieve its goals.

So just think about that for a second. Okay, so hopefully you thought of something. Now ask yourself that thing that I wanted AI to do,

was it to automate something or was it augmenting me or someone in in the organization? Was it an assistant? Right? You probably were in one of these two.

Then ask yourself, what am I basing that decision or that idea on? How what was the algorithm that you had in your head? What was the steps? What

were the things that you made sure you kind of checked? What was your checklist? Moreover, what evidence did you base it on?

Like how many let's say reports have you seen where someone had done something very similar in some other situation and they reported how well one solution worked over another.

My guess is is in in this room, if I had time to talk to every single one of you, the typical answer would probably be zero, maybe one.

For sure, not more than 10. Why is that? That is because as we stand here today, there's extremely little evidence that we can base these decisions on. The technology is so new,

organizations haven't really been adopting this technology. And if they have, they haven't really done a proper evaluation of different types of policy options where and publish those results

so that we can all learn from people's mistakes and lessons, right? And this is sort of the core mission of of JPAL is to work with organizations to create such evidence not just for that

organization, but for society as a whole. Okay, good. So I think we have a a good foundation now to to to move forward. You have thought about your own uh

situation. Now I'm going to place you in a policy scenario. I'm going to get to you know my own research but I'm I'm going to now push you to think about okay not my organization but let's take

a place in India. Let's take the health sector in a state. Uh let's do Uttar Pradesh. Suppose you're actually the main policy maker responsible for all the district

hospitals in this state, you know, which has, you know, millions of people, super big scale. And the task that they're trying to figure out how to do better is

diagnosing patients. So my good friend Sead Obermmyer earlier today was talking about advancements in AI is sackling in the space and there's a lot of exciting work in the space but

whatever that AI thing is whatever that technology is there's going to be this choice between the diagnosis itself which is a decision is that going to be automated

or is that going to be augmented. So augmentation typically means it's still at the end of the day a human that makes the decision the diagnosis he or she just gets some input from some

system we can call it AI about what the right decision is right so that's why I call augmentation okay so think about this now for a second

and I want to talk But first thing when it comes to the first dimension that I want you to think about is costs. You know economist talks about cost and benefits

and typically when benefits outweigh cost we think it's a good thing. But here we have to think about two policy options augmentation versus automation right so uh I'm just going to give you a

little bit more uh information to to kind of work through this simulation. Status qu of course is human only. we just go on like we have done always the doctors looks at the tests you know

makes up a diagnosis right but we're all here because we think AI can potentially transform all sorts of sectors and I'm just bringing up one and all sorts of decision- making okay so automation

let's say now you can save on labor costs let's say 20%. It's not that AI is for free. AI actually costs money. For the sake of this uh exercise, let's say this is a

net of whatever the AI costs are, right? So 20% cost saving. That looks kind of compelling, right? What about augmentation? Well, augmentation now involves humans

more than automation does clearly. So we're not going to be saving as much on the labor side. The AI might cost as much So let's say we do a 5% cost saving.

Okay, this is typically not that hard to figure out even before you roll something out. It might there might be some uncertainty, some implementation

issues, but the cost side, you know, we pretty much know kind of what wages are for for people and sort of, you know, what the costs of various AI systems are.

So I've given you some information and now I want you to put yourself in this situation say okay but which policy would I recommend in this situation. So, for this,

I'm going to ask you to, if you haven't already, pull up your phones, uh, go to the uh, go to the link with the QR code and, um, and and you can think about your answer and vote. So, I'm going to

open the poll now. Uhhuh. Okay. So yeah, I think you should be able to answer now. Okay. very good. Should we look at the

results? Almost 90% of you, we have a clear winner. If we believe in democracy, you know, we could all vote for this, right? So when I started doing work in this

space, I'll just tell you I was also in this space three years ago. Based on what I'm seeing from literature, from the little evidence that we have, I'm moving quite rapidly

to the left and I can explain a little bit about what I'm seeing there. But I think it's still a very much an open question. Now, I want you to Well, I was gonna I

thought it would be more of a split maybe. Okay. Uh, nevertheless, the reason for your choice could be

different. How you think about this could be different. So now I'm going to give you two minutes to convince the person next to you why whatever you picked if it's AI only or human with AI

assistant why that is the right policy choice. Okay. So it's going to get a little bit loud in here for two minutes. But that's fine, right? And then I'm going to have you vote

again and then we see if the 90% managed to convince the 9% or if the 9% somehow managed to spread their views to the other people. Okay. So we'll do that now. So you can talk

for two minutes. Can we move back to the other to the slides please? Can we move to the slides? Yeah. Good. Okay. So, very good. Uh, let's go back

to this to the menty and I'm going to reset this. Uh, how do I reset this again? Over here. Okay, now I want you to vote again.

So, remember now the AI only was at 9% and uh or something like this. Yeah. Okay, I'm gonna You can keep voting. Let's look at the result. Oh.

Okay, so good job AI only people. You managed to convince some people. Actually, a good friend of mine here who's one of the leading experts using machine learning in the healthcare

sector is Obermyer. Um, and he gave a talk earlier today. I was I'm I'm curious what he how would you what did you pick and what was and what what was your answer?

Um as usual with an academic it depends is my answer. I think um AI only when we measure exactly what we care about. So prior heart attack, we can measure that

exactly on um different tests predicting that AI only. But very often we don't measure exactly the thing we care about. In which case you would want some prediction going to a human who can

reconcile the measured thing with the unmeasured objective function that we're actually trying to optimize. An academic answer. I still don't understand which one did

you pick. There's no it depends. Yeah. As an organization like there is you can't be sitting there. It's like it dep sorry I love you brother. Uh but you

have to make a choice. That's the hard thing right. And the answer probably it depends right. Yes it depends but then what what do we do? So it's a hard hard choice right? Okay. Now let's go back to

No, let's go back to the we're not in class now. Like there's not like a right and wrong answer like in in my economics classes there is. Let's go back to the slides.

Can we go back to the slides? Not the menty. Great. Okay. Now it should be immediately clear if

if you guys think we get more costsaving with automation and less with augmentation there must be some counteracting force that leads you to go to automation right

and again if I had time to talk to each one of you I would want to hear but presumably there's something about the decision- making process uh that would lead to more errors you

think if you did automation only like more misdiagnosis Right? So you have kind of a mental model which is partly about what humans bring to the table, right? Like how how

how how qualified the doctors are, right? And making good decisions. That's number one. Number two, you have some view of a AI capabilities because the answer should depend partly on well how

good is this AI system in just if you want to try to automate it, right? But then there's a third thing where social science really comes into play which is what happens in the

interactions between humans and machines. When humans get some kind of recommendation from from a machine including doctors, how do they process

that information? And that is something we actually don't know so much about. Uh we know some uh but this still very much an open question. Okay. So ultimately you have to look at the benefit side

right like what happens to the patients and then let's just this is what impact is about right this is what this AI impact summit is about imagine you knew that the impact would be this

that automation leads to 30% worse patient health outcomes in augmentation actually also leads to worst outcomes but just 5%

But you're saving 5%. Compared to having human only, right? Should we still consider automation? You're saving 20% but 30% worse health outcomes.

Let's poll again. Go to menty. Okay. Which policy? And you can go back to the actually go back to the slide so people can read the facts.

Okay, good. You already see how decision you the policy decision is changing. Now we see a case that's much more strong for human only, right? Some people are still

looking at the 5% costsaving, right? and that looks appealing, right? Willing to take a little bit worse health costs. As a researcher, I cannot provide you with the answer to this question. This partly

comes down to the values and the goals of the organizations which are tough decisions, right? But researchers like myself can help you figure out the facts like what what the impacts are. Okay,

good. So, let's go back to the to the [clears throat] Now this is just a simulation right I just gave you some numbers but when you're actually making this

decision before you have done anything you should be entertaining all sorts of situations right what if for example you get better patient health outcomes here in augmentation well that would push it

towards that policy option what about if you get 30% better patient health outcomes with automation and you're saving 20% of the costs now automation looks very very compelling, right?

What about costs? Are we sure we're saving money? AI is not for free. AI can be quite expensive. The tokens, you know, if you take the latest anthropic model, I think it's

$140 per one million tokens if you're going to use that model, how many millions of tokens are you going to be burning, right? And we know there's something called inference type compute.

the more an AI gets to sort of think about a problem and solve a problem uh the the lower are the error rates right might be very very costly right so cost might actually increase we would want to

know that as well okay so labor is costly AI is costly and also AI can be combined in so many ways I say augmentation but it's ultimately a design choice how are you

going to augment people right also what makes it Even trickier, the technology itself is changing rapidly and how humans interact with the technology and have experience of technology is

changing. So we're in a very rapidly changing world, right? How do we ensure we get the highest impact, right? Well, data seems to be at the very least a a key first step, right? An

evaluation, some kind of evaluation. And I'm happy to discuss offline how that could be done. Now in the last uh couple of minutes let me just give you a brief overview of when I work with an

organization in Ghana where we faced exactly this decision. So they were hiring teachers to teach in rural areas for two years university students that went as volunteers

basically very highly qualified teaching underserved areas. One of the tasks the organization needed to solve was they got all these applicants applying for this job and

they had human teachers evaluate all of these candidates. The question was can we maybe automate this using GPT4 at the time this was more than two years ago or should we

augment so that the GPT4 first looks at all the applications uses a rubric based on what the organization is screening for and that decision then is a recommendation to the human teacher that

uh uh selects teachers right turns out in this case and I was I thought we would get the best of both worlds if we have experienced human teachers that can evaluate have some tested knowledge

together with a AI system that really doesn't know anything about teaching kids in rural Ghana that that would be the best turned out that was the worst

the process they were slowed down by the AA recommendations but it actually didn't change the decision- making and they were actually not very good at

picking teachers to begin with we show in the paper automation had a huge impact on success rates we increased success hiring rates by 70%. Okay, so that's an example where I

myself went into and thinking, hm, it's going to be very nice to see that augmentation really works. Automation actually turned out to be the best thing. It saved money and it selected

better teachers. So with that said, thanks. &gt;&gt; Sorry, we don't have time for questions. I would love to chat afterwards. Yeah, &gt;&gt; thank you so much. Uh, thanks David.

That was super interesting. Thank you for making this so interactive for our audience. Can I please request you David to remain on stage uh while I call upon the panelists for the discussion.

To moderate this session, we have Murugan Rasadvan. Murugan is the CEO of Wis Foundation. Please join me in clapping for our speakers as they are working.

Vivus invests in organizations and enables progress at the intersection of tech, AI, policy, and social impact. A fun fact, in his past life, prior to his move to the impact ecosystem, Murugan

led the Cisco's social innovation group where he helped several multi-million dollar businesses for Cisco as part of the emerging solutions group. Welcome, Murugan. Next up, we have Dr. Becky

Faith. She's a senior research fellow at FCDO or UK Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office. She's also a senior research fellow at Institute of Development Studies at Sussex. Dr. Faith

also reach re leads the research uh digital futures for works center where she seeks to understand how technological advancements can be used for gender justice. In line with this,

she has a very interesting PhD research examining how mobile phones shape the lives of opportunities for excluded young women in the UK. Next up, we have Elizabeth Kelly.

Elizabeth is the head of beneficials deployments in Anthropic uh where she works to ensure that AI systems are deployed responsibly and for public benefit. She was also the founding

director of the US AI safety institute and has held several roles at Obama White House and the bidden Harris transition team and was named one of time's most hundred uh influential

people in AI in 2024. And finally we have Shankar Maruara. Shanker is the co-founder and CEO of Astep Foundation where he works on building digital public infrastructure to improve access

to education at scale. Shankul previously led demand generation and marketing for Aadhaar, India's national digital identity program, one of the largest digital public infrastructure

affecting the lives of billions today. Thank you so much uh for being here. uh Muriban will be as taking your questions via the menty QR that's on the screen and we will be using them uh in the

middle of the session. Uh panelists you also have the time monitor in front of you. Thank you so much Muran. Over to you. I think we have just met some of the

some of you and it's a very interesting combination of people and I have to bring it up especially when Shankar is here. We have what we call sama, sakar and bazar in each of you. It's not just

one person representing market, one person representing government and one civil society. Each of you have dawned all three caps in your past life. So it's a very interesting group and I

think the um we had a very well-prepared brief uh which thanks to Claude I'm going to park for now and go with what Claude is telling me. And uh I know your team's

listening as well. So we'll we'll keep it clean. [clears throat] Um I think it's a very interesting question AI in work. I know we've talked about all of this thing, but I wonder if

this question if the question is framed right because I I really think the real question is whose work is getting transformed, who's measuring it, and who's deciding

what to do. And so I think with that as the background, we're just going to, as we agreed, meander a little bit around this. Maybe a little bit of a an unsettling question.

Is there a moment in the last 6 months, 9 months where your mental model of AI in work was fundamentally questioned by developments or what you heard or what

you read or papers like what we heard about now? Anyone can go first. Okay, let me go first because it's very recent. Uh 3rd of Feb, Ethiopia launched

its agri advisory. 11th of Feb last week, Amul, India, world's largest cooperative of milk farmers, 36 million. They launched their version of it. I was there on stage in Gujarat where they

launched it. The audience had 1500 people. 60% of them were women farmers would come from all parts of Gujarat when they started playing with the Slaba bin advisory AI advisory feature phone

Gujarati talk and you get the best advice on health of the cow and a whole bunch of stuff on how to improve the milk yield etc what I realized is it's not about better advisory it's about

women's empowerment it's about improving livelihoods and the way they said it is when they started this off with one or two cows They had no experience of milk farming. So if something happens to the

cow, if they have to ask something, who do they ask? And what they saw in this was the fact that the wisdom of 50 years of Amul lacks of farmers data from 30 million cows is now available for them

in their language voice when they want. So it can be a powerful. So is she she's a daughter-in-law, she's a wife, she's also the milk farmer and every day the cow falls ill, her family's income gets

affected. So I very recent example of how I started to look at it through different eyes of equity, empowerment and the possibilities. &gt;&gt; Fascinating. Yeah, Elizabeth. So for

those of us who work in this space, I I think we all know how incredibly quickly it's moving, but there's still moments where you're sort of taken aback and pinch yourself. So if I was to think

last six months, one thing that's really stood out to me uh is we rolled out a product co-work, which essentially is it's like Claude Code, but without the terminal. It's for non-technical folks

to be able to do all of the things that people are using Claude Code for. But that product was built entirely by cloud code in 10 days. &gt;&gt; And the fact that even the new things

that we are rolling out that we are using are been now being built entirely by by AI in record time I think is just a complete paradigm shift that still takes me back.

So, I've got a more prosaic example from my research that I'll be carrying out with the ESRC Center for Digital Futures at Work, which I think captures something about this pace of change and

who gets left behind. So, I was interviewing a National Health physiootherapist about her use of um co-pilot at work and she was saying it's really transformed the way she works and

captures notes and it's really sped up her workflow. But the community health workers she works with were really resistant to using it. They said, "No, I'm just about to retire. I'm not going

to get trained up to use it." And this for me captured and also the colleagues she was working with said, "It's really hard to integrate with other NHS systems." So that small anecdote says

something to me both about gendered and age inequalities and technology adoption which we need to think about in this whole space which has been my kind of concern for many years but also thinking

about how we evaluate these uh these tools and the work that we're doing in conjunction with JPAL and ID insight through foreign commonwealth and development office on our AI ford

program as well as doing RCTs we're going to be doing kind of process evaluation of what happens when AI hits real world institutions, who's actually using the tools, what are the barriers,

what are the gendered barriers, what are the age barriers, what are the rural urban barriers. So that for me really hit me. It's less prosaic and it's more kind of prosaic and somehow less kind of

shocking, but that kind of everyday anecdote tells us a lot about how we should be thinking about evaluating AI and the development impacts it can be bringing about.

&gt;&gt; Yeah. I know that's fascinating because you gave an example of a workforce which is already a high productive workforce &gt;&gt; software engineers now just either thinking about what and your CEO is on

record saying 50% of software engineering teams at anthropic are now haven't done coding in the last few months or something like that right and you know Becky's example of how that the

the nurses and the others you know where They see these things are different. You know, Shankr, you know, we were chatting earlier about productivity and the informality of the economy in India. 500

million people are working in the informal sector. Um, how does something like this which we have seen digital and I'll come back to that come to Becky on that one. But how does AI specifically

intersect with both the informality of the economy in India and jobs in India and the productivity aspect of job work in India? Yeah. Let me ask you a question that we have now or we will

have in a couple of years around 10 million gig workers. 20 years ago that number was practically zero. We have millions of YouTube content creators for whom this is a way of earning a

livelihood and a profession. The lady who is cooking great stuff, making videos out of it and lot of people puned lap it up. Right? This could not have been thought of 20 years ago.

So when compared to developed countries India is a low productivity society and we know that when something makes you more productive it's good for you it's good for society right those of us who

have seen the days of fax and precomputers etc we know that we have become much busier now than before right it is not that as technology comes you become redundant you become more

productive you can do more yourself as an organization and as a country and therefore India from extremely low productive base informal economy where the gig worker is also the security

guard is also doing a second third job because he's 22 years old or the gig worker is a college student who wants pocket money otherwise would have been studying so the options for being more

productive are now much more because of uh AI and as Mario said if in a couple of years if you have a data center full of Nobel scientists what you do with it India can show many more possibilities

than what it showed with YouTube or with a mobile phone right uh that to me is exciting obviously we have to we have to make sure it is safe we don't want it to go down the path of social media and

regret it later but new professions that could not have been possible Because I cannot learn in Marathi when you are in when you understand Bengali. I cannot teach you if we have a language barrier.

I cannot learn something if I have only a feature phone. A lot of those frictions when they go now it comes down to the motivation of the individual. Right? And at least in India, the way we

have taken to technology in the last 15 years gives me the hope that we will find the point about augmentation. I think there's a third possibility entirely new possibilities.

2006 when YouTube came, it was not augmentation to the housewife. It was a new possibility that did not exist. Same with gig workers where a lot of things had to come together. We will see new

types of services that are needed, new types of jobs that will be created and this will be done by people not necessarily in hyper metros like Delhi, in Nagpur, in villages of uh in rural

areas because you're breaking a few barriers which we assume as normal now. Language barrier, right? Access barrier. When technology is so boring, it becomes invisible. It allows us to do more,

right? And uh uh that to me is exciting. It's not the case if you're already a high productive economy and you only see only way from here is down risk and not up.

Okay. Um I'm going to have to think about that a little bit. I I would recommend all of you to think about it as well. And please send me questions. I think we're ready to take questions on

the menty code. One extra thing a World Bank research published last week showed that even in IT in India the productivity has gone up companies are hiring more it's counterintuitive to

what you would have expected this is data released by World Bank and sorry last week quite yeah that's interesting and uh Elizabeth

you you said you worked in the government before right Um government you know by design cares about the last person right uh not necessarily the top 100 million the next

500 million and so on in India. Um have you guys thought about or your researchers thinking about what the impact of something like this would be not for the software engineers and

others but for people like what Shanka spoke about. Um, first off, I just want to sort of double click on some of the points you made in terms of what the opportunity is here. So, part of what we

do at Enthropic is release something called the economic index. Uh, where we're actually looking at the data in terms of where is AI being used, where are we seeing automation versus

augmentation, what's the geographic differences, what professions are this used in, and we recently did this in India and I thought that the data was really interesting and I think speaks to

a lot of the points that you made. Um so India was number two globally in total claw.ai usage. Um however it was 101st out of 116 countries per capita and the high total usage was explained by

population size with the usage very much concentrated amongst the small tech tech sector slice Maharashtra Tamil Nadu Carnitaka Delhi similar to what we saw with the early mobile internet where it

was urban educated tech first but what was especially cool was just how technically intensive and creative the usage patterns in India were so 45% of all usage was in computer mathematical

tasks which was the highest percentage of anywhere globally any market &gt;&gt; exactly and in addition we actually saw more efficiency gains in India than we've seen elsewhere so tasks that would

take four hours without AI took 15 minutes which meant that it was a 15x speed up versus a 10x speed up globally so I just think it speaks to your point of there's huge opportunity that is

being leveraged here. I I think that part of what we're focused on is how do we make sure that this transition goes well for all of society which means that we're thinking not just about what this

means in the workplace uh but also how do we use this to improve health outcomes. What can this mean in terms of uh closing educational gaps? uh how are we ensuring that's actually outside of

the life sciences and leading to new cures for detected diseases and so ensuring those gains is broadly shared while making the sure this transition goes well for all workers is at the

heart of what I think government is focused on and will be a both opportunity and challenge in the months ahead what are your thoughts how's FCTO

thinking about it uh how should a policy maker in India think about it when it comes to the not the top 100 million in India but the next 500 and the next 500 right

&gt;&gt; so inclusion whether that's gender or disability inclusion is really central to the way that we approach technology at FCDO so that's already concerned about data that's coming out from

Harvard showing that women are already 20% less likely than men to engage with uh generative AI technologies at work and that risk not just a kind of skills gap but it risks that what we call that

kind of vicious circle of um AI bias getting entrenched, women aren't in the room, they're not using the tools, they're not tinkering with them, they're not it means that you end up with

products that aren't reflecting women's needs. So, our approach is that we think it's really important to to focus on inclusion and that starts off obviously with digital inclusion that you can't

have um women and girls getting left behind. It's a big commitment for the UK government to women and girls safety and that includes women and girls safety online. So if we don't have safe digital

spaces for women and girls to be using, then we can't expect them to be benefiting from using AI and sort of other digital tools at work. So I'd say focusing on inclusion and then looking

at um so we've [snorts] got really exciting work going on in innovating around disability and inclusion in AI. Um making sure that those voices are heard in policy spaces as well through

our work through the AI ford program. then also sort of trying to mainstream gender through our um AI evidence of work evidence work and we've got some some of our collaborators from ID

insight and JPAL here here in the room. So yeah, that's how our approach is. &gt;&gt; Great. We have a we have an audience comment as well that anytime a new technology is it's it's never black or

white. It's always the gray skies that turn blue. Very colorful comment. Um, I think there are a few audience questions coming up before. Oh, did the clock just increase?

Because I thought it was thought it was at 8 minutes and I was rushing through. [laughter] Okay, thank you whoever it was. Um, I think I would double click on the

informal economy gig worker because Shanker XEP is doing really good work on honest especially the blue dot program. If you don't mind explaining 30 seconds, what is the blue dot program and then I

would ask something around what could AI what do you see AI doing with it? &gt;&gt; Any of you who ordered Uber when you open up your Uber app there's a blue dot on it right? You are the blue dot. So

the map forms around you whereas if you go to a physical map you have to locate yourself on the map. But in the digital world the map is formed around you. And the blue dot essentially means you're

looking for a cab. And so the cabs around you see you and say, "Yeah, I think I'll offer my services, transportation, food." You go there, you want to find pizzas or coffee around

you. Blue dot. And so you see restaurants around you. Can you do that with jobs? Anybody? Uh I want jobs within 30 kilometers. I want a a skill teaching session within

30 km. Does not matter if you're a white collar, you can go from Delhi to Bangalore. But if you are a 21-year-old girl whose parents will not allow her to go beyond two bus stops, you are looking

for the job around you. Right? That blue dot whether it is finding jobs started happening in a district in Gazyabad here in Karnataka. What earlier the best of tech platform showed only 10 jobs

available through this process a very collaborative process 4,000 jobs were discovered which even the district collector like wo I didn't even know this existed discovery right is a new

possibility I don't mind earning 10 15,000 rupees in my hometown than going to Bangalore uprooting myself one example in Ranchi Bihar

people with disab Disabilities, scholarships they why should the person with disability look for scholarship? Why can't the

scholarship find the person with disability when in a blue dot? Because the car knows where you are, it will come to you. Why can't we do the same with girls scholarship, girl child

scholarships? Obviously, if we keep safety, etc. in mind, this is already happening. scholarships reaching the girl child in a matter of 20 minutes and not the six months that it took

beforehand because she said is the same those of you used digra in India it's the same thing so blue dot essentially means I am here this is what I want those of you who are willing to serve my

needs come forward and the way I'm accessing it through a is through an app I trust whether it be that of government or private or civil society right &gt;&gt; correct So on so let's say 3 years from

now blue dot signal goes up there's a local garage mechanic is looking for a trained technician who's available this whole system is now AI enabled and now AI turns back to the employer and says

look why do you want to hire this guy why don't you rent a welding machine at 20% uh you know cost of operations you'll get higher quality do you see that

happening and that's question for you and And for you Elizabeth when you think of beneficial deployments rightfully the small business owner is also a beneficiary and they should also

make more money be more efficient productivity is good for the country but if you had any thinking and I know it's very very early days and we don't know what we don't know which we which is a

lot who is the beneficiary I think one of the audience question also comes around that which is if productivity dramatically rises who captures the gain so in some face a similar angle to that

right so all of you maybe take a shot at it yeah &gt;&gt; yeah I don't see that happening in a hurry &gt;&gt; you don't see that

&gt;&gt; and not for the next 10 15 years because it makes so much of sense for the small per the businessmen he cannot invest too much in a lot of uh automation and uh and by the way I'm not talking of

that blue dots will work for every kind of job entry- levelvel jobs the ski the jobs where you don't need that much of skill experience right so it's very specific and that's why for a low

product uh productive country like India where we are now it makes sense we will ultimately and hopefully we'll reach that stage but I'll be happy when we reach that stage

I think this comes back to this question of how are you using AI and we see this a lot with enterprise employers you can use it just for efficiency or you can use it for growth so growing the pie

growing the opportunity ities that small business owner that you're talking about might be offering more products and services. It's not just a one for one trade-off. Um, but I think it comes back

to this question of how do we actually get AI and AI fluency into the hands of more people so more people can have those opportunities and those benefits because when that happens, we're seeing

remarkable things. We're seeing the coding team at Otelot who took a threeperson legal tech nonprofit and operates at the pace of six engineers using Claude. We've seen Protham do

remarkable work in terms of using AI to actually remove a lot of the administrative load so that teachers can focus more on students. But where there's this sphere of AI, it actually

limits the adoption and the widely spread gains. And so I think that's one of the things we have to combat as well as making sure that AI capability, AI fluency is much more broadly shared and

not just limited to certain populations. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Growth versus efficiency. If you are looking at it from a growth point of view, the automation does not matter. You have way bigger opportunities ahead.

If you're looking from efficiency, then what you're saying makes sense. &gt;&gt; I would also maybe rephrase it as growth versus development as well, right? because um

Becky, &gt;&gt; so I've got a kind of uh a practical answer and a theoretical answer because I'm also an academic. So the practical answer is that I think for people in the

informal economy, AI can open up new kind of vistas of skills training through uh more accessible content, content in video, in lots of different media that we know are more accessible

to a broader u kind of range of people in your content in your language, in your version of your sign language and so on and so forth that can help you uh give you skills to boost your livelihood

and so on. And my kind of theoretical answer with my academics hat on is that using that idea of adverse incorporation from development economics that ensuring that people when they're incorporated

into the AIdriven economy it doesn't affect them adversely whether that's financially because they have to pay more for data or in terms of their kind of dignity and human rights giving up

too much information. So I think there's the great opportunities but in terms of we we don't there don't have to be trade-offs between development and growth

you know just uh reminded that not too long ago that we had funded an organization for digital fluency for trades people for mechanics for plumbers for carpenters [clears throat] and that

was less than 10 years ago now you're talking about AI fluency right &gt;&gt; one story as part of this blue dot we assume that people know English they know how to write up a word Microsoft

word resume but we've seen cases where toppers of ITI they have ipsom lorum in their CV &gt;&gt; because they don't understand what it is they think it has to be there right but

with AI they're able to talk to an agent which creates a CV for them and they kind of say yeah this makes sense right it talks them through it what what are you looking for where are you etc so

it's just like a friendly coach in their native language they need not know have computers Microsoft word that's what I mean by new possibilities in India's context. All of this has to be designed

keeping inclusion in mind, keeping equity in mind, keeping India's diversity in mind. If we don't, then we are in trouble. &gt;&gt; Um talking about trouble, I will be in

trouble if I don't ask the question about measurement and impact. Um because I'm, you know, we are of course here uh with with Igbal and JPAL team here. Um, Becky, we spoke about it and you're

supporting JPEL. Uh, how do you see that part of this whole thing play out? We just heard about one measurement that was two years ago. We spoke about, you know, studying thousands of RCTs and

some of them are interventions that may not, you know, uh, that probably doesn't make sense today because it was done in 2007. World is changing so fast. How do you see the whole evaluation assessment

impact and that cycle coming back to program design? &gt;&gt; I think it's absolutely vital and I feel that we're really lucky at FCDO to have such great partners to be working with

on our AI evidence alliance for social impact. Um, I think it's actually really important more broadly for trustworthy AI that in a space where there's so much hype and

there's so much there's a combination of both hype and fear and there's a kind of great great kind of perception about risks and some of those risks are about like fear of job loss. So I think

evaluation beyond the like proving that we're spending money wisely and effectively it plays a really important part in a kind of trustworthy AI ecosystem actually. So there's we

adopted the kind of four stage evaluation framework that our colleagues at the center for global development and others who are some of whom are in this room are getting behind beyond that four

stages of looking at the model looking at the product using it looking at the use and looking at the development impact there's border issues about is there a stage zero should you be using

AI at all which came up in the earlier slides so all in all I think investments in AI evaluation both RCTs and other forms of evaluation are absolutely vital investments at this

time and we need to understand yeah who benefits the kind of great question I think put up on the screen earlier who who is benefiting and who who [clears throat] is losing out that we've

always known in the history of digital and development that technology amplifies it can amplify benefits and it can also amplify inequality so there's an absolutely vital role for evaluation

in this space at the moment &gt;&gt; it's a very interesting comment as well are we designing these to actually learn or just ship and hoping right so thank you [clears throat] for that question um

any thoughts on that I mean are we kind of because we are moving so fast right I mean and you know just also connecting back to both of you Elizabeth and Becky we've had now 2530 years of digital in

impact internet impact you know you you used to run ICT for D as well how are there any lessons learned from there that we don't want to repeat here but and quick thoughts shankar Are we just

shipping and hoping? &gt;&gt; India has a now a proven history over the last 1015 years of making digital work for growth and development for the entire population.

If you look at that, it is not that we implemented a perfect solution. You create a basic idea, you have a certain target inclusion number in mind and then you keep on improving it. But because

it's an infrastructure, you don't build a road thinking that the best car has already been invented. You build a road because that's the best thing to do. Others will innovate on top. That's

infrastructure, shared capability. So I think that approach in AI will make sure that it's a race to the top otherwise it will be a race to the bottom like with social media. We have to watch out for

that. And therefore it requires all of &gt;&gt; 20 seconds. All of us have to come together and make sure that it's a race to the top &gt;&gt; plus one a race to the top. And I think

for all of these interventions, if we're actually going to build trust in what the technology can do, it requires that real-time feedback. And what's cool is that AI can actually give us those proof

points sooner. A lot of our research is actually based off of AI collecting that data. And so how can we grow this field, get more real-time preboards of what's working, test and iterate, and keep up

with the pace of the technology. &gt;&gt; So AI can not only design and ship the product, but also keep tabs on how it's &gt;&gt; exactly. &gt;&gt; Got it.

&gt;&gt; Becky, last last thoughts from your side. I think we need to keep on learning from the last 25 years of digital in development and learning about the lessons we learned about like

how to include people not in an adverse way in a way that actually improves their kind of rights and development &gt;&gt; Thank you everybody that was u hopefully it was a good conversation for all of

you who are all here follow up offline as well. Thank you. Thank you panelist um for a very very relevant discussion and thank you audience for your engagement and your very very thoughtful

questions. A very good afternoon to all of you. I'm Kika and I'll be your MC for the next section. Today we are here for AI for social good impact that works uh seminar hosted by JAL here at AI impact

summit 2026. To know more about JAL and our work please scan the QR codes displayed here in the on the podium. And please continue sending your questions through the QR codes on the screen.
