## 📝 Transcript

come up with the idea. We decided to do a cash transfer, a digital one. We reach out to Estu Prize Nobel of economics that introduces to the University of Berkeley and and and a lab working on

social policy. So we designed a policy of uh a fully digital cash transfer in a couple of days. I would say we build a payment platform where we were able to send digital money to the corporations.

So to the most vulnerable and it was quite at scale because the program at the end reached 920,000 people which is 25% of total agent populations. So we at the time we didn't

have a social registry. So what we did was uh we use the vot as a biometric ID to the people. We built the platform. So we uh we we ask the people to send us code and then on on the database we're

able to to to identify whether they were part of at the time the social risk or the f the social file that we have and when they were part they will receive the the cash transfer.

Then moving on, we didn't know how long the pandmic you know will last at the time and we say we need to have a system way to prioritize the beneficial because our current social file wasn't been

updated for you know for quite a few we didn't know the accuracy of information that file had so we decided to experiment AI right and luckily we work with G directly that help us to fund an

experiment where we are able to prioritize more and 15% of the benef using AI. So we built two machine learning algorithm. The first one use satellite imagery to draw a poverty map

of the country and to rank all the district from the poor rest to the richest and looking at the 10 poorest country. We use the cold detail records from you know telecom operators and to

try to draw a sort of pattern in term of consumption to define the one that live below dollar a day. So we were able to identify a group of people individual

then we contacted them using the USD and asked them to apply for the program and they got the social aid. The one of the most interesting is you know um fast forward moving when we did our first

assessments you know of the efficiency of the program we realized that the people that were selected through the machine learning net was really the poorest of the people you know compared

to the one that was you know initially part of the file which show you know how effective you know that that the program has been and the most important thing the listen that we got for that program

you know moving on the We we say to ourel that how to make it sustainable this approach that we use during the crisis how to prevent to be prepared for the next crisis. Right? So

luckily the the program gain a lot of uh publicity. So we got funding from the world bank to build a social resilience social policy res. So we extending the program to all the

to goal is poorest people and we decided to do two things to build a so social protection information system that rely on three things. The first thing was the bometric. So we launched uh and we just

about to finish a large scale registration program to register all the toolist population. We rely on the payment platform that we built during the co USSD payments and we

are developing a social registry something that will be dynamic that will segment the population. So at any point in time we know exactly who are the progress and if we need a targeted

policy we're able to uh to uh to reach out to them. So and all of that have been possible because you know during the co we we implemented program and we we really trying now that you know we

moving in we build a data lab in partnership with the University of Berkeley to implement those kind of uh experiments. So what we realize also at the time we didn't have the capabilities

so we have to rely on external capability and exper. So now we're building that in house with with our own data scientist with you know our own uh tech team and trying to to leverage uh

uh the benefit of of AI. &gt;&gt; Fantastic. Thank you. And that's such a good case study of how a country like Togo can move quickly learning during a period of I think the lessons from what

you developed very broadly. Moving on to Asana from your work across India what are the most important lessons about digital public infrastructure can empower communities

and how should policy makers design these systems to ensure AI benefits reach rural and marginalized populations. &gt;&gt; Okay, it's so uh very complex to explain

because when we talk about the masses so just for this for the for the sake of everybody uh digital empowerment foundation works across the country and now in close to about 3,000 locations

with simple formula that u all the requirement of the people who live in villages uh their requirements first uh uh layer is information based right

trusted information whether it's access to information access to health access to uh doctors or access to market or access to uh your own money or everything is based on information. So

therefore uh and digital is an infrastructure that can flow the information but trust is one of the biggest things. So we have this info in intermediary card across the uh country

who actually serves people through either you want to have your payment done or you want to make payment you want to sell and buy you want to access your entitlements and so on and so

forth. So in this entire piece of learning is one you need a human loop of trust. That's the most important part. Howsoever digital you can make because the trust will come at the end of it.

The second most important thing is that if you want this information to go to them, you cannot do a one-way highway. You cannot con uh you know consider them only as a consumer to provide

information or sell your product. You also have to create a link which can buy their products and their knowledge and their wisdom and their products and the services and everything. Then it's a

two-way process. The third most important thing is that you cannot push everything the way it should work. You know, you cannot say that everything work on Intel or Google or AI or

whatever, right? Because the consumption of technology has to be frugal and affordable and very basic and that is always whatever whatsoever technology you develop the real requirement is very

basic and that is what we call as digital public infrastructure and that is the learning is that if AI is getting into becoming the pie in the big game of public infrastructure the digital

content must be reliable must be ethical must be serving, must be not capitalist, must be not biased, must not be all those things that we are fearful of and that's what the learning is and that

learning comes from them. So your design has to be bottom up. It cannot be designed in Silicon Valley and then you start pushing and telling that this is the technology even though you are

hallucinating when you are searching on chat GPT you still accept it you know that's that's the fantastic thank you and so much of the conversation today is dominated I think by a few voices

including from the labs who are developing these technology themselves and we need much more from the ground up to influence this as well.

Stella, moving on to you as AI could potentially concentrate wealth. How and I think we want to avoid that concentration, but if that happens, if wealth gets concentrated through AI, how

can direct cash transfer programs serve as an effective redistribution mechanism? And what evidence have you seen from your work that unconditional cash transfers can help workers and

communities adapt during economic transitions or shocks? &gt;&gt; Thank you, Adrian. Before I get into answering the question, I'll also introduce Give

Directly a little bit. For those who don't know, Give Directly is the world's first and largest organization dedicated to cash transfers to people living in extreme poverty and in crisis. And so we

believe in a version similar to the digital empowerment foundation. We believe that recipients deserve the right to decide for themselves how they will respond uh when there are shocks,

how they will adapt, what change means, what the transformation of the economy through AI means. at the last mile. This is not something that we can overengineer insert centralized rooms in

Delhi or DC or other places. This is something that requires all of us to participate uh and have agency in this moment. Give directly has worldwide delivered

about1 billion dollars. I think that's about 10,000 cr rupees to populations across the world including in subsaharan Africa. And our reaction to the debate is that there is a lot of talk about

what is the future of work in the AI era. What is the future of jobs? And we think that actually the emphasis should be more on what is the future of income. And when we talk about policy makers and

we talk about the responsibility of governments, what is important is how do we set up a minimum floor so that when the shock comes, whatever form it might take, whoever it affects, uh that as I

said earlier, those who are vulnerable are not left behind. And in the context of creating a minimum floor in the economy, cash transfers are the most evidencebacked intervention for poverty

alleviation that exists. And more than that in terms of the recent evidence and recent research um and especially the experiences since the co 19 pandemic both here in India and worldwide large

lumpsum cash transfers have a transformative ability to enable people to decide for themselves some kind of productive in investments that they can make start new businesses transform

migrate change adapt uh in ways that are suitable uh to the local context to the individual context as well as to the country context. text as well. Cash transfers are a nuanced policy tool.

When people hear about the work that we do, they think that it's uh it might be easy. It's a blanket statement, but it is as nuanced as a cash for work program, as a voucher program, and it

needs to be carefully designed, taking into account the country context, taking into account the policy objectives, and weighing the pros and cons of lumpsum cash versus recurring cash and the

serious trade-offs that occur when you decide to target one group or saturate uh or otherwise. And so it is a sophisticated policy mechanism that is underutilized and in particular lumpsum

cash is underutilized given the recent evidence uh that it can support resilience. can support transformation and not only that it is dignified, it is appropriate. Uh and we have the entire

payment architecture of the private sector of the remains in industry uh of UPI in India which is doing incredible things uh that can bring cash to the last mile. And so as we talk about uh AI

and a world that invariably is going to concentrate wealth in some places uh we need to have a counterpole coming from policy makers coming from governments uh to be able to raise the income floor and

ensure those who are living in extreme poverty finally have the opportunity to exit. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. And I love that reframing from the future of work to the future of

I think that's very helpful imagining different possibilities fur. Uh what are some of the findings from BCG and I's new report for job creation in the AI economy? What specific policy

interventions do you recommend for countries to simultaneously prepare workers for displacement of operating new opportunities the AI value? &gt;&gt; So [clears throat] I think uh when we

started this work with NIT we actually prioritized the technology sector for our thinking because that's the one that's in the news the most of getting disrupted. So we prioritize that but I

think the thinking uh should apply the framework should apply in other sectors also. Uh given we're talking about AI and jobs. I think the simplest truth that we all agree on is yes, AI will

impact jobs, right? There is no debate about that and especially in the technology sector, we are seeing roles like the the junior engineer, software engineer or the first level customer

support uh executive. I think those jobs are at a risk of you know uh getting disrupted. What we are already seeing at scale in the technology sector are productivity claims of 15 to 20% and and

you know that's also a revelation that it it is actually 15 20% it's far from the kind of claims we see about 50 50% or 80%. I think even with the uh you know technology curve that we are in the

midst of we believe that this is going to reach 30 to 40% by the end of the decade. So that is a given right and that is what gets highlighted in all the news items all the headlines and all the

fear-mongering. But I think what does not get talked about enough is the positive side of AI which we looked at. I think um when we saw I think AI actually has a humongous ability to

create jobs and we are starting to see trends of that. Even World Economic Forum in in its recent report called out that you know they believe about 60 to 70 million jobs getting disrupted but

about 170 million new jobs that can get created using AI right and we actually wanted to double click and see you know hey what are these uh kind of roles that are coming up and so the framework uh

the thinking that we applied was the three W's thing we looked at how work will change for the technology sector how the worker is expected to evolve so what are the skills skill sets they can

let go of. What are the new skill sets they will need to embibe and then what will be the workforce of the future? Will the pyramid look similar? Will the junior to senior ratios change etc.

Right? But from all of that thinking I think uh when we evaluated and looked at how things are going. I think there are three kind of AI roles that are coming up which is real today. Uh first is

enterprise AI. So your your AI product managers, your AI ops engineers, your prompt engineers, all of these roles are big already. They are being hired for by the largest technology companies in the

world. And these were roles that did not exist a few years back. So these are all new roles that are getting created. Second is frontier AI roles. Frontier AI roles are, you know, at the bleeding

edge of technology. So at the intersection of AI and cyber security at the intersection of AI and haptic technology at the intersection of AI and quantum technology even these are

smaller roles right now but they're growing really fast like in the seven to eight months that we took to study on the report the number of jobs in this category already had you know gone more

than twice uh and so it's it's the number of job openings on this frontier AI is growing really very fast and then the third is AI for AI roles the scientists and researchers and engineers

who are actually thinking about the next version of agentic AI right what will be the newer agentic architectures what will the next LLM look like and all of those on this again it's a smaller

category today and it's highly heavily biased towards the western world today but we do believe that there's a lot of innovation and newer roles opportunities coming up in this sector in the eastern

world right uh and so I I think as as I uh you know said in my intro, I think the question for us is not about how AI will let go of jobs. I think it's more about how the global south gets its fair

share among the opportunities of jobs that AI will create. The key challenges when we studied India especially was you know the stock problem which is to say our engineers are not ready who are

employed in the industry. They've not been they're not being trained fast enough. they are still you know used to the way they are uh you know they've been working and uh the reskilling

training programs in the industry today are not fast enough are not comprehensive enough to prepare them uh you know for the future second is the flow problem the new workforce that gets

added to uh you know uh every year to this workforce which are you know our college graduates we don't have AI integrated into the curriculum properly we don't have enough AI PhDs that are

coming out every year in India and I'm assuming in other other developing economies. We don't have AI uh you know AI educated teachers plugged into the curriculum. So that's the second biggest

challenge. And then the third is just the supply demand gap right there are a lot of great researchers India is losing because they're moving out because they have the right incentives, the right

compute infrastructure, the right data sets etc. And so I think you know to your point Adian the the policy interventions uh we came up with were actually uh five-fold. uh one is we have

to become a global magnet of AI talent. Uh China did it recently with their uh talent visa program. They were able to successfully attract back a lot of Chinese talent that had gone abroad. Uh

and similarly India needs to retain and attract global talent that is at the forefront of AI research. To do that we will need the right incentive structures, the right uh infrastructure

of course but that's one. Second, we definitely need to do a revamp of our AI curriculum in our you know school education as well as college education in India. Yes, you can maybe the top

tier colleges which are the top 1 2%. They may have integrated AI curriculum but even they there we don't see enough AI research projects happening and this now needs to go across all of India

colleges which which is a huge task in itself. So just integrating AI curriculum well and then third is participating and working with the industry to actually create the

reskilling programs that are needed. Uh uh fourth and fifth are just absolutely creating the compute infrastructure and providing access to the leading forefront researchers. Fifth is making

sure all the right data sets are in an open-source uh uh environment and available to the researchers for doing that work. But you know through these five interventions which are uh you know

we believe India and maybe other global south countries can actually participate in the job economy that's that's going to open up. &gt;&gt; Fantastic. Thank you. You can anyone can

download the report available for job creation in the AI economy which I recommend. As I know you need to leave in a second so if you need to leave please do. Uh

Rebecca moving on to you. So given the unpredictable nature of AI that we all How can multistakeholder collaboration bring together government society and effective communities help to ensure

that AI leads to prosperity? &gt;&gt; Thanks very much. So I have this honor and privilege to to lead the partnership on AI which is 140 organizations globally across 18

countries who have decided to come together to solve and work on some of the most pressing and complex challenges. And there is probably one that is not more complex than the than

the future of work. And the interesting thing about our organization and multistakeholder work is it brings together very large companies, frontier labs, technology companies, but large

financial services and enterprise companies together with academics and researchers at universities and institutes together with civil society organizations. These are points of view

that are often quite different and it can make for some uncomfortable conversations and yet those are fundamentally the conversations we need to be having. And about five years ago,

our community identified that they wanted to begin to pull together some work on the future of work. and across all those sectors with all the different interests and incentives about what

brought them around the table. They agreed on one thing and that was that if there is any topic in the responsible AI space that feels more inevitable, it is the future of work. We even call it the

future of work. You know, you think about all the other topics we focus on like safety and bias and transparency and explainability, but we call it the future of work as if there is this

inevitable path forward with regard to how AI will replace and automate uh jobs and humans. And the fundamental decision of that group was we need to break down that

assumption and say no, we have a choice. This is similar to what you were saying. We have a choice in determining how AI will impact the work. And that means we need to create spaces where employers

can come together with labor organizations and worker coalitions and individuals and workers can come together as part of that group with policy makers and otherwise. And so out

of that work came a very deep set of what we called shared prosperity guidelines which created space for each of those perspectives to better understand understand and articulate the

the costs associated with AI automation and the opportunities as well. And so this notion of developing job impact assessments to better understand potential impacts on different uh job

categories and then coming out of that how do you just create space for more worker well-being focused initiatives. Yes, productivity and efficiency will come, but how do you do that in a way

that centers the the human needs first? So, we have a our shared prosperity guidelines are online. They're available. We're now in the process of developing some really interesting use

cases from all of those different perspectives about how they have been deployed right now in real world settings. And so, as we move into this next phase of AI development, I think

it's going to be urgent that we create space for these types of multistakeholder conversations to happen and that they happen in an international context where we can learn from each

other about how we will plan for and better understand the nuanced effects and impacts moving forward. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much Thomas. Thank you for waiting patiently. Um what

are some of Switzerland's perspectives regarding AI and social inclusion particularly Yes, thank you. I I'll start with a few particularities of my country that may

not be applicable one to one to any other culture, but may serve or has serve have served as an inspiration in some ways for others. So, Switzerland historically uh is a bunch of poor

farmers living in the mountains um with their most important wish is to be free, not to be told by anyone else what to do. There are two main dangers. There have been two main dangers to this. One

is if an avalanche of snow of water or stones fall on your head from the top of the mountain or if one of the kingdoms or monarchies around us would try to capture us. Um there's only one way to

to survive in this uh in this context is to get to together with your neighbor, help each other. You don't even have to understand or comprehend or be friends with each other. But when a natural or a

human danger comes next to you, you will not survive alone. You can only survive if you get yourself organized. If you know the valley better than the enemy or if you And so this is something that has

shaped our our culture. If you want to be free, if you want to determine your life, you need to cooperate with the people around you. You also treat them nice, need to treat them

nicely because otherwise they may not help you if you're the one that is more in danger than them and so on. So this and that has also shaped our bottom up approach of the of the of the country.

You can't wait for the somebody in the capital to come and help you. You if if the avalanche is coming, you need your neighbor to be there. So you have a tendency to to organize yourself bottom

up. And that also you earn the trust in in in the capability to to organize yourself bottom up, be more agile this way than to wait for for your king to solve all your problems. And that has

shaped a lot of our thinking also with with economic transitions and it has also helped us to create structures where you create incentives for political opponents that are forced to

work together. We have an all party government from socialists to right-wing populists um that share the part of the same government uh also in the parliament. We have a football teams

with people that fight each other politically but in the end they play football or play music or have have a drink together. And this is something that built on mutual respect and also

try to make sure that the majority we have a cultural majority which is German speaking that we have French speaking minority a much small Italian speaking minority and a very small minority of

another language which is 30,000 people but we try to take care of each other in a way that it is acceptable to all to live together. I think this is is one of the the core elements that helped us to

to find solutions, find pragmatic solutions, usually bottom up, they usually don't come from from the government to cope with with with developments. And just one one um nice

example is that uh where there's lots of comparison with the industrial revolution, Switzerland was lagging behind. The Europeans were thinking about building railways around us

because we were nowhere. And then when it started um the the the textile workers that were working at home peacefully they uh asked the government of Turk the local government to prohibit

factories and to said we can't prohibit progress because this is more efficient. So the textile workers went and burned down the factory. This is 200 years ago. They

couldn't stop the progress. But what made the difference is that they organized themselves as a labor movement as a political labor movement and ask for fair share of the productivity

gains. So that not just the owner of the factory got everything and they lost all quality of life that they previously had. And the good thing was that the also the the political parties that

represent the interest of the factory owners and the farmers accepted there's a new group of people and they also have a right to live in dignity and they included them. It took them some time

but after a few decades they included them in a political system and this this understanding of no matter what happens you need to be able to discuss in your society and now with globalization you

can't do this just only a national level it's a global issue you need to discuss about understand what is going on and what is a fair reaction to it so that no one is left behind and again this is

this is we need to understand what is going on develop scenarios and then discuss them together and say Okay. What what is what is acceptable to all? If this happens, how should we react and

try to get a significant strongly coalition of the willing together to actually go in in such a direction? &gt;&gt; Fantastic. Thank you. So, we've heard a range of perspectives there, but some

some very good themes. I don't want to we did start a little bit late and I don't want to eat into the next panel's time too much, but I just like to ask the panel of quick fire.

said we diversity of thinking. What's one concrete recommendation that you would give to policy makers in the global south right now? &gt;&gt; So being a policy maker, I give myself

that advice. I I think especially on the global staff um no one can do it alone. I think collaboration and partnership is the key things. what we did with no we willing to share and to share it to

other countries that might be interesting. We're also willing to learn uh from the other countries and in term of digital public infrastructure in term of AI capability and collaboration for

sure &gt;&gt; collaboration. Thank you. &gt;&gt; I heard a lot of uh resonance in some ways uh from the other panelists in terms of empowering the last mile uh and

leading the moment in ways that are not too centralized. And so one recommendation I do think makes sense and inspired as well by our our work with uh the government of Togo and the

new platform is that I do think that policy makers should be thinking about building out the payment pipes. Um it is inspiring to see the developments that have happened in India with UPI uh and

how far it's come since COVID. Uh really inspirational uh for me as someone who saw it before then. um and not just developing payment pipes in the traditional way um but applying AI for

good to be able to dynamically adaptively build the shock responsive social protection systems that the government of Togo is building at this point because we both need to build

resilience uh but also enable ourselves uh to be ready to adapt for what comes which industries is it going to hit uh who's it going to hit uh and to know how to pivot and twist because we do live in

an uncertain world for many reasons uh that that we all know beyond that I would also add uh that when it comes to using cash as a mechanism uh and as a policy tool uh it's important that we

think about who are we including and who are we not when we talk about work and the future of the work who are the people that are working it's the informal workers certainly in India and

also other places who are not part of the formal government systems uh who will sooner or later also be affected um by what is happening in this moment and when we have a program like cash

transfers as I said that may not the shifts in how people work. But it does cause it can cause both the security of income that is required to be able to make the leap to new industries to new

types of work uh to new drivers of economic change. uh as well as build the core resilience so that when shocks come uh when there are changes and losses of income and changes in like the

macroeconomic structure of the world uh that individuals uh and households and communities are better equipped to save, better equipped to build productive assets, better equipped uh to be

entrepreneurs and to start new businesses that are more relevant uh in the current era and better as the ambassador said to band together in a decentralized fashion and decide what

makes sense at the last mile. Whether that is migrating, whether that's starting a new business, whether that's saving, whether that's stopping to work, uh a sort of basic income, uh that

serves the extreme poor is is how we can get there. &gt;&gt; Fantastic. Thank you. I can see the next panel are eager to start, so I'm going to be unfair and force a sort of 10 from

our last. What's the one recommendation you &gt;&gt; uh I'll just say that I think it has to be a bottomup initiative. U you know, maybe just rethinking skills to job

compact for the five industries which employ the most folks in India. What are the future skill sets that will be required? How will we train for it? And how will you create demand incentives to

hire locally? &gt;&gt; Fantastic. Thank you, Rebecca. &gt;&gt; Policy makers need information. They need better data about what is happening right now. Prioritize putting in place

multistakeholder approaches that can provide early warning signals as to what effects are happening. make sure these multistakeholder processes are designed with workers not for them but with them

engaged at the beginning so their voices are heard. &gt;&gt; Thomas thank you. I I would say also um education, education, education, but also fight corruption because if you

make sure that every country has talents that your talents no matter where they are born in what society, what color of the skin and so on, if talents have a chance to succeed, then this is

something that every country or every society and every economy benefits from. If you have to fulfill codes in order to succeed, you don't normally don't get the best ideas and the best people to to

make. &gt;&gt; Fantastic. Thank you. Well, that's been a really rich conversation. Thank you, and thank you for joining us. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much, Adrian, and thank you

to the panel. As an expression of our gratitude, I'd just like to give out the momentos. And I'd request everyone to please leave the hall uh right now. We have another session starting in a

minute. Thank you. Thanks a lot. &gt;&gt; [music]
