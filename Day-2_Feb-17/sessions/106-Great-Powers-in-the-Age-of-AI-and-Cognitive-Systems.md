## 📝 Transcript

rivalry between great powers and what that will do to to peace or prosperity or freedom in the world. Um we're launching a report which which you will see is available um on isi.global.

It compares countries and companies and it looks into the future of technology and it identifies 19 core technologies that are shaping that future. Within that it identifies six including

AI that we think will be the subject of the most fierce competition in history to see if they can control this a this technology and how it is diffused and distributed across the planet.

This these six technologies have been benchmarked in detail in our report and the findings are quite stark. What I'll do is step back from that and say to you um the report can be read in two ways.

You could read the report as somebody technical who's saying which technologies do we need to invest in and where do we stand as a country and where do our companies stand against other

companies. But there is a very different way to read this report. This report also says that the great transition from the industrial age to the information age is not about to happen. and it's

already happened. We're in the middle of that transition now, which is why it is so disruptive to be in the middle of this transition. It also says that at this stage, if you

took a snapshot, you can tell who is going to win and who is going to lose. It tells you though that the future is not predetermined. But it is clear that some countries are very far ahead of

others. I will um be unkind and just say amongst those countries leading the US and China are leading the EU is a is an important third player

but there is nobody else even close. So this conference is probably telling you the most important thing to know about AI is diffusion. That it should be diffused to everybody. And what this

report tells you is that is not at all the most important thing about AI. That diffusion is something that can be used to make sure everybody in this room and everybody outside has AI. But the

purpose of AI is not systems or technology. The purpose of AI is power, enormous wealth beyond any imagination and the ability to control people. It is quite a stark contrast from

thinking this is a technological shift. This is not a technological shift. This is a civilizational shift. We as a species are changing from thinking we should turn up to factories to work to

turning up somewhere else anywhere you want with a phone. And in that phone is your AI is your social media is everything you do. And this AI in your phone and on the end of

every social media is clever enough to get to understand you. It is so smart that it understands you as a human being. It starts to understand your preferences. And what is more perhaps

smart about this technology is it starts to change your preferences and you end up being something other than you were before you started using it. This is why it's so clever. So the

analogy I would like to give you is there would have been a point in time during the industrial revolution when the Europeans had cracked industrial manufacturing and they'd crack the

energy sources required to scale that. And what they would have done is they would have said where are the countries around the world where we should take this and they would have arrived on the

shores of many countries including India and they would have come as traders just to trade. And that trade would have been a trade that the Indians in those days and in Africa and in Australia and

everywhere else would have thought they wanted and they would have taken that trade and in the process of that trade they would have become dependent on on the Europeans and the Europeans would

have ended up conquering them because of this technology that they had which were guns and ships and the ability to build factories. This is no different. In fact, this is much more powerful with

this new technology with AI and social media. I don't need to send an army to your country. I don't need to administer your country. I can sit at home in Shenzhen or Silicon Valley somewhere or

in Germany or anywhere else where I can develop this technology. I will give it to you and you will think it's free and you will absolutely fall in love with it and become addicted. And in that

addiction, as you use it, the technology will get to know you. I'm going to explain a small piece from a neuroscience perspective in terms of what happens. So part of your brain is a

learning part. It's the learning system of the brain that starts to learn how to use this technology. But at the same time, the technology is learning you. So it has gone inside your brain and it

changes your neurology. It changes the chemicals and the biology and the structure of the brain. And two things are happening at once. One, it is reducing your ability to think and

reflect on what you are seeing because it requires you to react instantly. That instant reaction is an addiction. So when we measure it with neuroscience, we find it's an addiction. The people

who have it look just like addicts of drugs and alcohol and so on. You can't stop using it. That's very important because once you start using it, they send you more and more information. So

you use it more. On average in the world, people use it seven hours a day. So we're using this technology already that much. So here's what happens next. The structure of your brain changes. So

it stops thinking too much and another part of your brain starts to react and consume. As that happens and it sends you more and more information and your behaviors change, your beliefs change.

In fact, your identity changes. You build allegiances to things you didn't have. You buy things you don't need, and you start to hate people who don't believe the same things as you. So, this

is the power of this technology. So, what happens sitting somewhere in Silicon Valley or Shenzhen is I've owned your brain, your mind. You don't know it. This is the most

powerful thing. You don't know you. I've owned it. You think you have free choice. But you don't have free choice anymore. But you think you do. That's why it's so powerful. Why did countries

rise and throw over colonial regimes? Because they knew they were being controlled. And someday they wake up and they say, "We fight back." But this, you don't do that because you believe you're

in charge. You believe you're a free agent. You have free speech and you control your own future. But you don't. This is how clever the the psychology and the neuroscience of this technology

is. The numbers in our report are very clear. There are five metrics to decide who is ahead and who is behind. These are very clear. America is ahead on all five.

China is there on three of them, but very close on the next two. The Europeans have two and a half and are catching up slowly but bit slowly. The Americans are superb at certain things.

A commercializing foundational research, building an ecosystem, marketing it around the world. They're very good at these things. And so we all end up wanting it. Me too. I'm in the same

position as you. So we all want it and we think it's progress. And there is progress. Then the progress is big. I will say this. Where is India in this? Nowhere. We do not have the quality,

depth and breadth, the foundational research to play in this game. So what are we? We're just a huge market. This country is a huge market that needs this technology, but it does not have

the foundational research to allow it to be a leader. So we will have to borrow that from the rest of the world. So in this platform everywhere in these stages they will tell you that without this

technology you're in trouble. Well you are because you'll fall behind. So you have to have it. So when you look on here and your WhatsApp feed comes who owns that WhatsApp feed? It is not you.

It is somebody else somewhere else. So there is a scenario that we describe in the report which goes like this. If I'm America and China and I have this technology, what is my purpose? To

distribute it, diffuse it all over the planet and I have everybody buying it. No armies, remember, no administration, just sitting there marketing it and you become a trillionaire. Right? So that's

one part of the story. The second part of the story is that if the EU and the UK so Europe and India combine that's two billion people and across the five metrics they have enough to create a

third way. So there is a third axis that can be built but it requires Europeans and Indians to be able to work together because on the one hand you have you do have foundational research. On the other

hand, this country has the depth of STEM talent has global distribution through IT services and other things and actually they they know and they crave independence right so you combine these

two you have the biggest pool of the third axis of AI in the world but requires you to work together and do that for that I would say the following do we need a thousand of us or 100,000

people to decide that no you need a dozen people in a room to get together and figure out how you create that third axis and to kick off that dialogue um I have the most wonderful panel so I'm

going to describe them to you then join them and start asking the questions so first here we have Glenn Gaffffne Glenn Gaffne knows this subject enormously well if you watch how many of you watch

James Bond films every single individual I hope has seen one at least right you know there's a gentleman called Q in those films he the American you. So he was at the CIA for

30 years. He headed science and technology at the CIA. His job was every kind of technology on the planet to find the best there is on the planet and figure out how to use it for America.

So that's that's the job that he did. He left and for 8 to 10 years um Glenn also handled how do you how do you find these technologies in the planet? How do you incubate them, get them funded and

scaled? while he was at the CIA also handed data and intelligence. So here's a man who really understands this subject well. Um here we have uh Gary Jacobs. Gary uh has

lived in India for over 50 years. He arrived because he believes India has the answers to the deepest questions of humanity. Um he fell in love and he stayed. He heads something called the

World Academy of Art Science. They're a partner organization of of of mine and we're a partner of theirs. Gary heads um the whole organization which was established by Einstein

Oenheimer and Burton Russell because after all the things they did creating the nuclear weapons uh and the war that happened afterwards they wanted someone who would hold the peace and so this

man's job is peace and prosperity and freedom for the rest of us and himself. And um third we have my very close friend Sharia Duval. Sharia is a former banker and investor um in the India

foundation is the co-founder of the India foundation is an economist too and is is a man who has a deep interest civilizationally of India and what it means for India going forward. So we

have a great and very interesting panel to discuss this topic. So, I'm going to kick off and start asking the questions and hopefully we'll keep you all stuck here and uh tell you some things about

what we see. Thank you, [applause] Glenn. I'm going to kick off on the topic um of sovereignty. Is it possible to have sovereignty

for a nation when they do not control the most important points of control, choke points in the world, whether it's semiconductors or its software and applications or or it's the machinery

that underlies it. Is it possible? &gt;&gt; Um so the short answer I think is no. Um I think the the short answer here is where does sovereignty lie? Um it lies with whoever owns the infrastructure

through which your attention, your action, your decision making, your follow on execution flow. we we have created such complex infrastructures

um and the technology now as as Katan was just saying is it's we're going through this massive shift and if we're not paying close attention if we're not purposeful in how we

navigate through this transition we could be in real trouble I'm not throwing in the towel I wouldn't be here if I was throwing in the towel um but I am here right to ring a bell that

[clears throat] says we have to be paying paying attention to this and working cooperatively with industry, government, and academia to solve these problems. The tech is not just a tool

anymore, right? I grew up I'm a technologist by trade and training, right? Um and so many of my technologist colleagues say it's just a tool, but it's far more than a tool, right? Um

and it's neither good nor evil. But the reality is that the way the markets have developed over the last 20 years, the way we have fallen into bad habits

of consumerism, the way we have begun to worship at the altar of ridiculously high finance, worship at the altar of efficiency. We've created an appetite for these

things that puts a set of conditions that challenges our very understanding and is beginning to affect, as Katan said, the cognitive abilities that we have. Just think about how much shorter

our attention spans have gotten in the last 10 years. And so, we live with this set of conditions that challenge our understanding of sovereignty. Um and I

don't think we have had the discussions about sovereignty that at this level um since the days of uh the Westfallian you know peace accord right in 1400 right we're at issues of national sovereignty

individual sovereignty the sovereignty of the people and what's interesting is that the there are very few who actually own that infrastructure

who own the stack. And that stack is a primary basis of influence because if you own the stack and you control the data, you control the message,

you control the model, if you have if if we as we develop the age of agentic AI and all of the positives that come with it, if we realize that

those agents and you're going to have multiple agents, you're going to have an agent for work, you might have an agent for school. You'll have an agent for entertainment. You'll have an agent for

anyone of a number of different things. They'll be your agents and they'll be tuned, as Kitan said, uniquely to you. But who owns your digital persona? And what's the business model

that's actually supporting you having that agent? And if it's intended to influence you in a certain way, then where's your sovereignty?

And so at the heart of this, we start talking about individual agency and we start talking about agency in society. And now we're having a different conversation. And so many of our

government leaders are pulling the very familiar levers. And so we're either overregulating or underregulating as we just heard in the last panel.

And that's not good enough anymore because the economics of the last industrial revolution are not the economics of the next industrial revolution or the sindustrial revolution

as I'm increasingly calling it because it's all synthetic. And so now is the time for us to come together and actually wrestle with these questions and think about what it means

to partner with these large companies that actually operate more like countries today than they do companies. And it's the basis of those partnerships in goodwill.

It's the basis of those partnerships that wrestles with these questions that adjusts both the economic model or the business model and what we mean and what we can preserve relative to sovereignty

going forward. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Um thank you Glenn. I'm going to come back to this. I'm just going to ask each of you to to answer a first question just to warm up. So, um, Gary,

I I've I've got a question for you that I think really does focus on on your expertise. Um, at what point does optimization of behavior cross the line into loss of autonomy and effectiveness

and creativity and human development? &gt;&gt; That's a really central question for us. Is AI the biggest best thing that's ever happened to us? Or is it the thing that poses the greatest threats to humanity?

Why is it that we lead in live in a time of unprecedented technological and economic development and yet instead of everybody walking around with a smile on their face and saying the future is

golden to wondering what's going to happen tomorrow what's going to happen with our government katan said that America is number one but I don't know if said what number one and what right

now I We're number one in turbulence and confusion. [laughter] And I don't think a lot of Americans feel very number one right now because with all this technology, with all the economic growth

and everything, who's the winner in this? And what's the reason for this ripples of turbulence spreading around the whole world? And AI is not our problem.

Technology has never been our problem. Technology is the thing from the time we invented agriculture 10,000 years ago or writing or language or money or any of these things. The question is how do we

use it and is money the thing that empowers us and certainly it has empowered tremendous progress of humanity over thousands of years. We can exchange with each other. We don't have

to just have barter. uh we can be trading skills, trading capacities, trading endowments in everything or we can be dominated by the money. We can be ruled by the money instead of because

that's all we want rather than the human uh the human opportunities that we have as people. So the question I don't think is even about just to be a little contentious even about the companies.

It's a question of how do we respond? Do we understand that the technology that's being used now by the companies as as Glenn said is largely taking advantage of our capacity

to submit to submit our freedom to whatever we hear or whatever we get when we're on social media or of of any description because we're under the mistaken

impression that when I ask a question it's going to give me uh something that's valid. And most of us don't realize that when I ask a question, it's going to tell me

the thing that makes me come back and ask another question. It's going to tell me what it thinks I want to hear, or rather what I'm really interested in, and I can't resist asking another

question. And if it's on YouTube when they say we're going to give you an answer to the solution of uh of eternal life or what or living a hundred years, then what's that answer? Well, you got

to wait for about 45 minutes to find out that it's don't eat walnuts or something like that. Why didn't they tell me in the first minute that it wasn't eating walnuts? Simple. Because they're earning

money for every minute that I'm on the line. They keep me stretched out as long as I can. If I don't know that, if I think the headlines, whether it's in the newspaper and the social media or on

YouTube or whatever it is, mainly desired is how can I even know that the YouTube uh was earning advertising revenue from every minute I'm there on the thing. And their goal is to keep me

as long as possible, not to tell me what I want to know. So, that's our responsibility. We need to know where we're vulnerable to. Our attention is very valuable. The

human attention is the most valuable thing in the world. And social media enables us enables the the environment to harness our attention to such an extent that whether it's our kids or at

any other age, we can't resist the temptation to go back to it. We're being manipulated. We're being told what we want to uh tell. If I'm in a political party and if I'm in an extreme position,

I want to hear all the news that reinforces my side and I want to hear all the news that slanders and proves that the other side and that's the polarization we're

having in the society today. How do we solve that? as long as I want to be told what I want to believe rather than what's the truth. And that's our educational system. Has it really taught

us to understand the world we live in and the power of attention now and how we have to use our attention responsibly and not ask me what I want to believe in. Tell me more about uh that I'm right

and the other people are wrong. Uh tell me what's true. And that's we come out of this polarization. We come out of this being a victim when what we really want to

know is the fact and the truth. Including if my my enemy or the guy on the other side is got a a right position and and really I should understand him, not just be justified that I'm right and

somebody else is wrong. So our educational system has to really prepare us not to be caught in in this division. It's not the AI but AI gives the empowerment for us to be caught in it.

And right now we're it's new like most technologies. We're not sure. We don't know whether the AI for a lot of people they're hoping this is going to be a greater a better job for them because

they're just entering and they've studied AI and for decades of people who have been in the workforce are wondering when the AI is going to replace them and take them away and they lose their

autonomy they lose their freedom because they don't have the skills that the AI has but I'd just like to put one more point whether AI is the goal golden solution

for us or not depends on how we use it. If we're trying to h hang on to the work that we're doing now and the world as we're doing it now, whether we're a teacher or a doctor or anybody else, AI

is going to start taking away from us the things that we've done. like we don't use the uh the li the slide rule anymore when we got a calculator and we don't

even need the calculator when we've got a a mobile phone and technology replaces so many things but so we can develop higher order skills and capacities and the question is how do we do that and

our education can't stop just with the the number of years in college we've got to be keep learning through our life so I think the real answer is for us and and how to prepare our society and

ourselves to live in this high-tech world and take it for maximum advantage rather than be be taken advantage of. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you Gary. There was a lot of there were a lot of points in

that. We're going to unpack those in a moment. But I I want to come to Sharia. Sharia um how can India avoid being locked into control points that other people have set so the pathway that

other peoples have set and how can it avoid losing its autonomy its agency and sovereignty in the process what are your thoughts thank you ketan for that question that's a it's a very relevant

question because you know considering that India represents about nearly 20% of humanity and is the fourth largest going to be the third largest economy. India is a very big market and therefore

both u the powers that be maybe China or the United States would like to tap this market would like to take away the agency of this market would try to exploit this market that's what all

colonization is about it's about being able to acquire new markets and substantial markets and drive the resources of that market from the periphery to the center so India must

first recognize that India actually does because of its size it scale scale and its opportunity possess uh a a target for these uh for it the loss of its strategic autonomy and then it must take

measures uh to ensure that as you said that it does not fall prey to that its choke points its control points are being taken over by other powers and as Glenn rightly pointed out what are the

elements of how your sovereignity is is taken away so the first thing is that India must own its own infra it's India must be the infra must reside in India with the Indians that's the first point

if we control our infra then we don't allow our information and our data to keep going moving to where if infra doesn't exist the second thing is we need to own our own R&amp;D we need to be

researching and developing technologies and solutions that are relevant for us rather than other markets telling us what is important for us and us becoming consumer consumers u to fund this infra

and fund this R&amp;D we then need our own domestic capital we need our own domestic savings we need capital sovereignity because as long as we don't have capital sovereignity we will be u

uh you know we will be subject to us as being uh to foreign powers who will deploy their capital for their for their agendas and for their interests. Um we also need to control the data because in

this fire in this business data is the new oil. So we need to control our own data. We need to ensure that access to our data is is is is with us and we are able to work on that data for building

our own models and our own uh solutions. And then finally I think we need the right policies. The government needs the right policies at every point in time and it's an evolving scenario where it

is collaborative. We want to work with all the countries in this in this world in developing. I think this is a AI is a great enabler for humanity but at the same time we need policies that protect

India's interests and that ensure that India doesn't end up being just a market for for for the rest of the world for for these powers. And I think this is going to be India's biggest challenge

because it it requires a big laundry list of things that it must acquire and do uh real time because this is being done and fought as we speak today. And I think this whole AI u summit that is

being held in this capital is really bringing awareness to India and to Indians about the opportunity and the risk that this emerging scenario possesses for uh for all nations but

definitely for great powers and nations like India and particularly as India aspires to be one of the global players in the next 25 years. &gt;&gt; I'm going to ask Glenn just to jump in.

Um Glenn, why don't you jump in because I think that's linked. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it is. Um thank you. Um so I want to add to what Sherry was just saying because um not only is India not just a

market, India should not be a subcontractor right to the other leaders right in the world in this space. We need India to not be a subcontractor in this space.

Um, AI is a generalpurpose technology and those come along maybe once in a lifetime for most of us. It's like electricity, right? A general purpose technology is

something that changes every other market that it touches. It's fundamentally different than other tech. Now, every national strategy that's out

there today talks about adoption as a key metric for AI. And that's a good thing. But adoption and diffusion are two different things because when you have a general purpose technology,

history shows that it's the quality of the education system that actually moves that general purpose technology into all of those other markets most effectively. It's not who gets there first,

right? And right now, every market, every competition, and every policy that I see nation by nation is going against leading sector theory, which is you get there first, you monopolize it, you

drive the market, and you make a lot of money off of it. But history shows that it's not who gets there first that wins. It's who diffuses into that space. And this is a challenge for democracies

because democracies are inefficient by design. We want them that way. And so in this battle, in this race, we're going to have autocracies

or techocracies that try to drive in a specific area and may gain for a time, but our ability to actually think through some of the points that Sher was

talking about and actually focus on this diffusion and begin to change some of those models, right? Because these some of these big I don't want to paint the big tech companies as evil or wrong

here. Right? Like I said, it's not a matter of good or evil. It's a matter of this is just where we are. But they will work with folks who actually have reasonable conversations and concerns

about sovereignty and what sovereignty means moving forward. What is it? What does agency look like going forward? what is and and creating new market e economics in this space opens up new

opportunity. Um I I'm going to add to that before I ask the next question of my colleagues. Um which is um this this next phase of diffusion

and colonization of the mind is different because you begin by colonizing your own people because you give them the technology and they use it. So it's very different. Before you

thought what you had to do is go to another country to colonize them because they were different. They were foreigners. But not with this technology. You give it to your own

people. They become addicted. They make you rich. That gives you the money to go and do it elsewhere. And so everybody gets colonized. So this is very different. So we we've got to understand

what it is to actually figure out what to do with it. But um as we know each technology can cut both ways and it can lead to massive improvements in life, right? that not every technology becomes

a weapon, right? So, you know, there's another side to this technology. So, this same technology can actually unlock human minds, can improve our education, change our experiences, enlighten us so

that we become much more enriched human beings. And I want Gary to comment on that. Gary, this technology cuts both ways. What is the other side of this technology?

&gt;&gt; A lot of A lot of people in the world are frightened now about what AI is going to take away from them and make us superolous of different ages for

different reasons. Uh for the doctor who used to be reading the all of the test results and everything and the X-rays and everything else, now there's a machine that can do it. uh and and the

radiologist does loses his job or doesn't have to do it and everything. There's always that. But you know, if you look at the history of technology, it's always been that way. Each time

something new came, those who were comfortable or organized at the previous level. uh when Plato said more than two 2,000 years ago that uh this writing is really not good because then people will

stop memorizing and for him memorization was learning you know and that's what all it's all about. uh and that's happened at every when the printing press came then the

professor is not just somebody who knows what nobody else knows and he can tell you because anybody can read it for themselves whether it's religious text or anything else. The question is what

do we do with this greater power we have? What we do, what human beings do gradually is we give up doing a lot of the things we used to do like working in

the field and plowing the fields ourselves or pulling the bulocks ourselves or uh and so we can do something else. We can do something higher than that. Uh there was a story

of a Harvard MBA who decided at the after graduation that he wanted to start a business and he bought 500 acres of land in a in a country in a part of the country which was not uh where land was

cheap and he was managing 500 acres with himself and one man because he could do so much of it with the technology. He was the entrepreneur. He had time to think and market and create new crops

and other things. had time to read because the machinery could do so much of it. So the question is how do we do what do we do with the capacity that AI gives us? One of the problems we have

today is the growth of information is so great that nobody in any field can keep up with the pace of new information. So what do you do? You become more and more a specialist. And a specialist knows

more than anybody else does about this particular field. But the problem is knowledge today in the world. We have to know about everything. We have to know how it's interconnected. The specialist

who's trying to keep up with his unique field can never keep up can never keep track of what's going on because all things are developing now. So much information. AI can liberate us from the

limitations of specialization because AI can think out of the box. It thinks out of the disciplinary silo which none of us can do and and and consider all the possibilities about it.

Then what do we do? If we don't have to be studying and memorizing specializ just specialized information, what do we do? We get more time to think. We get more time to think creatively. we make

more type time to ask questions that are just beyond the information of a narrow field. How is this connected with that and this is connected with that? So I think this is a natural and very healthy

opportunity for us to develop higher order and our our education won't be again learning how to use a calculator or even learning how to code. That's not a bad thing because if we don't know

have to worry about how learning how to code, we can be creating new new new tools. Uh we can be figuring out applications for new tools like AI for example like that. This is how we've

evolved up until now from the time it was all physical. Now it's mental. Now we can spend more of our term learning how for human skills, for in interactive skills, for communication skills, for

understanding ourselves and other people and not just memorizing uh what's going on in the educational system. I think it is a positive great opportunity if we rise to the occasion. But we need help.

We need not education just for a few years. We need education to take us through our life so we can be continuously learning as we go forward and thinking too.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you. See, we do have positive views. It's not all about being colonized. I'm going to I'm going to ask a question which uh both Shuria and Glenn if you

would weigh in on which is um AI is just the beginning of the six technologies that we identify which determine the future. And so being behind in AI is is awful because it is the general purpose

technology as Glenn said. But the next one is maybe quantum and then there's fusion and then there's gene editing and the sixth one is extended reality. Each of these are at different stages of

fruition. But imagine a world where the AI is so clever. It helps us make the breakthroughs in quantum and helps us make the breakthroughs in fusion and then it helps us make breakthroughs in

gene editing which aren't just about human extension, life extension, but are actually about creating new species and it changes our view of reality because of extended reality, VR and AR and other

forms of immersive reality. Now, there's a point at which these technologies are so advanced. If you're a country that is behind on any of them, you're too far behind. Now, this comes back to maybe

Glenn, you take it first. In this fight for all six, the foundational research has been done by Americans and Chinese. Chinese have invested for 15 years. They know patiently, strategically, the

Chinese know that winning the first battle, the first mover, as you said, is meaningless, is not good enough. They're a very smart second mover. So, how should a country like India for

example be thinking about this portfolio of six that will be the base of transforming everything? &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, uh, it's a great question and, um,

&gt;&gt; I don't ask easy questions. Let's just see what he says. &gt;&gt; Yeah, this we could spend the rest of the day talking about this, but, um, to make it brief, I think one of the things

that's key, and Katan said it about how AI can really help and enable so many of these other areas, but if we think about quantum, it's not just quantum compute that's really the exciting thing here.

It's all the other quantum inspired things that come from the pursuit of quantum. We understand things about physics today that we didn't understand a few years ago because we've got

brilliant engineers and brilliant physicists working together. And there's things that we thought were noise that we're learning now are different physical properties that we didn't know

because we didn't see it at that level before. And so just like it AI can be empowering and pulling signal out of noise in a medical file in an image, it's helping

us in these other areas as well. China has done a great job in letting the US and others right lead in some of the leading edge research and they just operationalize that breakthrough faster

than anybody else. Another way to say it is they ma they be they've become masters at applying research into the areas that matter. And I think this applied research space is

really the critical space for diffusion that I just talked about and for the development of these next generation economies. And we have to do it in a way that we actually are educating our

public the people who actually are affected by the decisions that are going to be made from these machines. Um virtual reality, extended reality, right? An incredible [snorts] tool for

education. We're already seeing that students who actually go through a virtual reality experience and understand the context for the complex learning that they have

to do so much better in school with the mundane classes that everyone hates. You still have to pass biochemistry, but you don't mind it as much when you understand contextually that you're

solving for saving an ecosystem that matters. And when you have that experience, it makes it part of who you are and the way that you then approach those issues going forward. And I think

this is important because I really think experiential learning is the future of And so experiential learning whether it's through VR, AR or it is through other avenues of applied science in

markets doing it with the public right in order to build trust for the public that has to live with the decisions that get made by these autonomous or augmented systems is really key right.

So where should we be? We should be focusing on these applied areas for the markets that each country thinks are important for their future. If it's about manufacturing, then manufacturing.

If it's about energy, energy is going to be across all of these things. It's a gamecher, right? Um manufacturing, mining, agriculture. Pick your spots, right? Do the applied research. Build

trust. Understand what a reasonable failure looks like in this space. We all talk about success, but there's reasonable failures that that can be developed that you can learn from in

this space. If you don't take the time to learn from them, then that failure, I believe, might cause a localized AI winter in certain markets because the catastrophic effect, people will back up

from it. And we've already had too many false starts in bio. I don't think we can afford another one. as an example. And so applying this work in these key market

areas, doing it in a way that actually builds trust, allowing government to actually develop more flexible policies that actually develop and and enable at the speed of a market development I

think is key for us and democracies actually working in common markets and sharing their results actually takes some of the inefficiency of the democratic system and speeds it up for

everybody. Sure. I'm going to ask you to come in in the following way. Um, China 15 years ago and we were part of helping China to think about that from where I was at the

time had a tech strategy that said in 5 years we're going to get to here. 10 we're going to get to here. 15 we're going to get to here. And their objective was autonomy. They didn't want

dependence on foreigners at that time for for the core technology. uh uh we might benefit from the fact that this generation of AI is expected to consume if they project it out by 2030 so not

far away 14% of all energy made in America and there's a report that says if you project that out to 2040 it's 28%. Now, a technology that consumes somewhere between 14 and 28%.

Is is not really a viable species. This this is a dinosaur that's eating too much and is going to die. So, not being first, not being second might not count as long as you are third though with the

right answer. Can India do you think forge the relationships with Europe in particular that has the technology and the science and with others Canadians, Australians, Japanese

but Europe has most our benchmarking shows Europe is not far the UK and the EU. Do you think we can do that in India? Um absolutely ket as the report points out not only should

India uh India can do that India should do that because um I think u you know India will need collaboration uh because it's running against time you know as as as to in particularly in

India's context we need to do two things in parallel we need to in the short run build those fundamental capacities for R&amp;D for learning for our coming generations so that we are able to

create these technologies and solutions internally. But that's a long-term project. I mean that's a project that India should have started uh like China you said 15 years ago to have maintained

its strategic autonomy today. But uh India is coming a little bit late to the game and therefore India is now doing the corrective measures to to try and at least uh ensure that going into the

future we don't give away we give away our you know we just don't produce as as as subcontractors for the rest of the world. We actually are doing fundamental research and fundamental work in our own

country. But while we are doing that um we also can't ignore the fact that this fight is this race is happening real time. So we need to find strategic partners who will help us um meet the

the the the you know the the the coming wave from the United States and China. And in that I think we have uh potential partners in the European Union and the UK who can be sort of complimentary to

what uh we can provide. uh these people have already some deep technologies R&amp;D but they don't have very deep markets and therefore their collaboration with India becomes an obvious choice they are

equally concerned about what is happening with the United States and China coming to their markets so this could be a coalition of the willing uh in the and in the medium to short term

it buys India time it buys India's time to build its more fundamental defenses against this kind of an onslaught so you're absolutely right that I think in the short run India India will have to

look for uh partners like the EU and the UK because as I said they bring in capital they can bring in R&amp;D they can bring uh they can bring uh you know somewhat energy as well that we need

because in the short run to produce this kind of thing we need and India is an energy deficient country we need to be able to ensure that we have energy supplies to be able to play this. So I

think I think that uh that India among the sort of the whole host ofund and or whatever 200 nations in around the world India's choices here right now in this are quite limited to some big players

like the EU and the UK uh because both America and China are definitely not going to collaborate with India on this. &gt;&gt; Thank you Sharia. Um we're in the last five minutes. I'm just going to ask each

of my colleagues here to uh to say something so that we we've heard their final thoughts on this before I take one question from actually why don't I take one question from the audience first

anyone &gt;&gt; gentleman there you were first the with the beard Uh so this week there were two interesting statements. One was from

Marco Rubio at Munich Security Conference uh almost uh wishfully talking about the imperialistic time and so on. The second one was from the second one was from Dario anthropic

CEO in which he explicitly talked about regime changes uh using AI. Um what are your reactions? Um, Glenn, would it be unfair to ask you

that question? It would be. You relax. So, um, our reaction is the following. If I have penetrated your mind and changed your beliefs, I can get you to revolt against your government.

And so, one of the most fundamental uses of AI is to shape your mind to do what you shouldn't do. Right? So, it is a basic tool which in the old days would have been propaganda. It was just not

very efficient. This is highly effective as it all. And it's accessible to anybody. Right? And so what what was the purview of nation states relative to what was

called influence operations is now an economy. It's an influence economy. Right? I mean, think about it. We call them influencers and they make a lot of money, right? And so now if you actually

have a plan to put this into place and use that infrastructure for to exert your will on a public right if you actually have the opportunity to control the data sets that are behind these

pieces you begin to rewrite history and control the data and the in and influence the way people are processing it going forward. So um that's my answer to that that question. It was unfair to

ask him, but I'm glad he answered. I There are so many hands up. I know we could go for another hour, but we're not allowed to because as the moderator, I have to make room for the next one. And

I'm just going to say this that you know the the the most valuable thing in the world going forward. We know it's not oil for sure, right? And uh we think it's data, but it's attention.

If I capture your attention, right, I start to own your brain. And here's a scary part. If I capture your attention and I change your behavior, there's a genetic marker

called an epigenetic. It captures that behavior and you pass it to your kids. So, don't lose sight of how profound the change is in the world and what it means for you and your kids. Without agency,

you're not human anymore. And we're on that brink, civilizational brink. I'm going to ask each of my my colleagues here. We're all part of the institute that is issuing this report to uh or

directors in that to uh say one positive thing that we can do to make the world better. So, I'm going to start with uh Glenn, why Glenn, why don't you do it and just pass it along.

&gt;&gt; Oh, I don't have a positive one. Sorry. the um the my point here is on I'm going to try to make it a positive um which is I believe that cognitive sovereignty is

an inalienable right and if it's not then I don't know what an inalienable right really is. We have a choice and I believe in the power of human

agency and the power of partnership in order to come together as society, right, and rewrite the social contract, right, for what it means to actually move forward with these technologies to

create the better geopolitical systems that provide what it says on the wall behind us, welfare for all, happiness for all. &gt;&gt; [applause]

&gt;&gt; short positive &gt;&gt; short very positive uh I don't have time to say how positive it is I think India has an opportunity to set the model for the future of

higher ed the future of education in the world we need to double higher educational capacity in the world and it's impossible to do that through the

existing system that that's there now. We can use AI as one of the tools to help us facilitate and dramatically improve the quality of education, access to education and bring down the cost of

education so that we can anybody in the country who wants to have a high a higher education can have worldclass education in any language in any subject and not just worldclass

it will be interactive educ education where you're not sitting somebody lecturing a long time and reading a textbook. You have a doubt, you ask a question and the system immediately

comes back to you. It can be self-paced learning. So if you're tired one day, you don't miss the lecture. You it tunes to your to what you've learned and what's the next thing and you can go

beyond. It's human centered education. It's not to prepare us for a job. It's to help develop us as a human being. our understanding, our attitudes, our capacity for inter relationships and

all. I think it's a a tremendous education, a a tremendous opportunity and India could be the leader for it and set the pace for the rest of the world. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Um I

&gt;&gt; yeah I think from India's context um the positive thing is that you know India's a civilizational state. If in this game data and information is the fuel then we have the data and information and

cognitive knowledge for the last 3,000 years. Uh we you know when so you know we have a huge advantage as we go into this into this game. Now it's our challenge how we convert that using

technology into solutions that are not only true for India but are actually going to be true for the rest of the world. And therefore I think our rallying war cry of vasuv kutumbakam

which is you know was India's approach to this will actually find a chance for India to have the influence uh in this world where uh we will go with solutions and technology to the rest of the world.

I I want to thank you for being a great audience. We're up we're we're finished of time and I'm going to give you one answer which actually protects you and it is as Shia said inherent to this

particular civilization which is um if you meditate you get control back. No one can control somebody who has control over themselves.

Thank you. [applause] Uh sir uh we need to take a picture guys just just a picture right just for a second. Uh thank you for a wonderful session

sir. Uh we are really at a crossroad and you gave us a lot of lot of a lot to think about. On behalf of India it team I say thank you. Heat. Heat. Heat.

Please &gt;&gt; uh the report sorry I should have said &gt;&gt; everyone is requested to please evacuate as the next section going to start who

&gt;&gt; whoever has attended this session uh the Next session is going to start. Please leave the room. Let the other attendees the join the session.
