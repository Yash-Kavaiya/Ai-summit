## 📝 Transcript

Can you use the mic? Yeah. Uh so uh and uh Vinod has braved all of Bharat Mandabam to to make it over here. Uh super excited to do this uh what feels now a closed door session after a lot of

braving the crowd but uh very excited to have so many uh people in the room founders investors. The session is uh founders and funders uh India's uh AI capital ecosystem. And uh when uh I

think Rajan and I and Mohit and I first thought of this session uh we only had one person in mind to kick this off for us which was Vinod and he gladly agreed. Uh so very excited to have him here

today. Uh guys few rules uh this is a closed door off thereord session. You can take pictures but please don't post anything uh from the session. Uh in case there's media, please this is uh like I

said chemos off the record u you know maybe you know it's available offline after this. &gt;&gt; Anything I say can be on the record I don't care much. [cheering and applause]

&gt;&gt; All right sorry that's an edit. &gt;&gt; Okay so Mohit &gt;&gt; I say it can be awesome. [laughter] &gt;&gt; So with that I'd like to welcome Moit to

kick this off with Venod. Mohit is MD at Peak 15 partners. &gt;&gt; You feel the love yet? &gt;&gt; Oh, this is great. See, it's great to see the excitement with all the people

outside and just amazing how much interest there is in the subject nobody had heard about five years ago. &gt;&gt; AI can solve anything other than Delhi traffic. So, [laughter]

&gt;&gt; well, AI can solve that too. Yeah, &gt;&gt; it just we haven't implemented it the right way. There you go. Hey, but before we jump into AI, you know, just want to say on behalf of everyone, just

incredible inspiration to the rest of us. You've just done wonders, not just uh you know, being a founder that we've all looked up to, but then crossed over to the dark side like I call it and

become an incredibly influential and impactful investor. So, uh you make it hard for the rest of us, but thank you for inspiring. &gt;&gt; Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Okay, so uh we have a good crew. How many How many founders in the room? If we can just get a read of the room. Wow. A lot of people. &gt;&gt; Awesome. Awesome.

&gt;&gt; And how many investors who are willing to put their hands up? It sounds like the same people put their hands up. I don't know if you noticed. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Well, you can be an investor and a

founder. The best investor is somebody who's been a founder. &gt;&gt; Okay. I got lots of questions for you and then we'll open it up to the team as well.

&gt;&gt; Uh but we know we are sitting in Delhi, the city that's very special to you. where it started from you and you're probably sitting uh at the most important influential AI conference that

India has ever had and I want to start with that which is your impression of India's AI sovereign journey India's strategy to you know have a bank of GPUs its own foundational models clearly at

the application layer take a step back you're sitting with prime minister Modi you're sitting with the ministers and you're trying to opine with them around you What is what should India's AI

strategy be over the next decade? &gt;&gt; Well, clearly they're doing a good job. This summit seems to be unbelievably successful. Uh I had one of my nieces wanting to register and she said 300,000

people registered. She couldn't register which is surprising that many people interested. So it's very exciting. All the interest will cause more people to participate in the AI economy. So at the

policy level they're doing the right thing. The idea of a sovereign model uh and we are investors in Saram uh is a very good idea. In fact I've long believed countries should have sovereign

AI and that's why we invest in Sarbam here in India and we invest in Sakana because Japan should have its own so sovereign model and different countries should have their own models. are small

countries it's very hard to do but India has done a good job of embracing this idea clearly for national defense and cyber security and all that you cannot have foreign models every country will

want its own models so sovereign models are important but I think the most important thing to do with AI is not so much in business the first applications and I'll be talking about this in the

plenary session on 19 is very much it is possible today and within the next year or two in India to provide a nearfree AI doctor to every Indian 24/7 as an AI doctor.

It's possible to provide every Indian child all 250 million children in India an AI personal tutor. That would be far better than if they could afford to pay for a human tutor. Why? Because it can

judge a person's level of knowledge, know where the gaps are and teach at the level of personalization nobody could. Those are two very fundamental things. Um I was just researching an aronomist.

Every farmer in India, small or large, can have an AI aronomist available at the PhD level to them in their locality speaking their language. If you're in Mgalia, you can speak

Kashi. U so and know the diseases and crops and pests in that area. So that level of personalization I've just mentioned three that are absolutely essential and they should be part of the

Aadhaar system like three imagine UPI primary care AI tutors AI aronomy agents those take care of essential needs for the the bottom half of the Indian population uh you know there's people

who can afford personal tutors and frankly they will have poor education relative to people who use AI tutors for free. &gt;&gt; Makes sense. Makes a lot of sense. You

know, if I may just push on that a little bit though. So, &gt;&gt; but I want to add one more thing. &gt;&gt; Um, you talked about you can't fix the uh Delhi traffic. That's not true.

That's a failure of imagination. We we have a company that's building public transit based on self-driving vehicles. Sure. The interesting thing about public transit based on

self-driving vehicles, it has 10 times the three throughput. Why do you have congestion? Because we don't have enough throughput. Passengers per hour per meter of street width is how these

things are measured. With AI based public transit parts, service can be like Uber or Ola on demand. It can be pointto-point.

It can be safe for women even at 2 o'clock in the morning &gt;&gt; and it can be cheaper than today's public transit if you do the math. So these fundamental structural problems in

the country can be addressed first before we talk about the business side and there's lots of business opportunity. I suspect all of you are interested in that. I wrote a document

uh called uh that I published last month but I actually wrote it last August on what AI can do for India. I forget the exact title. I I can get it to you if you're interested. It is stunning the

level of services that can be done in the next two three years. &gt;&gt; And then of course there's the longer term where uh you know it was in 2008 I looked at the

question because my wife was working in education. I asked myself the question what could you do for medicine or enough doctors in the country? I said if I personally had a trillion dollars to

spend a trillion dollars, I could not to get the doctor patient ratio the same in India as it is in the US with a trillion dollars and 30 years. I couldn't start enough medical schools, find enough

professors for medical schools. It just was not doable. That's why in 2008 I decided the only solution was an AI doctor. That's how I came to this conclusion as I was looking at doing

something nonprofit in this country in in medicine. Um and in 2012 I wrote my first blog called do we need doctors? I wrote a second blog called do we need teachers? Both in January of 2012 in

Techrunch. So you can find them for the record. Uh so these are massive opportunities. U and of course you probably want to talk about the business side of things.

&gt;&gt; No but I agree with you. I I think the story of India has been that of access and getting distribution and the only way you can do it is if you're incredibly low cost whether it's your

mobile phone and lowest data cost in the world or even at e-commerce the you know the average ticket sizes that we do e-commerce within India and so on so forth. That's why I agree with you that

technology enables us to serve the next 50 million, the next 100 million because it allows us to drop the cost. &gt;&gt; Well, it's the next 500, 700 billion very easily.

&gt;&gt; But I have a question for you. Uh &gt;&gt; what what do you think it would cost to provide daily primary care to 700 million people? &gt;&gt; My bet is

less than a billion dollars or two a billion a year. A year. Even in India's context, that's a very small part of what the Ministry of Health spends. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it' be 10 or 20 cents per per day

at max. Yeah, separate question coming up later. What we do with all our teachers, but but we'll handle that next. Okay. Uh uh

let's flip back a little bit uh globally uh because you know a lot of people here are immersed into our day in day out in the AI world of India. If there were three

important trends that you think are happening globally that are not as obvious to folks yet but is going to hit them over the head in the next 12 months. Well, it's very clear to me that

people in India don't believe that the whole idea of IT services will go away. By 2030, there will be no such thing as IT services. There will be no such thing as BO. Those are gone. Yeah.

&gt;&gt; Right. There will be new kinds of services based on AI that Indian companies can form and bring to the rest of the world because India has the best engineers, the best talent and education

and all that. So there are opportunities but those will be very very disruptive to the Indian economy and I don't think people are paying enough. Somebody at emphasis is hating me right now.

um but they have to make the transition &gt;&gt; and and and I've heard you say this before and then you talk about the export for transformative services. What do you mean by that? So AI AI knowledge,

you know, so there's a massive gap between AI capability. Uh there's a blog that was just in the last two or three days. I was reading it on the plane last night called something

big is happening. Uh it was an interesting blog and you know I forget where he wrote it on Twitter or someplace else. And within a day or two, this blog had

80 million views. Even entertainment products don't get get that kind of readership. In a couple of days, 80 million views. Uh I think I'd recommend people read that. Uh so the magnitude of

the change some of these areas are not not really recognized by people. So imagine uh the world had 10 to 100 times more scientists in material science in

biology in energy or power we will have that capability for near free so what do we do with that I mean there's lots of social problems &gt;&gt; sure

&gt;&gt; you pay a construction worker the same you pay an oncologist who spent 10 years in medical school because they have the same knowledge which is the knowledge of the AI. So

everybody's up level to being a PhD in almost every subject that they can express in English language. That'll be the hard skill. What do I want from an AI? The specification of need is the

hard part. So it's a very different world. So and by 2050 one way or another that will happen. But go back to the trends that are shaping tomorrow. So one is you're saying IT services is in deep

trouble. That's one entire industry that's going to uh you know not but I want to understand with all the data center uh investments and all the downstream you know memory and

everything else with there what is it that is getting built out that is going to impact us in 12 months later. Well, uh obviously I think compute usage will keep going up and it should go up and if

you give a billion people free education and free medical services or at least physician services, heart surgery is a little different. Um so there are things but

even you know we are starting to design drugs for one patient. If they have a cancer, we can design a drug for one patient. It's not an approved drug. You don't even have a regulatory process

because you don't have a patient population. It's a population of one. So really amazing stuff. Why the AI pops it out. It's better than a five-year development process from one of the

major uh pharma companies. So very interesting stuff happening. Uh, so look, has AI let you down? &gt;&gt; What do you mean? As in, you're such a proponent. It's going to change

everything. You probably are an early adopter of almost any of these, including drug discovery. Has it let you down? &gt;&gt; U, look, I take the long view.

I think it was in the year 2000 I first said AI will have have us redefine what it means to be human. I was vague enough and sounded weird enough that I didn't elaborate more. I was very clear on my

view. But 2012, I wrote two blogs. Do we need doctors and do we need teachers? Um, and I'm I've been steadfast that's going to happen. And I think just this year certain states in Utah, uh, in the

US, Utah as an example, letting AI prescribe medicine, that'll happen this this year. Wow. &gt;&gt; You know, the American Medical Association doesn't love it because you

don't have to see a doctor to get a prescription. Uh, it'll roll out very slowly in small increments. Start with the less dangerous drugs first. So, of the 2,000 drugs in the market, 500 have

very few side effects. So, you start with those, start with the simpler, less complex cases, but you go up in complexity very, very rapidly. let AI diagnose you and then maybe get a second

opinion if you really care to in &gt;&gt; so almost certainly I only use AI for diagnosis uh and if a doctor tells me something I get a second opinion from my AI including dosage and stuff in in half

the cases now I probably have the best doctors available &gt;&gt; I I pay ungodly amount for a personal doctor almost always the AI refineses the things and will usually result in a

change of drugs. &gt;&gt; Got it. &gt;&gt; Like that's consequential. &gt;&gt; Okay, you got a dial in your hand. On this end is the entire wild west as

you're painting it out. Uh goodbye doctors, goodbye educators, goodbye IT services. And on this end is by the way, we should add the other business areas. So I talked about what I think can be

government services. Yeah, please. like med doctors uh tutors u I think legal services should be free so people have access to the law because most people who are poor can't access

their legal rights um and aronomy so some of those but entertainment will be free it is so easy to have great entertainment uh it should be free

&gt;&gt; you know Tik Tok without creators is entirely possible if you use Sora 2 today. They don't have enough chips to keep serving all the people who want to use it, but otherwise it'd be all over.

So entertainment will generally be free. We are seeing a lot of movies being made in one minute increments by AI. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So if entertainment is free, all these

services are near free. Um and I think transportation will be near free. The the hard area is something like housing which I haven't seen yet how AI impacts though I have plenty of ideas I'm

working on but these are fundamental human needs &gt;&gt; if they all become hugely lower cost. It's a pretty interesting world.

Okay, sorry. Where I was going with that was uh the policy makers, the government's got to balance this uh you know look after the citizens, give them a call it a path in this new journey and

on the other end we don't want to hold back uh and not restrain innovation like on which parts do you sort of completely dial right? Which ones do you sort of be a little bit more careful?

&gt;&gt; Look, whenever there's large social change involved, there's large politics involved. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So the biggest issue to be managed very very carefully is politics. My general

view is the adaption of AI will be very different in different countries because the politics are different in different countries and politics not cap a technical capability will be the key

determinant of what is adapted and what's not adapted. Okay. Give me an example in the US where they've &gt;&gt; well let me give you an idea. This is this the silliest idea. I wouldn't even

have imagined it's possible. Germany does not have retail workers on Sundays. So, you can't open a shop and work uh in retail in Germany on Sunday. They just banned robots from working on

Sundays. [laughter] That how ridiculous that that's an example. &gt;&gt; Great example [laughter] &gt;&gt; of what not to do. Okay. I I don't know the stupidity of whoever legislated

that. &gt;&gt; Right. Okay. Great. All right. Let's uh I'm an investor too and uh valuations uh are uh always challenging us in this new world. Sometimes we we say to each other

as early stage investors. Uh our job is not to value companies as much as to pick the right companies because if it's going to get big, it's going to not matter. But the flip is uh you just get

started and you throw a little bit of AI washing and you can get to hundreds of millions of dollars before you know it. Somebody walks into your boardroom or your IC. How are you able to tell what's

real, what's not? So we don't have an IC. So we are one of the venture firms that doesn't have an IC. Uh we discuss every investment. We discuss it vantly

but after that any of the managing directors can make their own decision and I I will disagree with something and they can still go ahead. That happens all the time.

&gt;&gt; We should try that Rajan. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Well, you have to have confidence in your partners and you want to encourage diversity of views. You know, at the academic level, everybody says you

should have a diversity of views. But if one person's approving the investment &gt;&gt; or if you have consensus, you're going to go for mediocrity. Consensus always means you miss the outliers. So, we

maximize our process for outliers. There's no way everybody would agree to invest in OpenAI in 2018 when it was a nonprofit with no product plan, no revenue plan, no notion of when the

technology would work. Uh it took conviction, it took guts &gt;&gt; big time. What what uh what did you see &gt;&gt; very simply in Sam and the team? really great team

&gt;&gt; and I was pretty sure if when AI is successful not if when it's successful it'd be massive and wouldn't matter if you made your return in 3 years or 15 years the IRRa would still be awesome

&gt;&gt; and and I was right on the magnitude of the AI impact nobody would have imagined you know companies worth think worth near trillion dollars as startups but it's

entirely possible today. I'll I'll give you my favorite story. Uh this Indian company called Emergent. Uh anybody from Emergent here by any chance? &gt;&gt; They're all selling in the US.

&gt;&gt; Yeah. The approached me just like four or five months ago and they were a small company. Um they just launched their product in I think in July or or August.

Um they just sent me a note yesterday. Yeah. already up to a hundred million run rate in a few months. &gt;&gt; In India for an Indian company. That's just stunning.

&gt;&gt; And it was a controversial company because you know there's cursor and lovable and and you name it. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Um we bet on the founders. They're great

founders and it's going to be a massive success. Obviously, serum has dominated in the model space. &gt;&gt; Yeah, let's talk about that one. We are investors too. [laughter]

&gt;&gt; That would be a good one. &gt;&gt; Well, you know, you could easily you could easily have say Amani or you know the one of the other big efforts with a lot more money behind it might be the

successful one. That's not the case. It's great entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs like Pratush. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amazing. Sorry, just one more example if I may of in your in your

discussions in your uh with your partners when you guys are now looking at new AI investments to make beyond the founders is there something structural for example in our IC we talk about do

you believe in a multi- uh model world or do you believe in a single model world and if you believe in a multimodel world then you know you have to take a set of certain directions

&gt;&gt; so one of the things we have which is pretty different from most under uh uh other firms if we are deeply technical &gt;&gt; right I can have a detailed discussion my partners can have a very detailed

discussion in fact one of my partners who happens to be German and loves my robot joke uh about Germans um his he he his self-driving car that he was the chief engineer of is in the Smithsonian

Museum as the first self-driving car that achieved certain milestones that won the DARPA competition So we have that level of technical depth to be able to have those discussions.

What do we believe? We've had intense discussions on robotics. We have five different approaches to robot models. Um I am my favorite. Uh but uh you know we we will

bet on different things and we will bet against each other. There's no competition in our firm because nobody gets paid on the investments they make. Nobody has a koda

and nobody owns an investment. We uh we have very unusual process. Um and if I say to somebody let me take over your investment, they'll say happily I have too many other things to do. You can

take my workload. &gt;&gt; Okay. I have one question of founders and maybe I can take one or two questions from there and then we'll carry on. Um,

it's it's a question you've probably answered before, but it's hard to be a founder in this very fast changing world right now in terms of &gt;&gt; Oh, it's so much easier.

&gt;&gt; Oh, tell me more. Tell me more. &gt;&gt; Things didn't move quickly when I was I was a founder in 1980. My first startup &gt;&gt; or my second start startup in 1982. Nobody believed in anybody under the age

of 40 doing anything interesting. like it was age. People were very aegist. It was like, "Hey, people with funny accents aren't don't wear suits and ties and I've

really not worn suits and ties." And so there's you didn't startups didn't have credibility. You always trusted IBM over a startup.

&gt;&gt; Right &gt;&gt; now, you always trust a startup more than any IBM company. &gt;&gt; They will. Yeah, if somebody's worked at Cisco for 15, 20 years, I consider them

unemployable in the real economy. [laughter] Anybody from Cisco or IBM or General Electric? Look, if you're at these big companies for 15, 20 years, you are so

obsolete and so oified. Don't say anything. [laughter] &gt;&gt; No, no, no. G fits in that category. &gt;&gt; Get out of there. &gt;&gt; [laughter]

&gt;&gt; Now I have very strong views. You get oified in big companies. You have to be at the edge of learning. I'm a big believer. I'm 71. &gt;&gt; I don't think I've ever learned as fast

as I'm learning today. Ever. &gt;&gt; I'm literally doing years of learning every month in every area. I can talk to you about AI models in antibbody design for a particular cancer or about fusion.

Uh happy to talk about any of these talk because I'm always learning and that's all I do. &gt;&gt; That's incredible. I want to eat with you.

&gt;&gt; I don't talk to financial people. I don't ever talk at financial conferences. I talk to entrepreneurs. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Um and anybody else I mostly just end up

insulting and they hate me. So a question Hi, my name is Fun. &gt;&gt; Just &gt;&gt; Hi, Ven. Thank you for sharing. Hi, my

name is Farun and I'm from the UK. I studied medicine and neuroscience for years in in England and then I became a &gt;&gt; good digital health startups in the UK. &gt;&gt; Yeah. No. And um so now I'm Thank you.

And now I'm um actually a filmmaker. I turned into films. I'm actually directing a documentary on AI. Um, but my question to you is, &gt;&gt; and I would bet if you asked an AI to

write the script for a documentary about AI, Yeah. &gt;&gt; it would do better. &gt;&gt; Actually, &gt;&gt; I'm very religious.

&gt;&gt; Yeah. I wrote my own and then I asked AI and yes, I merged them. Right. &gt;&gt; Okay. That's a good question. &gt;&gt; I did. Yeah. But my question to you is, so you mentioned um we can make now one

minute videos, right? So when do you think we can make a 90inute fullon 90minute Hollywood movie full lip sync everything like from for one person in one room instead of like a

100 people how what's your timeline in probably the next two three years uh that will almost certainly happen um and there was a filmmaker that just got panned because he used AI to build

pieces of his film I forget the name of the person who did Okay. But the question you have to ask is, do people want to watch a 2-hour movie? The answer is probably not. What China is a good

indicator. What is the fastest growing category of media that people watch the number of hours in China today? One minute shorts. But do you learn from one minute compared to like uh do you watch

documentaries 90minute documentaries? &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; You still do, right? &gt;&gt; Uh I don't but &gt;&gt; Okay. Okay. Well, in terms of what

&gt;&gt; I like I'd like to have Chad GPD watch it and summarize it for me. [laughter] &gt;&gt; I'm going to keep moving. But this evening there is a session at I think 6:00 to 9:00 p.m. at the Kutuk Minar

where they're talking film and AI. You will not believe what's going on in Bombay and how many studios are actually trying to create a Mahabharat just using AI and AI only. There's a lot of stuff

going on. My friend Me right at the back. You can scream min. &gt;&gt; All right. What in your experience the best way of young people being

&gt;&gt; you know that's a hard question. Um first thing I say is in the entrepreneurial world you have to be really curious and that's what I mean by I'm always learning. any professor

anywhere wants to come educate me on any topic which they're often ready to I will sit down with them over any business person always and say educate me in your area and it doesn't matter

whether it's fusion or interplanetary science or geoscience I will you know I'll read a book on how you do carbon dating and my kids make fun of me uh you know reading of that or an

encyclopedia of grasses. I have my favorite encyclopedia of grasses. I I read about everything. So curiosity is number one to your question. I think the second most important question is

agency. People who have agency there's people who think that's how the world is and there's people who create the world they want. You know I I joined IIT Delhi in 1971.

There wasn't the single IIT with a programming class. So you couldn't really people said you can't get the administration to do something. In 1971 we started a programming club with four

people and one junior professor. We made programming happen. A few years later I worked with professor Gua at IIT Delhi in those days to make a biomedical engineering pro program happen. Why I

got we created the program and we created programming uh because I was curious about it and I had the agency to say hey let's do it and we started working with IIT Delhi's electrical

engineering department and all India institute of medical sciences. So you agency is very important and then you know anybody who's done startups knows startups are really hard. You have to

have persistence. You don't give up when you fail. I always say my willingness to fail is what allows me to succeed. I'll bang my head against the wall if I think something's a good idea till it

succeeds. So persistence is really key. So those are three quick things. &gt;&gt; That's great. He's doing a great job by the way with many Delhi schools and in you know inserting entrepreneurship as

part of the curriculum and seeing great results. We'll take one here. &gt;&gt; The mic doesn't &gt;&gt; you know my so if you ask me 15 years from now

I don't see any need for universities and colleges. I think there will be other ways to learn that are much better on your time without the expense of a university and the time dedication.

So I I don't see a huge future for universities in these universities with 100year endowments just uh they'll have their endowment left not much else. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a good use. But there's

other ways to do that. uh and I think in high school that is the principle or even in kindergarten that's the principal purpose of school is socialization and I think that's very

important um whether universities do that or are as needed for that function I think by 18 most people are independent enough there's other ways to socialize for

eight or 10 year old kid that's much harder and so schools are important for &gt;&gt; Is there any industry you said housing was one that you were still trying to figure out how it gets impacted. How

about healthcare? Is there anything any one or two industries that are more insulated? &gt;&gt; Uh you know first every time I think of an industry uh I find somebody finds a

way to obsolete it. Um you know take minerals and mining. I thought you know we need everybody in development you need more steel you need more copper you need more lithium

um almost certainly over the next 15 years we will discover more minerals than we will consume why because AI is helping discover you know today how how do you find a copper deposit it's on the

surface in some part of the planet you start digging and refining if you could look a kilometer under the Earth's surface which AI lets you do and special kinds of sensors and I can get into all

every kind of sensor that's used in geoscience. Some actually know it reasonably well. Um you'll find resources everywhere. So I don't view those things as a constraint.

So great answer. Yeah, we have an entrepreneur who cannot sit down. He really wants to ask the question. &gt;&gt; Go for it. I think

of humanity as an &gt;&gt; I feel sorry for five years from now. But keep going. Sorry. I just

&gt;&gt; Sorry. Did Did you have a question or was there more of a comment? &gt;&gt; Oh, okay. That's not not here. Not here. &gt;&gt; I have the mic and a question. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes.

&gt;&gt; And it's a nontechnical question with no as a military brat. My name is Sima Jatui. I run a venture fund. Big bullish on the AI. But non-technical question. What are your views on uh the future of

humanity because of the future of AI? What are all these people going to do when they have no jobs? What are your views on this? And especially if they don't have agency.

&gt;&gt; Okay. The question you have to ask is will anybody need jobs, right? I think by 2050 it'll be very clear nobody needs jobs because enough production of goods and services that

are near free, you won't need jobs. Now that's not to say people won't do jobs. uh people have much more time to spend with their kids, with their parents. So caregiving is a really interesting use.

Competitions, the Winter Olympics is going on right now. People love competition. People love singing. People need art. If you're a painter, I used to tell kids, uh, go do that, but make sure

you don't need to support your need a house or to send your kids to college. Well, uh you'll be able to do any of those things whether it's painting or surfing or skiing or Olympics and

dedicate your life to whatever passion you have and the number of things people have passion for will explode. So let me give you my favorite example. If you have a five or six year old

child, maybe a 10 year old child, you say go to school, study hard, get into good college, you'll get a good job. Um in the future you'll tell that kid learn a passion and explore it from age

five they will know it's not about getting life education isn't about getting a job it's about developing curiosity and having passions and I think people humanity will generally

pursue passions not jobs but &gt;&gt; will that put food on the table uh &gt;&gt; I think all those So I suspect the minimum level of services, healthcare, education,

um legal, uh food, food will be very cheap because of bipedal robots, uh and not needing labor. Um

and I can go into much detail. Housing is the one I mentioned. I have a trouble with saying how it gets to near free levels, but uh the basic level of services afforded everybody will be very

high by governments that do this right by 2050. And this is only 25 years. It's it's in my working life. I think I hope I'm working at 75 95. Uh I hope it's in your working lives. Most of you are

younger than me. Um I I think we are looking at a very different world now very unpredictable how the path is from here to there. People will object to unemployment and lots of other things

and social causes. So that's why I say politics will play a role especially in democratic countries and I think China has a huge advantage there. &gt;&gt; Last last question please. But what are

what are your thoughts uh you know on uh on AI potentially starting a nuclear war and if yes if it's if it's possible is there a way to protect against it? &gt;&gt; I'm much more worried about Trump than

AI. &gt;&gt; Now that [cheering] is the final word really. I I have the mic. Are we actually done? So we &gt;&gt; Yes. Unless one

&gt;&gt; or I have one last question. Uh prediction. &gt;&gt; Which year which vintage do you think AGI actually becomes a reality? best of your knowledge.

&gt;&gt; Well, so it depends on how you define AGI. People keep moving the goal post. Uh I define AGI very specifically as when AI can do 80% of 80% of all the jobs that have economic value. So

whether you're a structural engineer, a farm worker, uh assembly line worker, a doctor, an accountant, if AI can do 80% of 80% of all jobs, that's AGI. I think we are there in the next two years.

&gt;&gt; Wow. All right. &gt;&gt; Awesome. Thank you. Thank you, Mo. Thank you, Venod. &gt;&gt; Thanks. [applause] &gt;&gt; Uh you know, we're not going to do uh

any more sessions. is out of time, but why don't we all take a picture? Pratosh, Shahad, just one second. &gt;&gt; Come, come do a picture with the some of the other folks.
