## 📝 Summary

AI infrastructure, encompassing compute, data, and models, will determine who is able to build, deploy, and govern AI over the coming decade. At present, access to these foundational resources remains uneven and highly concentrated, constraining meaningful participation across much of the Global South. This session, organised by Factly and Meta, examines how an AI Commons can be developed through shared compute frameworks, AI-ready open data systems, and interoperable model and tooling ecosystems aligned with globally recognised standards.

## 📝 Transcript

economic productivity and public service delivery. As AI begins to shape welfare systems, health delivery, education, urban governance and digital platforms, the key question before us is not

whether AI will be adopted, but who gets to shape the access to this infrastructure on which this AI is built. The insights from the Hyderabad and Chennai presummit events organized

by us revealed something consistent which today's panel is going to focus on. Our panel reframes AI infrastructure as civic infrastructure. Similarly in importance to the digital

public infrastructure shaping participation agency and public value at population scale. We have an exceptional set of voices representing the full AI stack. Mr. J Shanjan, an IAS officer,

special chief secretary to the government of Telangana. Mr. PJ Narayan, Mr. PJ Narayan, the chair of research symposium here at AI impact summit and the former director of triple IT

Hyderabad. Miss Amanda Brock the CEO of Open UK, Mr. Osama Manzer, the founder of digital empowerment foundation. Okay, he's yet to arrive. Miss Praji

Bhya, the public policy manager at Meta and Mr. Rakkesh Dubu who is the founder of faculty and who will also be moderating the session. I request the panelists to please come forward for a

small photo. Yes, &gt;&gt; sure. We could have this at the end of the session. &gt;&gt; Sure. Sure.

I now request the moderator to sparehead. just walking. So &gt;&gt; sir, I think we could begin with the session and

&gt;&gt; Sure. Uh thanks Anushka. uh as you know uh the AI will need a whole of society appro approach not just a technology problem and which is why we've uh gathered the

stellar panel for you today who represent different strands of the uh the AI world that we're looking at from government from academia uh from technology companies from somebody who's

working at the grassroots with people and somebody who's championing uh open source so we wish to have these perspectives because like I said it's not a single solution that will help us

go beyond uh talk and rhetoric but actually implementable solutions. I'll start with uh JSI who is the special chief secretary for government of Telangana. Uh sir from a you've been for

so many years the IT secretary and also at the forefront of uh IT in the state uh from a state implementation lens what do you think is the hardest part in uh democratizing AI? Is it know building

the infrastructure? Is it governing it or is it ensuring that it actually gets used meaningfully and equitably? &gt;&gt; Thank you. Greetings to fellow panelists. Greetings to everyone in the

audience. So I'll I'll share an actual uh [clears throat] experience to answer your question. See many of you would know that when digital India started as a flagship program way back in 2014,

one of the important components was called Bhatnet. You lay optic fiber cable you connect all the villages. So in my state of Telangana we took a decision that will go a step

further which is a decision which the government of India has also taken now but this decision was taken way back in 2014 in Telangana that will connect every household as well and uh we had

one advantage at that time that trenches were dug to connect water pipelines to every village and uh we felt that this is a great opportunity in the same trench let us put the fiber duct as

well. You save on so much of cost because if you actually see bat night about 40 50% of the costs just go for digging the trenches filling them up. So here you have ready made trenches then

we we were getting this saving we felt that we should now connect household. We took a saturation approach like you go to a village cover all the homes then go to the next village go to the third

village. So after the program started and we would have covered maybe 100 100 odd villages. One of the feedback which we got was that so let us say you are a small farmer in a remote village. You

went to bed today and tomorrow morning you woke up someone told hey there is broadband at your doorstep. We did not find people jumping with joy and rushing out and investing in a smartphone or a

tab which kind of surprised us. we are sending spending so much of time and effort and resources to provide connectivity but it's not causing any enthusiasm at all. So I think this is

what uh taught us a very big lesson as the phrase says I mean as the proverb says you can take the horse to water but what else do you need to do so this was the big lesson that just creating

infrastructure is not enough how do you get your buying and what we found was that it's not that they are not buying a smartphone or a tab because they can't afford it many of you may not know this

but uh Telangana has the highest per capita income in the entire country So it's not that we are a languishing state where people can't afford to buy a phone or anything. And

so the discovery was something different. The discovery was it's largely a mindset issues. I mean many of the people who are in remote villages obviously have not gone to colleges

don't speak English. So it's a mindset thing. I mean that standard that the meme

So I I have not studied in English. I have not studied at all for that matter of fact. I don't have much familiarity with this gadgets etc. So then two solutions came out. I I don't know what

are your follow-up questions but uh in my anxiety I'm I'm answering your next question also. So two solutions came out. One solution was that let us assist them in mastering this technology. So

even if I have some mental block that I can't use it, can I find someone in the village who can guide me in using it? So we used our uh digital kiosks which are there in every village which are called

MISA centers very imaginatively. Wherever there was a shortage of MISA centers, we created new ones and in the new ones almost thousand of them we encourage women from the local community

to become an entrepreneur. So that again is a very great uh very satisfying outcome that women are now leading at the cutting edge these kind of revolutions. But the other more

important thought was that even if I assist you I will know that okay I can pay some utilities using this facility. I can get some services but can it help me in handling certain things which are

very very foundational very fundamental and we discovered that if you are able to solve some of their most pres pressing problems before their eyes using technology the buying happens

instantly. If you can show to them that see here is a problem that let us say agriculture most of the rural livelihoods depend upon agriculture as we know if you tell them that see this

is a pest issue which eats half your crops every year your father faced the same thing his father faced the same thing you also lose so much of opportunity because of the pest attack.

Please uh welcome uh fellow panelist Osama Banza and uh [clears throat] please come please take our pictures. Then he has to go to another hall now. So uh just to continue so in agriculture

for example there'll be hundreds of challenges which a small farmer a marginal farmer face but if you show to him that here is a technology Y which can help you come out of this problem

which you perhaps would have never imagined will happen in your lifetime. You will see amazing kind of response. Even people with whom we want to remotely even associate technology or

high-tech you will see them getting converted. So this is the most difficult part but in my opinion this has to be done. Unless you convince them that technology can help you improve your

life we won't have uh buying at all. infrastructure and all is not the more difficult part. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Thank you Jar. I'll next go to PJ Narend. So you've been at uh the helm of

a a renowned and renowned technology institute in the country. So what specific role do you see both universities and research institutions playing in uh democratizing the a stack

uh you know uh I mean the lot of things to the a stack but which specific things do you think the uh the role of universities is critical universities and research in? Thank you for inviting

me to this panel. Uh so AI world at least in the last three four five years have changed so much. It is you know it got appended otherwise we are all doing AI for many years and what is today they

will call the oldfashioned AI not the ones that with these foundational models and large models and so on and that has changed the landscape uh for everybody especially for university and not just

Indian universities the global universities because all the big uh exciting things are happening in uh companies like Google Meta or you know the open AI the very big players because

one of the thing is of course the the resource like both compute and data data may know many of these you can see these companies are primarily internet companies. So they have data and then

because they are also again internet company they have compute for other purposes and they are able to repurpose it and so on and this is for for uh for academia world over even the MITs and

Stanfords are feeling little bit uh you know behind they are not leading the race and in India these are you know our in investment in these things always lags now India is trying to create uh

infrastructure etc. So that that infrastructure computer infrastructure is very important. I mean there is often cliche that told that you know the data is the new oil.

I believe that is true. I mean there is a way it can be justified if you want to cook an AI dish you need all the ingredients but in the end you need to heat it. The the oil or the fuel

required to heat it is maybe the data but the component that releases the heat from the fuel is the compute. So without that you cannot do much and that's where uh that's one of the points where you

know academia is uh is at a at a disadvantage today. uh the India I've been talking to India people also saying that they should create probably an academic compute cloud just for academia

to be able to uh you know do their work and the second part of infrastructure but nobody would have thought of data as an infrastructure in until maybe 5 years ago 8 years ago today data availability

of data is know you can have all the compute you want but if you don't have the data you don't have the the the algorithms then you can't do anything with it you know so in in 10 years ago

all these companies uh you know like Google uh they all became open source in the you know 25 years ago or 30 years ago the cultural war was open source with versus non-opensource and the the

Microsoft or the the closed source proprietary software and hardware versus open source hardware today everybody is open source because the real value is provided by the data and the other

resources that they have the code itself is is of low value in this whole equation And of course there are companies like Meta which has taken a position that

there will be open weight models and that helps a lot but still there are other restrictions and on on the usage etc but that's where uh you know the academia is at a disadvantage and India

on one hand you know with with 1.4 four billion people in the world, India has can be a very strong player in the data space if we can play it right. And that's where we need to put our heads

together and and typically governments directly or indirectly control or or influence a huge amount of data that is produced in the country and which is of value to generating AI solution whether

it's a civic data from the cities, data from the phone, data from the people etc. So that I think there is there need to be a a a movement like the open source movement

that kind of ran out of steam because everybody's open source and that's alone is not enough open data moment that that that's very hard at least mandate that some of the data some of the critical

things will be available not just for academia the startups the companies to use so solution relevant to these users will be will emerge out of it. Thank you Narendra. I'll go to Prai. Uh

how do you know big tech companies like Meta envision a personalized agentic AI transforming the lives of individuals in the global south? I know we you know we've spoken about I'm sure this entire

expo has shown a lot of solutions toward this aspect but how does big tech see it and uh uh can you also let us know a couple of steps that companies are taking towards realizing this goal?

&gt;&gt; Sure. Thanks so much Rakkesh and thank you so much for partnering with us for a series of discussion that have happened in the last couple of months and thanks to everybody for for coming here. I

think this these topics have been very important like uh sir mentioned data is definitely data compute the unscaling all of these are like critical components of infrastructure now which

which we will need to make the AI vision possible. Specifically when you talk about the vision at Meta. Our vision is to bring personal super intelligence to everyone and everywhere. So inclusion is

is is a very important part uh of our mission. uh and we believe the personal super intelligence can happen by way of AI glasses which can actually allow your AI to to interact with you to hear what

you to hear what you hear to see what you see and and we feel AI glasses can actually accomplish that uh mission. Uh we also have all of our glasses now launched in India except for RBM

displays. You can go to the metap take a look at at the glasses and it has actually already started making a lot of impact specifically for the blind and the low vision community. People people

are using it to make their day-to-day life possible. Today uh I I really saw an a very interesting use case. A blind a blind person actually walked inside the bhat mandapam summit wearing the

glasses and there is an app called be my be my eyes app which actually a blind person to a cited volunteer and using that help the person could navigate how the person actually reached

the expo area. So very small like small real life examples making a huge difference in in a life like in life of so many people and specifically when we launched this in India we we also added

couple of additional languages in addition to English it's available in Hindi Canada and Tamil and we will obviously add more languages to it. Uh we are we are also piloting uh UPI

payments using the glasses. So you using your AI glasses you could actually make payments. So a lot of innovation is happening there and also just to talk about uh how data is important and I

think you rightly mentioned uh opensource has been has definitely been a very important pillar of this and government's recent initiative of AI co is a perfect example of how public

private partnerships can work. Just uh yesterday uh we contributed a very large uh data set 12 billion token with 4 million pairs to the government's open-source library which is in 10

different Indian languages which can actually support applications in agriculture, healthcare and education. So open sourcing data sets is critical also uh which are relevant to the

applications that a country needs. So this is this is a great example uh One more uh uh new model that I would like to talk about that meta has built. This is just one of the many examples that we

have is omnilingual uh ASR model. It actually helps in converting more than500 languages and it covers more than 500 low resource languages and a bunch of Indian languages and if even if

you have like one audio sample you can extend the model to to cover that langage. So a lot of innovation is in that area and I think more needs to be done. Uh public, private and academic

partnerships probably are uh one right way to solve for uh the issue that's rightly mentioned. Thank you Rajesh. &gt;&gt; Thanks Prai. Uh this is a good segue to go to Amanda. Uh Amanda as you know open

source is often treated as a technical choice you know whether you want to open or close it. uh but as you know from a policy and legal standpoint uh uh open infrastructure is is deemed to be

central. But why do you think it is so central in democratizing uh AI and not just as you know something that comes from an ide ideological lens but more importantly as a as something that is

very very central to democratization. &gt;&gt; Uh thank you very much for having me along this afternoon. I feel like a little bit of a fraud because I don't know enough about the global south to be

sitting on a panel. So maybe you will all tell me through the course of the afternoon various things that I will learn from. Um when we talk about open source and we

frame it in the context of today's conversation, we've mentioned civic tech, we've mentioned digital public goods and one of the things I think 2026 will be

remembered for is the of the ontology word definitions. And I I think this year we're seeing people start to really focus on having consistent meaning across conversations. So we hear the

term sovereignty a lot. Um India wants sovereignty, France wants sovereignty, the UK wants sovereignty, everybody's demanding it, but nobody's explaining what they mean by in the digital

context. And there's lots of different extremes. It can be simply localizing globally available technology that you can build on so that it respects your language, it respects your culture and

it's secure. And I I think that I would call that soft sovereignty. And I think that's probably a very sensible approach all the way through to it has to be created here to be sovereign. And when

we look at infrastructure, I talk a lot to politicians and their understanding of technology varies. And I talk about pizza. Everybody likes pizza, right? Anybody not like pizza? I

can't eat it. I'm allergic. But uh everybody likes pizza. And when you uh go to a pizza restaurant, what you talk about are the the toppings. You don't talk about the base usually because you

don't have much choice. And if you are looking at the technology pizza, the toppings are like AI, the cloud, the internet, machine learning. And that's what you go and you sit in the

restaurant and you talk about. You don't really think about the base. And in our digital infrastructure, the base, the pizza base is open source and it's the dull, boring stuff, right?

It's the plumbers's tools and the plumbing. But if you take that base of your pizza away, what have you got? Sloppy mess, right? So what we need is a firm base, a solid base that everybody

knows is going to be there they can rely on. And open source today provides that base. Now I may slightly disagree on why it's been successful. Uh when I started working in open source the there were a

lot of jokes about open source and the punchline was always Microsoft. I can't tell those anymore because Microsoft today is one of the biggest contributors to open source. I'm not

funny so it's just as well I can't tell them really. Um and they've shifted and they've shifted not because they think it's for the greater good. They've shifted because it makes business sense

and it makes business sense because the cloud the platforms all of our infrastructure is built on this open source and if you want to be engaged with those if you want to run a business

a cloud business to be a hyperscaler you have to use that open source so we've seen this shift towards open source of necessity and a lot of that has come from technical changes you know things

like GitHub suddenly becoming so popular you've got 25 million people on GitHub in this country. You know, you're one of the biggest in the world. And that has enabled collaboration and it's enabled

people to take the technology and bring it into their business without getting approval from risk professionals. They don't need a lawyer to sign a contract because it's on a standard license. They

don't need financial approval. And that's kind of shifted the landscape of business. Now for me you now have infrastructure you can rely on that's open that's collaboratively built that

everybody else is using why pay for it twice you know we take it and make it your own and what we need is to see I think prime minister Modi said access for all when he opened the French summit

and I think that access for all comes through open source now when we look at AI I agree that there is going to be a moment and if I knew what that moment was I'd be rich there will be a moment

in my crystal ball looking into the future where something will shift and we will see adoption at scale of open source AI and that is what I think as an outsider looking in you need in the

global south but I also think we need it in Scotland where I'm from right we're all in the same position so don't I I realize there are some particular things there languages you know I I didn't grow

up speaking English I grew up speaking Scots which is a dialect and just recognized last year as a language. You when I was in high school or junior school used to hit us if we spoken it,

you know, a ruler. So I I get that you have a culture that is very uh meaningful to you and that you want to see properly represented within the tools you're using and you should have

that. But I think you probably underestimate the stage that we are at in places like the UK in terms of our sophistication. And I think that humans are humans the world over and we really

a lot of the same challenges and there's a lot of room for us to collaborate globally around the future of that technology and build things together. &gt;&gt; Thanks Amanda. I that that kind of

perfectly sums up uh to go to the next uh panelist Osama you've had more than two decades of experience in last mile digital empowerment. Uh so we've seen how mobiles how internet has transformed

and you've been at the forefront of that work. So I I want to understand and maybe the for the benefit of the audience here. So what do you think AI inclusion will mean? So we've been

talking about financial inclusion, digital inclusion, but what do you think AI inclusion means for the grassroots uh beyond you know devices, beyond connectivity.

&gt;&gt; Okay. I uh after two decades of experience I only started hating inclusion not because it ends up doing exclusion more than inclusion. Uh I'll just narrate one very living story of

every one of us. Uh for example uh all of us started uh you know social media came to us right and social media came to us as an interactive media which allowed all of us to generate content,

publish content, create content and after 15 20 years what has started happened. We became content and we started our behavior and our choices. We became content of control and narrate

and all that. Right? Then you started seeing those content which you are pushed to see you know on all the social media. So what I am actually trying to say when we say inclusion

actually the purpose is that more people use it so that we can use you. So today all the devices is meant in such a way that we are the content for the device. when we are using actually we are being

used right we are being used our behavior so all the likes that we did okay this is what we like so push this kind of content okay I like red so push red

content I like you know violent content push violet content so your friends only creating content but your violent only violent content coming to you or love content coming to you or whatever you

know content coming to So this is how the devices come to us and take our sociobehavioral habits of the user. Now that is that is how and the same data is now being fed

to AI to create a another uh kind of system to give you to get included. So is this inclusion for what? So when you are saying financial inclusion do you want to include me or my money?

in the bank right or my choices to withdraw or not withdraw. So you know and the reason why it's very interesting panel is because here we are talking AI more from the perspective of media media

consumption you know media habits and all those things is even more you know so it's very interesting that we see AI as a data crunching machine because without data like somebody says that

without data AI is nothing you know You know data is the oil. Now what what uh data are you feeding to the AI machine? You know what kind of data? Because if you want to replicate my

habit, my habit is 57 year old you know and now you want to just maybe record now AI is saying that even if you record one hour of my video they can create a avatar of mine almost talking like me.

So how can you just in one hour of content you know data collecting and taking the machine learning and create your you know your like of content and you say oh this guy is talking like a s

then you feed the content on that this is what you have to speak this is what you have to so I don't know uh how we are going but the point is that data point for the technology creators

which are only few who is creating who who is pushing these technologies who is pushing these AIs of the world or the machine learnings of the world and all I mean and and why are they pushing it?

Are they trying to use us or replace us? Then why should we be replaced? Should human intelligence be replaced by artificial intelligence? I don't know. I mean so I my my point is that in this

entire system I think human in the loop is the most important part as a loop of trust you know and also the literacy of human beings to the last mind that I'm saying is that are we making them aware

of data literacy or not are we you know before data collecting from them or using their data or giving them any data. So that is the point that is most important and which is not happening. We

are first pushing the machine and then we are making them experiment. In these experimentation we are collecting data and then we are perhaps asking about the ethicality or all that. So there is no

uh system of uh what you call as uh front feeding you know there is no advanced feeding of the information only feedbacking system. No feed uh you know feed fronting say system there is only

feed backing system you give the system you learn from it and you then take control and then that is how you go. So we need to figure out as a governance system as a policy system is that what

kind of policy we create where the machines are not going to use the uh population of the people before the consent and before the ethical participation from their that's what

&gt;&gt; thanks thanks for grounding that uh I'll because we have about 15 minutes I'll ask the panelists to kind of you know give their suggestions and Uh first

for a long time I think governments have played the role of infrastructure creators &gt;&gt; level the playing field or you know provide access

to market makers throw up a challenge a hackathon invite uh solution providers to create something bespoke but obviously they require data and we are aware about some of the points which

others mentioned. Data could be available but there is a lack of trust in making that data available. There's always a fear that some some uh thing beyond my knowledge or my scope will be

done using that data. So we have created a data exchange and a data management framework. So for agriculture we were able to get 19 data sets many of them maintained by the government but many

others many data sets maintained by others also who once they understood the logic of putting together this exchange were willing to come forward and share their data as well like what Prache

mentioned about Facebook contribute meta contributing to so much of data and uh more than putting all the data at one place as an exchange making it machine readable making it interoperable the

bigger contribution ation wants to create a data management framework. Who has access to that data? Under what circumstances will you be permitted to use that data? If you're going to

benefit commercially from that data, how will you share that benefit to with the people who from where the data has originated? So that's something which uh has stood the test of time. This

agriculture data exchange, ADEX as it is called was uh has been live for more than two and a two and a half years now and many users, many insurance companies, banking companies, people who

provide crop loans etc have used it for uh for uh bringing more efficiency for improving their outreach to their stakeholders. Looking at the success of this agriculture data exchange which is

called ADEX we have now expanded it to cover 30 odd verticals and expanded it as a TEX Telangana data exchange. So data sets of various kinds, mobility data, weather data, price data, tax

data, health data, what whatever databases are available have all been used and the management framework remains the same like who is a contributor into that data exchange, who

is a user, what is the responsibility of each of them, who monitors, who has an oversight of that data exchange. So this is something which I felt I should share with uh everyone. But to answer your

question in a very very quick way, the [clears throat] opportunity to create market for small players was uh introduced way back in 2014 in Telangana. We when we became a new

state, we came up with a policy to promote innovation and entrepreneurship and uh in those days Hyderabad was not a very thriving not a very dynamic uh hub for innovation.

But whoever were there uh I still remember that conversation that happened actually in triple it where professor PJN was the director those 50 60 odd startups who were present in Hyderabad.

We asked them to tell what help do they require from the government and I mean just as an aside I can share this with you the obvious answer was that if you stay away from us that is the biggest

help but when we asked what are your problems do you really think that the government can't help you with anything one problem which they mentioned was that finding the first customer is very

challenging we may have a great idea we may have a great solution but because we don't have any track record finding the first person is challenging and many of us just faced the value of death because

we could not get any customers. So way back in 2014 when we brought out the innovation and startup policy, we mentioned this that the government will be your first customer. I'm guaranteeing

this to you and over the last uh 12 years or so uh I don't have precise number but I'm very sure that uh the use cases which we have taken from uh entrepreneurs, innovators

uh which is of relevance to the government, the numbers would be close to 100 if not more. So that is a role that we have played in encouraging uh people who are just beginning their

journey. There is a process we do have a system of evaluating whether the solution that you are providing is it relevance relevant to us or not. But uh things have worked out well. Thanks. Uh

Professor we uh I mean triple ty has been at the forefront of doing a lot of work in indic languages. uh so there is always a you know tussle between uh spending resources of frontier research

versus contextual applications which might solve an immediate social problem. So how do you you think you know university resources uh should be should be balanced between these two?

&gt;&gt; I think university like anybody in the society should play should solve the problems around them that they face or people around them face. At the same time universities are obviously un

universal entity but I think if you can't solve the problems of your neighborhood then then you are not doing your job. So you mentioned the Indian languages the translation between

Indian languages speech uh both speech understanding and speech production both all have been uh major activities in from 2000 onwards and they the work that we did formed the backbone strong

research backbone of the bashne system today which is really changed a lot now you have an API you can call and send a sound a speech signal in one language and ask it translate and give us a

speech signal in another language and it works and that's I mean that really enables that you know you the JSA said you know the people not finding what is the use in English what now though they

can talk to this phone in uh in Telugu or whatever their local language and we you know we are in the in the data collection uh framework again local it can be very local also so we you know

with with Samagra and uh other uh uh open source entities. We have been has been leading an effort to collect cultural and other data from villages every village in Telangana or Andhra

Pradesh etc. And the goal was to have to use 100,000 student volunteers to go to their local places collect speech or other data and then create create a model later sometime later and we have

fallen short of hund thousand but we have done 60,000 or something which is a big feat by itself. So I think we need to I mean India is a large country and every few kilometers everything changes

food changes language changes everything changes and we have to solve the problem and we that offers challenges that maybe other countries don't have you know how to how to create very local solution yet

it's part of the bigger solution because you know even our languages the there are 22 or whatever languages but there are two major families of languages and we do have we are research which says

the translation system among the Indo-arian languages can share things data and other things together. You don't have to think of Gujarati as separate from Hindi or separate from

Marathi. So they can together they can do things. So these are solutions or challenges offered only by India and we should solve those problems first. Yes. &gt;&gt; Thanks Professor Pen. Uh Rachi uh in

what policy approaches does uh meta recommend to ensure that uh regulation supports responsible innovation but also avoids unnecessary uh commitments all of them leading to uh you know large scale

AI adoption that benefits both commons and individuals what specific policy advice does MAC &gt;&gt; sure thanks uh thanks so much Rakkesh I think I'm going to address a couple of

points that were made earlier as well uh specifically talking from the perspective of the policies that government needs to do. I think firstly India is doing a great job uh regulating

the use case of technology is probably one of the best approaches that that the world can follow because you can't have uh technology specific regulation uh we when we are talking about policy or

regulation it really needs to focus on what are the outcomes what are the harms uh we are trying to address. So unlike Europe, India is definitely showing a uh example to the world. How do we strike a

balance between regulation, innovation and adoption? I think a lot was discussed on data. Uh definitely uh we need good uh governance principles which minimize the risk of uh issues with the

data. Security of data is paramount. We we need how we need transparency on how data is shared. Investment in privacy-enhancing technologies is also very critical but at the same time we

need all of these governance frameworks to enable access to data but not just restricted for the very fact that uh professor just mentioned we we want a lot of these applications definitely to

for us to work for India and I don't think digital tools is just limited to media I think it's much more it's beyond that today just taking an example of how a farmer can just use a WhatsApp to

communicate with with anybody in improve the crop performance and I think the same is also coming with AI. Uh sir gave an example of how data is actually ch AI is actually changing the way in which

Indian agricultural is going to operate uh in the future. So I think the opportunity opportunity is great. So we definitely need rules, policies uh which actually don't restrict data sharing but

uh enable all the applications the upcoming technology to also work for global south because language is a big problem. If you have all of these tools built in languages which don't support

local communities and how will people use it. So if you really need to reach the last mile, if you want the benefits to go to every citizen in the country, uh accessibility and inclusion in my

view are are critical and policy supporting that uh would be uh very important. &gt;&gt; Thanks. Thank you prai. Uh Amanda uh one of the constant concerns regarding uh

open is about while open in name uh it should not be closed in practice especially on the licensing and compliance burdens. So how do you think uh you know we ensure that uh AI does

not get there &gt;&gt; does not &gt;&gt; uh get there when when we say you know how do we prevent uh complexity around compliance and licensing?

There's been a a lot of discussion today that in other panels that I've been on that sort of brings us to this point in the afternoon. It's been quite a long day, right? I don't know if everybody

else has had quite a long day, but we've had a lot of conversation and we've talked about regulation and laws. And while I was listening to you all, I realized it's 30 years since I

started working in tech. I started working in tech in 1996. I was a an internet and a dot lawyer. And I I was listening to what you were saying and we built laws that were suitable for

selling online because that's what we were doing. You know, in the 90s, in the early 90s, that's what we were doing. We had no concept of social media. And we made laws that we thought worked well,

but they didn't shift and change because law makingaking is a slow process and it's an expensive process and a difficult process. Policy isn't much easier. And what we see is something I

don't know if you'll know this term, regulator. capture, policy capture where it's possible for those with money to influence where it goes. And sometimes they'll encourage you to make more

regulation so that only they can comply with it because they need resources to do that. So sometimes it's better not to have regulation or it also won't deliver what it is you

want to achieve. I I'm sorry I I haven't met everybody before, but we one of you talked about water and the flow right at the beginning. I used to live in Amsterdam. Uh I don't know if you all

know Amsterdam, but it's a city built on canals. And the Dutch had a challenge. They had a challenge of flooding. And there's a a famous story of a little Dutch boy who puts his finger in a hole

in the wall to hold the force of the sea and the water overflowing. And clearly that's doomed to fail in the end. So what the Dutch did instead was they worked with the water and they created

this canal system that they could control that powers their agricultural environment allows them to be in Europe one of the best at growing things because they have all this water. So

they found a way of making it work by sort of working with it. They do have an element of control but they created that control in harmony with the ecosystem rather than pushing control onto it. And

and I think when we look at AI and technology, we want it to serve us. We don't want to be its servants. And when I look back on my 30-year career, I do not believe that politicians and

regulators would have made the decisions they made if they knew where it was going. And the difference 30 years later is we we know a lot more, right? We know where we may be going and we could guess

and bet on some of those things happening. So what we need is to learn from the recent decisions that we all make and I think we have to understand that it's more about practicalities and

what happens than whether you have a law or policy right and we have to work at ensuring we spend the money in the right way to build the landscape that actually enables to have what we need and that

what we need is this access for all and I think we need access for all in two ways we need it for the end users to be able to access the technology so that everybody has access to the internet but

we also need it in order that we can innovate and if you want to shift uh India so that you're not just one of the biggest contributors to AI but you become a leader a leader that's powerful

and has influence in the long term then you need these practical steps to be taken and you know China is a great example in this seven eight years ago they set up an open source first policy

and they built the infrastructure like have a national foundation called open atom and if you look at the steps they took it's all public you can see some of the things that will need to be done I

feel like I'm eating into your time so I'm going to hand you the mic &gt;&gt; uh it's only fitting that I come to you last or summer uh can you share with us a use case or an example that you have

come across uh especially around community centered AI in whether it's education health or any other area that you felt uh could be something worth emulating

Yeah. So, uh what I learned is that technology and the medium with which it all started like English was the medium of all the technologies that came to and I remember about from 20 25 years back

when we were doing digital literacy in the ground most of those people were learning on their own and not the course that we were putting you know for example one simple thing uh I went to

one of the centers and the kid was opening YouTube or something and he did four buttons And uh I said how did you open this? I remember through the sign of the language or the keyboard what

website to open and not the curriculum that you have given right and and most of the computers one person will be holding a mouse another person will be keyboard and the third person will say

you know open this one and open this one and all that. So what I actually figured out that peer learning uh peer curriculum or peer way of adoption is very very important and India for some

reason I mean for many many years you know we were pushing technology and they were adopting in their own way for example WhatsApp got so much penetrated only because of audiovisisual nature and

because of its uh its its voice nature and the video nature and the symbol nature you know because we knew how to do a simple way of communication. We knew how to do a oral communication. So

that is how uh we got it. But in in that manner what happens is that we are also getting their data without really letting them know in the way they would understand. So what is very important is

that you know can we have with them by them and and and and and and from them rather than we push everything you know in the name of higher literacy or higher education and all that and that's that's

what the uh the the uh whether we call it digital public infrastructure or we call it uh because digital itself is a language of its own you know but we we how do we really put them into into the

way they can adapt it and and they can they can be used with awareness of rights not with the awareness of only being a consumer that's that's very very important and that is where we need to

push the technology in a manner that it it becomes with them and ra for example Jes was talking about data exchanges and all that you know does that is it understandable by the public whose data

is there you know it's it's very important or public representative or something like that so We we need to be very very inclusive in terms of policym in terms of rules and regulation and all

that while we are pushing the technology or technological uh devices. &gt;&gt; Uh thank you thank you the panelists for your wonderful insights and &gt;&gt; thank you for that extremely rich

discussion panelists. We now move to the second segment of this session one that demonstrates that democratizing AI infrastructure what what it looks like in practice. Now in partnership with AI

Kosh as part of this broader AI common vision uh faculty and meta supported the AI for all hackathon which focused on tools that make public data sets AI ready. This took place in multiple

rounds and the response address data usability and multilingual access. I now request Mr. Jay Shanjin, Miss Prai Bhya and Mr. Rakkesh Dubu to present the prices. First place goes to intelligent

document processing by Cedax Flash. Never mind. We can just move on to the next page. Uh second. All right. &gt;&gt; Correct. The second place goes to Biz Nova by

Code Plus and the third place goes to FAP NextGen by AI for Health. Thank you so much participants. &gt;&gt; This was online. Yes. This was not

today. Yes. So let's do &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; What we have today reflects on my love [music] and family. I thank

our family.
