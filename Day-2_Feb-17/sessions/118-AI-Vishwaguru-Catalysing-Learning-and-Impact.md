## 📝 Transcript

and to fund the research and learning needed to scale what works. A fun fact, Igbal previously served in the Indian administr administrative service and was in fact the topper of the 1996 badge. So

he wears multiple hats. Sam, please share a few more words about about the playbook with all of us. Thanks, Kaneka. Hi everyone. Uh JPAL is thrilled to announce our new AI evidence playbook, a

practical resource written for policy makers, practitioners, and funders who are investing in or building AI enabled programs. In this playbook, we sum up everything we know from randomized

evaluations of programs that involve AI and from decades of evidence on human behavior and past technology for good efforts. Our goal is to support three decisions. where AI can best help

improve lives. How to design AI enabled programs so that they work in the real world and how to evaluate them to avoid wasted resources and ensure that we share the full benefits of AI. This

playbook was co-authored by Atala Abasi Daliwal Audrey Loro and myself and we're very grateful to all of the researchers who are working on rigorously evaluating AI enabled programs. We will be updating

the playbook regularly to capture the latest lessons from the field. I would now like to call upon our esteemed guests, Mr. Abishek Singh, Maggie Johnson and my co-authors Bal Daliwal,

global executive director of JPAL and Audrey Lorvo, AI policy associate at JPAL to join me on stage. Maggie Johnson is the global head and vice president of Google.org, the philanthropic arm of

Google. Google.org or is invested in unlocking the potential of AI for social good and is the anchor funer for Jap's project AI evidence initiative. A fun fact before entering the philanthropy

and technology sectors Maggie was a professional musician. Mr. Abhishek Singh is the additional secretary ministry of electronics and information information technology matei CEO of the

India AI mission and director general of national informatics center NIC overseeing India's AI and emerging emerging technologies agenda including cyber security and digital skilling Mr.

Abhishek Singh focuses on building Indian foundation models, scalable applications, trusted data sets and a strong AI workforce and has a key role in developing India's national

sevenpillar whole of government AI strategy. [music] A fun fact, Mr. Abishek Singh has also been named times in times 100 most influence influential people in AI 2025.

You can now download the AI evidence playbook using the QR code on the screen. &gt;&gt; Should I go? Okay, great. Thank you everybody for joining us in this

afternoon session. Uh I do want to uh you know call out one thing. When I was a civil servant here and we used to do conferences in Delhi, it used to be you know there would be seven or eight part

you know speakers there would be 30 or 40 participants. A big conference meant that there were 100 people and then somehow it was on the participants to you know broadcast the messages to the

rest of the world. So uh you know I think I really want to commend government of India for democratizing this particular AI summit and for making sure that everybody who is going to

touch and feel AI in India not just from Delhi but from all parts of the country are here and I also want to say that you know does it mean that it makes things difficult? Absolutely. Does it mean that

it takes long lines to get us in? Absolutely. But if only 10% of the folks who are in this room and yesterday I was here and there were so many of these college students and high school

students if only 10% of them turn into successful or even try their hand at AI entre being AI entrepreneurs this is a huge success. So I really want to commend government of India for doing

that. So so thank you for doing that. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you. And in fact uh thank you for doing this session because I've been hearing a lot about this particular schedule of sessions from

many stakeholders and uh I would say that not only people in this room are watching it but the sessions are being broadcast live and many people are joining and yesterday one session which

I tuned in because I could not walk into the room it had 11,000 people watching online. So there's a lot of community outside and I'm sure this session also must be reaching out to many people

beyond this room as well. &gt;&gt; Amazing. Okay. So uh I'm going to start Abhishek with you. Uh you know like when people join the civil service they're like maybe I will get one position where

I can have a transformative impact. Uh you managed to or or you were at in this position for more than four years now and you know four years ago people hadn't even heard of AI on the street

that you know Chad GPT broke in front of you and look where we are now. Uh so you've seen a seminal transformation on how technology can improve governance, productivity, how it can become a part

of our daily lives. So based on what you have seen, what is it that excites you most about the potential for AI? What are the things that you worry about? And uh if there's one lesson in all of this

for other countries, what would that be? So three questions in one. Thank you. So AI is pretty recent in fact as you rightly said like most people like of course an old technology 1956 the term

was coined but more people have become aware of AI since the chat GPT moment but if you look at uh not only four years if I look at my entire career I have been spent almost 15 years in the

tech sector in the by being in the government and part of the digital government part in fact but this is my ninth year in the same ministry I was part of this digital when we started the

egovernance plan long back and the digital India story all major projects when we associated ated with. So what I see is that AI is taking forward the narrative of digital public

infrastructure. We built digital public infrastructure in India through the India stack whether the Aadhaar the UPI or the digil locker or the other associated GVD

dika projects primarily to ensure that access to services is enabled for people in all languages and anywhere. What AI is doing is that it's adding a layer to it making services accessible through

all lang all languages and through voice. So in a way what is doing is exponentially expanding the reach of AI and in fact literally or figuratively I think of it as DPI raised to the power

of AI. So that way DPI's reach goes beyond. So if a farmer wants to access a service instead of going to a browser or downloading an app or getting lost in the capture, he could actually speak to

a on a tollfree number with a 2,000 rupee phone and ask or where do I get seeds? Where do I get fertilizers? How do I get agree advisories? And he able to enable voice

enable services for that. It's transformational for him because he becomes part of the knowledge economy. So in healthcare people can access services. A lot of kids die of diarrhea

still. But the solution people are not aware. They don't have access to a specialist doctor. But if they can just pick up a 2,000 rupee phone, make a call to an AI doctor and ask in their mother

tongue, what do I do? My child is having uh diarrhea and they get the reply back, it will be it will be enabling access to healthcare by using these tools. So this is what AI has the potential to do for

that. What what do I worry? of course becoming a long answer but my worries is of course in ensuring that we are able to train our workforce to take advantage of the opportunities that are coming in

the field of AI because in the short term some low value jobs some entry-level coding jobs debugging jobs which can be done better by AI those jobs will be adversely impacted how do

you ensure that these people are given the necessary skills so that they move up the value chain and start building AI transformational services get to know about agentic AI, physical AI, edge AI

and get into making autonomous vehicle systems. So those jobs which will arise in the AI economy when we need to to ensure that we able to skill and reskill people so that they don't are not

adversely impacted. So that's the one major worry that I have. Fantastic. So so Maggie at google.org you have the vantage point of looking at the best of the world not just India or one other

country or the United States. So when you look at your portfolio of investments and the people who come through the door, what is it that strikes to you most? Is there something

that strikes out and say, "Oh, wow. This is incredible and uh I wish others would adopt this." &gt;&gt; Uh when when I think about India, there's so many um different possible

examples. I I think one that comes to mind is a organization called Karda. And they've done this really clever thing. And if you think of all of the big AI labs, they all need data, you know, and

one of the things that they really need are is data in local languages. So what happened is what KA did is they actually went to uh people in rural India and had them create the data sets that these

models needed and then sold them to the labs. And what's really neat about that is that that's really good money and that ended up going to those uh people who are creating those data sets. And it

just it doesn't stop there. Uh anytime that uh we reuse those data sets in other models, they get royalties. So it keeps going and and the actual pay is way more than minimum minimum wage in uh

in rural India. So it's a it's a really great example of how you got this really clever idea and thousands and thousands of people in India are benefiting from it and they're actually um scaling it to

uh Ethiopia and Kenya. So I think that's one example that is just like so clever and so innovative and it's helping so many people. &gt;&gt; Fantastic. So just following up on that

like you know the title of our SP thing is Swish Guru which means you know a teacher for the rest of the world. So again looking at the ecosystem of Indian AI applications and how the DPI and how

we got there like what are the key lessons for some of the other countries who may be behind India in the development of AI and other applications. What does a country like

India or what did a country like India get right when you go to some of the other countries you say guys you should be doing this? &gt;&gt; So you're flipping it for me. Yes. Okay.

So um yeah I think that there's um there's a lot of different um applications that are happening elsewhere in the world that I think are starting to come into India. Uh one is

called a digital twin and what that actually means is a virtual replica of a physical entity. So a really great example is is a city. So you can create a model of a city that has you know it's

with sensors and AI and various other types of data and if you have that model you can actually do interventions in the model like put a bridge there or change the traffic pattern and see what happens

in the model so you know you can understand the ramifications in the in the real world. So one of the things that is um happening in India now it's starting to happen but it's actually

happening more in um elsewhere around the world is this this kind of um city simulation. So what one example is our research scientists create a created a system called green light and what this

does is it takes real time pedestrian and traffic data in a city and then it actually modifies the traffic lights and how they operate based on that data. And what's happening is that at least in

India, we've got this running in several cities is that the um the emissions are actually being decreased by 10%. And the number of full stops which are actually really bad for the environment are are

being decreased by 30%. So that's an example of something that we actually have implemented all around the world but it's starting to make its way into into India.

&gt;&gt; Fantastic. So uh I'm going to ask a question which is common to both of you. Uh you see a lot of applications AI applications come your way. uh hopefully a lot of them succeed but many of them

don't make their way through. So Abhishek from your point and later Maggie from your point drawing around the experience are there any common themes that you see between what these

you know like these 11 applications got right and therefore they not only are impactful but manage to scale and here's another stack of examples where we thought wow these have high potential

but somehow they didn't really click. uh is there any common theme that emerges in what succeeds and what fails? I think uh as far as AI applications are concerned, it will be too early to call

on what succeeds and what fails because AI is just coming in the solutions which are deployed many of them are in pilot stage the proof of concept stage and when they are scaled up then we'll have

to be able to see and after giving them a finite time for whether they're mature enough whether they've reached to the last mile whether deployment solutions have been sold out or not like for

example AI to diagnose tuberculosis it has worked very well in in pilots and proof of concept. But when you deploy it in field across primary health centers, community health centers and let it run

for some time, train the whole people, then only time will come when you start evaluating it. But to answer your question, if you look at the example that we have from digital solutions

because digital government solutions have been there for a long time, AI is just a layer over that. So if you look at why digital government solutions succeed and fail. So I have found that

only those solutions succeed which are number one solving a real world problem because very often in technology the techies think that I have a solution so I'll find a problem where wherein I will

retrofit the solution that doesn't work you have to think a problem from the first principles and try to think how you are going to make something different that applies to all digital

solutions AI included number two you have to think it from the point of view of the person who is accessing the solution If it is a student or a farmer or a rural uh health worker, you have to

design the thing from his perspective. Does sometimes we design like when we're doing portion tracker for Anganadi, we would think of thinking everybody will have a smartphone and iPhone doesn't

work. They might have a 5,000 rupee phone. Does the solution work there? Does the solution work with intermittent connectivity like what we did there like asynchronous connectivity? So the

application should work on a low cost device in a low connectivity area and the data should shrink uh when whenever the connectivity gets in. So one will have to think of real world challenges

design it make it easy for citizen to address. Sometimes we put captures even educ literate people the way we define literacy they will got get in rural area they'll get lost between the hashtags

and the ants and the amberscent. So that's not so some we very often design things from our perspective. So we'll have to step into the shoes of the person who is using it. Walk across the

table look at the perspective from the other side and then we design whether it is a digital system or an AI system it will work. AI is just a form of technology. It's not something different

from digital products and digital solutions. &gt;&gt; Amazing Agie. How about you? &gt;&gt; Uh well I think I can actually answer this in a pretty tangible way because I

you're aware of our uh accelerator program and &gt;&gt; so we we run a program. It's a genai accelerator and basically it um it's for organizations that are already using

technology in some way and these are nonprofits and then we help them to actually bring Gen AI into into their platforms. Great example of this is a um an organization called Tarjimi that has

been for many years doing uh translation services for refugees and asylum seekers and they've been doing this since 2017 and always on a technical platform and they were part of a cohort uh just

recently one of our accelerators and brought Genai into their platform and it just automatically increased the number of languages that they were able to translate really reduced the response

time and made a huge huge difference in the service that that they um they provided. So one of the things that I we work really closely with JPAL on is uh they help uh evaluate the impact of

these systems that go through our accelerator and help us to understand well first of all how to improve our accelerator but they help the organization understand how to actually

um go forward and whether or not what they're doing is working and even more important for us is what what could we be investing more in. So those are you know that accelerator I think is a um

interesting answer to your question because I could tell you about the criteria we use for you know actually picking &gt;&gt; actually that would be great because I

was going to come to that later. Yes. &gt;&gt; Oh okay. Do you want me to do it now or all right I'll do it now. Um okay so when we look at these applicants and there are thousands of them that that

apply for our accelerators. I think the first one is scale. Um, typically what happens is that this is an organization that's already using technology and if they bringing gen Gen AI into it, it's

usually for scale reasons. So, we want to see what they're doing with the pilot and then how that will scale to a much larger audience. Uh, the second thing is open source. Uh, we really encourage

open source whether it's the code or the data if possible or even the weights in the model that they might uh create. Sometimes the data is not even available for what they want to do. So that's

another consideration as we're looking at the applications. And then a really important one is you know how much are they thinking about the future? Do they have a vision for a year or three years

out and what they're building and how to make it sustainable for the long term. So those are some of the you know the attributes that we look for. &gt;&gt; Excellent. So then let let me actually

uh talk about the uh from the from the JAR perspective. So we have partnered for a long time with Google.org or on uh funding innovative solutions and piloting them and evaluating them and as

as you mentioned earlier there is project AI uh evidence which which you know calls for really uh uh proposals for these innovative ideas. Last time in our first round we got 65

this year we got 96 proposals and these are very well curated proposals. So kind of there are three core things that we look at which we have found are are good metrics of success. The first is

technology, the second is impact and the third is what exactly what you said building for scale. So the first is technology. I think it's really important for people you know one of the

things that we've seen as a metric of success is who's your technology partner? Are you trying to do it yourself? Does the technology partner have the ability to think through issues

around uh what data is being used? is the algorithm have any biases that need to be thought about uh and and so forth. So that's really important. But there's also the hardware piece of it which

sometimes people forget when you go to the messiness of the real world you know you have tablets which will fall on the ground 11 times in a day in the in the lab the tablet will be sh you know

handled by one person in a classroom there are 40 kids who are kind of sharing this tablet. So one of the first things we look at it's have you thought about this. The second is impact and you

know like in the morning session I talked a lot about you know basic impact but I also talked to you about who benefits. I think sometimes when we look at average numbers and say oh yeah this

particular technology improved the lives of the people that in the treatment group. Sure on an average it did but if the benefit acrewed disproportionately to the best performing students in the

class and the lower performing students in the class actually went down then that particular technology is not what the uh what you probably had in mind because the best performing kids were

doing just fine. The third thing is cost and Maggie alluded to this like how are you going to scale this up if this is way too expensive is extremely important to look at and then the final thing I

would say is you know just to uh you know building for the real world understanding what rules and regulations need to be changed uh in the morning presented about silent heart attacks and

how these handheld e you know ECG devices can help in all of that but what if rule number 37B of the Indian medical council act says you cannot do that without a particular doctor having to

look at the report. You cannot then go and be treated at the at the district hospital. It's really really important. So, so I just wanted to make a plug here for a lot of you who are tech developers

uh or thinking about AI applications that uh this is really really important. Um uh Abishek going back to your perspective uh what practical evidence would you give advice would you give to

your counterparts in state governments you know you are in the fed in the central government but a lot of action happens at the state level you for many years you worked at the state department

one thing we keep hearing is the health secretary saying I'm inundated with 10 people trying to give me these health applications three people who are saying here's a mental health companion for you

two people who are saying this is diagnosing heart attacks. How should even a policy maker start thinking through this model of uh um applications that are coming at them?

&gt;&gt; See like uh for example the example they gave healthcare the health has a health is a fairly regulated uh sector and any solution like whether it's a medicine or treatment protocol or a procedure is

approved through a particular process. It's not that any vaccine or medicine can straight away be deployed. Similarly, if there is an AI tool which replaces a medical procedure, it has to

go through the same level of checks that's normally practiced for other things. And here also like when we the cure AI solution or the Nidan solution uh for the diagnosis of tuberculosis, it

went through testing by the central drug control authority and also with ICMR. So they are the right regulators who kind of look into it and they certify that a solution meets the certain benchmarks

like if it is diagnosing a disease it should be equal to or better than what a human doctor or radiologist will be doing. So those solutions is not to be done at the state government the

approved solutions in a particular sector which is kind of endorsed by the regulators are to be scaled up. So once a solution is there or a class of solutions is there can be deployed at

population scale. One will have to think of how do I train my health personnel in using this solution. How do you use it? What are the dos? What are the don'ts? Where are the mistakes that can happen?

So those are the things that the health ministry should do in the states. Coordinate with the central ministry and ensure that they do the roll out. The scaling of part should happen at the

states and the same will apply in agriculture wherein suppose IC recommends that a particular AI way of diagnosing plant diseases or giving advisories is something that they have

ratified approved then scaling it up ensuring that the same thing is available in all languages across geographies should be done by them. Education the states have a greater say

AI tutors for example AI tutors are there. Are there AI tutors which are performing well? Are they AI tutors which are confirming to the learning levels of a particular uh board or a

syllabus? So they can say that yes this is something that can be used in place of a regular regular teacher. So for every sector there will be different solutions. What will be needed will be

to government of India and states working together in close coordination. The way we have artic the architected India AI mission is that the common layers the compute layer the data set

layer the foundation model layer. This is being provided by government of India and all the applications use cases on top of it can be built by the state governments and the private sector.

&gt;&gt; Great. Uh wonderful Maggie we talked you talked about Kia as one of the social enterprises or uh an example of what the world can learn from India. Are there other examples or other general themes

that we should pick from India uh and that would be useful for the others to think about as they build their own stack of applications or they build their digital public infrastructure

outside? I I think there are so many examples. I I think one of the things that you know uh going from what Ahmaka was just saying there's um you know a few guidelines I think that are always

really important especially um in in India one is really to design with the community to build for the community and then design for scale and what that means is really you know building with

the community means you actually should spend time in that community with it's an educational you know um application with parents and teachers teachers and students and actually understand the

real problems because a lot of times as technologists we assume we understand the problem then build the wrong solution. That way you know that you're going to get it right. So I think that's

really important and then um building for that community. So you want to build the solution that's going to solve that problem but you also have to keep in mind the design principles that are

relevant in that place. So, as as uh just said, you know, maybe the, you know, the devices are a little outdated or the Wi-Fi is a little, you know, spotty. These things have to work

offline. You have to actually be mindful of the environment that they're operating in. So there's all those local considerations and then at the same time you want to be able to design for scale

and that really means understanding the attributes of this community and identify where else in the world it might make sense for that to actually be relevant. So those are some of the

things that I would I would think of. &gt;&gt; Fantastic. Uh we have two minutes left and I'm going to um you know like actually those were the questions I had for this panel but uh I do think that

the previous panel on the labor market impacts was a hugely important issue right so so I'm going to ask this again in sequence to both of you uh Abhishek you mentioned you know like that a lot

of the jobs that might go away are entry-level data coding jobs now I grant that you know like in countries like the US maybe those were not the most well-paying jobs but those were actually

very aspirational jobs for a country like India right like you know to be an entry- levelvel data coding person so how does a country like India transition you I think it's a huge advantage right

that you have all these entry-level coders you have all these people who have in business processing outs BO sector how do you help them transition into the AI sector uh and to to leverage

this so that this doesn't become a net job uh loser and and Maggie after that I would love to hear from you how at Google.org you're thinking about augmenting versus automation and like

how does one make sure that AI follows the direction where humans uh don't end up being on the wrong side of the stick here. Abishek let's start with you see the entry- level jobs uh again if they

if those who are in those jobs if they get these coding agents today we hear about uh cloud for 5.2 2 we hear about uh uh cursor we hear GitHub copilot codeex seram has built their own coding

engine so there are a lot of coding engines that are coming in so what happens is that when the coders the entry-level coders arm themselves with these coding agents then they become

much better advanced versions of themselves and they acquire the skills and abilities to build agentic AI because any enterprise or organization which is trying to adopt AI I it's not

that they just get a subscription of a chat GPT or a cloud cloud and they are done with it. It doesn't happen like that. You will have to integrate these coding agents and these tools with your

legacy IT systems. So for example, whether it's a bank or a transportation network or a power company, they will have to integrate these agents into their systems and these will be called

as AI transformation services or what Palanteer calls forward deployment engineers. So the job roles of these will increase and they will be much higher paid than any other jobs compared

to the coding level jobs and India especially with its talent expertise and the number of people who are acquiring these skills we have become like the go-to hub for sourcing AI transformation

engineers forward deployment engineers. So what I feel is that there's a huge opportunity for the Indian IT industry to take the game up. Their outcome, their outputs, their ability to provide

these services to multiple companies will go up. Similarly, we look at physical AI, the robotics, there's a whole area remaining to be explored in 3 to 5 years. Just like people have

especially in the western countries, not in India immediately, three to the every person who thinks of having a car will also think of having a robotic assistant. So those who can design these

systems, those who can build the systems will there will be jobs for that. So jobs evolve, AI will not take away any jobs. People with AI skills will take away the jobs of people without AI

skills. &gt;&gt; Uh I will be very quick. Um I completely agree it um I mean if I think of what is really the focus right now, it's around training these models, putting them into

production and having that infrastructure available. And what I think is going to happen is that all the applications that sit on top of that have not been developed yet. And those

are the things that I think are going to be that growth opportunity for you know these um uh software engineers that have the AI capabilities and use the tools that way.

&gt;&gt; Amazing. So uh uh I hope both of you are absolutely true and uh on that note please join me in thanking our brilliant panelists. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you Mr. S Maggi and Ibal

[applause] for your thoughts. I would like to call upon Shobini Mukharji, executive director, Japal South Asia to felicitate the panelists

off I don't know. Okay. Thank you all. We'll now be taking a short break and starting the next

session at 3:40 p.m. If you would like to learn more about JPAD and to collaborate with us, please scan the two the QR code on the two podiums here.
