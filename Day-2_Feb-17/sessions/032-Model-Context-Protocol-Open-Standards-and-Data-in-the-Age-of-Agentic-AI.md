## 📝 Transcript

rather than who is serving the with the best and with the most optimized way for power sector for education. &gt;&gt; Yes, it is absolutely a breathtaking race that is happening right now amongst

all of the leading labs. I don't see that changing at all in the future. In in fact, the race might speed up. Uh models are being released all the time and also new applications of how to use

the models. So, I'll give you an example that might get to get to your question. uh Claude for finance and Claude for healthcare are two recent product releases that that we've done and they

specialize the the way you're using the tool if you work in finance for example so you have access to proprietary data you're able to do Excel calculations in a way that you need to for your job and

I think that will be the future along with increasing rounds of new releases I don't see that changing anytime soon and the the competition is is really defined by this exponential growth that we've

seen to be actually extremely consistent in terms of compute capabilities, metadata. We're we're going in the the increases we've seen due to other aspects like reinforcement learning. Um

so this is this is how we're going to experience technology just an everinccreasing pace of releases and then an increasing personalization for the exact use you need for the industry

you're in. Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Uh I appreciate your uh statement that Hello. Hello. Yeah. appreciate your statement that uh there

is a young population in India who are contributing uh too much here but our major issues we are tier two tier three cities our major issue is that uh we don't get these uh

high performance computing uh solutions from AMD I mean I I don't see AMD is not aggressive ive in uh India in providing uh say u uh processor like u uh this uh uh thread rippers with the Nvidia cards,

multiple Nvidia cards where we want to use the systems with uh I mean uh power optimized uh workstations with eight eight processors, eight GPUs plus uh two thread rippers or uh new generation uh

uh processor. answers. I I mean I'm not getting uh the uh quote from uh uh OEMs. &gt;&gt; Uh listen, we should we should talk after this. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So so I think I I I'll just say

that we are motivated to make sure that you have access to our best uh you know GPUs and we'll continue to work at that and we will we will follow up with you. Thank you. Stick around.

&gt;&gt; Yeah. Thank you. You know, but we all understand. &gt;&gt; Yes. So, you know, the we talk about AI literacy, AI access and of course the impact, but how do you really measure

that? You know, ultimately the theme is welfare for all all, happiness of all. So far, you know, there are metrics and this is not enterprise value of a company. It's not GDP of a country. It's

beyond that. So how do you begin to measure some of this so that you know we know the progress from vision to impact but how do you quantify that? I'll let them jump in a second, but so I I've had

quite a few roles in government, both in the US government and in the Australian government. And um and that is perpetually the hardest questions to answer for any government is how are you

um how are you quantifying impact for for citizenry, right, on any services that you are providing for them. So given that we're very very early stages in what the like the potentiality of

this technology or the how much it can transform people's lives I don't think that that the metrics are quite there yet because people are trying to figure out how they can they can enable this

technology how they can use it in sectors to to accelerate people's um the benefit toward towards their citizenry. Um, but I'll say that from like my former uh US government and former

Australian government. &gt;&gt; Would you like to add to that? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah, we're done. Okay. So, so sorry everyone and uh thank you for the

eagerness for the questions. I'm happy to to stay back and have a couple of conversations. Um but thank you to the panelists and thank you Abashak for your intervention. Uh and thank you all for

for joining us today. my sir. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; My question is from panel is how AI will

disrupt the stock market, money market and how AI will emerge in finance sector. &gt;&gt; Hello. Uh I'm so sorry. Just one second. We'll take a picture. We'll go in

outside and then you can have your picture. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay. What we do? &gt;&gt; Okay. Nice meeting you.

&gt;&gt; This is what I dec one more. One more. Oh, thank you very much. Good morning. So everyone here for the world cafe if

you're here from the previous session appreciate it if you make space for those who are here for the world cafe. Hey, thank you.

You know what? Hello. Let me start the presentation. The patient So basically,

That's good. Oh yeah. You can ask my colleague. &gt;&gt; Okay. I can't sh can you can you put up the slides here?

&gt;&gt; Okay. We cannot see it there. Look at how Check. You have to be very

We had a couple &gt;&gt; of Hey, good morning. You can put it up there. Okay. But you already

can start. &gt;&gt; Can we start? &gt;&gt; Just a minute. Yeah, hang over here. Hey, good morning everybody. Welcome to

our world cafe. My name is Sager. I am um a research uh manager lead a group of researchers from Cintev in Norway. So I welcome you all to this world cafe. I don't know if you know what a world cafe

is. Yes, there's a lot of uh information about it in the in the sheets we have distributed. Molly has distributed around. So um it will be an interactive session. So it's a good idea to not sit

with your friends and uh sit with people you don't know. But uh I guess this was not um uh something that we planned for that will be so many but we'll try to do our best

anyway. So why is this not working? Why are we here? So we are here to um explore the core tension between sovereignty and uh building across

borders. So how do we trust each other so that we can uh build AI pro products projects AI enabled uh projects that can have an impact in our society. So this is the main question we want to explore.

So um this conversation actually aims to bring together a very large ecosystem. So we have had registrations from different people. So we will have people from research including myself,

startups, industry, government, civil society and also foundations. Um each of them are very essential to making this collaboration across borders work.

So let's use this space to listen, connect and co-create practical pathways forwards. There's a bit of a lag. I don't know what to point.

All right. So the goal today is so we want to uh we want to have inputs from everyone. It's a collective intelligence um sort of exercise to agree on how we will work together. Uh

what kind of ecosystems and enablers we can uh think of that can allow us let's say I'm from Norway and India. How can we work together? how can what are the means that can be made possible so that

we can actually focus our efforts and agree on dos and don'ts and what is sovereign friendly and sovereign safe. So this this is the goal and those who contribute will also be invited to sort

of be acknowledged as part of a or co-author a four-page policy brief that will be the outcome of this session. So the agenda for the today. So like I said the world cafe the purpose is to

gather collective intelligence. Um so it's very important that we make opportunity for everyone to speak and give their opinions. So it's not just me talking and you listening. So it's a

very sort of a flat uh uh setup here. So every table So we have different tables here. So since we don't have tables we we will have conversations in each row. Um so 1 2 3 and so on. Mutz will give

out numbers for the each of the tables later on. So you will start by introducing yourselves. So you become aware of your expertise on the table and then you'll

appoint the table host. So one of you will actually mediate the conversation and guide the conversation ensuring that everyone's included. Due to time constraints there will be no formal

rotation in the room. So usually there's rotation but we won't have that. So capture your insights in a shared QR document uh sorry document results from it later on.

Sorry. So the agenda for today is as follows. So we move from purpose to practice to action. We begin with um a four-minute lightning pitch by Alexandra Beckorf who

will frame why crossber applied AI matters. Now uh this will set up the first discussion on interest, trust and shared opportunities. Anil Sharma from TCS will

then share works in real world collaboration leading to a second round of collaboration uh uh second round on collaboration models. from Nokia will explore how to remain

technologically open while safeguarding sovereignty informing a third round. And finally, Aman Anand Kamanvar will give his vision of AI Silk Roads linking government startups and applied

ventures. And finally, I'll outline the next steps for what will happen after this so that we can continue with the momentum. So with this I would like to invite

Alexandra to give her first lightning pitch. Alexandra, would you &gt;&gt; uh you can do it even that but it's up to you. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I think so.

&gt;&gt; Good morning everyone. Um my name is Alexandra Beyb. I'm uh talking to you uh from the vantage point of one of the largest research and technology institutes in Europe, Cintf. We also

have high impact collaboration here in India as well as in low and medium income countries in the world. And we pursue a dedicated strategy to broker international networks for collaborative

solutionsoriented research for innovation including in the dynamic space of AI. We also set up a number of deep tech startups in this space. &gt;&gt; There we go.

&gt;&gt; Now, most conversations about AI focus on how smart the models are. Uh but the bigger shifts happening right now is something else. AI is becoming a coordination layer for society. It's

starting to help complex systems adjust to each other. Not just optimizing one things, but balance many things at once. We're seeing this in energy where AI helps managing electricity flows between

regions with very different energy sources, renewables in one place, fossil hydro another. And that's not just prediction, it's real time coordination. And this idea goes beyond energy,

industry, logistics, climate response, all depends on systems that must constantly adapt to each other. So the real impact of AI isn't only that machines can think, it's that we're

automating how systems interact. And once coordination becomes automated, the question is no longer just about performance. It becomes about who can participate, who can shape it, and how

safely these systems work together. If AI is becoming the coordination layer, then a key question is who gets to shape the coordination? It only works when all participants have

the capacity to make their own independent choices and shape their own life and future. We call it agency, not just access. It means local teams can adapt systems

to their own realities, question AI outputs instead of blindly trusting them and adjust how AI behaves in that context. And without this, countries don't take part in the coordination.

They are simply coordinated by systems designed elsewhere. We can see what agency looks like at a national scale in India. India is investing in it in its own AI compute

and developing models grounded in its own languages, data and societal needs. That's not just technological progress. It's the ability to shape how AI works in areas like public service,

agriculture, and industry. So capacity building is not a side topic. It determines who helps design the systems that increasingly connect our economies and societies.

AI systems are not involved in one shared environment. They're being trained on different data under different rules and based on different assumptions about how the world works.

That's normal. Countries have different infrastructures, regulations, and priorities. But when these systems start interacting, those differences don't disappear. They collide. And that's

where risk comes in. A mis mismatch between AI environments can turn into systemic instability. Not just because one system is wrong, but because they were never designed to work together.

Take energy systems. An AI model trained to optimize a highly stable grid with certain market rules may behave very differently when connected to a grid with different constraints, supply

patterns, or regulatory structures. So the risk we face isn't just bad AI. It's misaligned AI systems or ecosystems interacting in tightly connected systems. And as AI becomes more involved

in coordinating critical infrastructure, these mismatches scale from technical issues to society societal risks. So if misalignment create risks, this the answer is the answer to centralize

everything. No, global coordination does not require one authority controlling all AI systems. That would just ignore ignore local realities and reduce agency. What we really need are shared

mechanisms. Shared testing environments allow systems to be exposed to conditions beyond their original context. And here I think about digital sandboxes, but also physical

laboratories that we run among others. Interoperability standards help systems understand each other technically. Crossber validation means models are checked outside their home environment

and mutual safety principles create trust in how systems behave. Systems remain local shaped by national priorities etc. But they learn how to work together. And a good example is

countries using joint simulation environment to test AI systems together how they interact under stress without giving up control. It's about alignment. Let's so let's

diverse systems cooperate safely. So just a little bit about what we do in Cintf. AI impact depends on coordination and many of our projects address this at complimentary levels. Read builds

coordination into operations clear creating learning feedback loops. Enfield ensures that coordination is safe and sustainable developing trustworthy and energy efficient AI that

can operate reliably across domains. Data pact uh tech tackles the governance layer compliance and data spaces that allow organizations to share and use data responsibly without losing control.

Edito scales the planetary level building shared digital infrastructure so countries and institutions can coordinate decisions using common models and data. And through the EU project

open mod for Africa we extend this model globally supporting open global collaborative model in that enable eight African countries to coordinate energy and development decisions using shared

tools and data together. This is what real AI impact requires systems that learn together act safely and share responsibly. Thanks for listening and hopefully we find partners for new

projects. If India was to join the European framework program for research, that would be a fantastic uh enabler. Had I had more time, I could speak about similar topics on digital twins of the

ocean and the intersection of uh environmental protection or supply chains for critical rear earth materials, but there has to be some limits. Thank you for listening.

All right. So, it's now now time for the room to take action. So, this brings us to the first round of the World Cafe. So, you'll have about 10 minutes. So, I'll moderate that um

depending on how much time we have left. So, uh so our guiding question for the first round is how do we manage different interests across research, startups, government and large firms

while still collaborating effectively across borders. So at your tables focus on trust across jurisdictions, data, intellectual, property accountability and how we can include startups and

small and middle uh u small and mediumsiz enterprises. So you can start by introducing yourselves, appoint a table host, someone who is who can mediate the

conversation and let the conversation flow. There's no formal rotation like I said. Most importantly, everyone can and should contribute share concrete experiences and nuance insights in the

shared document. So let's begin. So you can &gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay. So you can Yeah. &gt;&gt; We have 18,000 people in India. 18.

one of the biggest research and development hubs that we have. We have factories here. I mean we have always all the fun actually we have all the functions of the corporation here

present. So we are here happy we are market leader for it is very strong partnership. My colleague Sagar is very keen on this international support

collaboration. We are not white. talking about what is what really is the understanding is quite natural there

are as many definitions of ecosystem as there are people that you are asking from so we are trying to harmonize that and then now I'm also running this AI ga factory initiative

for the north of Europe. So we have Latia, Estonia, Finland and Denmark together private sector and public sector and we are going to

EU why not Sweden. I know but that's great. We'll have another opportunity for this. So I'd like to

welcome Anil Sharma. He's the global head of TCScoin co-inovation network to deliver the next presentation. Anil brings lessons from global AI collaboration. what works, what doesn't

and how part partnerships can scale across borders. So, Anil, the stage is yours. &gt;&gt; Okay. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Sager. And uh good thanks for

having me here. Uh I just want to give you a set uh can you hear me well? &gt;&gt; Okay. So, I just want to give you a uh philosophical question. See, what is the purpose of AI, right? What should AI do

for us? I think see in TCS we have this thinking, right? when you look at knowledge work. So what is knowledge work? The work done by doctors, engineers, marketers is all knowledge

work. And what should AI do right? So if you think about uh somebody like a good marketer, what is an like an average marketer and the elite marketer? An average software

engineer elite engineer. See there is a many order of gap between these uh capabilities. See one uh paradigm shift we want to address is can AI really bridge the gap between elite skills uh

average skills and the elite skills. That's one paradigm. Uh there's one thing to about think about how AI can impact uh the work whatever work we do the work we do today as knowledge work

would change in one year time three year time uh but uh this paradigm should not change. I think that's something which we believe in strongly. Second is if if you look at India as a country, we have

a lot of communities, right? And there is an access barrier uh for everybody to even participate in services. Like if you look at rural population, they cannot access services. Uh and if you

even look at other areas where we think we are very capable but our understanding for example when you uh when you visit museums right most of us just pass through the paintings which

you have artifacts right. This is one project which we did with monk museum in uh Norway Oslo. And the idea here was uh not to build AI which say for example will learn how monk paints painting not

to train a model to essentially learn how the monk would paint and then allow other people to create uh painting in his style. But that's not uh a paradigm which would be accepted in a culture in

Norway's culture. I think that's where when we're building AI collaboratively with other countries and other cultures, we have to be very sensitive about what is possible and what is acceptable. I

think the paradigm here is uh the idea which we build here was very simple. See most of us like to draw right now if the question is if I draw can I ask monk to show me what paintings he has drawn and

that idea really worked here and I think the um so idea needs to be simple and this removes access barrier for most of the people who go and discover art. Now if you look at most cultural institution

in the world most of their artifacts are in the vault. monk only has 3% of their artwork uh uh in the galleries 90% of it in the world and this system which we created allows people to

experience most of his collection today right so and I think uh when you're building AI for culture it is not that you can just build and scale so we went through several lab pilots in Norway

with real users so there was a lab one we learned from it lab two we learned from and then it'll be scaled out in a full exhibition in this June. So anybody who

is visiting Norway, you should be able to see this uh exhibition in from June to December of this year. So this is one example. Uh this is another example in India. Uh

how many you know what is Kuma? Right? Most of you. So in the Kuma 2015 is where we got involved with the community there. So we actually created a momentum in the city of Nanasi and then we

deployed 15 interventions and that was probably the most digitally enabled kumla in the country and what we done is here we want uh this ka to be the most AI enabled and accessible kumla so what

we doing is again here it is about not technology so the technology which we are using is from MIT Nanda this is a very promising initiative in the world which is rethinking about uh when you

will have billions of agents on internet what does the internet of agents look like right then you have to solve lot of issues about trust incentive uh how do you transfer money securely uh

and things like those so this is a very good architecture which is being now developed by lot of players in the world and we are also particip participating in this architecture so anybody who is

interested professor Amit Rascar is doing many sessions in uh India summit uh Uh the idea here is simple like a lot of people who visit Kumla uh they are not very literate they speak

many languages. So idea is can we build a personal agent for every pilgrim who comes to Kumbla. So this is essentially augumenting how people can participate in what you call an experience economy

or can in can access can access u services like transport, home stays, health and things like those. Uh I think there are design principles here for India which is we even if we do we have

to be privacy first right we we need to take consent we need to build it securely and we have to build it around trusted systems in the country. So the India DPI

uh digil locker and all those are very trusted systems. So we have going to build this over those systems. So we have now built demos again here because this is going to go live with 50 million

people. It is not easy to get it correct. So again going through lab pilots. We're going to do a lab pilot with 10,000 uh students and this year and next year we will use lot of

experimentation to get it right. This example of uh uh what we're doing. I think this is question you had asked what does it take to do cross cross uh country collaboration MIT is a

technology build in US we bringing it to India and making it relevant uh mango as an example of we as a creative technologist and a culture institution working together to create which works

in country like Norway but the idea there is you always need to have a regional partner a local partner who understand the cultural context and also the understand the user very very

there is has to be uh great incentive to work together. There has to be trust built out and it takes time. Uh again human centricity right even if it is AI we have to make it really humanentric

otherwise this does not work with people. I think that's the message I wanted to give you. Thank you all. Thank you very much Anil. Um, next on the agenda was actually another round of

world cafe, but uh we're going to uh keep that for later because of the lack of time. So I would directly like to invite our next speaker um who is Pari and Pari is the senior

vice president at uh Nokia on strategic government and industry. He brings clear perspective. Sovereignty is not an isolation but control over critical layers and openness is not just a value

but an economic strategy. So with that I'd like to give the word to pass. We'll uh talk from his point of view. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much. &gt;&gt; Hello everybody.

&gt;&gt; Yeah as it says my name is Bosi and before going to the actual topic I want to say I love India. it this this came up uh yesterday's dinner discussion. I have been coming to

India almost every year, sometimes multiple times per year since 1999. I know some of you were not even born at that time. It was very different. It was very different place at that time. And

it has been fascinating to see how the country has evolved, how the infrastructure has evolved, how everything around uh the different industries and others have been

changing. And we were thinking earlier that I mean is this concept going to work here? I mean because we are not having those tables and of course it does work because this is India.

everything is possible country and and the wonderful people inside it they just find the way to make it work. But now more about the the topic itself.

Uh for me this all comes down to ecosystem thinking. How many of you think that you have a

good definition or definition that you feel familiar? What is ecosystem? Raise your hand. I'm sure that you have all been thinking but you you something that you feel that yes this is my

definition. Good. I think that is good and also a little bit the challenge. Public sector, the different government agencies are having their definition of

ecosystem. Private sector players, different industries, different companies, different uh associations, they having their definition of ecosystem.

And as we are ending up talking on a headline level that leads to confusion and then complementing that confusion with all everything what is happening in the geopolitics that the pressure for

sovereignity we have a perfect soup uh in our hands defin my definition and I'm not saying that it would be the right one but my definition of ecosystem

is it's a trustbased get together of everybody who is interested in about the topic. You don't set borders. You don't set limitations. Who is able to

play? Who is allowed to contribute the value is distributed transparently and fairly within that ecosystem. And that has been sometimes a little bit

even painful in in certain conversations because the world where we are coming most of us is somehow dictating a directive that I mean I'm the biggest company I have the most money and

ecosystem should not be led by that thinking it should be I am a good member of ecosystem I have good idea that everybody are able to benefit Philosophically it's almost the opposite

ends of collaboration. It's it's not me me it's us. Let's do this together. And and it is giving us who are who are having that trust to join in this ecosystem. is giving us a wonderful

opportunity to innovate to inspire each others and boost the success beyond the individual companies individual agencies who are participating. I am worried in this AI

era that especially the startups academia are left behind easily and I was listening very carefully our friends uh talking earlier and even the previous

panel it's it's difficult to find that highest quality compute power if you are early stage of your company in ecosystem you can allocate that good in a in a different way based on the perceived

value for the whole thing. I see tremendous opportunity for all of us to work as an ecosystem. Oh, now it did go too far. This is now getting really I mean real time latency

is off. Uh this is just an illustration about ecosystem when it when you turn it as a technology when you turn it as as a stack and and now specifically for this AI

market the world has seen the representation of the most powerful companies we have seen valuations in the wall street that we have not seen before it's of course also changing the

expectation how it is going to work and I think and I'm not here to disqualify any company or actually opposite I mean I'm admiring if some has been that successful but it's not necessarily

always the easiest when we are talking about the sovereignity and the ecosystem modularity is the key to be successful as an ecosystem open interfaces you need you it needs to be as I mentioned open

predictable able and fair, open, predictable and fair that everybody within the ecosystem can connect there and that's the best way also to protect your sovereignity. It is

it's it's clear many countries also players in the private sector they have learned that I mean I want to keep some part of my data in my own hands. This is the answer here. you can define

the systems following that principle and satisfying that need as well and I don't want to go for company marketing not at all but this is how we are doing it uh in Nokia

we promote open interfaces open interfaces in traditional telco world and now in AI era I'm regular member there in European Commission talking about how to do it in practice.

Ecosystems again how we are forming ecosystems around the most compelling topics and making sure that they are really following the trust foundation and being

fair for every direction. Internal openness it's very important as well. I mean how the culture inside the organization is supporting the

openness, how it's supporting the innovation. We are we are very used like the private companies are used to I mean said I mean I'm the most powerful one I'm the most

powerful also the hierarchy within the organization has been quite strongly dictated. I have been protesting against the hierarchy in the organization for for 10

plus years sometimes successfully sometimes not that successfully but I mean it's fascinating when when you know that you are in quite high in the organization and you are having that

environment where the individual engineers or whoever within that group is daring to come to you and share the thoughts and and really I mean seek for that sound polling it's it's very

rewarding and then of course the communities and the standardization how we are able to make the standards which are connecting uh the different members of the ecosystem together.

That's it. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thanks so much Basi. I think we'll move on to the last speaker to of today which is Anand Kamanva.

So, so Anand is at the intersection of government startups and deep tech supply chains. helping turn research excellence into

real world deployment through collaboration. Uh and he will be talking about his concept of AI Silk Roads. And very fittingly, Anand as you all mean know means joy. A reminder that our

shared goal is progress and that benefits everyone. So please join me in welcoming him for the closing remarks. Good morning. It's great to be back in India as always. Uh let me start by

giving a quick uh 30 seconds of context of what applied materials and applied ventures is uh uh very quickly. So applied ventures and applied materials sits at the uh

intersection of the semiconductor industry and physical AI. We make the equipment that makes the chips including the Nvidia chips, the AMD chips, the Intel chips, the HPM memory chips and uh

and so on. And we also make some of the biggest uh TVs or the equipment power some of the biggest TVs in the in the world. So every time at Diwali you go from a 50 in to a 60in 65 in uh we are

the technology that powers it. Um as well um quickly I head applied ventures. We are the corporate venture arm of applied. We have been investing in the deep tech sector before it was sexy. Uh

we have deployed over half a billion and we're looking to including in 19 countries including uh Norway, Finland uh and India uh among other things. Uh I know we are short of time so let me be

direct right there's a whole discussion around like uh what is a national AI strategy and there's no such thing as a national AI strategy. I think it is all about global AI and how you position uh

uh within it. Right? So a lot of the people talk about oh the like the algorithms are coming from somewhere else but keep in mind the data is all local right the data is so you need and

obviously the compute is expensive so you have to work together as uh collectively to make this u happen right so most people think that the bottleneck in AI is the models or uh the GPU

compute and uh data centers and power uh I think you're going to hear a lot about it during this conference I don't think that is the biggest issue I think the biggest bottleneck is trust right I

think trust has to move across borders right if that doesn't happen none of this AI uh stuff is going to happen there's also one other reality we should probably also be very much focused about

right one is um if you see this whole AI and the semiconductor industry right it has it was the semiconductor industry was pretty benign or flat uh and maybe under the radar for the last like few

decades people talked about Mo's law and here and there last few years the stock market is watching the right the the uh the the whole semiconductor stack has changed right we were internally

modeling semiconductor industry to hit 1 trillion in 2030 the good news is it's going to hit this year okay 1 trillion of annual spending that uh in the semiconductor industry it's going to

happen this year okay so and it's and we expecting by 2030 we'll be off we'll be out to around one and a half trillion and I can bet you we'll be wrong uh we we are underindexing it by a wide uh

margin but underneath all of this AI and data centers right what you what we are worried about and at least I'm coming looking from the Silicon Valley side of the world is there is significant and

we're not even seeing the we're not even feeling the effects of it here but I can trust you in couple of years you'll see the effect the entry-level jobs are going away by huge margin right I have a

kid in college and I don't even know what to advise him because advice changes every uh every three months And it's not about just coding, right? It's about marketing, legal, finance,

customer support, design, operations, everything is changing. The last I coded was maybe around 20 years ago. But over the weekend, I was able to use cloud to create a fully automated audio

transcription. Right? And it did a better job than what my 20-year-old what I as a 20-year-old could have been uh doing it. Right? I'm telling you, this ch has changed it so significantly that

we don't even know what's going to hit us u uh uh badly. So the question for India is not will AI change work. I think the question is India be ready before the disruption becomes visible at

scale and that's why this whole crossber discussion is uh is important right uh at applied ventures right we have been &gt;&gt; okay so at applied ventures we are not talking about this only uh academically

right we have been doing this joint venture funds with various regions right as I said we have invested in 19 countries so we have created this joint funds with the government of Korea we

created a joint fund with with Taiwan uh with an organization called it that's where TSMC was born and media tech and UMC uh some of these companies might be uh this one right so one of the things

we did see there and we learned there was right is we are we did this not just for a press release right I we are not operating operating that it was purely the architecture right the Korea brought

lot of systems tech and manufacturing discipline they are the leaders in HBM memory uh if you guys have right and Taiwan is a big player in the whole logic side of the world but India does

bring in talent software and the ability to make this uh work under real life conditions right so that's why we are excited about the collaboration uh in India so a lot of this framing is east

versus west I honestly call it right this whole discussion is how do we make this happen right the the data has to stay local right there are going to be data centers built in India people

are going to complain about oh we don't have power for this we don't have power for that why are they using data centers it's going to happen right I think the question is how do we adapt it and I

think the people in the room are probably are going to drive this right uh in more than anything else so for decades right uh u we have been talking about it and I'll just give an example

of how we did it did this with the Korea and the Taiwan fund and we are hoping to do the Same thing with the European fund and as well as the India fund. Right? So one of the things that we really did was

we did not push for these companies. We invested in these companies. We did not push these country companies to move to US or Europe to grow. Right? We grew these companies in Korea and Taiwan.

Right? So for example in the Korea fund, we invested in six companies. Four went IPO, grew the R&amp;D, grew the IPA right in uh in Korea itself and fifth one is filing for IPO this year. Right? very

successful but both strategically for Korea it has done well and we hope to create the same set of model here in India we invested in a company called BBDN uh which is driving significant

amount of business in electronics manufacturing they have a big booth here at the uh at the uh event as well right so in to end right I think there's a lot of discussion around

uh uh roti kapla and macakan I think we should definitely add AI to it right um it's going to help transform form and I and and I don't think India is going to be left behind. We are pretty bullish on

what this is going to happen uh in every shape or form. So in the end I would like to say like you know this whole crossber collaboration is not a nice PR or press or a nice just event like this.

It is going to happen. I think we just have to be adopted and move faster than anybody else. Anybody who is thinking that oh I want don't want I don't want to use algorithms from here. I don't

want to use data from here etc. I think we're going to be left uh uh uh uh behind. Anyways, thank you so much and I look forward uh to this crosswater All right, I'll just talk about this.

So, thank you so much to all the speakers for a wonderful presentation and thanks all to the contributors. We didn't manage to do all the rounds that I had imagined but um we would still

like to write a policy brief. So if you are interested in participating and contributing put your contact information in the shared document and we can have a meeting online or

something later on. Let's get this conversation going. This was meant to create momentum. So if there are any questions for the speakers now is the time. We have about a minute.

Yes. One first one there and then one here. &gt;&gt; Can you introduce yourself? &gt;&gt; We do a lot of delegation. I come from behavioral science background. I'm part

of a lot of innovation ecosystems. One of the primary challenges we see is everybody actually wants their products to be researchbased which means collaboration everybody wants but we

have really hard walls and those walls have people bureaucracy a lot of things and I think AI is a big hope leveler because it can get virtual it can get democratic it can get smart where ideas

and really people who worked on it matter it will not be about the AI efficiency that the person can speak in but the technical expertise they bring in so I think we're at the right time

But we still need structures where we could maneuver through all this. Like as simple as I just took a delegation to Africa and the thought process absolutely changed when people realized

Africa is just no more Africa. There's so much of Indian and people have got a similar background. So I think a lot of more cultural cross collaboration what Pari was talking about has to be a

little base to this because just technology just innovation alone may not be able to bring in the trust. &gt;&gt; Do you have a question for the speakers? Yes, my question is at this point do we

right now see something brewing in that direction because if you see this whole AI even the summit right everybody's talking about the AI layer alone like there's a lot more below at a

socioeconomic collaboration layer can we have more democratic ecosystem for startups to be part of where it's not just ideas but actual collaborations opened up

&gt;&gt; anyone would like to take that question &gt;&gt; I can take it For me it's not conditional, it's an imperative. We have to take that better into account and and take the responsibility that it works

accordingly. One more question please. Uh maybe there may be some kind of a &gt;&gt; can you introduce yourself? &gt;&gt; Yeah, I am Subar Raju. I am a founder,

mentor, good sava. Good sava means good service. It is a combination of goods service as well as good service. It is a supply chain optimization company. Actually there are a lot of conflicting

uh paradigms are operating at the global level. Like one paradigm is not invented here. The other paradigm is uh duplication of effort. Human we will all have same technological availability.

One can do the other can also do. So that in is an also issue. We'll have a commoditization of technological availability and accessibility and uh we all invent the same things here in

Sweden or India or somewhere China is a some kind of a duplication of effort. Can &gt;&gt; can you question please because &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. here. How this collective

intelligence is possible and uh is it not a confl or things some in your at your country level at your company level there is conflict of interest and how is this collective intelligence

&gt;&gt; we can we can have one word from all the speakers so we can start with Alexandra &gt;&gt; maybe you want &gt;&gt; well I I I think it's impossible to coordinate all activities and I think

duplication ation of effort is also part of competition and one my biggest worry in the AI space is the monopolization that there will only be five five uh companies extracting all the data from

all other countries. So so competition is good. Uh I also think um trusted trusted third parties like a foundation like my own can bring together ecosystems and uh then hopefully also

make space for startups. Sorry that's my &gt;&gt; Thank you. Anand &gt;&gt; I I think we just have to be ready for a world where the cost of intelligence is going to be zero.

&gt;&gt; Okay. It won't be like you know I have to have the access to the best people and the best researchers right the question is what do you do when everybody has the same level of

intelligence or access to the same level of intelligence that the world superpowers have right what you can do with that is is mindboggling right so I I think less worry about who is who if

you were to ask 3 years ago or 5 years ago Google was going to win everything you ask today open AI is going to win if you ask tomorrow anthropic I don't we don't Right. The world is changing but

remember if the cost of intelligence is going to zero what can we do with it and how do we make ourselves more productive I think that's &gt;&gt; we need to move on to the next speaker

so that Anil could you have the final word &gt;&gt; okay so I think see my view is uh there are always going to be geopolitics right so for that reason people may want to

build a duplicate effort but see when the market matures I'll just give you an example if you know what Toyota and Suzuki did in India see they have licensed the mid-market market car here

like if you know Artigga and Toyota Romeo is the same car &gt;&gt; right the idea there was that why see why do you spend 3 years creating a mid-segment car which that is already

proven so I think eventually at some point of time &gt;&gt; uh this we have speakers waiting outside if you can quickly finish it that would be great

&gt;&gt; we also have photographs for everybody &gt;&gt; it's all set &gt;&gt; thank you so much thanks so much put in your contacts and we'll stay in touch Hello, good morning and welcome to this

session on the um global assurance and standards ecosystem. Um my name is Sue Dailyaly. I'm the director for technology and innovation at TechUK. Um uh TechUK we are the UK um trade body

for the tech sector as a whole and it's our absolute pleasure to be here at the summit. Um myself and Tess Buckley who's the organizer of this session. We're really thrilled to be here. So thank you

for the invitation and if you want to know more about TK go and check out the UK pavilion. Um we're in the holistic as well. We're in the UK pavilion over in hall 14. It's worth the extra security

scanner. Go and check check us out. Um today we're going to be talking all about a really a topic that's close to our heart, AI assurance. Um and driving trust and adoption of AI from principles

to proof and really how AI assurance and standards are helping us to do that. Um AI assurance really uh arrived in a bit more of the mainstream last year although many of us have been talking

about it for for many years now. uh we saw governments in the UK, Europe um and and in in Singapore starting to integrate AI um assurance into their governance frameworks into their

principles and their controls. We've also seen companies not just the big four but companies like JP Morgan starting to talk about AI assurance. So it's becoming part of the conversation

with the goal being how you put ethical principles, ethical frameworks into practice and establishing real trust that can then drive real adoption of AI. So I have an amazing panel of experts.

We hope one more is joining us. That's why there's an empty chair here of experts on AI standards governance industry. We're going to talk about what does transformation, what does

development actually mean in terms of the role of AI assurance and AI standards. What are the opportunities here for India? What are the opportunities for the UK and India to

work together on this? Which sectors are leading the way? And I'm sure a lot lot more as well. Um, so it's all going to be about AI assurance and practice, strategic opportunities and

collaboration, which I think is really the collaboration is the word of the summit, right? That's why we're all here. Um but before I introduce the panel and before we kick off, we're

really thrilled to have um with us a presentation that's going to start kind of setting the scene for the conversation. So Carson Maple, who's from the Alan Cheuring Institute, Ken,

thank you so much for being with us. Can you perhaps set the scene a little bit and give us a bit of overview of AI standards in the ecosystem where we are and then I'll get the panel to introduce

themselves and then we'll kick it off. &gt;&gt; Sure. Thanks. Thanks very much. Uh Sue, it's so it's a real pleasure to be here and it's great how packed this room is because it's a really important area um

assuring AI. So um my name is Caster Maple as as Sue mentioned. So I'm from the Allen Turing Institute, the National Institute for Data Science and AI in the UK and also the University of Warick.

And in the UK we have a national hub for edge artificial intelligence. I've got some colleagues from from that hub here as well. So why why does AI assurance matter? I I

find myself talking at quite a lot of events to all kinds of audiences. Um and it's great to set the scene for such a a talented panel that's really going to delve into some of the issues around

this. But what we're seeing is and and part of my session so I will be speaking um organizing a panel on Friday around democratization of AI and that's that's a really great thing right and um AI's

got the power to really lift nations and I I think we're going to see a lot of global effort in this area but democratization of AI means it's in the hands of everybody um and that brings

problems as well as some great things. Um, you've probably seen recently Open Claw um or Clawbot or Maltbook um the biggest changes in in rebranding exercise in one week um and some some

great power and for me as a director of cyber security quite a bit of worry as as well. So this age of agentic AI really means that we need to start thinking about how we um govern and

assure AI. So agentic AI um is autonomous or semi-autonomous agents that they can plan tools they can talk to other agents. Um and this example that I've spoken about in the UK um to

the digital regulators cooperation forum before was about a holiday agent you might have. So if I decide to to have this agent and actually this was before openclaw was around but the technology

existed prior to that but I would have to give access to my diary maybe and maybe also my bank so they know how much money I'd got maybe of my partner and children. Um and this this agent could

then go and discuss with other um agents perhaps some kind of hotel booking agents or um Tvago or whichever you decide to use rather than individual hotels and look at flights. All of that

communic uh coordination seems fantastic but there is a risk. Yeah, there's a risk because this low or no code agents that's proliferating and I've got to say I see this not only hobbyists but

actually in industry people who really are not grounded in um developing software that's that needs to be resilient. Um but we're seeing many nonsecurity engineers people who are

putting out these systems. Um and one of the concerns that we've seen already with these agentic systems and you'll hear from some of the panel I'm sure because holistic will do some of this

testing. Um there could be privacy uh exfiltration so data exfiltration uh that can go on as agents start communicating. There will be trust gaps and we're seeing uh the development. So

um A2A has been around. So agentto aagent communication has been around for a little while now. Um and it's much more powerful than MCP model context protocol. Um but we're seeing also A2P

develop and we'll see more um systems and communication protocols develop. So it's really important that we develop a AI assurance uh processes. So it's not new. Um this is a a paper that a bunch

of academics um I was included uh developed about AI governance back in 2021 in one of the leading journals for machine intelligence nature machine intelligence and this set out some of

the principles what we're looking at now is that's okay. Um, one of the things that we've got to decide is how do we test AI systems? So, the NIST risk management

framework, uh, AI RMF version two gives some idea about some of the things that we want to look at. Is it safe? Is it secure and resilient? Is it valid? So, that's one of the questions I hope

that the panel will consider today. We need to think about how appropriate and verifiable is that assessment. You need to test the right things for the right questions and you need some kind

of audit. It doesn't need to be a public audit, but what you do needs to be auditable by somebody and that's certainly some of the work that we're looking at in ML Commons at the moment.

We need justified evidence collection of um to show how trustworthy our AI is. But there are many ways to test. Yeah. And the problem is if we t take the wrong instrument to test then we're

actually not assuring the AI appropriately. We need to think what is sufficient and acceptable. What are the benchmarks? So I mentioned ML commons and its AI

illuminate that is one such benchmark. It's a global effort and it will provide um the standards that are required the de facto practical standards that are required but we still need to decide for

every other type of uh system for a health system for a finance system what is sufficient and if we test how long is that assessment valid for so I've just put a list of things and

we've got the British stand uh standards uh institute here BSI who have coordinated this event and I'm just putting up the fact that there are so many different standards and I think Tim

who's an expert I've known for many years can talk about some of these but these first standards are just software standards been around for quite some time but then we see the development of

AI standards most notably many of you will have heard of 421 quite analogous to 271 those in the security arena. There's 4219. I'm not going to go through them all,

but I just want to show you how many different types of standards there are. So, there is a plethora of support there in terms of standards and guidance. And what's important is to reflect on those

questions that I set out and think what's the most appropriate way for your um system that you are developing. Sue, I'll hand over to you because the panel can talk a little bit further.

&gt;&gt; Great. Thank you, Carson. Thank you so much for setting that scene. So, let's get to the panel and um some amazing experts for you to hear from and then I've got some questions for them and

hopefully we'll leave a bit of time for some questions at the end as well. I'm just going to ask them each to just quickly introduce themselves, their title, and their organization, then

we'll get going. Natasha, great to have you with us. Please just introduce yourself briefly. &gt;&gt; Thanks, Sue. It's wonderful to be here today. I'm Natasha Krampton. I'm a vice

president and chief responsible AI officer at Microsoft. What that means is that I both help to define and govern make sure that people are doing what they say they are doing. Um the internal

practice of responsible AI at Microsoft. That means I work very closely with our engineering teams building new AI systems and models. And I'm also responsible for uh working externally as

well and being part of the conversation about what are those new standards or norms or laws that we need to help make sure that this technology is made available broadly and beneficially for

people and Natasha's been working in this field for a number of years now. So it's really great to have her with us. Raj, great to have you with us as too. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much. Um hi everyone.

Good morning. My name is Raj Patel. I'm the VP of AI transformation at Holistic AI. Holistic AI is an AI governance SAS provider um spun out of UCL 5 years ago. Um we provide end-to-end governance for

enterprise clients for um smallmedium businesses for startups that have AI core to their business offering. We take um a view from ideiation all the way through to continuous monitoring and

retirement of models. Um because of our close affiliation with UCL, we we are at the forefront of testing as well. So we are looking at agentic AI testing um explanability techniques um we're

prevalent in that in that domain um and we work with the likes of Unilver GSK GE healthcare to help them get a good visibility of their entire ecosystem to maintain um effective guard rails so

that they can identify areas of risk mitigate them effectively and move forward with confidence. Thank you. Thanks Raj. Great to have you here. A real leading um UK company. And then

Tim, great to have you as well, but obviously you know this has been a joint BSI and Tech UK panel. So we're really thrilled to be joining forces to do this today. So please introduce yourself.

&gt;&gt; Thank you to Lawrence for helping that as well. Um yes. So I'm Tim Maggar from BSI. So the British Standards Institution. So the part of BSI that I work in leads around certifying testing

of AI. Um so particularly uh one of the first cro certification providers for 2001 and also doing reviews of medical devices and the like but prior to that I spent over a decade in the standard side

of BSI so involved in the standards right from the very beginning as well. Yeah, exactly. Lots of experience, a really experienced panel. I'm sure you'll agree um to really get into the

the devil of the detail. I want to start with um rather and custom set us up in terms of the kind of parameters but let's talk about AI assurance and practice and Raj perhaps I can start

with you drawing on your experience and what you're seeing from um sectors particularly in the UK but obviously from from wider that you're seeing the most mature around assurance practices

already and perhaps why and are there sectors that are leading the way or there are some that are perhaps lagging behind and what is your sense of where we are right now if that's a good place

to start. Yeah, it's a great place to start. I think um it's an important question because different industries are within a spectrum. I think sectors have uh some that are leading, some that

are lagging definitely. But within that sector, there's also a spectrum of companies that are leading and lagging within them. So, if you're in a sector that I'm saying is at the forefront and

you're not quite there yet, don't feel bad. You're not you're not going to be alone. Don't panic &gt;&gt; for sure. So um I think Ken you set this up really well with your introduction to

this that we have to really look at um what does AI assurance mean in practice and that is taking something from an ethical statement or a principle to something that's quantifiable with

evidence and that is where we see the industries that are leading really make this scalable and repeatable. So industries that are leading this are ones that have had a history of um

reputational or governance requirements. ones that have the highest consequence of something going wrong. So they're touching end customers, they have real liability against it going wrong and

ones that have been able to create these scalable processes. So these are industries like financial services, healthcare, uh critical infrastructure, defense, these are areas that if

something is to go wrong, it will have a material consequence to their end user or to society at large. So when we look at those I take financial services because I have a a history with

financial services institutions we look to see what has made them successful in this number one is that they have been operating in a highly governed um environment highly regulated environment

for a number of years. So from the financial crisis in 2008 onwards, banks as an example have been required to keep strong model documentation be explainable in all of the outputs to

have good risk controls in process so that there's not a repeat of um that catastrophic time um back in 2008. Secondly is that um that kind of stakeholder impact they have

reputational financial damage that could happen to the company as well. So they need to protect against that. And then finally is the innovation side of things. They want to make sure that

they're moving forward with the right AI use cases given the risks that are prevalent. So when we look to companies that are or sectors I should say that are lagging what they should be looking

to do is identify um the AI use cases. First of all you should have a good idea of what AI use cases are operating in your environment already. You can't govern what you can't see. So that's

always a good starting point. Have a good robust living inventory. And then is to set up your risk appetite as the core backbone of your AI governance process and your AI assurance process

going forward. What I mean by that is that you don't need to throw the kitchen sink and high levels of scrutiny at everything. Your team's bandwidth is not going to be infinite. You need to make

sure that you're applying good governance and quantitative testing and um effective mitigations to use cases where it's needed, where it's high risk. Low-risk ones you should be able to

mitigate away. You should be able to have pass through mechanisms, but that will allow you to achieve something that is um an innovation driver, not a checkbox exercise. It's something that

allows you to use governance as an accelerator, assurance as an accelerator to realize value. So I think that's kind of the foundational framework that I'd like to see um other or general

industries applying. &gt;&gt; That's a great way of thinking about this Raj in terms of the value. And Natasha, I'd love to come to you and your experience because we're talking

about how do you, you know, how do we help organizations bridge that gap between okay, I'm doing cutting edge AI development. I'm really excited about what I'm doing and the research or the

product I'm developing and then the kind of practical governance frameworks and practical assurance frameworks and just thinking following on from Raj's talking about how do we see it as a driver, you

know, um how do you help or how do companies bridge that gap? Is it about create you know showing how this can create tangible business value or prevent risk as well as well? What are

you seeing from you know how how companies and organizations are addressing this or you've addressed this in your your own organization? &gt;&gt; Yes indeed. So when we started doing our

responsible AI work at Microsoft almost a decade ago now um in that long. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. Even the office of responsible AI that um I led I have led from the very beginning um that will have existed

for seven years uh by the middle of this year. So at the beginning of our journey at Microsoft we had um exactly what Raj mentioned we had a set of six highlevel principles. So we said AI systems that

Microsoft is going to build are going to be fair. They'll be reliable and safe. they'll be private and secure, inclusive, accountable, and transparent. Now, those principles have been very um

important guiding north stars for our work, but they are not sufficient by themselves. Um, and that's simply because they're stated at such a high level that they don't answer sort of

fundamental questions that our uh product building teams, our engineering teams have on the ground. So nobody argues with me when we say look we want to make sure that AI systems are fair.

But what our engineering teams want to know is what does that mean for the data that I need to collect um in order to train this model? What type of testing do I need to do before releasing the

system and also on an ongoing basis? What documentation do I need to make available to our customers? So over the past um uh almost decade now we have been answering those questions at

Microsoft. So taking a highlevel set of principles and operationalizing them and making sure that we've got the receipts to show that we've done that work. So to come to bring things forward to you know

what does this assurance actually really look like in practice. Let me give you the example of uh M365 C-Pilot which is one of our flagship AI products. Some of you might even use it. It takes um all

of our Office uh products like Word and Outlook and Excel etc. uh that are well used around the world and really supercharges them with AI features. Now for us it was important um that not long

after the international standard ISO 4201 became available this is a management system standard. So it looks at the governance process around how you build

um a system like M365. We went and got certified against that standard and that delivers real business value for us. Um Microsoft has many highly regulated financial services customers and

healthcare customers and defense customers. Our customer base asks for and expects us to have these types of certifications. I think one of our insurance customers that's global in

nature put it really well which is to say you know unless you have the receipts in the form of you know certification against an international standard. It's like saying that you're a

you're a car manufacturing company. You've got safety engineers, but no one actually proves that the car has brakes and the car has airbags and both of those things function in all the

anticipated sort of and foreseeable operational circumstances in which they will be operated. So um I think to finish on Sue's core point um assurance at this point is not just a nice to have

it is you know demanded in procurement processes um and it's a way of building trust across the supply chain so that if we can offer um you know our certifications forward it means it

empowers all of the many people who build off Microsoft's platform make available applications and their context to actually leverage the work that we've done to help supercharge um your work

building applications as well. &gt;&gt; Thank you Natasha great examples and Tim come to you talk about AI insurance and practice. Let's let's let's go back into the kind of the tools in the toolbox I

suppose and ISO 4201 is really becoming a reference standard. I be interested in your view of where do you think we are with that? What does successful certification actually require? And also

perhaps are there common misconceptions that organizations have around implementing it? You know, if that's the the good place to start, how do organizations how do organizations need

to think about it? Does that make sense? &gt;&gt; Yeah, probably best way to start where we're at. So, particularly we're seeing in terms of the certification side, it is massively picked up in recent months.

It was already growing a lot. Um, and it's really quite interesting where it's been driven from. So there are certain in terms of certain countries and sectors that normally pick up

certification but for 2001 is really driven by where AI is sitting. So financial services, ICT, professional services in terms of countries um India is actually second in the world in terms

of accredited certification. So &gt;&gt; that's great. &gt;&gt; Well done everyone. &gt;&gt; UK is number four. Still good but not as good. Um

&gt;&gt; what's number one? uh US and China's number three surprisingly but &gt;&gt; so India's really up there huge um so in terms of some of the uh misconceptions so cast mentioned about 27,0001 and all

these management systems follow the same structure which is deliberate so they're easy to pick up and use but so there is some some views the 20 the 42,0001 is just 27,0001 with a bit extra it's not

it's something that's new you have to work work all the way through it to get in place as well. Um, akin to what's been mentioned already, it's about certifying the organization and their

approach to AI governance, not a particular product. Carson also mentioned earlier on as well. Um, and there's also there is kind of this view about the link to regulation. So

particularly um say in the UK there is a push towards using standards and assurance including 42,0001 to be demonstrate good governance but really as was said the pull is coming through

supply chains companies want to do this their customers want it it's not because they've been forced to it's because the market's really driving them to do it &gt;&gt; so in that case Tim perhaps I come on to

you and I want to move kind of perhaps just thinking about the strategic opportunity for India before we talk about how India and the UK Okay, because it seems like we're on similar paths in

terms of a assurance, how we could potentially work together in partnership on this, but thinking about the strategic opportunity for in for Indian organizations, what should they be

prioritizing then to capture this kind of AI assurance opportunity, you know, in the next 3 to 5 years? Is it is it that working with your partners, working with your supply chain, say, look, if

you you know, you're going to need to do this, I can demonstrate that I can do this, too. Is that is that the way to do it? &gt;&gt; I think it's there's two sides. one it's

you know 42,0001 is here you know whether it's in terms of taking uptake or certification that's thing that really demonstrates that you're a leader and also getting involved is sort of

cast mentioned the standard system as well um yeah and I think I mean one thing I was going to mention so uh we recently announced that we' certified axis bank which is you know it's the

first as far as I'm aware the first bank in the world that's got 42,0001 certification so you know India is really a leader ing this already. &gt;&gt; Yes, that's great to hear. Natasha would

love to what your advice would be to for Indian companies thinking about if they haven't started on this kind of AI insurance I hate that word but journey you know what should they be

prioritizing and then Raj I'll come to you as well. So I think in um here in the Indian context it's a really great moment to lean into the role that assurance can play recognizing Ken's

important point that um you know there's not just one type of assurance that applies in every circumstance um but rather it's a range of tools and and critically you need to sort of match the

right tool to the right use case but with with the India AI impact summit. Um the Indian AI governance guidelines have also been published and there's um a number of important recommendations that

are coming out of that that I think will help pave a sensible course for it. So for example, there will be an AI governance group that's established and a technology and policy expert

committee. One very concrete thing that I think those uh groups could do is to develop what's called um crosswalks um between international standards and other mechanisms of assurance and some

of the specific requirements in India and what a crosswalk does is it shows how you can meet the say specific existing Indian law on the books um in a way that also acrru to meeting the

international standard. So it helps basically provide a map or a path that you can follow in order to see how if you take a step like making sure you've got a valid incident response process,

you can see how implementing those controls to meeting your obligations under Indian law as well as um demonstrating a control that will be assessed in the

context of um a a governance audit that might um be scoped to a particular part of your business. So I think just trying to make sure in this moment that you really are connecting in all of the

excellent activity in India to some of these broader frameworks that are crossborder. This is going to help not just um more rapidly um adapt and localize um tech that's developed

outside of India in India but you're also going to export to the world too and so that's why you want to make sure that you're using this moment to align and map wherever you can um so that you

can get the benefit of these emerging uh global or crossber standards. &gt;&gt; Yeah, thank you. It's this really exciting conversation. I might be being a bit of a geek here, but we've been

talking at tech about AI assurance for, you know, it'll be 10 years. Our digital ethics summit, which you spoke at really the beginning of be it be our 10th year this year and now it actually feels like

this is actually happening, right? It's actually having real world impact which which is amazing. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Um but thank you for setting me up because Raj I wanted to ask you

and your given your experience and your knowledge a bit about frameworks and policy frameworks that can help c um c um um drive forward the AI assurance market particularly in India thinking

about you know as you touched on deployment in financial services but also as healthcare and agriculture public services government services you know are there policy frameworks that

you think could really support or that are needed to support those you know critical use cases and adoption and diffusion of AI and AI assurance at the same time. What would you say is is key?

&gt;&gt; I think um I want to build on something that Tim was talking about which is um integration to the supply chain. Um starting off with your procurement process. Um while in a previous answer I

said that governance should never be a stifling um factor to innovation and moving forward. There has to be a point at which um the economic buyer or the procurement process needs to have a

certain standardized pack and I don't use those words lightly because it's difficult to standardize this but as an ecosystem as a uh as a country if you align on a certain requirement set of

the uh AI providers that are going to deploy AI use cases into your organizations there should be a minimum baseline that aligns with both the company level expectation as well as

country level expectation. I think we as a technology company we see this we're in we are integrating with Indian companies at the moment and some of that procurement process is very

well aligned to AI systems and we get through and we're able to showcase the good work that we're doing and provide evidence where it's needed and it's a smooth process and then there are there

are others that it's a very cumbersome process. It slows down AI adoption because they're trying to get through this with a not fitforpurpose set. So I would definitely start at a policy level

which is procurement um across the board. Um next and I will always champion this is risk have a risk based approach. You need to have a a policy pack that's in place where you are

identifying critical infrastructure and critical AI use cases that require the most evidence against them and then you should prioritize in that manner and then you can move forward quickly with

high impact low-risk use cases and do the effective due diligence on high-risk uh high impact use cases. So I think those are the two things I' I'd probably start with as levers to move quickly in

terms of policy. Thanks Raj and and Tim just thinking then turning it into okay the UK we've been you know leading the charge in AI assurance for for a number of years now uh our government

check it out published an AI assurance roadmap um only last year in terms of how we're going to drive forward the AI insurance market industry she said India number two for you know actually

implementing the standards which is great but so what could the UK and India do together what could we learn from each other in regards to AI assurance and standards

you know is how do we help each other? What what would you say would be key there in terms of you know going forward? &gt;&gt; I mean I think sort of taking it more

sort of geopolitical level. So if we were having a kind of conversation about where regulation standards and assurance are going last year it was quite clear the direction everything was going in

the world and literally in the last year everything's kind of gone in multiple directions it has to be said. Um, and I really think in terms of what the UK and India can do, it's trying to get more

harmonization around it across the board because it's just going to make things really difficult. Particular point earlier on about importers and exporters and so many rules around the world

&gt;&gt; and &gt;&gt; just the complexity &gt;&gt; the complexity of the way things are going because there is you know there's always been this tension between the

need for regulation to let innovation flourish but it's just got much more complicated in the last few years and trying to get you know regulation is probably coming but trying to make sure

there is that alignment around similar sort of approach to regulation whether it's light touch or not I think it's something we need to all do together. &gt;&gt; Um Raj would love any views from your

side on that as well. And perhaps what does what could or does success look like in terms of collaboration between the UK and India on AI assurance and are there concrete steps you think

organizations or policy makers need to think about in terms of the opportunity here to because it sounds like it feels like we're at a similar kind of point in time if that makes sense.

&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely. I think um my answer is going to be a little bit biased towards a technology provider that's looking to to deploy effectively in this area. But

&gt;&gt; I think that's allowed. &gt;&gt; It's allowed. Okay, fine. So what I would love to see is a lot more collaboration in terms of sharing um best practice when it comes to actually

um governing and assuring AI use cases. There's a lot of work that we're doing with multinational companies um UK based companies that we get a lot of learnings from and we are happy to share those

learnings in terms of best practice with organizations that are starting on their governance journey, organizations that have established um ecosystem in India that are looking to export and what is

best practice. The idea being that governance should be again the accelerator to your deployment. It should answer a lot of questions that your stakeholders have by your

quantifiable evidence that you're providing to them based on these kind of governance pathways. The second thing I'd love to see is um more collaboration again in terms of like a a sort of

partner swap almost. So we have people that are working in the ecosystem in the UK to spend some time in India and vice versa to make sure that we're learning from both ecosystems. both have unique

challenges that um each ecosystem will face at some point whether it's first or later or vice versa. I think that would be an an extremely valuable um cross collaboration opportunity. And then the

final one is a potential shared sandbox environment where certain use cases could be tested and um different benchmarks could be collaborated upon with visibility into the actual use

cases that we were testing. &gt;&gt; Yeah, Tim, I see you nodding away just before I come to you. Sandboxes we've found in the UK right to have a really really important role to really flesh

out how these things work back to our theme of like AI assurance and practice but also help develop trustworthy and trust trust between partners right um because we're talking about is this is

really key in terms of supply chains do you want to touch on that in terms of the experience of the sandboxes &gt;&gt; yeah I mean there's there's two sides I mean as you say the UK led this 15 20

years ago financial services so &gt;&gt; FCA started the sandboxes right originally So, so basically these are areas where you can work with the regulator and try something that's new

and not be worried about the regulations there and sort of talk in the UK is about taking this forward particularly if the regulations aren't right then changing them after the pace as well. So

that's one side. The other thing we're also involved in which I haven't mentioned yet is around the sort of EU AI act and so we will be a notified body and certain organizations we need to

work with notified body to get their products onto the market. So medical devices, toys etc. &gt;&gt; To get their accreditation basically &gt;&gt; they have to basically get um designated

to get it on the market and around that a similar structure around um sandboxes as well. So in our role as a notified body, we'll probably be involved in those as well to sort of oversee what's

happening. But from a sort of non-regulatory perspective, but yes, sandboxes, I mean, particularly given the pace of change in in AI, which is frankly bonkers, you know, it's um you

need something like this. &gt;&gt; Bonkers, it's a very technical term in the UK. um and and and also check out the UK's approach um in terms of governance in terms of the AI growth

labs that that's now being developed which is a bit like a sandbox approach but looking at actual the legislation the regulations the rules of the road and whether in a sandbox environment any

of those need to change or need to shift because we are also looking at you know AI is moving as we all know incredibly quickly and laws and regulations don't move incredibly quickly so how do you

keep pace but but Sasha any view on that but also just wanted to come to you on this kind of point about collaboration because from what I see um uh India is deploying AI rapidly right and scaling

the deployment so rapidly which is amazing to see the UK we've got had that pioneering practical AI assurance approach so there must be specific collaboration opportunities here um

which could create mutual value and I'd I'd love your ether um views from where you've seen other things around the world that could work here or where do you think the opportunity is for

collaboration? &gt;&gt; Big question I know. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. I've I've got some ideas. Um uh so I I agree with what Raj said earlier around you know I think

ultimately the opportunity space for collaboration between the UK and India crosses three areas. Ideally you want shared standards. You want shared skills and then you want shared like evidence

evidence of meeting those standards. And if that is the overall frame then what are a couple of specific problems that I think India is really well placed to help um chart the path forward for India

but also for the rest of the world. The first is about trying to get clear about responsibilities across the supply chain. Now I think in India it's entirely possible to have a use case

that involves for example but art GPT that is uh outputs from that are integrated by Infosys into a system that's deployed in an agricultural context across India. So in that type of

use case, it's really important to understand who needs to do what across that supply chain and what is the evidence that needs to pass from one actor to the next to help them do the

things that they uniquely need to do. Now actually globally there have been you know initial attempts to try and define what a developer of a model needs to do versus a deployer of a finished

application. Um but there are some really important open questions especially kind of in the what I would call the messy middle. um you know what does um Infosys in that example need to

do relative to the model developer relative to the system deployer who needs to monitor the system in practice. So I think India because of its very um broad and deep um uh uh ecosystem in the

tech space is is going to be really really well placed to help define with clarity who needs to do what. The second opportunity in India I think is really making sure that we master the art of

not just testing in the lab prior to release but testing in the real world um on an ongoing basis. It has to be efficient and effective to do at scale. that India has such beautiful diversity

in uh linguistic dimensions, in cultural dimensions that it it really is the case that you know the agricultural system deployment um in northern India is going to have quite different issues in

practice than what it's going to have in southern India. And so helping to find ways to um effectively do that real world testing that post deployment um monitoring at a scale that is efficient

and effective I think is a real challenge that uh India can help lead the way on. So, we're going to come to some audience questions, but I'm just going to quickly ask my panel um for

just some very closing thoughts from their side. And I'm going to give them, you know, 30 seconds or maybe I'll give them a minute each, but um given everything you've said, one piece of

advice or one area that organizations should really focus on if they're starting or thinking about their AI assurance. Natasha, can I start with you based on, you know, what you just said?

&gt;&gt; Sure. So, I'm sure we've got many builders of AI systems in in the room. And what I'd encourage you to do is to really think about assurance about how you create the evidence that people

should trust your system as a product capability. You build it in from the very beginning. Assurance, sometimes people think it's just a paperwork exercise at the end of the day. It's

not. The best systems that deliver assurance are ones that have it designed in from the very beginning and you can use AI to help too. &gt;&gt; Um, so I think really thinking about

assurance as a product capability from the very beginning. &gt;&gt; Yeah, we've we've talked about security by design. We've talked about privacy by design. This is the age of assurance by

design. There you go. Um, and you you can quote me on that. Uh, Raj piece of advice. Um, I'm going to talk about Natasha mentioned a car earlier about airbags and brakes. And when I think

about AI governance, I think about your company is the car and AI governance is is the brakes in that. And a car can only go quickly because it has brakes. So when you're designing your governance

deployment, you need to think about how are you going to materialize that in reality in a tangible way. The companies that we see best moving fastest with AI are not the ones with the most

sophisticated use case. It's the ones that have the most sophisticated or most tangible AI governance workflow. If you go to somebody in your organization, you ask them, you have a great AI use case

idea. How would you move that into production? That should be knowledge across the entire organization. Identify the use case, identify the risk, mitigate it, and deploy at scale and

continuously monitor it. &gt;&gt; To use the capernaly, maybe it's it's your headlights as well. It's knowing where you're going. Right. There you go. You can use that Raj if you need to. And

then Tim um piece of advice and then we'll open it up for questions. So please um put your hands up for questions. &gt;&gt; So the one thing I'll say is

everything's moving very quickly but ourselves and others are putting a lot of things out there for free to help people. So in terms of work that needs to be done around the EUA at the 421

we've got guides self assessment tools training. There's lots there. So please look look to that. And also we're on the UK pavilion in exhibition hall 14. So come and have a chat to us as well. Yeah

you are as well. &gt;&gt; That's a great plug Tim. I'm also going to plug um the lovely Tess Buckley. Please wave your hand. So, she's um the mastermind at Tech UK um and I have

Lawrence as well, but Tess has been writing a number of reports at TechUK um particularly one that came out last year on AI assurance looking at specific markets and industries. It's a brilliant

paper. Please go and check it out. It should be available to download. Um but TechUK, we've got loads of material as well. So, we're really keen to help. Okay, questions, questions, questions.

I'm going to ask you to Wow. Okay. I'm going to for those online, you can't see all the hands up. We're going to go take a few at a time and we're going to try and do it quite um quickly. We did start

a bit late though, so forgive us organizers if we just go over a little bit. So um okay, Tess, let's do the best. Let's take these one. Okay, one, two, three, four. So can we take four at

a time? Is that all right? Keep your questions really tight if that's okay. &gt;&gt; One side only. &gt;&gt; I'm going to come to that side. Don't worry. Don't worry. Don't worry, I'm

fair. Don't worry, I'll be fair. Okay, go. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Mine's a very quick one. &gt;&gt; Okay, the microphone's not on. Could we turn the mic on?

&gt;&gt; Can I take one of the microphones here? &gt;&gt; Okay, &gt;&gt; thanks for a great panel. Uh, very quick one for me. Uh, can we do 420001 using AI?

&gt;&gt; Okay. Can you do 420001 using AI? Next question, please. &gt;&gt; Hi, I'm Gotham. I'm part of Salesforce basically. So just a quick one on skills basically Tasha you touched upon very

important pillar and then you mentioned Raj about uh brakes and cars right and if someone basically who doesn't even understand what AI is and doesn't even understand the entire landscape it's

very important for them to understand which one is brake which is accelerator right so what exactly is tech UK largely maybe Sue can answer that largely is doing in terms of filling in that skill

gap u and I have an NGO as well which works around alongside this uh particular thing so I'll probably want to touch upon later as well. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Brilliant. Okay, let's come um Okay,

let's go to these two here and then we'll don't worry, we'll try and get through as many as we can. Thank you for keeping them brief though, sir. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Uh so I'm a research scientist. Uh

and I think assurance is directly linked with cyber security. Uh one of the key aspects of cyber security is that no model is going to last forever like they deteriorate. So when do the asurances

deteriorate and how is there any policy framework that can help us like you know have a sustained assurance metric some sort something something like &gt;&gt; that's that's a great question and next

please and then I'll take a few answers and then we'll go to this side of the room. &gt;&gt; Uh so uh we actually implement uh use cases automation for SMBs. So uh we try

to install brakes and headlights in the system before uh deploying the use case. But uh I want if you can in uh talk in realities for example uh if I am implementing uh for a car washing center

uh calling AI who will call after the service to the person how was the service after 2 days and taking the feedback. This is a regular repetitive work we automate it for them as a

deployment. So how we should uh approach we try to make it safe and reliable. uh but from you guys I want to know if we can get any advice. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Okay. So any advice on how you do this

in reality assurance and cyber security so deterioration of models how do we deal with that skills? How do we understand the difference between the break and accelerator? Um and then can

you use for um can you use AI for the standard? Tim should we go quickly and then we'll go quickly Dan we'll come over here and then we'll have to wrap it up.

&gt;&gt; I'll be very quick. So in terms of um can you use AI for 2001? Note it's really about trying to understand your organization and build it to your own risk profile.

&gt;&gt; Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh yeah yeah sorry &gt;&gt; sorry. So it's really about building to your own organization and governance approach. What is coming is a smart

standards approach which means in the future when the standards will update it will update into the systems but that's to come. Um in terms of the other question about cyber security so within

firstly within the management system the approaches adapts to your organization and changes that's one side but equally with the assurance infra infrastructure it means that you're regularly checked

as well so it's not just a case of you get a certificate and that's it for life it has to be continual. Yeah, great. Thank you. Raj, do you want to take any of the other questions that haven't been

&gt;&gt; um I'll quickly touch on the skills piece and uh the the model visibility piece as well. Um in terms of skill, uh your first line of defense is always your people.

&gt;&gt; And so that's the side of the coin that is the um pessimist. Something's going to go wrong. Your people need to understand the limitations of each use case that you put out there and know

what is right and what is wrong. The other side of that is through effective upskilling of your organization, you will realize AI benefits quicker and also identify areas where AI can be

deployed effectively. So having that skills-based training in place, whether it's internally driven or um externally is valuable for multiple reasons and every company should be doing that as a

baseline. Um to the question on uh model retirement, model drift, um the way that we approach it holistic AI is understanding the inherent risk of that use case. What are you trying to

achieve? the technology you're using to achieve it, the data that goes into it, and you bas you benchmark your repetitive monitoring based on that. So there's email autocomplete. It's

something that's not super high risk. You don't need to revalidate that system, maybe once every 12 months. There'll be things that you want to monitor continuously. There's items you

want to reassess every 3 months. That is should be formed part of your governance framework up to an organization level so that you understand what you're trying to achieve and everybody knows what

they're trying to uh baseline against. &gt;&gt; Great. Thanks. Tasha, anything you wanted to add on any of those very quickly? &gt;&gt; I think they covered them well. I don't

I don't know if there's one question from the side. &gt;&gt; Let's see what Let's see what's coming up over here. Okay. I've got Okay, we'll start with a gentleman here and then um

let's go. Okay. So, so &gt;&gt; I think we're only &gt;&gt; one, two, three. Okay. So, this gentleman and then can we go with the lady here?

&gt;&gt; Question. &gt;&gt; This to you. &gt;&gt; Okay. Very quickly. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Is my question my voice? &gt;&gt; Yes.

&gt;&gt; Yeah. I'm Subaraju here. My question is specifically for Microsoft. Uh as the quantum has become reality now, do we require a paradigm different kind of a approach for assurance?

&gt;&gt; Okay. Different approach for AI assurance in quantum. We'll come to that in a minute if that's the case. &gt;&gt; But it's a good question and it's something we're actually exploring at

Tech UK already. Go ahead. &gt;&gt; Uh so I uh I identify high impact processes for SMBs. uh US and UK and my question is with cloud bot and modbot you know uh you're talking about

certification you're talking about compliance and I uh like when the business owners want the high impact processes to be implemented and the technology is changing every day you

cannot control the guardrails uh these boards are easily able to break that so how do we propose something to them and implement when the compliance is also you know growing every day

&gt;&gt; because it will take a hell lot of time to use the use case wisely and make money out of it. So, how do we do it? &gt;&gt; Okay, thank you for all your question. I'm gonna have to hold it there. I'm

really sorry. Um, &gt;&gt; we just have to hold the questions now. I love that everyone's curious, but just for timing sake. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Sorry. Um, so actually, um, that's

probably for Raj, but we'll start with Natasha on the quantum. It's a great question and something in the UK, we've been working with the National Quantum Computing Center on responsible quantum

and what we can learn from AI assurance into the quantum world as well. But please answer answer &gt;&gt; and look I think it is a fantastic question and there are going to be

elements of our sort of AI governance and assurance program that will very much carry across and there'll be new things that need to be added. Yes. and and some of the governance processes as

well. And there will also need to be new uh techniques and approaches built on top particularly as we you know um confront you know a sort of a a need to address you know whole new sort of

cryptographic errors and challenges in that space. So what I would say is that um while it it is potentially a pretty significant paradigm shift, we've had to navigate these waves already and we have

to apply the same skill sets that we used to move from traditional AI and ML to generative AI and now agentic AI systems. Actually all of these waves have required um new and different

approaches. And so I think of I I think of the um impacts of quantum as along a spectrum. In some areas they will be very very significant and whole new approaches will be needed but actually

there will also be many elements that we will just be able to strengthen and build upon as well. um uh to our uh uh this lady's question in in the front row. Look, what I would say is that um

it is the case that um you know unless you have a baseline mandated by the law. Um uh not everyone is going to follow all of the responsible practices. We know that from past waves of technology

that continues to apply here. Um but my experience within Microsoft tells me that actually um you know good hygiene when it comes to upfront risk management is doesn't just response uh result in

more responsible product. It actually just results in a better product overall. So I would encourage you as you do this work to really find the business case champions of where the product has

been both you know well designed to meet user needs and responsibly designed and use those champions to help build broader awareness of why we do this work because the business value is very real.

Um and while there might be you know there might be instances in the ecosystem where um you know things are pretty fast and loose I think you have to look over longer time horizons to see

what is actually sustainable and valuable in the in the medium and long term. &gt;&gt; Thank you Natasha. We're going to leave it there. We've run out of time but

thank you so much for all the hands and all the questions. Please can we thank the panel for Tim Siraj and Natasha in the normal way and thank you all for being here.

It's a real pleasure. Thank you so much. Enjoy the rest of your day. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Natasha. as a senior program managers. Over to you.

&gt;&gt; Thank you sir. Uh good afternoon everyone. First of all, I think uh walking in the corridors, you must have seen everyone seems to be really excited about what we are going to do in AI,

right? And hope you found your places for your coffee and food and also navigate through the rooms as well. Uh which is pretty easy, right? Uh just just uh coming coming to the to the

session uh I think if we talk about what World Bank does, several of you might be aware of it. It's a it's a multilateral development institution which is putting financing on the table and it's it's a

kind of partnership which we build with the government. It's not the world bank doesn't do anything on its own in isolation. Uh over a period of time I think there has been a very significant

amount of investment and I was chatting with my colleague earlier and we we learned that almost 4 billion plus uh US dollars have been invested on foundational systems of how digital

health systems can work. And in the morning we had in we were in a couple of sessions where industry leaders, experts and all of them were talking about AI modeling models are as good as the

foundational systems available. And the foundational systems are a very simple term to speak but if we get into the details they they go from everything from a typical digital infrastructure,

internet infrastructure to creating some kind of interoperable framework having information exchanges unique identification. We get into all those elements of foundational system without

that and then the more important what comes over here is the data. How do you train your AI models and system and the data that to good quality data? Now the World Bank investments while the digital

health investments etc. work on core designing tools and systems. The other investments of health system reform actually look at some human angle to it like the data quality is not just the

tool uh uh uh decision. It's also the human decision. How how do those at the front line actually create and enter data in the system and and take it forward. So all of these investments

together in India and elsewhere we are trying to uh create some kind of foundational framework so that any kind of AI models and tools if you want to ex scale implement and scale in in a state

kind of setting or a country kind of setting that has something to to work with. Finally, I think uh one of the things which uh we have been working very uh we have been very kind of

serious about that the partnership is very critical if we want to make sure that the AI models really give us some tangible results and the partnership is not just between the government and

multilaterals. It's about the private sectors, non-governmental organization. I can give examples where the uh tools designed, developed and tested by non-governmental organizations are now

being implemented pan state to 100 million population to uh to 50 million population as well. So we can talk more of some of this but that's the fundamentally what uh we try to focus as

part of the bank. &gt;&gt; Thank you Rahul. Thank you for your introductory remarks. Uh I'll go to now Malik Choxy who is global director of excess health international and he's a

professor. is a researcher professor. Over to you uh Malik for your initial comments. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much sir and thanks for having me here. Uh I represent the

organization excess international and we are a a health system design organization. So let me break those words health system design. Today you know most of the people might have heard

what ABDM Aayush man digital health mission right and now we are listening uh AI big time for past a year a year year and a half. uh the first conversation of ABDM started in 2016. It

was announced 2021 by uh our honorable prime minister but the work of ABDF the first conversation on national digital health mission started in 2016 and we have been part of the process right from

2017 till 2021 till this till the uh day when our our efforts saw a policy framework and an implementation framework and that's what we do uh currently also uh in at 4:30 in the

evening uh we are going to announce uh uh our strategy AI strategy for health right again this piece of work is not something that's that's happening overnight there has been a year and a

half efforts going on in creating that strategy and we are part of the process of creating the strategy now what does it mean if I take ABDM as an example again we had 150 consultation in a 2 and

a half year time period each and every stakeholders perspective was taken into consideration when this strategy or a national digital health mission was drafted and similar efforts are

currently going. And when we talk about AI specific, who are the people who are going to get affected by AI, right? Who are the people who are going to use AI? Who how are the people going to use AI?

I think so when you create a strategy document, each and every element needs to be part of consultation and you need to have a framework to address those things and we Excel International are

happy and proud to be part of this process primarily supported by various development partners. But that's what we have been doing. We also do something else. So let's say ABDM got announced

right. What are the impact of ABDM? You know it got announced in 2021. Today we are 206 almost 5 years are getting over. So what has been the impact of of ABDM as far as provider are concerned,

facilities are concerned, user consumers are concerned. And similarly we already started working on implementation research frameworks for digital health. We worked and now we working on AI. So

if you want to measure the impact of AI, how you going to measure the impact of AI? People talk of interoperatively but interoperatively might be something that a bureaucracy might be looking at but

for my bedside privacy is something that I am looking at right so this is what we tend to do as a health system design organization and I gave digital health and and artificial intelligence as

domains but similarly work on healthcare financing we work on pharmace pharmaceutical policies we did some work with nitia very recently and making sure we had this huge kind of cough of crisis

in our country right how do we make sure that our systems are agile enough to kind of detect those kind of stuff. So when something happens, we are able to respond it. So we work across three or

four primary domains, financing, pharmaceuticals and digital health as well as people's health movement. And thank you for having me here. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you so much, Malik. uh

uh I think before I go to the second round of questions you know I I'm sure you I would like to touch I request you to touch on you know certain areas which

are the key challenges we are facing you know across the world so friends when you talk about key challenges that we are facing you know in the AI system we'll find the infrastructure gaps are

all over because recently we have entered in the in the global south and especially the African region you look at the infrastructure whether it is absolutely available I would say it's

it's it's missing. We talk about capacity building and HR issues. Do we have right set of people? Do we have those kind of capacities built over there? I think still is missing. What

about promotion of the local and the innov local innovation and the solutions? Again, you know, we are talking in generic but what about the local solutions? I think they are going

to be more important. They are going to play an important role. What about the ethical and your social implications? When you're using AI, do we have those kind of ethical and social implications?

And I think we have to look into that. We we do lack you know collaborations, knowledge sharing. Again it's one of the major gaps that we always find. What about data?

I've seen you know when we are talking to certain governments in the Africa region especially east and west both data is missing. So can we really afford to have those kind of AI solutions

created in that situation? It's going to be like garbage in and garbage out. So is it possible that we start you know and lastly which I feel you know one of the major challenges that we are facing

is the whole of LMIC the world is flooded with pilots. Now how to take these pilots to scale is I in my way the one one of the most challenging you know situations

currently what we are facing especially in the global south pilots you know why we failed I think we all know that wonderful pilots are available across the you know world

they're beautiful you know you you'll find that there are very smart motors you know they'll always give a promising accuracy the nice dashboards are available but but when it comes to

scaling whether we are able to scale them or up I think that is an important area. So I'll request you when so you get time when we have the second round please try

to you know touch upon this. So I'll go to uh uh Miss Vina Muktali. Uh in your view uh Vina G like what does responsible deployment look like especially in the health care domain and

in case you can touch upon the human in the in in the loop I think in healthcare I would say and any any any domain you look at the human in the loop is going to play an important role. So we're able

to really talk about this that'll be very useful. &gt;&gt; Sure. Uh that's a very important point because as a clinician uh when a clinician is using u AI to make any

decision I think uh the information that comes out of the AI also has to come with a lot of credibility and that's where I think uh the point that you made earlier about garbage in garbage out

also comes into the picture. So of course uh uh your AI needs to be trained on the right kind of data with the right kind of inputs but also it needs to have certain sort of explanability. Uh so in

our case because the AI was to be used by nurse midwives or uh health officers on at the grassroots level. Uh there was always an element of who would take the decision of treating the woman if she's

found to be suspect positive. And we thought that since a clinician is not really a a part of that uh decision- making at that point, we should give an opportunity for let's say an ongo expert

to review these images uh or review the cases that are identified by the AI as a suspect positive. So we consciously kept uh a human in the loop before a decision for treatment is made. Although the WHO

does have protocols about see and treat uh for something like cervical cancer uh you know so what that means is for those of you who perhaps don't um have any idea about the cervical cancer uh

cervical cancer is one such rare disease where um even at a very early stage at a precancerous stage there are treatments available which can be performed even at point of care. So that means there are

tools available which can treat this these precancerous cells of the uterine cervix. So uh there has been a concept for almost 20 years where the WHO is also promoting that nurses can be taught

to treat these precancerous lesions. In reality however that has not happened because although the nurses are taught to do visual examinations while treating somebody they feel a lack of confidence

and that's where we thought our AI adds a great value by giving them information by giving them that simple decision making that you know if the AI says this is a red case that means this woman

needs this particular type of treatment and she may be referred for further uh you know treatment whereas if she's uh you know uh the case is a brown colored case that means she has a low-grade

lesions and and she does not need an aggressive treatment. So this kind of a communication is all that these nurse midwives needed at that point but the actual decision to treat the woman or

what kind of treatment should be given is left to the clinician. So we have included a remote review system in in our platform where the same uh images which are captured on uh ground are also

viewed on the cloud platform where the clinician gets to see them score them and accordingly schedule them for further treatment. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you Vji. Thank you so

much. Uh uh uh I'll go to now uh Dr. Vidyani. Yeah. Uh you know you are a top-notch biomedical research scientist at the Stanford University. Uh what about AI applicability in the biomedical

research? How do you see this happening? And second you I always say that you know how best we can ensure that the AI solutions should go from lab to the field because at times you are just

working the labs and creating those kind of pilots but ultimately how they are going to be more beneficial to the public is is a question but how do you see that you know as a bio medical

research scientist &gt;&gt; so as I mentioned earlier we're leveraging AI to kind of uh decipher all these multiomic uh imaging large data sets and coming to how we deploy it uh

for benefit of public good. So my main focus now after being in biomedical research for so long is preventive healthcare like there's so many we uh people are talking about that they can

cure cancer but nobody really talks about the side effects. So from the last 3 years my focus has shifted to how we can prevent the diseases as we age and increase the health span of the aging

population. So we're working uh with the worldwide fingers team based at curling skya institute Sweden and Stanford global health and uh it's five different things I think it's for everyone to

remember food physical activity sleep cognitive exercises and cardiovascular health and what we are trying to do is develop region specific interventions and even more leverage AI to develop

personalized interventions so AI will get inputs about what our health conditions are and what we like to do for example I talked about these five things in the physical activity. There

might be somebody who are already physically active. There's some people who might be not finding time to go to the gym. So for those people, we have designed something called exercise

snacks where we can go to the we can just do these things for 10 minutes at our desks and these have benefits of doing going to the gym for an hour. Similarly, uh cardiovascular health,

sleep and all of that. and in cognitive exercises. Some of us like to play chess. Some of us like online games and since we are all from India, we are very culturally rich and our music and dance

forms encompass many of these culture uh cognitive aspects, physical activity as well as social interactions. So we training these AI models to kind of uh incorporate our health data as well as

our individual choices and develop personalized interventions. And uh we also are doing developing models to first risk stratify the individuals for disease and then they can focus more on

these interventions and every day when we wake up this AI tools will provide us what are the five different things we need to do and uh eventually we'll also build digital libraries for different

populations because we have we are such a diff diverse country and we can make it more fun and uh to incorporate these lifestyle choices and increase the health span of the country as Rahul

&gt;&gt; thank you so much thanks a lot uh Rahul you know I'll just come to a very pertinent question to you uh you know again we have been talking about pilots and you know scaling of pilots uh

because unless you integrate these pilots in the systems any system you're talking with the health systems and agriculture educ any any domain you talk I think the most important part is that

how best you can you know basically the change change is not going to be technical is going to be structured and that requires a lot of funding support and

all I always say that you know 90% of with 90% of sensitivity you know of these AI pilots you know still I find them I I don't know use this word useless but at times you'll

find that why they let us say if it adds to an extra burden to a frontline worker it's it's not of any use you know similarly it if it lives outside the system. So unless we integrate these

pilots within the system, it is not going to help be of any help to us. If it requires perfect data because in governments and you know you go to any country I'm especially I'm talking about

the global south data is not perfect. So our solutions have to be created which are quite aligned with so-called impact imperfect data which is available within the country and let us if you are not

able to sustain these pilots you know once the donor is gone then also I think it's a useless exercise to happen in your view being a multi- you know little donor to the governments how do you see

how best you know these multi-donors especially world bank is helping and supporting the governments you know in in scaling up uh these solutions. &gt;&gt; Uh thank you sir. Uh indeed a great

question and uh this is a very interesting set of panel as well. We are having a very specific technical uh conversation on ideas and then how to really scale them. I think this is

something a great idea is not great in itself unless a good idea can be scaled. A good idea is a great idea. a great idea which cannot be scaled given all the constraint it will remain in a very

small island of innovation and probably will not give us the dividend what what we want to have so I think that's something and the scale I think we use the scaling up very loosely as well

sometimes we say we need to scale up this pilot we need to scale up this idea the scale up doesn't happen in vacuum there are bureaucratic challenges there are wills there are resource constraints

there are issues around data standards and all of that which drives how exactly you scale certain things. So in our point of view there are four uh and I will not get into the detail but four

fundamentals if we really want to look at how do we want to take something to a scale or something which is at a scale and we sustain that and the first one is on these things the data standards and

digital public infrastructure I think with that's fundamental that's basic without that even if we think of anything and that includes a lot of things I think if we get into detail we

can have a whole day session on that but Aishand Bharat digital mission is trying to look at some of those aspects very clearly and how do we really create those frameworks to make sure the data

system DPIs and and the platforms are available. The second thing is let's not talk about okay this is the idea let's scale it up is that idea can be plugged in an existing platform that

DPI can it be interoper okay let me not even talk interoperable over here can it can it really exchange information with two existing systems of the of the government or even the large public

sector providers which can connect to each other I think that's what going to make it really work the third which we we don't speak as much in every conversation is the workforce force and

institutional capacity. Again, institutional capacity is a very loaded word. There are there are there are 15 different dimensions of institutional capacity and again we can have a long

chat on that. But the workforce capacity and institutional capacity together will make sure that what we are trying to bring to the platform will really go forward and there one area which we have

seen if you talk about the frontline workers primarily we feel that we have developed it's uh user interface is good we have provided it to them they can use it in our personal experience working

with angari workers one simple tool required 9 months of constant training month on month to make sure they were able to use 40% of the uh UI of that particular application. So I think

investing on that if you want the frontline workers and users to really use it is going to be very critical. Finally the financing has to tie to the readiness and the outcome. We cannot

just put money. In the morning also we were having conversation and it's of the government money. Also the World Bank is technically not a donor. It's a lending organization which is putting the money

and the government is returning that. It's a technically government money itself if if I be very frank with it. So any money which is coming from the taxpayers which is being used for some

of these things we cannot just invest just because there is a great idea. Can it really link to the platform? Is there a DPI system in place? Is there workforce and institutional capacity we

are building on? If together all of those four investing then investing in the tool and technology will really give us uh dividends. So I'll probably stop here but if there are further uh

clarification questions can come to it. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you Rahul. Thanks a lot. Uh uh now uh going to our friend Malik uh uh Malik how do you find you know inter intersection between AI and

research how does it look like? uh I answer at two levels right uh my first two panelists come from biomedical and I'm a biochemist myself so I think so uh I remember when I was an academ uh

a student you know I I'm from MS University of Botaa and it was one of the best library and I spent number of hours even sleeping in library at that time if I want to do a research paper

you know identifying a a publication or an article from nature or lancet was a job in itself right I think so AI has made that life much much easier right so I think so if if I start looking at

basic science uh my my first prime of say is what is known so I don't invest in what's known I focus on what's unknown and I think so in research perspective AI gives that is a fantastic

tool to elucidate what is known and henceforth I can focus on what's not known right but this is primarily at a biomedical sciences and then what what she said I think so I know you know in

vivo setting in vitro setting I can I can see what chemical interaction happens kind of stuff it decreases my time so if I look at that perspective research perspective I think so my my my

basic biomedical research the time taken the accuracy of research I think so it has gone very very fast but uh I wore that hat for a very small period of time of five years and then I became a public

health researcher uh and I think in public health research there again are are huge opportunities Sir uh and I will focus on what you asked us to challenges. Firstly in LMIC you did

mention we have got data but we also acknowledge that the quality of data and then standardization of data is not good enough to create LLMs right now and and henceforth there is an inherent bias on

on the LLMs which are created right now. But having said that so decision support system might take some time in evolving but process level AI dependent algorithms could be very fast. So if if

I say I want to decrease out of pocket expenditure of medicine, one of the way of decreasing out of pocket medicine is provide services to provide services. Uh as as he said Rahul said we need money.

There are lot of issues in the way money flows from federal government to state government or state government to district government to block level. AI can help there right that process

engineering can really work with AI decreasing the kind of blocks at where money is getting stuck and then itself can result in a lot of kind of net benefit as far as health system is

concerned. uh uh similarly if I say you know uh lot of lot of people you know 40% of Indian population is in urban area right if I stay in Delhi people start talking about you have a pollution

blah blah blah blah blah there are around seven ministries who are working together have got money to focus on health within that domain if we get algorithms of where the monies are where

the money is stuck and how the money flows out I think so there is a huge efficiency gain that we can get as far as AI is concerned it can give data visualization it can give effect on on

on kind of what kind of decisions needs to be taken. So I think so at a research perspective uh also it helps in seeing that what's working what's not working what needs to be tweaked and how what

Rahul did mentioned of inter kind of departmental convergence that can come into picture so I think so there is a huge scope at a biomedical level as well and there is a huge scope in terms of

how how the health system could be strengthened in taking decisions and uh and the last bit I would say the the biggest kind of government supported health insurance scheme we have got or

PMJ J I if if you want to see that how fraud how many frauds are h happening how do we prevent that fraud I think so AI there is huge scope of research in those uh segments to bring an efficiency

as far as thing and and I would take a word from from AJ and kind of if you want to shift ambulatory care from from let's say hospital to homebased care I think that's that's what the data talks

and AI can help in really augmenting those kind of processes and making sure that there is efficient health system in delivering care with saves money as well as time. Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Wonderful. Uh Malik, uh you know my my my boss always says that you know you know the world is going to be divided into two types of people. One who knows AI

and other who doesn't know guys. So I think the times before us are absolutely challenging. So I think we have no option but to go for this uh you know I was trying to I worked in for multiple

years you know more than three decades in the government and UN system. I think uh the only benchmark that I I established for any successful pilot was whether it is replicable or whether it

is being accepted by the government. I think that has been you know and you likely but most of the occasions I'll find that more than 60% 70% pilots which are being established and done by

different agencies whether within the UN system or NOS's and all they were just they remained projects you know within those files and they ended there only but I think in AI we can't afford to

have that kind of situation we need to be absolutely prepared to see that whatever pilots we do though still you know there'll be chances that those pilots won't really work but how best we

can ensure these pilots you know to to to get scaled up. I was looking at you know Vadwani AI in India you know that we have been able to it's a huge team I was looking at you know how they have

been able to succeed in their own ways or because India has got in ministry of health they have got multiple national programs and very smartly they have aligned themselves you know starting

from the co-creation to the scale with the government with government data look at the TV malaria there's TV national TV program we have got malaria program You got maternal

newborn child health nutrition etc. You look at TB part there are three four solutions like we talk about risk prediction or loss to followup or lab diagnostics you know what they have done

they have aligned this with the next share which is a national platform for TV I think there couldn't have been so there's no scope for you know the kind of failure because we'll keep on

tweaking we'll keep on making changes similarly in tele medicine you know look at eenjimni which is a platform which is a clinical decision support system which has created now again you know it is

being scaled up because it is part and parcel it has been fully integrated in the system what I'm trying to bring point home is that unless we integrate these systems you know the pilots in the

system I think somewhere we'll be missing the bus I I'll go to the last and I think we'll also have some five to seven minutes for your any questions and comments

basically I think it's it's not that people sitting on this side are the best brains or they're the top-nose people I can understand I See punk is you know has been he worked with me he's a very

highend you know technical colleague so I'm sure you know the wisdom in the room is absolutely you know fantastic like to hear from you also but as a last you know round of questions uh your closing

remarks on this what so you want to say and talk about this after question and answer maybe I'll try to you know end with a few of my observations and and concluding remarks so how should we

should we start same way over to you. Um yeah and that's a great responsibility to kind of summarize but yes uh of course um what and this was a very insightful session by the way right

from uh you know research to uh financing and of course uh analysis uh so that it becomes an integral part of the healthare system how AI uh will add value is a very very important topic and

I think uh uh the point that you made about pilots being designed designed in such a way that AI eventually or any innovation for that matter eventually becomes a part of the system is very

very important. Uh and that has been my experience as well. Uh I agree with the point. So I will uh perhaps end my uh you know thoughts by saying that it is the intent which has to be clarified

when the pilot is designed. Uh because pilot is like an elevant. Everybody has their eyes closed. The government expects something from the pilot. uh the innovator is expecting something else

from the pilot and perhaps the beneficiaries or the people themselves are expecting something else. So unless everybody has the same kind of um objectives out of that pilot uh and the

communication is made in the right manner uh I think um even innovations like AI which may have a great promise uh which may have been built on a lot of data also will find it difficult uh you

know to be a part of the system. So having that intent clarified in the beginning is very important. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I was reluctant I was about when

AI started when it was like hugely uh elevated but now I'm pretty confident that AI can take us from reactive care to predictive and preventive health care and we I can see great potential in

helping increase the health span of the individuals not just in India but across the globe. Yeah, &gt;&gt; thanks. Uh I would put uh the HTA

framework for all of us to think does it work? Is it safe? Is it cost worth it to put it? I think those three if we really have uh the HDA approach even on this one I know it's it's very difficult to

be a very black and white answer for uh some of these things. I think but we need to know whether it works it has potential to be scaled up. It is cost effective and all. I think that that is

something we should take for sure. The second thing is and this is something let's go back to 2000s when when technology started coming into our health se at least the health health

sector to to help us service delivery and all that. I think since beginning one of the things which I always probably did not like personally is this uh thinking that probably bringing a

digital solution or an AI system or any new technology will solve the problem. The problem is solved by people who are there. they're providing services they need to solve. It needs to be an

enabler. It cannot supplement and replace what the system can deliver. Till the time we don't acknowledge them, the fight and the tussle between the both will continue to happen. There'll

be push and pull. So I think that is the second thing I want to uh want to take home uh put the message over here. And the third which uh which is very very critical is

especially currently the AI models they are as good as what gets fed into that those models itself. So data systems are we doing enough on our data quality research? Are we putting enough

resources and support to build make sure that basic building block of what the data where the data gets data doesn't create it in air. The service delivery becomes data point itself. The day we

start hitting that in our mind every every time we think of data the data is not coming from thin air. There is a service delivery happening which is becoming a data point and that service

delivery to data recording needs to be resolved. So I think these three points would be my uh final takeaway on on on this. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Fantastic. You did touch base on human

in the loop which is very important. Okay. &gt;&gt; And and I'll respond as a researcher right a researcher moving towards vixit bar 2047 I think. So we are in a good

space I think. So India AI co is making lot of anonymized data sets available. I think so that's that's in good direction. uh once they make available ICMR uh National Health Authority,

Ministry of Health are working on anonymized health data being accessible uh both at a disease level and at a state level. We have got some old kind of outdated GBD data burden of disease

but I think so if I look at a researcher right so there are good data sets which are coming out in market which can help us in kind of solving real world problem but again as as as you you have kind of

directed us I'm being careful that uh currently because that the data systems are are are not that rich I think so there has been a tendency to use synthetic data and I think so I'm also

very mindful about researchers when they are using synthetic data and training that models they are being transparent enough to let people know what they are doing so that the onus on on on also

comes back on researcher to make sure they make uh uh those those points very clear the kind of data sets they are using for training their AI models and clearing algorithms. Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you Malik. I think we just five minutes for uh uh we can take you know two three questions. Oh, there multiple hands you know going up but how to start I don't know

&gt;&gt; you have to be &gt;&gt; quick and uh &gt;&gt; so I'm a pulmonologist from Hyderabad so you mentioned about tuberculosis so lot of people develop complications when

they're not monitored properly and then they drop out of the treatment that non-compliance will be there so has there been some work on this front to improve the complaints using AI to avoid

complications predict complications and improve the complaints &gt;&gt; so I won't be able to reply to you but I'll be happy to connect you know with the experts who are working in this

particular field on any solutions. So I'll take your details and come back. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thanks. &gt;&gt; Uh thank you for the opportunity. I'll

just summarize all the uh panelist questions and view points. So so cancer care prevention at the core enablers and then you talked about the district level implementation. My simple question is is

India's primary healthcare ready for the AI implementation &gt;&gt; Rahul. Yeah, &gt;&gt; thank you. Wonderful question. &gt;&gt; It's a great question. Uh it's always

ready. The ready there is no uh switch off and on. I think that we have to accept in a large uh public sector kind of working. We cannot have a on and off switch that now it is ready now it is

not ready. what makes it ready and whether all all the uh primary health systems all the districts on the same page that differs I think that that differs on multiple parameters uh we

have to take it from this point of view when uh and I I'll give you a very real life example when first time a frontline workerled digital job aid was introduced in 2015 when they were uh and I'm

talking about the anganari workers those who are not from India don't know they are semi-iterate or illiterate uh frontline workers who have never even held a feature phone in their And

everyone said that they are not ready. It took around 9 to 12 months of effort to make sure they get trained. They get again and again multiple segments were trained. They come come back. They go

through services come back. Once it was done, they were the first ones to start using the application and take it forward. So I'm taking an example to tell you that the readiness doesn't

happen just because we have created the infrastructure. It happens when we invest on those who want to use it and if they are confident to use it the day they start using it things will become

more uh kind of &gt;&gt; Thank you Rahul. Yeah, just two more questions please don't otherwise you know outside we can always &gt;&gt; Good afternoon everybody my name is

Nishant and I'm an educator in AI so my question is that we have a huge data and we want our AI to be fast right but in aviation and in clinical field there's a term in AI hallucination then how can we

deal with it like it's a kind of Yes, I think so as your data sets grow uh and they are trained properly I think so the noise will go off right but again uh most of the AI systems are

self-arning systems uh so it's going to be a continuous challenge right it's it's only the good quality of data that's going to be good quality last data is going to answer uh to your

question until we get that good quality last data which keeps on evolving on itself right and still some noise will remain And I think so let's let's accept the limitation that that will bring in.

&gt;&gt; Just one more question. Sorry. &gt;&gt; Sorry. Sorry. I'm just intervening. When you say good quality data, right? Data doesn't tell itself. Okay. It's good quality, bad quality, right? So it's the

field ops which are very important which Rakkesh Rahul I think you mentioned that if you don't have field ops, you don't have laws to actually mandate field ops to make sure that the correct data is

actually being entered. How are we going to settle that? So hallucination is always going to be there but it's not going to evolve by itself. &gt;&gt; Sorry about that.

&gt;&gt; Last last question. please take the mic. this side is there listen we'll come to &gt;&gt; uh yeah so my question is so at what

level we are uh are there sincere efforts to build uh large scale Indian multimodel data sets healthcare data sets to train foundational models uh like that integrate imaging uh culture

nodes as well as the structural lab data and how do we design the feedback loop from the clinicians to the training data pipeline Um so for the lifestyle interventions

project we are uh creating we are generating the data we starting off it as a pilot in Andhra Pradesh and Hyderabad and even in Bangalore the center for brain research institute so

they're acquiring longitudinal aging data and this being done thoroughly with the imaging and OMIX both integrated so we'll have in-house data right generated accurately

&gt;&gt; thank you Just two questions from this side. Sorry, we have to madam first to you and then we'll &gt;&gt; sorry. &gt;&gt; Very interesting panel. Uh thank you

very much. I have been working in the health a very innovative approach to really use open innovation to really solve the local problems and use uh large congregations like Kuma to really

uh actually serve as a sandbox for uh creating that baseline data. um point in uh this thing is a MIT sponsored uh uh support system for kumbla at NASC and uh we'll be driving the same initiative

again in the uh the next kumb which is 2027 and I'm uh very keen to really understand how and uh the government start using it actually prair gadam gi

who was head heading the NASCOM he moved to uh the ABDM and that's how uh it actually got implemented in the governmental systems what more can we really do to really bring in uh the

efforts of Stanford the efforts of MITs and the efforts of this thing to really really take a leap &gt;&gt; you got your point someone has to

&gt;&gt; uh uh I I'm sorry if I have understood your question correctly but I think So uh once the data sets I think so ABDM is creating is is is creating at least uh health infrastructure data sets right uh

uh and if there is there is an emergency kind of stuff that's coming in the data sets are very very helpful in kind of making sure that right information is flowing at the right point uh without

losing time and and I think so that energy could be extended in terms of uh the repository have been using for disease surveillance and being uh climate resilience preparedness so I

think So uh as we move forward it will come up. Uh if you ask me what's happening today I don't have an answer for that. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Yes. Last the very last.

&gt;&gt; Yeah. Actually for the fastest few centuries there is an increasing uh intelligence of microbial organisms versus human intelligence. The frequency and the the vility has been getting

frequency has been getting higher. Vidility has been getting higher. And as a collective human beings we don't have a collective intelligence net world health or nation all global institutions

are crumbling domestic sovereign institutions have a limited time frame the p parliament has five years so we are looping in the five years tenure of uh human collective

intelligent effort forget about AI do we have a collective human intelligence institution to mitigate the future pandemics which may recur quite frequently from

centuries to decades now. &gt;&gt; So uh I think your question is at a very intellectual level. We should have a we should have a very kind of open conversation on this. I'm not sure I'm

the right person to answer that completely but two things I want to put over here. I think in any kind of uh democratic setup and you are rightly said the world order is changing there a

lot of things would change like how exactly people can support each other unless the data sharing crossber border is very open lot of these kind of pandemics are very difficult to even

predict and even kind of prevent from so how does that happen if all the countries are open doing it now no one has really control on how the countries will have as you rightly said how things

are moving in that direction what I personally feel and this is nothing to do with where I work and what I do. I think this constant state of chaos we are in the only way forward is we

organize that chaos to somehow chaos somehow. I don't think there's a very finite way of answering answering that question because we I can give you 15 example where we tried to with

government we tried to set up regional uh data sharing platforms and mechanisms and systems it didn't work out for multiple reasons neither X country is at fault nor Y country is at fault but

there are individual preferences realities which people want to put in so I think those realities will be there the the AI systems can and the last point is where AI systems can help and

I'll give you I'll close with an example right now in India the surveillance is more reactive something has happened you go detect outdirect detection put a team and all of that there's a huge amount of

gold mine lab information data available routine basis which is for provision of IPD and OPD services in hospitals if we put a large language model model very importantly and analyze that very

clearly it'll give you a heat maps in real time that probably something is wrong in this geographic area all the PHCs and district hospitals are picking high markers of infection something is

happening over there can we look into it so there are the AI models can really give us some of the solutions which we have not been able to do earlier but whether it will solve all the problems

you mentioned I really don't think so it it needs a lot lot more effort &gt;&gt; last question sir &gt;&gt; Dr. Vidyani ma'am &gt;&gt; session

&gt;&gt; uh ma'am you have mentioned like lifestyle modification for chronic diseases like cardiovascular diabetes so uh I'm working in monorx.ai AI. So my question is what are the most important

patient factors needed for making personalized lifestyle modification for the patient? Let us take gender, soio economic changes everything. Um so we have recent u my first focus

was dementia and then we have developed a Indian specific dementia uh risk prediction risk score called CADE. So it took into account uh BMI and then education, sex and then it also took

into consideration total cholesterol and so these were some of the basic parameters we began to work with and as more complicated it gets we can add more parameters like smoking history and then

re renal complications and all of the diseases. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Uh we we you can talk to one of the panelists outside this. Okay. Okay. So I I'd like to thank profusely

my co-panelists and and and you all just a final you know couple of points from my side because we have to ensure that AI works you know for the you know larger good so I always say that we

should stop celebrating these pilots because rather we should celebrate the integration part it really happens we need to design for the constraints and not for the for the for the ideal

condition because if let us say we don't have good data uh it doesn't mean that you know we should stop doing it. Similarly, we need to build these AI solutions for the users and not for the

users. I would like to say that AI doesn't fail because it is too ambitious but it fails because it is not often too grounded. We need to really remain grounded. And finally, I would like to

mention here that and this is a quote unit which I took it from somewhere. It says that when the AI becomes invisible, embedded and trusted and boring then it is fully functioning and fully

working. So I I think I I leave you with these kind of thoughts and ideas but thank you so much for being a wonderful audience and also the panelists. Thanks a lot.

if you can please make it to the stage please. Mr. Je Mate, regional practice director for education at World Bank. Mr. Vinit Naya, founder and chairman,

Sarak Foundation. Dr. Yogita Rana, Principal Secretary, Education Department, Government of Telangana. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm there.

&gt;&gt; Thanks to all the speakers for taking out the time. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; we are here. &gt;&gt; If I can just request all the speakers

to pose for a quick picture, please before we get started. If the speakers can quickly stand for a second for a picture, please. Yeah, &gt;&gt; thank you, David. over to you.

&gt;&gt; All right. Now that we have the photographs out of the way and the Instagram moments ready. Hi everyone. I'm David. Uh I serve as the director of programs at People Plus AI. I'm not

going to spend a lot of time doing long introductions. I would much rather spend time uh talking to our speakers on stage today. We're going to focus on AI and education. That is a big topic, a hot

topic. A lot of people around the world are talking about it. We have really some wonderful panelists that that will shed light on the subject given that education is quite a broad field of

work. We're largely going to focus on um what we call as FLN or foundational learning. So AI and education specifically for math literacy somewhere around first grade to 8th grade um

across a global south context. So that would be it would cover perspectives from India across multiple states in India but as well Africa, parts of Latin America. So I do not know the people in

the room. Having said that, I really do hope um that this would be of interest to you and maybe we'll try and keep time at the end. We'll do our best to moderate the crowded room that we're in

uh and maybe have some questions from the audience at the end. But let's uh let's do this. Here's how I want to structure the panel today. We'll start off with perspectives of AI and

education. From there we'll go to what is the actual practice in terms of real regions, real use cases, what it actually looks like when we deploy in school. And then finally the progress

what do we see going forward given how quickly models are progressing as well as we see AI diffusion also progressing at that speed. How then uh do we see the next one year and I think one year in

the AI industry is quite a long time. So that being said, um let's do this. If we can do a quick lightning round of introductions, I have some great panelists from different regions today,

all from organizations that you would have heard and and probably followed for a long time. So if we could start with maybe just a quick 30-cond introduction to our speakers as well as the work they

do, that would be great. Maybe we'll just go in the order of the panel. So let me start with Mr. Venit. &gt;&gt; Hi, I'm Vinit Naer. I used to be the CEO of HCL Technologies. Since I quit all

that me and my wife started Suk Foundation. Uh today we work with two lakh schools uh touching the lives of two cr children uh using AI and technology uh in a big way and pleasure

to be here. &gt;&gt; Hi, my name is uh Jam Ma. Uh my going way back uh I became an engineer uh did grad school in engineering then decided I'm not a good engineer and studied

economics instead. Uh right now I cover I mentioned this because of this whole flexibility angle and individualized learning that we will hopefully discuss. Um right now I cover uh education,

health, uh social protection and labor for this South Asia region. I lead uh the units that are in charge of that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Namaskar. I'm Yogita. I am secretary education from government of

Telen Ghana. By academics I am a MBBS doctor but I am a development practitioner and I have about 23 to 24 years of my service uh you know cutting across health education heading the

districts. So it's really a privilege to be here. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Good afternoon. My name is Ben Piper. I am the global director for education at the Gates Foundation based in Kenya and

my real claim to fame is I was a fourth grade teacher out of university. Thank &gt;&gt; All right, let's um once again welcome to all of our panelists. Thank you for being here. Um let's jump in.

given the entrance of genai in the last say 2 and a half 3 years and even prior to that there was machine learning that that had been around for quite a long time. So we had been seeing platform

based e-learning uh algorithm based personalized recommendations but now geni has kind of brought a new perspective and new opportunities when it comes to FLN learning. So more from

an insights perspective um views on on where you see geni going if you have both insights as well that you could tie into real examples of what's happening on the ground. So let me start with that

and then maybe I'll tailor and do follow-up questions with uh each of our speakers. So how how' it be best Dr. Yogita given uh all the work that you're doing in Telangana why don't you start

us off um how do you see currently the insights learnings of of what is AI and education and how it's being deployed currently and I think we can share the microphones among us

&gt;&gt; yeah in fact a very interesting question and whenever in the field we talk about AI in education most of the teachers and the parents ask actually what is AI will a robot come and teach our students is

the you know wildest best way they can think and in fact not only India but the entire world now is in a transformation so it's not AI is not only a technological uh revolution I will say

it's actually a technological transformation because it is going to touch the many generations which are going to come so it's a social transformation I will say and then

seeing it through like this we we really have to ensure that every child the parent the teacher and the society at large actually benefits from AI. So just coming to the basic question of what why

AI in education why is it that we are talking that artificial intelligence has to be an integral part of education. So I have just four five points in fact during the interaction with the parents

and all. See first of all it is our bound duty to ensure that the child knows what is AI to be safe first of all like the child should know how you know unsafe the AI also can be. So it is very

important for the education department to tell a the students and the parents like what all AI can do so that we can firewall. So first I will say for the safety of the student it is very

important that the child should understand what is AI the deep fake some kind of uh reals which are maybe you know we have seen I will not uh really gloss on to it. Second is since there

are so many tools available then how my student my teacher my parent can actually use those AI tool. So that is the second important thing. Third, not only the child should need the tools to

have better learning outcomes to know from where the child can get more inputs so that the outcomes are good. Also, the child for the coming generation should be that like you had the IT

professionals should be an AI professional. So that tomorrow the tools which now the child is using the student is using tomorrow the same students should actually you know they should go

to the coding computation critical thinking and they are the one who will bring in new tools. So that way AI has to be there and looking at the the deep deepening of this AI tools which are

available in the entire ecosystem. we actually you know and we all know that India is at an advantage of demographic ad uh you know the privilege which it has for the next some 20 to 30 years. So

we have the young population but the young population need to have those creative skills those future generation skills so that they contribute in the society for a larger uh scheme of things

and they become more employable. So like we had all IT professionals you know in the entire world we should have AI experts from our school education I feel &gt;&gt; thanks

Ben let me come to you um there was a a funny story there was a startup in Bangalore that had built edtech solutions and um they said their number one usage on the platform was students

copying questions from a quiz uploaded onto their chatbot getting the answers and pop you know pasting it back into So we can't always trust usage alone and if we just look at consumption data it

might look like wow we've reached millions but from a funding and a pers uh really from a funders perspective how do you look at impact when it comes to education beyond just usage

&gt;&gt; thank you so much for the question it's like you were reading my notes um &gt;&gt; I was from there &gt;&gt; in fact I think this is one of the beauty and also the risks of where we

are in the sector in AI at the moment the power of AI is such that you have so many things that it can do but the real question that we at the foundation are starting with is what problems exist in

the education system that need to be solved. We we're very excited to start some new partnerships in Telangana and there is a very it's a very talented education system but there are some

challenges that exist and so being able to make sure that the use of AI is adapting to the challenges that exist on implementation that happen right now. That's point number one. Point number

two, what does good look like? And for us, good looks like good looks like one thing. Does the child learn more? Do they have more skills? And so, at least for us, we're really excited in India to

see such progress on npunat, which is the focus on foundational learning, literacy, and numeracy in lower primary. We are assessing children to make sure they actually have skills. And here's a

statistic that was shocking when I first saw it. In India and subseran Africa, only 7% of all of the edtech products have any measure of learning outcomes.

Not even a rigorous measure like an RCT or something else, but any measure at all. So for those of you who work in this edtech and AI space, at least for us at the foundation, we think it's a

very important shift to make sure that programs are evaluated. I love research. I'm a researcher. I would love everything to be a randomized control trial that takes two years. Given the

speed of development, we think it's important to start doing rapid evaluations, but the turnaround time needs to be much faster and the outcome variable needs to be learning. Does a

child have literacy skills before the program and does a child have better literacy skills after the program? And can we make sure that those things are impactful? Just very quickly, the great

thing about the Indian ecosystem is there are many partners who have made progress on this and can show meaningful impacts. Actually, there are some very exciting results from Andra Pradesh,

from Hariana that show impacts on learning outcomes. But I think the evidence should be that the standards are learning for children uh and that that has some reasonable measurement on

outcomes. &gt;&gt; Ben, if it's okay, I'll ask you a followup. When you say rapid testing, how how rapid are we talking? what what frequency of cycles are you looking at

in terms of measuring? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Um I can't say the partner yet but um in about next month we have been partnering with a group to evaluate one of the frontier labs use cases for

tutoring and the turnaround time from the beginning of the pilot to the end of the evaluation is less than 3 months. So there needs to be partners in this ecosystem on the evaluation side who are

thinking about how doing rig rigorous evidence that actually can look at learning outcomes improvement as well as between comparison groups. It's a really important thing. We'll actually be

launching something tomorrow which is about creating kind of a new accelerator on this topic because it's so essential that we are not only measuring outcomes. I'm thinking about education secretary.

I was in your counterpart in Odisha on Friday and there's a long line of people. Everyone has their tablet. They're going to show education secretary ma'am all the wonderful things

they're doing but how can she tell the difference? You're very intelligent but how do you tell the difference? Having it to be the standard across everyone in the room that we have measures of

learning those have rigorous evidence and it makes it easier for these very busy important decision makers to have the data they know both on impact but also impact against cost and I think the

Indian uh ecosystem and edtech is just at the cusp of getting that combination. better evidence, rapid evidence and and things that government can actually use for scale.

&gt;&gt; Awesome. Um Mr. Venith, for those of you who don't know in the room, he spent decades as a stalwart in in the tech space. Um and then in his next stint, it started a foundation called the Sak

Foundation uh focused primarily on education. Coming as as a stalworth in the tech industry, how did you why did you pivot uh into tech? what sorry into your

education what problems were you looking to solve um partly if you could even share your personal story of how you got into this space because and and but but we'll see

how much time we have &gt;&gt; uh okay so let me start with a story uh I was uh I had written this book called employee first customer second which became a global bestseller New York

Times did a very big article on it and Fortune magazine came up with the top and CEOs I don't know how my name appeared it I made a mistake which many people of you would realize that I took

the cutings and took to took that to my mother and said look we have three brothers and I'm very comparative so I said to my mother look you know if I was not born to you what would happen to

this family and my mother was a teacher school teacher and she wrote something on a piece of paper I was flying to New York that night and she said read it on the flight I was in the flight with a

single malt in my hand and opened the envelope hoping that my mother would say I'm so fortunate to have you as my son and there is only one word which was written on it and that word was enough

and I called my mother from New York and asked her what does that mean she says you are a slow learner it'll take time but you will get it and she explained to me that in life uh

there comes a time when you have to be financially independent after that you need recognition if you are a professional but that doesn't give you joy The joy really comes from giving and

giving back and therefore when I turned 50 I quit along with my wife and we cut a check of $100 million to set up Suk Foundation. Now my perspective on this is going to

be a little bit more controversial predominantly because I don't have as experience as the gentleman and the lady out here but let's look at a couple of things. Uh number one uh irrespective of

the amount of investment the government is putting into education over the last seven decades the learning outcome in government schools have only gone down and I'm talking about from a limited

perspective that as I said we work with two lakh schools with two cr children across eight states and I've seen the struggle in trying to get the learning outcomes up

artificial intelligence is the first hope that we can actually solve this problem and we deployed AI through Sak TV in 50,000 schools. There's a very interesting study which I

will encourage all of you to look at. Hana government did an assessment in December of 2005 across all schools and they did it with two subjects Hindi and math. In math they worked with Sak

Foundation where we implemented AI in every school for every child and in Hindi they did it without technology in the old way. The average learning outcome means the percentage of children

who are grade appropriate was 36% in Hindi and it was 78% in math. So that was the kind of difference which technology makes and therefore that learning is very critical

for all the people who are trying to look at how to use AI. Having said that there is a concern which I have given the fact that I come from technology. The question I ask you is when COVID

happened and we had an antidote in form of a vaccine did we immediately deploy the vaccine or did we test it on human beings? Today we are in a AI phase where everybody is saying AI is a solution.

But what do we know about AI? We know AI is smart, AI is intelligent, AI learns on its own, AI uh lies and AI creates hypnosis. And therefore to put that tool in front of a child we have to be very

very careful and we have to test it before we deploy it. Yes. Can it improve learning outcome? Yes. Can it exploit learning? Yes. Can he do all the magic things which we are talking about? Yes.

But have we tested it in front of a child? In front of a farmer in front of a child where we can say that person doesn't have the capability to be able to understand if the child is if the AI

is lying or not. So what is the answer? The way we are approaching that AI beam it towards the teacher, beam it towards the classroom and use the data to try. So for the first time in India, we are

able to collect data from every classroom every evening. eight lakh components of that data in terms of leading indicators of what the teacher is teaching and what the children are

answering as a community not as a child and teacher is in control of that AI and teacher is in control of the nudge and that data is sent to BRC for them to correct the event so AI has to be AI is

a use case AI is not a technology so therefore my argument would be is AI attractive the answer is yes but you ask for a perspective on AI be careful be careful how you deploy it Don't don't

fall for the technology company selling you subscription, right? Just be a little careful. Our children are the most important commodity we have for our future, for this country. Let us test it

as we test the vaccine before giving it to them. &gt;&gt; Sam, I have a fun question for you. What is the World Bank most excited about in terms of u AI and education?

Which what types of uh projects do you look at fund uh study measure evaluate? &gt;&gt; Uh just to be clear in general we are not the types who become excited. It's just the way it is. That said I do

see AI is a huge thing. I mean uh and my my team members can uh support me on this. I bring it up all the time. I do want to see what our initiatives that we are involved and are doing in there. But

uh what you heard from uh the panelists uh what was implied if not openly said it's a tool. It's one of the tools. So you got to be clear about what you are trying to achieve and then what are the

bottlenecks and try to solve that. So that's our angle. So I don't you know we don't go into a thing saying okay where are where is the AI in this uh to be provocative maybe but but we start also

with what is the problem and how you solve it and the problem here is by the way uh 40% according to government numbers right 40% of grade three students

cannot read and comprehend a small story that is huge because that's the problem that that we are facing uh in 10 years the government's it's like that everywhere we'll be in a panic mode.

What can we do with this uh 18 20 years old? Well, your options are very very limited because there isn't so much uh to build on what on your question more directly what makes me enthusiastic it's

this uh individualized nature of learning. Okay. Uh that comes with AI. I think it's huge. It's huge for children who are lagging behind. It's huge for children

who are vulnerable, children who are in rural areas. But the thing is we would need to pair it up with systems that allow it to function. You can't simply give some you know software and hope for

the best. First people need to have incentives. Teachers need to have incentives. They need to be paired. They need to be the data issue came in uh big time. they need to be measured and not

only that the community needs to be aware of what kind of learning levels we are looking at uh in these schools the states uh there are examples from let and that's the last point in this round

that I'll make um the in the incentive structure to me is everything uh in Latin America in a number of countries like Mexico Brazil the central government agrees with the states on a

yearly basis what outcomes are to be achieved and then uh the fund flows are adjusted based on those agreements. So this incentives, funding, potential uh performance bonuses and so on. Uh I

think that's the future. Yes, AI would play a big role there. I see AI only functioning in a accommodating environment like that though, not in isolation.

&gt;&gt; Awesome. Coming into the next round of our panel which goes from perspective really into practice. Um, one of the things that's often being talked about at the summit is what we call as AI

diffusion where we we understand that there's a lot of AI infrastructure already built and the applications that need powering but there's a certain diffusion level in the middle that

enables those applications to work to scale. Uh typically in terms of examples we'd call that as um in some regions you need to deploy it through voice- based solutions because uh mobile textbased

interfaces will just not work. In some regions you have to ensure that there's unique data privacy and and security protocols. Um and so this is typically what we call as AI diffusion which which

is in our thesis the missing layer to ensure that AI skills. So really my question to the panel in this next round and then I'll ask individual questions is how do we look

at use cases? How do we really look at the practice of AI specifically in education? Um we're excited about its potential. We feel it has a great ability to make impact. Um now what are

we actually testing out supporting enabling in terms of and and let's try and be as specific here. So if you know of regions and and if you're not able to mention partners but the the type of

applications and and solutions that are being deployed on field um Dr. Yogita let me start with you uh there's a lot happening in Telangana across all the schools and and within the computer labs

but I'll let you share more about it and we'd love to hear about how the government is looking at this and looking at adopting AI across government schools.

So I'll just come to the uh straight away to the question. See first is the agenda which the state of Telen Ghana took was to make everyone sensitive about what do we mean by AI when we say

the offsets of as uh you know uh the panelist said it's a tool or what do you mean by critical thinking what is coding what is AI so from the this academic year that is 2526 the entire curricula

was developed as a use case so from class one to class 9 curricula was developed it was embedded added into the regular syllabi into the classroom session and it was not a co-curricular

or an extracurricular activity. So I mean anyone can wonder what a class one student will you know require AI but we know the normal tools like what do we mean by a tab? What is a mouse? What is

coding? Just the ABC of that was introduced in class one and only the mathematic teacher teaches class one to five. Then 6 to 9 then we had detailed like a a syllabus which will be taught

by the English teacher by the math teacher and by the science teacher and a rigorous training was also done to the teachers. However, we realized you know the teachers are not alone. I mean it's

difficult for the teachers to understand at about 50 45 like maybe they are not sinking into what is AI. So then uh you know slowly we evolved a system in which the students who are doing uh degree

colleges the undergrad the postgrad they will come and help these teachers you know they will be the support teachers. So that we started in a pilot. So one use case is to bring this entire

curricula into the and it has to be a part of the syllabus. It has to be part of the timetable. So when you talk about coding you talk about model it has to sink into electricity model where you

have you know a positive b positive so on. Second we realized as you know uh peril gi was also telling about the fln foundation literacy and numeracy where more than half of the students in class

5 are not even able to read class three or class 4 textbooks. So there we partnered with XTEP uh and we came up with a small tool called as AXL and AML tool. It's a very simple tool. I mean

the more we talk the more simple the tool becomes in which suppose if I am there and Ben is there Ben is I'll put you superior Ben otherwise you'll scold me in the end. So he's able to read

words and I'm not able to read even an alphabet. The tool will adjust with me. Okay. Okay, it will tell me A B for him maybe it will read sentences. So it's like an adaptive it's a voice over tool

and surprisingly in the last about 8 months we realized 42% of the students actually improved using that tool and mind it I'm talking about the students who were not proficient in reading the

words the sentences the fluency and so on. So it's a typical use case of in Telugu language English and mathematics. So that's the second use case I think. So I can say the third in fact many

stalls are there about the PAL the personalized adaptive learning in STEM. So we went with Khan Academy and in fact CSF as a partner came forward for ensuring this fln with astep. So PAL we

introduced for the STEM that means all the children who are from class 6 to class 12 will be having personalized services through Khan Mingo uh tool of Khan Academy or as such customized uh

learning and even a co-pilot for the teacher. So then we come to a higher education then there we have a skilling app you know and then we have a career app we have a counseling app overall we

have an app any I I believe any uh you know research or any kind of a screening which is based on Q&amp;A is a thing where AI can really uh do wonders. So these are a few of the use cases. I thought

not to take much time but the studies within this one year actually has shown that there are students who were star have become superstar. Students who did not have confidence in them they are

having confidence and the students who really thought that they are left out in the class and you know coming to the class and going back home doesn't make difference. We realized absentism has

reduced these are in fact the intangible these are the intangible effects of how AI can really help and not only this last uh I'll take and then you know the teacher will know like we had when I

said 42% of the students improved in FLN but there were 20 to 30% of the students even when exposed to the tool actually did not improve. So then we came to note that these are the students who require

onetoone remedial. So you have a very targeted kind of approach because normally in a class the teacher actually takes a midline. The superstar children don't find the class very exciting and

the students who actually need some support also don't. So the teacher normally modulates between like the little the superstar can understand and little you know the person so that way

and pal really help the child to come to the benchmarking learnings I think. So that's really a uh some change and a revolution which AI can bring and then the students who are star actually can

become superstar using these tools and and as a you know secretary taking care of the uh government school where the mostly the students from the you know poor households disadvantaged backward

they come. So why should I not allow as a government why we should not allow these students also to use those tools which already the students perhaps they are rich perhaps their school is giving

them are exposed to. So that is where when we say the social empowerment so that this AI tools should not deepen the divide right and it should not leave those children who cannot afford. So I

think so there is where Ben will help us CSF XEP will help help and also in fact as you had very rightly said like it is not that I really want to do something in AI because it's the new gen word no

this is my challenge I need a tool for this I think so from there we should start like FLN we know we are struggling we need a tool for that and lot of things are there in fact I per say many

a times I say actually it should be the pro bono organizations. I don't know how you will take my statement and the people who are not forprofit should venture into AI for the students because

students are not a commodity because we cannot you know distort the pedagoguy we cannot distort the soul of the learning where the teacher has to be at the center stage and the tools revolve

around the teacher student and the class interaction. &gt;&gt; Thank you Mr. Vene. uh you mentioned about testing. Um so if we could go further

there, what what do you test for? How do you then test and actually move into deployment and and um how's it going along the way? &gt;&gt; I I think that's a that's a great

question and we we need to be a bit careful. I'm I'm come from a technology background, but I'm a bit cautious about uh blind testing as I would call it. uh let us approach this subject from two

sides right let us approach from my past which is it and all of us have predicted most people that 50% of the skills which are currently used in IT are not going to be required anymore and therefore the

number of people who are going to be without the job is going to be very large at the same time we have predicted that because of AI the number of new skills which are going to be required is

going to be 100% more than the old skill which are going to go away so net new there will be more jobs. Now the question for education is the fact if that's the scenario in the industry that

the old school old skill which is largely knowledge driven is not going to be relevant new skill which is problem solving imagination uh being able to think about a solution

which which you had not thought about just because of an existence of technology. What is a skill which we need in an education system? So therefore if in the education system we

start solving the numerousy and literacy problems which is mandatory condition for us to solve I think we are not using the AI ability enough and therefore we need to think about what is the right

ped pedagogy for us to be able to create what I call employable youth right now we are creating a lot of non-employable youth and given give you a sense that the reason these non-employable youth in

the education system was employable predominantly because in 6 months time in it we could make them employable that's not going to happen now because the amount the kind of skills which you

need in future is not going to be possible in 6 months time and that is the reason Indian IT or global IT is not going to make that investment we need to make that in education so what is that

investment the investment is that how do we teach them problem solving skills how do we teach them reimagining skills and therefore there are two experiments which we have launched which is very

interesting from a pedagogy point of view and all this is AI research right so this this is not credit to SUK foundation it is credit to uh training and retraining our SLM to be able to

come up with the right thing so we came up with what we call a half story and therefore we tell a story to a child and stop it midway and tell the child to imagine what would happen next and you

have to go to these two lakh schools to see you know the kind of noise it gets created now that is the first time we said this is the imagination skill the second we created two characters like

one is called chhatter another is called putter and they ask bloody 10,000 questions to the teacher and the AI engine depending on the kind of responses which are coming coming from

the teacher provokes them to answer ask more and more more and more questions now slowly the character of the organiz character of the class changes where everybody was only listening to the

teacher and suddenly they start asking the question now as we are walking this direction and we are making more and more investment using AI not only to come up with what we call sahikram

sahedang to teach literacy and numeracy but how do we bring these new life skills alive and there are many experiments which we are doing now let's go back to testing now that is a that is

a big problem that the only testing which we can do is the old numerousy and literacy you know whether I I gave you example 76% 36% but that is par I think that is not going to help us you know if

you really come from an IT industry which I come from the kind of problem we're going to face is mega is huge and therefore the education system in our schooling and in our college has to wake

up and I don't have an answer of how to test whether we are making these children ready for future if somebody in the audience or somebody has that capability of testing non numeracy and

literacy skills but life skills which are relevant for tomorrow I think that will be a pathbreaking and if you can use AI to do that I'll be the first to adopt it and free of cost you know from

an NGO point of view. Ben. Um how's the Gates Foundation looking at use cases? Um not just um my guess is that a lot of this room

would be quite familiar with the Indian landscape but so touch on some of the Indian landscape but also give us a global flavor of what's happening in Africa and other parts given that you

have a global lens to education adoption. Yes, I'll try and be very specific. So, I'll talk about three different use cases. One is the problem that happens more in Africa than it does

in in India where there's very large classes and you're struggling to assess learners. So, actually in Rajasthan, Wadwani AI has a tool that is a simple reading assessment tool. So, it gives

the child reads a story. You said that certain percentage of kids can't read even in fifth grade. The the child would read a story. The tool would assess whether or not the child is correct or

wrong and give feedback to the child and then feedback to the teacher. And if this was my class and all of you have done that assessment, then there will be some patterns on particular challenges

in Hindi that the children were were struggling with that then would have some implications for me as a teacher to retach. Given so many states now have structured pedigogy programs, it could

actually give feedback to the state about what sort of things that they would be able to provide. So that's a very specific example. We are actually talking with Wadwani and Prtham and

other partners on taking similar learning assessment tools and applying them in a couple of countries in subsaran Africa. We've already started with Pratam International in Kenya. Same

idea Kisuahili um which is the main major language in East Africa and trying to help make that happen in a few countries. Second use case is on personalized adaptive learning. You

already mentioned PAL. So two studies that have come out relatively recently. One is in Andra Pradesh from Michael Kramer did the external evaluation. Basically kids in this convogenius

program have twice as much learning in one year as those who didn't go through the program. Now you have to read the fine print. That requires quite a bit of additional technical support in the

learning labs so the children had enough time on task. Second one is Khan Academy has a pilot that just had its first evaluation results. Similar um additional year of schooling with

participation but also similar additional technical support from an additional officer. So there is promise for personalized adaptive learning. The thing to grow on as we think about that

use case is make sure that personalized is affordable because sometimes right now we have personalized adapted learning but it requires somebody supporting quite a bit which is fine for

now but at scale would be a big problem. The third use case maybe my favorite of the three is about AI for teachers. How does AI make my job easier? And in some states where you don't have the

instructional support officer ratio down to the child that's very easy for that coach to come and observe the teacher quite frequently. How can AI provide coaching? I was actually trained as a

teacher coach. And I love going to the classroom and observing a lesson and saying, "Okay, teacher, you did well in these three areas, but these two you could do better." Maybe now as you're

listening to me, you're thinking of things you want to give me coach to improve my performance. But could AI do the same thing? And so Madi Foundation and Tamadu is working on a teacher

coaching app as well as um Central Square Foundation is working in a few contexts right now on things that can actually listen to the classroom and give actionable feedback that can

improve. I'm quite excited about that because I'm a big believer in teachers and the idea that we need our existing teachers to be better. uh and coaching could help on that. Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. Um Mr. Sam, if I can be slightly controversial. So in governments have to choose and and there'll be so many solutions out there and they have to figure out what would

serve my population of students best. How does the World Bank work alongside governments in in selecting use cases that really do work that are measurable? um deployable, affordable. Um so it's

partly does it work and then then can I afford it? Uh like Ben rightly said. Um so how does the World Bank look at that? The World and and in order to really work with the government, the foundation

of it is trust. Um and and so thinking about it from a trust point of view um if I do invest this next 100 200 crores of a budget towards this AI solution how far will it take the learning outcomes

of my state or country right um look our job is to bring in yes some funding in countries like India by the way that doesn't mean much it is such a

small portion of what's going on in the sector that so you can't really simply get into building uh I don't know 50,000 schools it's a drop in the bucket you wouldn't do that so one of the things we

try to do is uh to see how we can be a bit more impactful yes one can do good I'm not undermining it at all but what we try to do is to kind of uh

well basically punch over our Great. That's that's what it is. Right now, among those concepts, a very attractive one is and what the secretary actually in her example, it was it was clear uh

the autonomy of the schools for example. So, I'm giving this example because it's such a big deal. You are doing AI, right? So you could try to prescribe you could ask the world bank as if we would

know we wouldn't by the way uh which AI solution is the one how do I know I mean even if I knew it uh 3 weeks later probably it would change anyway uh so instead of that we what we try to get

into is uh those concepts like that I I mentioned incentives in one uh this uh the ability of the schools there's a huge literature there the private schools tend to be more efficient. It's

because they can make more decisions. So if we could bring in a flavor of that as her example suggested right so AI based this particular tool works for these students but not so much for these. So

if the schools can make those adjustments because one of the things that we haven't discussed is uh another huge insight from the literature by the way is uh children should really do a

good better job in choosing their parents. So basically the impact of parental characteristics on outcomes of children right we didn't even talk about that. So

imagine you are doing any kind of intervention in a setting where um there is huge variety in the how the home environment is you have to give some flexibility to the schools and some

authority to handle that right so the types of things that we would emphasize is to me by the way this data and monitoring business is at the heart of everything uh implementation o of AI and

anything else let me just um give one example here. I think it is Uganda or something where uh they um they simply posted how much a school is supposed to be getting from the government. How much

money because 80% of the money was not flowing to the schools. It was some of them set in the district, some of them god knows what. After that once the community and the schools were very

clear, oh this is the amount we are supposed to be getting actually things changed. An example here is if the schools had learning outcomes publicly announced and posted in there right

yearly that is the fundamental building block of everything else you are talking about to me because then you can build in guess monitoring assessments putting in incentives you can do everything if

if you don't have that what do you &gt;&gt; given that I see a red sign on the clock already here's what I want to do um the future future is uncertain and so let us summarize it

into two lines. How do you see the next um one year and the maximum I'd really want to go if if if it's beyond one year is two years how do you see the next one to two years of AI and and let me now

make the very hard ask of summarize it in a two line statement if if you were under the fire test of saying two lines what does the next one year of AI in education look like? Um,

whoever's ready to go first. Mr. Venez, &gt;&gt; my two lines says, uh, the bubble of expectation of AI will bust and then the real AI implementation will begin.

Is anyone happier than that? &gt;&gt; Uh, actually I I copied this from an earlier session. uh in in health they concluded that it's almost impossible to predict the future. So what we have to

do is invest in the building blocks and let the private sector bloom. &gt;&gt; I'll say two sentences. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; Rapid change

evidence required. The transition I think so will be smooth because many use cases will come and the use cases will show if the learning outcomes are really benefited. It will

be for an AI and if it is the other way the system will take care. Yeah. I want to be kind to the audience and I did promise that uh so we would have a maximum uh three questions. So I saw one

here, one here and uh just just if we can be fair maybe one on that side. Um we're small room so if it's okay if just stand up and and ask your question and maybe one person from the panel would

like to respond to each one. So go ahead. My question is that working with a lot of teachers. So you know some of the problems that they

always had is ever since the technology came they were never ready for the technology they are still adapting to the computers digitizing the information because we need a lot of data to be

uploaded from there and then they have the last mile manower that we have. So when AI comes &gt;&gt; keep it short &gt;&gt; will it become something that they have

to do they have 10 15 applications to manage or there will be some elements that AI is taking care of independently so they don't have to between the manual as well as the digital aspects of the

work and not getting time to &gt;&gt; Ben given that you guys work with pratam already would you want to take a shot at that &gt;&gt; I think there was an analysis this is

from the US so it's not exactly the same as India but that there's probably 60% of a teacher's actual workload are things that are external to teaching and to me the main thing we want to keep is

the brain power of that teacher to make that internal classroom decision do I follow up on this response do I turn to this child there that the genius of teachers are on those things couldn't AI

help with the preparation with the assessment with the planning and simplify the the brain power and the space to make it much easier for the teacher to focus on instruction. That

depends on a lot of choices. Right now, I don't think that is the case. I think there's a proliferation of apps. I think some states in the Nepun Barad work have been better making sure that these

things all need to become into the one thing that the teacher works on. But right now, that's not the case across the country. So, it's a combination of policy as well as incentives to make

that more likely. Otherwise, we will lose some of the power that AI might be able to bring to reduce some of the friction and costs that might might get in the way. Thanks.

&gt;&gt; Awesome. The man in second row. &gt;&gt; So, I'm partner from education foundation. You work in the capacity building as well as the design projects like foundational

uh moving forward because AI is a big thing. How we can kind of design a project which can kind of benefit the kind of benefit that is the students in a broader way considering the following

constraint one of the constraint if I'm talking about the eN per se um if you talk about pedagogies then pedagogy should be active activity based pedagogies also the we should also take

care of the screen time especially for the grade 1 to four uh and uh if I'm talk of and if I'm talking about the benefits of the AI one of the great great benefits is that the uh that is

kind of the uh now we can provide the in person if you could just summarize the question if that's okay. &gt;&gt; Uh and of course the the challenges that that we find in the government uh

schools like the we don't have the proper infrastructure maybe the connectivity and not at the scales at the remote at the last mile. So how kind of design a project considering all

these challenges opportunities together &gt;&gt; yeah uh Dr. See first of all one should have a clarity as to what is the challenge in your FLN. So whatever is your challenge

first you have to see have that clarity what is the challenge. See whatever you have spoken till now is challenges which will be there for another 10 years for 20 years also when I join the service or

when I retire. So first that clarity one has to know what is my challenge. Now how do I build the challenge? So AI can only be an addition to what is available. It can never replace the

teacher. So if we think that FLN tool will come, we will put the child onto the FLN tool and it will take care. It's not like that. So what is your challenge and what is the tool available in the

ecosystem that you have to do the matching batching and then you have to start see now in fact the other day when we were at the Bodhen AI launch I realized the out of the 122 stalls

almost 50% stalls were on PAL and almost some 2025 were on this FLN by voice or all and then what the gentleman was asking so any tool which reduces the burden of the teacher and increases

increases the efficiency of a teacher. Any tool where the students learning outcome is very good, I think. So, that should be your main currency to pick a tool.

&gt;&gt; Awesome. There was somewhere on on that side. Uh yeah. Um I'm going to be mean, but a 10-second question and then a one minute response and and and we'll do this.

&gt;&gt; Uh yeah. Hi, thanks. This is Dave from EI. Uh this is a question to Dr. Piper. uh like you mentioned the uh you know the need for uh quick pace of outcome measurement right um so does the shift

in this pace of outcome measurement need to be met or backed by uh like a shift towards a common framework of AI aware learning indicators which uh you know need to be now be de developed and also

standardized uh is this something that we should be looking at and is there already work being done on this &gt;&gt; maybe you should think about it Um but I do think there is a greater

standardization here in India around how to measure learning and so I think being able to have standards on what you know the foundational learning survey is coming up right now I think um parak is

doing that so there's some progress on what the learning outcomes are but your AI enabled indicators that doesn't exist we actually have because we think like you we have a partnership that's just

launching right now that is trying to get alignment and agreement on what the standards are for evaluation and then with the and actually making it easy to do these evaluations. So that

doesn't exist but there does need to be some combined work on this. The session I just came from was from the global AI learning alliance which was launched today and it's to bring together the

frontier labs Google uh anthropic open AI the partners from India and globally the funders and then the implementers on the ground together to kind of coordinate on these kind of issues. a

lot of work to ahead but that issue of how do we agree on the standards I think is really important. Thanks. &gt;&gt; Awesome. In case you didn't know this morning the

AI impact summit announced the education compendium which is a global repository of use cases uh from around the world. You should go and check it out was very privileged to co-author that along with

the central square foundation. But that being said thank you so much to my panelists for the wonderful conversation. uh we have a we have a small gift for you from our side and and

uh cameraman you're ready uh we'll take a quick photograph and and then we need to vacate this room for the next session. So, thank you once again to all of our panelists.

&gt;&gt; Benjamin Piper, a quick gift for you. Dr. Yogita, &gt;&gt; Mr. Sam, &gt;&gt; Mr. Vene, &gt;&gt; if you could take a quick group

photograph and and we're good to go. We were just in as a governance and a for all right and not for the technology not for the corporate it's for the layman right

that's what it is heading towards and it's very interesting facts and figures but really uh we have a wonderful you know the leaders and davistified really we are looking for to have a

great conversation in terms of how the a going to add value for the you know the as a country maybe from the crime standpoint from the technology standpoint from the growth standpoint

irrespective of the sectors right and a just earlier just it's like purely for the ID department are who purely you want to do that development that's for that actually now it's not the case

right I mean if you want to do it and agree it's a a play very significant role and if you want to be part of the music a play very significant role so which of the domain just you take you

know the a play very vibrant and significant role from you know the end to end on the current trends if you see this close to 1 trillion from the economy standpoint which is contributed

by the IT now it's like a more than 28%age of the trillion in terms of the contribution for the global economy which is coming over there from the estimated from the India

standpoint close to 20%age a going to contribute in the bigger wing it's a 20% it's a bigger right I mean in terms of the GDP growth for the you know the country and if you take a you know as a

organization from the organization standpoint from the layman standpoint when just 10 years before there is a demonetization right where we are crunch on the money the people are looking on

the UPI the UPI payment like you know that right it reached the tender cognet side who is selling the tender coconet at roadside he was the technology enabled and then what are the money

transactions even fraction of you know the you know pisas where we are able to transfer and get things so there is adoption change but however it's a transformation is it got into the bigger

wing instead of the credit card debit card and then online banking now the UPI transaction is bigger and then wider now this wave it may not be the wave right it's a transformation I can say the wave

will fall down right but A it may not it's absolutely the transformations where we are looking where we going to add value in the into the bigger wing and if you see this IT industry

standpoint like always when the AA came of course it was there more than 20 years but it's when come to the layman that's what it is a bigger impact it is coming to right when the open CPD coming

to the pictures everybody started look like what exactly I want to he and then from there just I can you know get things as a extract as output I may not require to put my brainstorm actually on

the specific area. So from the you know cyber standpoint like uh close to 40 to 50% of the organizations already be optered how we can detect and prevent by using the AA component but at the same

time you know the hacker also use the same AA component how they can in terms of do the complete harvesting of you know what I think just they want to get things done right that's like other side

it's going on the in the biggest so we have a you know the great experience I can say it's a legend. I I work with you know all the leaders and really we

want to hear from you know their perspective like what exactly you know aim mean for a technology as a layman and then as organization and what are the crime just where we have handled

from you know the end to end uh so just would like to you know start from you uh you know specifically uh the people are thinking uh the AI is it's for the technologist that's for the

business you know not for the you know the layman in and as well as when Away you know came into the pictures just where we are thinking this is a angel but of course from cyber side we have a

devil also inside right so really love to hear from you they is for whom I mean it's for the lay layman or maybe it's for the technologist or for the business like how this weapon is going to be used

on that &gt;&gt; well I think that when a new technology comes cyber criminals are the you know negative people they are the first to exploit any technology and we always say

that uh cyber criminals at least in their domain they are a step ahead than the police or law enforcement it's a fact you know so for example AI came and they the first one to exploit this AI

technology how they are exploiting this AI technology they are creating defect video they are creating synthetic video synthetic image and through that they are you know committing digital arrest

and extortion scam every scam is being operated now it's IBR enabled you know they have integrated AI in such a way that if call is coming from that is automated call but the call is coming

from it it appears to be that it's a genuine call it's coming from bank it's coming from any insurance service provider the fact is that is completely automated they are using AI in such a

way and that's why it's just one month back it was a it's it's a the figure was announced in parliament that 22,000 cr rupees in 20 2024 in one year 22,000 cr rupees was lost by

general public in India it's it's a and and and more than 26 l cases reported and earlier the cyber criminals used to be localized you know then they organized at a district level then at

the c state level and then at the national level now they are international ly connected. They are operating from a huge cyber scam at the border of Thailand, Myammar and India.

you know this is huge uh scam compounds I mean multiple stories and they are operating from there and they're targeting Americans, Canadians, Indians you know and they have recruited uh

people from the social media uh based on their profile based on their uh native uh if if they have to loot someone from India they they will give this task to Indian. If they have to operate

something inside the uh uh USA then they are recruiting from there and they are putting them in scam compound. They are seizing their passport and then they they are getting them

worked as a cyber criminals. You know earlier they were recruited for some good job you know some IT work some coder some you know cyber security guys but once they land up there they are you

know pushed inside the scam compound and they are they are you know compelled to commit the crime. So this is the way the cyber criminals are operating and now this is it's very worrisome you know

that internationally they are connected they are creating their own ransomware or they are operating uh victim is somewhere else money is being withdrawn somewhere else negotiation is happening

with someone who is in other parts of world. So now it's it's very difficult for law enforcement agency and police to operate and and and successfully crack because uh police they don't have

expertise they don't have tools they don't have resource they don't have international cooperation you know it's it's not only technical it's not only crime related it's a it's a technically

and legally very complex to operate so now the police is fing facing the biggest challenge with the introduction of AI the biggest challenge before law enforcement agency of policy is that how

to track the criminal. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; No, absolutely sir. Like specifically the last note what you have left it is how do we track this you know criminals

uh because earlier if you take a robbery the physically the thief will be present on the bank around the bank or maybe if you wanted to you know physical attack that's like always we there is a

physical visibility of the you know the human being right now it's like all digitally connected more internet and then more threats now it's like a more a coming to the pictures it's easy to mo

it like I'm from India another five I may access from you know different country so it's not so easy to you know connect and pick it forward so with this note really you know I wanted to hear

from you as yet share this in terms of the real-time experience of what exactly the challenges where we have it but just other side really we want because just you crafted a lot of policies and then

enforcement you know we love to hear u the practical stuff like if you see the last year to this year that I4C's announced like a close to 200%age of you know the cyber fraud has you know

increased even now this it's going up in terms of the AA side right you grafted the policy and process and then guidelines for the country level like how you see in terms of the enforcement

at ground level if that is in fulfilling know some extent we would have avoided or maybe still there is a gap between the uh drafting policy and then enforcements on the ground level

&gt;&gt; so first of all I'm Rakkesh Mahishari I was heading ministry of electronics and IT the cyber law cyber security and data governance side. See the role of government for any

policy initiative is to see that one like AI for all equitable reach good usage but simultaneously to also ensure that the law and order that the harms to the individual harm to the society harm

to the nation does not happen and therefore the policies are written in such a manner that we actually require or want that the digital economy and digital platforms continue to comply.

And in a normal scenario when they are complying ideally government should not intervene at all. But when things go wrong once again at any level the law should

be such that one it creates deterrence. It creates possibilities of detection. It creates maybe through the platforms, possibilities of educating the users, creating accountability of the platforms

and finally when things go wrong as to be sort of governance function comes into picture and as to how exactly it can adjudicate or or maybe do something about whatever wrong has happened.

Particularly in the context of AI while lots of use cases, good use cases are there. In fact, including in crime prevention, fraud detection, the fact remains the the ease with which things

can be faked, deep fakes can be created and because of the very nature of the internet that the things go viral and hence the extent of damage that can happen is immense.

Commensurate ne actions therefore have been initiated by the government and maybe subsequently when when maybe as and when I'm required to talk I'll talk a bit about the IT

rules 2021 which has been very recently just about 10 days back has been &gt;&gt; yeah no absolutely sir no really I wanted to you know come back on the specific those area like uh tier 1 to

tier three of course subsequent discussions we can have it s just as s had mentioned um in terms of the policy creations and the enforcements at the ground level really just I want to hear

from u awareness standpoint right I mean we cannot measure the sample from tier one cities what exactly they have taken over there right uh it has to go and reach on to bottom level of people of

course it is going and reaching uh but just you want to know like where we are now I mean in terms of the awareness level specific to the a enforcement how the weapon can be used right So love to

hear from you know the your side. &gt;&gt; Okay. Thank you very much. First of all I sincerely thanks the organizer and uh cyber crime research foundation who has given me opportunity the research

foundation for sharing this stage and especially with the dignity. See uh I am a Dr. Sapnabil professor Shiram College of Commerce and director institutional outreach as a point of education. I feel

there is a difference between theoretical and practical. When we talk about cyber crime laws, rules and regulation, the picture is in a different image. But when it comes to

the practical aspects is altogether different because the police station they are not equipped with the machineries and technology and at the same time we don't have a ecosystem. We

have UPI we have lot of things right now we are doing digital payment. We have dizzy lockers, we have Aadhaar card. But yes, once again this ecosystem creating a lot of problem as well because uh

cyber attackers they know how to leak it and you know it was a time when we say a picture can define the thousand of words and that can be easily you can recognize but right now you can say uh fake video

can change the liar voice. So things are changing day by day and as the point of view of educator I can say there has to be some coordination between government educator and yes of course police

systems rules and regulations when the rules and regulation will match with the education sector and they will create a awareness maybe this problem can be solved. You better know a man in a Kpur

recently lost a one lakh rupees a fake AI video from someone pretending to be a relative and at the same time the second case recently happened you know the senior citizen in Delhi paid money after

listening the voice of the child okay he step somewhere and at the same time few more cases a tech worker in Bangaluru almost lost 1.5 lakh back rupees in uh you know recently this kind of a scam.

So so many things are taking place like hacking tools, fake identity, malware, stolen data, fishing emails and fake loans. Every day we are getting lot of lot of calls and it's very very

difficult defakes creating a lot of problem even current scenario. So we should understand key the things is changing only awareness alertness and third very important part is that

educate them in a very very specific ground level. So that can solve the problem as the best of my knowledge. &gt;&gt; Thanks. Thanks Sa. I think you have given a punchline in terms of to follow

actually. Thanks Lord. Um uh Tarun just you know following up on Sapna really just want to know she has touched upon the deep fake you know which has created a lot of scam I mean of course it's not

you know illate right it's like a well educated people just they are losing in terms of the money from you know the end to win so really we want to know uh this is one is u on the AI um

yes glad to have you sir So just uh you know we want to know like uh one is with the a how we can prevent in terms of the you know incident second one is how I can detect the incident and

third one is once the incident has happened really just I wanted to know like it's like a real or the fake or how it is and then from where it is and just we want to know the root of this

incident so that furthermore any incident come just can be avoided with the right set of the mitigation step right so love to hear from you like in terms of the foreign side like what are

the key step how the A is playing significant role in terms of detection as well as a prevention &gt;&gt; thanks thanks Nathan so let me let me touch upon the problem uh in brief

before I talk about the solution see if we talk about a state like Delhi we have a population of 1.52 cr people we have a police force of 1 lakh 4,000 people. There is absolutely no way you can

monitor 1.52 cr people with a force of 1 lakh 4,000. I am pretty sure that 50% of the people in this room would have faced an incident that you would have lost your phone or maybe your wallet when you

went to the police to complain it complain about it. No FIR you would get a lost and found complaint and be done with it. You may get a message on your phone saying that some inspector has

been allocated for this case. 4 days later you'll get a message that the case has been closed and the reason for that is that the entire department is overloaded with cases. The third problem

as Dr. Sapna also mentioned also mentioned the guy who has joined the police force you know if he really wanted to become a technologist he probably would not have joined the force

right I mean I'm not saying that he cannot become a technologist but that is not his moto that is not his career it does not give him that zest for life right he wants to go to the field he

wants to catch criminals he doesn't want to spend time learning a new technology and the technology is changing at such a rapid pace that he will have to learn a new technology after every 1 2 months

and start using that technology. So if you look at the problem surrounding our police forces, they are they seem to be unsurmountable. Right? Now the solution to this what are what

is the basic premise behind a crime? If you look at it every crime if it is not a white wolf attack it's a network crime. You talk about somebody stealing your phone at the end of the day he has

to sell that phone and make money. You talk about somebody stealing your wallet you know it's a network. Somebody you know you have all these money laundering is a network. You have narcotic which is

a network. These are all network crimes. How do you identify a network? How do you start building the patterns to identify a network? And that is where AI can help. See, I'll take few examples.

Bartyani Sahita has come out with a guideline that today if a person is arrested, you need to do the forensic image of his digital devices, laptop and mobile phone because literally

everything that we are our life is defined by our digital devices. If I get access to your phone or laptop for maybe 1 hour, I would be able to figure out 90% of what your life is and vice versa.

Right? So, Bharti Sahita came out with a guideline that when you arrest someone, you have to do an image, clone his mobile phone and laptop and keep that data. Now, that is huge volumes of data.

Just to give you an example, you know, with income tax investigation units that we work with, when they go on a simple raid on a single company, they get data in tune of 80 terabytes of data. How can

you analyze 80 terabytes of data? And that is where AI plays a huge role in forensics analysis. So you dump all the data onto an AI engine and let the AI start trying to find patterns within

that data. Imagine the kind of patterns that you can identify and I'll give you a few examples some of the use cases that we have done ourselves with revenue intelligence GST intelligence just using

pattern recognition a very small AI model on the entire GST data of the country we were as per their own estimates able to identify possible fraudulent GST transactions worth 5577

crores and this was just a 3 to four months effort so that is the role that AI can play in identifying patterns in huge volumes of data and identifying these networks.

So I think now I think I answered your question. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. No. Thanks a lot. Thank you so much. Uh see the fundamentally uh you know doing the same

activity it's like a one go if you have the same pattern if the a will help you to detect and then give you this accuracy in terms of what went wrong and then how we can detect and then you know

the prevented over there actually. So thank you sir. Thank you so much for joining. Um uh see from the your rich experience you know you you would have handled a lot of you know cyber cases

and really just we love to hear from you uh in terms of the how the a can help you to hunt in terms of uh you know the fraudisters or maybe in terms of the threads because uh now this other side

what people are using is a can be used to do the fraud right and just I'm looking on the both aspects like how you have utilized or how you have a plan of in terms of using a component to detect

or to hunt the respective you know the fraudsters. uh f first of all I will want to reframe this question uh because you know being a council I'm

not an investigator &gt;&gt; so I'm not here to detect uh there are times I'm in fact mostly I'm representing the accused the condemned man you know because with all the

presumption of innocence proof beyond reasonable doubt and all of that so I would want to you know speak of an ideal legal regime that I foresee with AI technology. The policemen are there, the

judges are there, all that is happening, the accused is there, the victim is there, the complainant is there. Now I uh the few points that I come to my mind first of all privacy is very important.

right to privacy. It's a fundamental right recognized by the Supreme Court in Putas Swami's case flows out of article 21. So privacy cannot be compromised first of all. Now as an exception to the

fundamental right to privacy, one of the exceptions is uh crime investigation, crime prevention, terror prevention, terror investigation and prosecution. So that's an exception. So first of all we

must respect the rights of people the privacy of the people as an exception we must have uh enough technology law enforcement to prevent uh criminality cyber criminality preventive prevention

is better than cure and as my colleague said on the das it's next to impossible to investigate all crime that is happening. So many people come to me and they say,

you know, when a when a fraud is less than say five lakhs or 10 lakhs, I tell them just forget it. Nothing will happen. Why? Why? Why should good money chase something which

you will not get back? So one is crime prevention. At the level of crime prevention, I would say that people themselves have to be cautious. First of all, be careful in your dealings. That's

one. Now, an incident has happened. Then I would say from a victim's perspective, what does the victim want? First of all, he wants a red wrestle. He wants his

money back. That's one. And secondly, he wants the damn guy to be prosecuted. He wants that that guy who has committed that crime on him and made his life miserable. He wants that man to go to

jail. So effective prosecution, effective prosecution is where the police comes in. Law enforcement comes in. Now you know I hear or I have heard people saying that for example in the UK

smalltime thefts up to say £10,000 no cognizance is taken. &gt;&gt; That means we can do more less than 10,000 &gt;&gt; because so so what do you do? What do

you do? So then therefore the police has to investigate uh the crime properly. Prosecute the offender. That's the another objective. Of course AI plays a role over there. AI

plays a it's a double-edged weapon. AI will be used as a cyber crime tool also as a weapon also. And to counter it also you can use AI both ways. So therefore I will want a legal regime where the

correct accused is found and prosecuted. Now why I'm saying correct because the internet has layers of service providers. It's very very difficult to pinpoint the originator of a particular

fraud. So I will want you know the man who has committed the crime to be booked. And then last but not the least where I come in the innocent man should not be implicated. You know we have we

still I must say after 33 years at the bar and as a defense council I must say that we still have a very colonial police force in the country. I'm not saying it. The Supreme Court has said it

time and again. We still you know the whole police system is perhaps smiling and with a smirk that the whole police system they they start working from a confession and they work

backwards. So we need a we need a you know fairer system from the perspective of the accused also. Fortunately we are a country where there's rule of

law. Fortunately, we have independ we have an independent judiciary. Fortunately, we have the rights of the man who arrested. We have the victim also who is now being looked at with

some sympathy in the criminal justice system. We are moving in the correct direction. But of course, systemic problems are there. The number of policemen to the population, number of

judges to the population, all that is there. Now you can't have you know a policeman protecting every Indian citizens. So some criminality will obviously go unpunished but I hope that

most of the criminality should not go unpunished and innocence should not be implicated and if they are then I am there to look after the details. Thank &gt;&gt; Absolutely amazing sir very impactful

input and that's what where we are bringing a sir. I mean you may not have to have a proportional of populations and police. I mean we can reduce that actually and then from there we can you

know add value is amazing. Thank you so much for the great input. Uh so just coming I mean from lawyer to police right um so just I wanted to

hear couple of stuff right when we debate and the cyber security you know side we see so that's like a national threats I mean what are the a coming over there of course the valuation is

there but however we we feel that is like a national threats since you know I have seen you like from the long time you have handled in terms of the crime where the people to the smuggling and

then you know other cyber crime just want the physically now you are into the digital area also like in terms of the handling all the a component and then how needs to be ensured from you know

the end to end standpoint so just really just I wanted to hear from you like a both of aspects from police to the you know in terms of handling this AA like what are the prevention step where we

can take it forward to prevent all the crimes love to hear your input sir because all youngsters are there I All all young chaps right all Zenzi I can see that like the entire life live on

you know mobile so love to hear your insight. So uh when we were selected for the police you know the focus was completely on swimming horse riding

AK-47 you know run 10 kilome it's a mornings and you know uh beat uh IPS or DYP or sub inspector are constable at all level anyone can enter you know uh he may be

from humanities he can be from physics and mathematics and he can be a computer scientist as well so 99% uh policemen they from the humanities or

science background but this cyber crime is completely a different domain cyber foreigny is completely different domain so what we think by giving two three days training we can make them smart

cyber smart no it's Complete science you will have to give at least one year, two year, 3 years rigorous training in cyber security tools, cyber technology, cyber forensic tools and then this all big

data platform and it's all uh you know technology. So for training uh police personnel which is not happening right now you need at least 6 months rigorous course and only then you can train them

unless and until police understand technology behind the crime you know I for example suppose somebody is committing crime through UPI. So unless and until you know the

structure of PPI how NP national payment corporation was what is the infra behind RBI NFT and RT yes you cannot you know crack the case if some crime is happening through website if

you don't know how the domain is purchased how the website is created how the payment gateway is integrated the back end and how the criminals are using mule accounts and mu simology

you cannot crack the case. So that's why what is happening 99.99% police they are not well trained in cyber domain they are not well and not only cyber technology they have to be

the domain expert as well because if you want to investigate a case you should know the technology behind banking you know how this ATM network and everything very technical

&gt;&gt; so and that's why I always say that uh there has to be a clearcut a different it cider in the police department. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Okay. And only then we can solve

otherwise it's very difficult for the police to crack this kind of &gt;&gt; Of course the force is ready sir. &gt;&gt; No no no wonderful. Um see in the current trend no if you want to hack or

if you want to bring down this infrastructures I may not require to get into your laptop right if I pull down the power of your house if I pull down the power of your internet it's more

than enough. So ultimately I want to disturb you right I wanted to stop what you supposed to do that I can stop your water like what are the flows comes to your house you cannot take a bath you

cannot come to office so that's a supply chain it is coming in the bigger way right as well as now if you wanted to bring this ecosystems like I think most of the people you are aware right the

entire power grid has been hacked people are talking about internet the power grid has been hacked and then it's like a completely shutdown for this entire regions so that aspect so Now I'm

finding all the mobile what is being used everyone hand knows that is much more critical infrastructure for the country because it's like a weapon right as it rightly mentions right to be

forgotten like what they can tweet once it is done just you cannot take it back that's done it's like you know within your friends within your parents and within other neighbors you can squirrel

you can make a fight but after few days it will go off but the social media one comment you leave it that's it forever it will be there actually. So with that aspect of I know that just you was a you

know the foundation you know the member of in terms of drafting DBDB and data privacy and all things and all. So love to hear from you like how because a need more data data privacy where we should

not send the data. So love to hear from your perspective sir. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So when we talk maybe privacy is a fundamental right. Therefore when the laws for the country

particularly the DPDP act the digital personal data protection act which is which is which has already been enacted which is getting into operationalization as of today. The

whole aim is collect only what is really required. Don't overcolct be transparent. uh store it only for the minimum period that is required for the business. If

you are sharing it with anybody, there must be a reason and there must be a control. &gt;&gt; But we say everything for Yes. Yes, sir. because we won't access the app, right?

&gt;&gt; No. So, so, so in fact as of today probably it's only I agree to the terms and conditions and that's it. But tomorrow you will find you will get to know as to what data is being collected.

Number one. Number two, in case maybe more is being collected or has been collected, you will have the the rights to ask and confirm as to what data has actually been collected with

whom it has been shared. And in case you are actually wanting that this data should no longer be processed further, you will have the right to even get it erased. Lastly, for some reason or other

because it's a cyber security issue, I mean it's a things can always go wrong. Breaches can always happen intentionally, unintentionally that it will be the liability of the

organization who has collected processing this data to report a breach not only to the data protection board which is coming up but to also to the individuals whose data has been

impacted. So that means transparency, trust, accountability and possibility of financial fines which is all there in the system. &gt;&gt; Amazing. Thank you sir. Thank you so

much. And uh so just following to s you know the input uh uh I want to hear from that responsible air right I mean how as you know war has mentioned it's a double-edged sword really just I want to

hear from you like how the responsibility as a layman or as a technologist or maybe as a professional as a layman just how I can you know use make use of this weapon very responsible

way of course there's a lot of framework which is available but love to hear from &gt;&gt; yeah very good question and yes everybody wants to know key as a layman how we can take a prevention because

it's a very very important part we all literate people actually you know come under this trap because we don't know we always share the OTP like we use the public Wi-Fi and sometime we never know

how to use the AI ethically and AI ethically it's a very very important part we are teaching cyber crime in the colleges and schools but you ethical AI is still lacking. I feel like that the

diploma degree and more awareness program can help a lot. There was a one share which was you know said by the duchian So very important the rules and

regulation the rules and regulation and ethically we have to make such pathway so that the Genji can follow because if we are not providing the framework definitely people will suffer and we are

talking about Vixit Bharat right and Vixit Bharat and 5 trillion dollar economy can be affected if we are not taking a step ahead because it digitally we are empower we are actually

superpower but ethically yes most of the crimes taking place in India only you find 22,000 k rupees we have lost because of this crime and every minute f 5005 crimes every minute every minute

you know 5005 crimes taking place it's a very serious matter and this point of time government have to make cert certain rules and regulation implementation should be very strict and

the best part is that awareness and yes awareness education and at the same time make the guideline for everyone and there has to be some two-way verification

and ethical aspects that's it that's it I want to say &gt;&gt; awesome thanks Ram &gt;&gt; thank you &gt;&gt; see uh from where she left out in terms

of the awareness play very significant role right uh But even though just as a layman how I can make awareness is so but however if you take this deep fake and then in terms of the voice cloning

even though you are you cannot make out like it's it's a real or it's a fake right and what are the techniques maybe as a layman just I can you know give it in terms of just this are the video the

are the glimpses it comes this a fake or this is a real right and because the voice is already it's everywhere right if this voice is there with that they they can clone clone whatever they want

to do it and if you have my photo and then my mannerism just all things also can be cloned and that can be give it over there right so that aspect as a layman really just I want to understand

like what are the key stuff you know they should look in terms of the deep fake as well as the wise cloning &gt;&gt; so see deep fake is going to become a national security issue very soon maybe

as soon as the 2029 elections imagine it's so easy to create a video I mean frankly if you are an hostile country. It's so easy to create a video of maybe a a deep fake video of a cow getting

slaughtered and the head of the cow in front of a temple or a pig getting slaughtered and the head of a pig in front of a mosque. It will lead to riots. In specific states in the

country, it will lead to diets. That's had that has an impact on your economy. And with social media, it's very easy, you know, it actually cost as little as and I've seen it live. It actually cost

as little as two and a half lakh rupees to make a Twitter trend the sun rises in the west go viral. So there was a time there were where the top three hashtags in Twitter it was the sun rises in the

west right. So you can create a deep fake video make it go viral on social media. Half of our generation Z is on social media more than half. They will look at it and they will believe that

this is the truth. Right? So this is how big a problem defake has become. And another challenge with that is as of now and I've evaluated multiple AI models. There is not a single AI model which can

detect a really good deep fake generated video and tell you that it's a fake video. So the only thing that we can as responsible citizens do when you see something on social media or when

somebody gives you a call you have to do the verification of that through multiple other sources. You know if you see something on social media if it is actually genuine it would have been

covered by some newspaper media vernacular or mainstream in the country right so check it out check out search engines if you receive a call from someone who you think is your brother

sister or whoever you know do a cross check call them back and figure out whether that is you know whether they are the same people or not. These are basic checks that you can do. Technology

as of now to detect deep fake is lagging behind. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Now of course that's a lot of technologies and then other sense also keep coming and so with this really I

want to hear from you u earlier if you want to do hijack like I may not require to do myself I can hire a team and they can go and execute report it it's done right so that aspect so now this ramping

up you may not require to be part of any crime but you can hire the professional Profals they come and do the work execute they go away. So it's a cyber crime as a service which came into the

pictures you can pay and know where you get involved and they also nowhere connected to the counterpart whom you wanted to make a attack on that. So from the legal standpoint really just I

wanted to see as a you know cyber crime as services what are the preventions or have you come across any other cases like that has been you know executed from end to end and who is liable

whether it is who has executed or who has you know hired the people. So love to hear from you. uh we we have the law in place. In fact, the law the entire law of criminal

conspiracy you know has been there since Lord Macaulay's Indian Penal Code of 1860 that if uh if people come together and they agree upon to commit a crime

tacitly, explicitly, implicitly they are liable. uh so the liability mechanism is there in place and we have a lot of law that has developed the law has gone so far in fact if you see the evidence act

uh the there's a very interesting illustration that if a place was to be bombed and there were there was a conspiracy between A B C D and E

so it is not necessary for law to prove the agreement of criminality between all the five. So if A is organizing the fund somewhere in the world, B is organizing the weapon or the bomb or the making. So

all by their actions, you can prove a criminal conspiracy. So the law is there in place. Now if we apply it to AI, if we if I apply it to the uh to the internet, the problem that arises the

the experience that we have seen, of course I we derive the benefit of all that all the confusion from a defense perspective. The problem is how to attribute certain acts to individuals,

how to identify them. For example, you know, if you have an AI, if you create something, you know, why have why have five people uh why hire five people? Why not create a drone or create something

that that is not attributable to me? I have to only create it and put it into the internet and that that that drone or that mechanism itself is committing a crime. So the attribution of an act to

an individual is getting more and more complex. You know in the physical world you could identify people whereas in the world of the internet AI cyber world you can't identify people and then we have

problems of jurisdiction collection of evidence but the law is in place now. Now the law enforcement agencies have to be smart enough you know to identify uh these hiring of cyber criminals because

the best way to catch them is through the money trail. Money trail has become a very effective means of tracking cyber criminality laundering etc etc. So there are see law also catches up with crime.

It's the law is not you know not law is not so weak. catches up with criminality. &gt;&gt; Yeah, criminals is helping to develop a law, right? One extent.

In fact, if they are not there, I mean, we don't develop on that aspect, right? Just maybe one, you know, 10 seconds follow-up questions are like since all young chaps are there. Sometime we think

like if you do the crime from India, it's like a straight away it comes and hit on that, right? But if you do VPN to the some other country from there if you launch the people will think it may not

come to our responsibility. So love to hear your you know 30 seconds of input sir &gt;&gt; of course this proxy criminal &gt;&gt; because cross borders and interpol also

come into the pictures right they do come into the picture but but you know it's very difficult to prosecute offenders at that level you what we what we hear what we read in the papers that

so and so person is going to be extradited to India that's only a tip of the iceberg you know somebody some young lawyer very interesting ingly he narrated to me that you know why are

these you know nirv Modis and why are these few people being targeted you know because they have they have defrauded the bank what about those people who have defrauded private individuals

private lenders and they have run away from the country so these are you know problems extradition is a problem collection of evidence is a problem sovereignity of a nation is a problem so

I guess uh you know mutual treaties amongst nations where you cooperate with one another. Interpol is there but but interpol cannot really take care of all these problems. So we

need to we need to keep evolving you know from a law enforcement perspective. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Absolutely. Thank you sir. Thank you so much. And uh uh it's maybe I may take one more minute just 10

seconds of your input for takeaway for uh you know the and all the people just each one just I want to hear from 10 seconds just one takeaway for them like what they have to do and don't in terms

of uh cyber crime as well as with the AI &gt;&gt; for this I think uh government will have to create massive awareness comp campaign among the public so that they could know how the criminals are

operating what what are their mody And secondly, government will have to put much more emphasis on capacity building not only in police but in judiciary and prosecutors as well. And they will have

to provide resource as well. I mean cyber lab advanced tools technology you know and they will have to put much more emphasis in R&amp;D as well. R&amp;D regarding you know for example the current threat

is defect. So we must focus on defect detection technology. So do we have no as tarun told so no right now no there the best of the tools available that can give you only 80% accuracy not 100%. So

it cannot be admissible in court of law and that's why I think these are the things if government is focusing then definitely we will be able to uh control the cyber crimes.

Yeah, I would just like to mention it's not just about cyber frauds. It's also about so many illegalities which do happen in in the cyber world. And we'll also like to say prevention is the best

way understand greed. This is a normal human p I mean behavior. So something which is giving you too much of money or or maybe exploiting your greed, exploiting your fears, exploiting your

emotions which is what we have to I mean which is what we need to overcome in the age of AI seeing is not believing. Listening or maybe hearing from your known sources

may also not be truth. So, so maybe act responsibly before what we say is a zero trust architecture. &gt;&gt; Only one line. Stay alert. Once again, I'm repeating. Stay alert. Stay aware.

Stay secure. These are the three fundamental aspects you should keep in mind. Definitely you can save yourself and your family members. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thanks. Yeah. I I I think I have a

recommendation for the government not for the citizens. I I think the government of a country we have to realize that intelligence has to become privatized. It has already become so in

US. In US you do not have uh you know the intelligence is corrected by private individuals working in conjunction with the government and the operations are in hands of the law enforcement agency.

India will have to realize like the income tax departments of the country they have already done that they are working with private entities to gather intelligence and they are only involved

in the operations. I think all aspects of the government will have to follow suit. &gt;&gt; Yeah, we all work work together. We'll make that

&gt;&gt; u we need a deterrent law to check cyber Uh secondly, no crime should go unpunished. And thirdly, we should not be obsessed with uh you know catching hold of the criminal. Uh we must protect

the rights of the innocent man, the accused also. The the system has to be balanced. It cannot be a one-way street. &gt;&gt; Awesome. Amazing. And you know it's a wonderful conversation. We can give a

great applause to the entire leadership and of course a is a double-edged sword right how you handle is a matter actually so that's way we can handle with a more responsible and more

accountability to ensure that things are taken care with you know the positive note thanks a lot thank you so much and have a wonderful day ahead thanks a lot gentlemen

and all the guests to continue the discussion outside. We have a next session to begin with. Thank you. Good afternoon everyone. Hello. &gt;&gt; Welcome to this session this afternoon.

It's great to see a full room and and lots of smiling faces. Thank you very much for taking the time to be here. My name is Mercedes Fogarasi. I'm a policy analyst at Paris 21 which stands for the

partnership in statistics for development in the 21st century. uh and I work on our AI and innovation profile at Paris 21. It's a real pleasure to see everyone here today for the session on

local AI uh here at the India AI summit. I think this connects very well the the topic of local AI connects very well to some other conversations that we have been having already uh including a panel

we had yesterday on AI readiness and open data uh and as well as lots of conversations continuing to happen tomorrow and and through the rest of the week. So just before we get started, a a

quick opening remark for myself and then I'll pass it on to uh some official welcome remarks and then we'll get into a panel discussion. Uh but of course across the world today, artificial

intelligence is really being presented as a powerful tool uh and a really powerful tool for development especially. But one question that keeps coming back to us at Paris 21 is AI for

whom and built by whom? In many countries, especially across the global south, data systems are already under immense pressure. Statistical offices are being asked to do more, do these

things faster, but also with fewer resources. I think the mic is still on. Yes. But also with fewer resources while still responding to increasingly complex

policy challenges. And in that context, AI can offer a lot of solutions, but it can also widen already existing gaps. So this session and this conversation we are convening here today starts with a

simple idea in that AI only becomes truly impactful when it's grounded in local realities. That means local data ecosystems, local languages, local institutions and most importantly local

people. For official statistics, this matters deeply. Statistics are not just numbers. They are public infrastructure. They shape how governments see society, how policies are designed, and how

communities are recognized or also overlooked. If AI is going to be part of this increasingly new and complex infrastructure, it needs to be inclusive by design, trusted by institutions, and

useful for real decision-making. India offers a particularly interesting and powerful context for this conversation. The scale, diversity, and leadership in the whole conversation

around digital public infrastructure raises questions that resonate far beyond national borders. Questions like, how do we build these AI systems that work across languages and communities?

And how do we ensure that innovation strengthens, not replaces public accountability? Today's panel, we have people coming from government. We have voices from

technology, civil society, and international organizations. and together we'll explore what local AI looks like in practice, what has worked and also what hasn't. Our aim is not to

showcase the technology for its own sake, but to tell a grounded story. And to start us off on that story today, I'd like to invite my colleague from civic data labal to offer some more proper

opening remarks. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Mercedes. And good afternoon, everyone. Uh on behalf of Civic Data Lab and Paris 21, I extend a very warm welcome to our distinguished guest uh

partners, friends and colleagues. I am Shita Raal. I lead public finance and gender initiatives at Civic Data Lab. Uh at Civic Data Lab, we are on a mission to enable data change makers to leverage

data and AI for uh conquering some of the most pressing humanitarian problems uh specifically focusing on vulnerable communities. It is an honor to join to be part of India AI impact summit of

summit the first ever global AI summit to be hosted in global south. Our session today focuses or revolves around four important keywords as I see it. It is localization, inclusivity, data and

AI. To begin with, let's start with inclusive data systems. We all know and we all agree will agree that AI fuels uh data fuels AI and AI is actually representing what kind of data we are

feeding into it. So it becomes very important that the AI starts from the ground. Uh and u but sadly most of the time the foundation of data systems exclude the very communities for which

they are being created or for which they are being made to serve. And but have you ever wondered why? mainly because data these are being designed in the boardrooms these are coded in the tech

hubs and we still are following top- down approach and after doing all this we always kept wondering why uh AI or why data systems are not inclusive why they are not able to or they

misunderstand our local or regional languages and why they still perpetuate biases I think it's a time we need to rethink and we must agree that inclusivity should not be an

afterthought but it should an integral part of our design and um and these uh communities for which it is being created they should not just be a mere representatives but also co-creators in

the process and co-creating solutions is only the way forward as we see it and one powerful example that I would like to share here is uh Bhashini a government of India's initiative a

multilingual uh AI platform that actually supports uh voice to text and uh translation in most of the Indian languages and we see that this is be that this is what starting from ground

means basically touching the point which is very close to everyone's heart which is language if people are able to communicate able to uh uh interact with the services in the language that are

that they understand they definitely are empowered at least I feel empowered so uh I think and at civic data app. We are very proud to be part of this initiative and helping in supporting and

strengthening it further. Another important aspect that I have already shared beforehand which is like co-creating solutions. I would just like to talk a bit more about it. We all know

that data given the critical and extensive nature of data, it is not one man's job. We all need to get together. We all need to collaborate, partner, come together on a common platform where

we start sharing data sets, use cases, insights and we all become partners or co-creators. And this is what has been in our overall uh like I would say that this is the

overall ambition in whatever work we are doing at civic data lab. Uh we have been forming and strengthening data and AI collaboratives across all streams of our work. whether it is gender and

inclusion, whether it is climate and disaster risk reduction, climate and health and so forth and we would be happy to have all of you be part of our journey and happy to share more about

this and discuss more about this uh after the session or maybe later on. Finally, I would just like to end up by throwing few words which have been consistently put uh came across to us in

our civic sabha 2.0 which civic data lab has convened last week. Some of these words are responsible AI, inclusive data systems, ethical AI, collaboration, localized solutions, AI skilling,

participation, accessibility, safe and trusted AI and data and AI collaboratives. And I'm sure in today's session as well, we are going to delve deep into these topics and see how we

can all meaningfully engage with this and come out with a common idea. uh we will explore together what starting on the ground actually means in practice with all these distinguished

panelists with us we would like to hear from their experience what and look at some of the examples where local AI is actually empowering communities where we are falling short

what is the way forward what we see as potential benefits challenges and gaps I look forward to our conversation and to concrete ideas partnerships and innovations that will emerge out of it.

Together, we have a unique opportunity to ensure that data and AI drive inclusive development and we leave no one behind. With this, let's dive into the session and I now hand over back to

Mercedes to take forward the conversation. Thank you so much and thanks again for joining us here. Thank you so much. That was that was wonderful and a really good way to start

off this conversation. Like you mentioned, I think the points you hit on inclusion and inclusivity in the way that we design is incredibly important. So I look forward to hearing about our

speakers on that. But before I do pass it over to our speakers, I do want to introduce them because I know you can see well you were able to see their pictures and their names on the screen,

but not much more than that. So let me tell you about how great these people are. Directly to my left, we have Johannes Yutting. Johannes is the executive head. Yes, that is you.

Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Johannes is executive head of Paris 21. So my close colleague again Paris 21 is the global partnership that is hosted by the OECD but we are a separate entity in

what we do and we have our own mandate which is really on supporting national statistical systems around the world particularly in the global south. Johannes is a development economist by

training and also a former member of the UN secretary general's expert group on the data revolution. He's long worked at the intersection of statistics policy and inclusive development. Directly next

to him we have Dr. Sorro Gar. Mr. Garag is the secretary of India's ministry of statistics and program implementation and he oversees one of the world's largest national statistical systems. An

Indian administrative security service officer my apologies he has held senior leadership roles across digital public infrastructure, social policy, finance and brings extensive experience in

technology enabled public service delivery. Next we have Gorov Gwani who is the co-founder and executive director of civic data lab a research lab advancing

data and responsible AI for public good across India and the Asia- Pacific region with over a decade of experience deploying data innovations in areas such as climate resilience, public finance

and health. He works to strengthen civic and institutional data ecosystems. And finally, at the end of our line here, we have Sachi Bala, who's the deputy director at the Gates Foundation, where

she leads work in India on gender equality with a focus on women's economic empowerment and leadership. With experience spanning policy partnerships, public health, and

equitable development, she brings a strong emphasis on evidence-driven and intersectional approaches to social impact. Please join me in applauding our fantastic lineup here today.

So, let's get started and I'll I'll like to hear from you, Johannes, first um to maybe set the problem statements a little bit for us because when we talk about local AI can mean a lot of

different things, but what problem are we actually trying to solve when we talk about global or generic AI solutions, failing to address different things in official statistics and and public

decision-m? &gt;&gt; Thank you very much, Mercedes. Good afternoon, everybody. Good to see you here. Um if if I may may I say this I I wouldn't put this maybe not too much

into a global versus local conversation. I think the global conversation that we have is very important. We discussed many things related to global AI and the problems and the challenges. I think

it's now high time to discuss local but to see the benefits of this conversation of seeing what can local AI do and here I have to say I have really to congratulate the Indian government in

particular also your ministry um to put the question of welfare and to push the question of happiness. This is if you run around the signs you see AI for improving welfare and happiness. This is

the focus of the third summit. The other two summits were in the UK and in France uh important summits but this is the first global summit as has it been said that is in the south and focuses

specifically on issues related to poverty to welfare. So I think the first point I wanted to drive home is it's really something that we need to take on now very seriously of how local AI and

data system can improve well-being. And if I may, can I speak please again about the STGS? Have you forgotten about the SGS? No, we shouldn't. I mean we still have the Monday to talk about the

sustainable development goals and agenda 2030. Leave no one behind. We have seen some developments in the international arena but let's please keep us have to focus on the STGS. We still have a few

years to go to achieve something. So the first point I really wanted to drive home is the contribution of local AI system and local data system to improve well-being of all people specifically

also in rural areas and who are living uh a little bit behind. Second point I wanted to say what are the key levers how this sort of situation how can we discuss this. The first is access the

access question and as you know I mean um with many of the data systems and data conversation we had yesterday we had a conversation about AI readiness getting um sort of the system ready and

the data to be used for AI AI for data data for AI and I think that's something we really should see are we coming into as Stefan Vulz professor in New York says are we coming into a data winter

because some of the access will be closed or will we be able to unlock data. I think this is an very important key lever to ensure that we can access data that helps people and that helps a

sort of local AI system to um really address uh problems that matter for local people. So access is very important. The second point capacity development this is Paris 21. We are

capacity development institution. We train and would love. One thing that I haven't seen just I'm picking this out. Um I'm a trained uh development economist but in reality I'm an

agricultural economist by training and what always struck me in agriculture was the role of small farmer organizations. Small farmer organizations to help farmers to understand their world and

sort of to be helped to give them the fertilizer the pesticides the education. I haven't seen yet the small farmer organization helping them with the AI systems and helping them to relate to

those sort of using mobile phones to help them. I think that's something maybe we can we can look into further. So capacity development through whom training is the second point access

capacity development and last but not least it comes all over again and again is trust is trust. If the farmer let's stay to the farmer example doesn't trust in terms of the thing that he gets from

his wonderful mobile phone tell him he has to plant now if he doesn't trust this uh because he doesn't believe in the data and whatn not then we have an issue so the trust will be key let me

come to the last point um is the role of national statistical offices I think the national statistical offices all over the world but particular in this country can play an tremendous role in ensuring

that local AI data system can support uh the fight against poverty and improve well-being. Um it can so do uh by setting standards by helping with the quality control of the data and by also

something which has come up uh very recently is to talk to different stakeholder groups. We often think about unlocking data from the private sector. That's a big debate. We talk about

public sort of all the surveys. Yes. But we also have citizen generated data. many citizen generated many NOS's and can we sort of integrate that data after having it quality controlled into sort

of local AI systems that can really again help um supporting um uh the welfare of poor people. So in a nutshell um this is an important conversation that we need to have. We are just at the

beginning and now I'm curious to hear from my Indian colleagues what they say more precisely on the Indian situation. &gt;&gt; Thanks Johannes. And I think that's a really insightful way to to look at this

maybe. Yeah, I agree. It's not necessarily a problem, but you know, the challenge that we have at hand here. Uh, a lot of what you touched on here is really the importance of grounding AI in

local realities. Um, so I'm curious to hear from the government perspective. Dr. Arg if you could tell us a little bit more from that perspective because India really is cited quite often as a

leader very rightly so I think in this um especially for digital public infrastructure but what type of institutional or governance choices would you say have been most critical in

ensuring that AI enabled data systems remain inclusive trusted and fit for public use. Uh thank you uh pleasure to be here. Um and also a pleasure to talk about uh

inclusive AI uh data systems because that's really at the core of uh what we when we talk of uh the overall objective of AI for welfare and and AI for all. Uh in fact uh one of the seven working

groups of this AI summit is on democratizing AI resources. uh I'm associated with that group. I co-chair it along with Egypt and um Nigeria and in Egypt and Kenya and uh we are looking

at this issue and the fact remains that a lot of AI resources whether you look at uh compute you look at models you look at data systems you look at talent uh they're not evenly distributed and uh

that's an area that uh we've deliberated in the working group also to look at what what needs to be done and this is all the more important because AI is now moving from experimentation

uh to real public deployment and uh we are not uh no longer at an experimentation uh level and uh some of the things that we've been discussing whether in the working group or outside

is uh how data and AI ecosystems uh need to be treated perhaps as a data public infrastructure u data in the sense A lot of data is generated uh as you mentioned uh by the

statistical offices by censuses surveys but there's a lot of data which gets generated within governments and outside governments and uh at least we need to be able to identify the data sets which

can be put out in the public uh ecosystem which can be used uh for uh AI development and data is the raw material for AI And uh if uh credible and standardized data is available that will

ensure that uh the AI models work in a manner where no one is left behind which is also the goal of uh the SDGs uh towards data governance. What is also required is a standardsbased uh system

and that is something that we are working uh intimately in the government uh looking at how to ensure that the uh that the metadata is uniform that classification and standards are

followed uh that uh interoperability is maintained uh that data is machine readable uh so that it uh it becomes accessible and uh issues of access are critical

whether it's for compute or for models and that's the reason what are the different mechanisms uh there's talk of uh the edge resources uh edge compute there's talk of small domain models and

I suppose a host of these would really help to ensure democ democratize AI access uh and ensure that AI remains uh inclusive uh the other aspects are in terms of how

we can uh how we can uh mold AI to ensure that access uh remains uh inclusive and what I'm talking of in terms of ensuring that uh semantic search can be made much more

multilingual uh because increasingly I think that's one thing which AI uh ecosystems allows to ensure that voice becomes a means of being able to uh search and identify and voice which is

uh language neutral which is uh uh which is for which you don't need to be illiterate and you don't need to have a single uh language access I think multilingual access and voice access is

something which AI in a way enables so AI uh we don't need to look at AI as always restricting access. But I think this aspect of AI is something which will only enable greater inclusiveness

and ensure that people are able to access highquality information, highquality resources because of the inherent uh benefits of AI. And last but not the least is also in terms of

strengthening safeguards. I think uh that's been alluded to and that's what when we we talk of AI by design uh being able to ensure that uh u the uh data is uh is is one takes care of safety

concerns and concerns of uh ethical issues around it. So what would be the guard rails for that? I think that needs to be uh built in at the design stage itself. But that in itself should not

prevent us from ex leveraging AI much more effectively. I think uh very often the u u u the if I don't want to use that word but for lack of the doomsayers uh are

uh might talk about the uh harms of AI but I think we need to be cognizant of the benefits also while ensuring that we have sufficient uh safeguards built in at the at the design stage. So I'll stop

here but just want to add since we are uh talking in a forum which is a partnership for statistics and I am um part of the statistics office in India uh that is something that we are working

with across ministries across states to ensure that uh the data becomes accessible and that uh uh data is uh is standardized and because if our data ecosystem is correct That's really the

foundation and that foundation will ensure that uh AI becomes uh so much really AI for all and AI in inclusive in all its sense. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much Secretary Gar.

That's really helpful and especially the points you're hitting on about inclusion. I think you've hit it right on the nail there. Um but I do think it's one thing to design these inclusive

systems and then it's a real other thing to actually feel their impact. So that's why I think uh maybe now we turn it over to to Goro from Civic Data Lab to to go in a little bit more on that angle. If

you can tell us a little bit about how you've seen local AI actually empower communities uh or maybe from the civil society actor perspective as well in a way that you can now engage with data in

new ways. &gt;&gt; Thanks uh Mercedes for having me here and thanks to Paris 21 for co-organizing this session with us. So since we are in the late afternoon session with your

permission Mercedes, can I do a bit of a poll just to see the energy in the room? &gt;&gt; Yes, I love the interaction. &gt;&gt; So raise your hand if you have used AI application be it your traditional GPTs

and LLMs in not English and Hindi. Not English and Hindi. Great. uh continue to keep your hand up if you feel everyone in your family especially your elderlys can use that

effectively continue to keep your hand up if you can find local information about your neighborhood for example SDG goals I'm also wearing the SDG pin as we were

reminded by Johannes that SDG indicators we can get in the local language for your local area through those AI models So yeah very few hands left. So that's the problem which we are trying to solve

like if you have to make local data work for local population for the local development goals we don't have the ecosystem ready yet and it has three major uh areas which we have to improve

upon. Number one is co-creation. Some some of the times these models are created as my colleague was explaining in research labs but not tested or not actually involved very uh from the very

beginning with the local communities. So at civic data lab we keep saying when we talk about the AI life cycle unfortunately the local audience comes at the tail end of it when we start

testing those solution not from the very beginning they get seat on the table to to have opportunity to say their concerns say what their problems are what are the kind of opportunities they

want to uh achieve with help of these local applications. So ensuring there is enough representation in the room when we conceptualizing these AI models is critical. Uh and then we involve them in

throughout the AI life cycle. Find incentives for them to be motivated throughout the AI life cycle with you. when you are conceptualizing, when you are bringing in the data sets, when you

are early testing the models, when you are actually scaling up the models and and ensuring it's ready for the population scale, find incentives that they are involved throughout the AI life

cycle. Second one is evaluation. We understand and Johannes briefly touched upon it that there is global AI ecosystem and there local AI ecosystem and lot is happening in the global AI

ecosystem. We can see across the bhat mandapam a lot of conversation is dominated by that. How do we ensure that there is a bridge between global AI and local AI? We don't want them to be in

the locks with each other. We want them to work with each other and that's where the participatory AI evaluation uh framework can help us enable that. So lot of LLMs, lot of AI models would be

developed uh in other countries and would be brought into other geographies. That's going to happen. That's the reality we are working with. But we need participatory eye evaluation where local

experts, local domain experts, local culture experts know what are the biases in some of these models, flag them well in advance before they are raised at population scale and help them curb all

of this. And again we find incentives for these experts local domain experts local culture experts to serve us in that journey. That's the second aspect. Third is the skilling. Local AI is as

good as the local skilling ecosystem who is going to get benefit of it. We understand that still certain section of communities struggle to engage in the digitization journey struggle to engage

with the AI journey as well. How do we give enough opportunity of skilling to them so that they feel they have a seat on the table? They can participate with this information. Be it your data sets,

be it your AI models. How do we find that space for them to skill and and and feel comfortable that they would have a secure job in the future as well? So that's what I would feel uh if you have

to unbundle local AI these three elements co-creation participatory AI AI evaluation and AI skilling need to be unlocked parallelly to make it happen. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much Gorov. Um, I hear

what you're saying, especially on the the scaling aspect of it as well. And that's what's really key here. And so maybe if we if we want to hammer in a little bit more on that because I think

it's important that we talk about initiatives that go beyond pilots and and really looking at that impact and that success as well. But turning over to you Sachi because I know you have a

lot of experience both within the Gates Foundation and and in other areas as well working across different countries and institutions. uh but from your perspective at the Gates Foundation now

what is one recommendation that you would give to governments who are really interested and want to invest in AI for data systems especially keeping in mind something that actually strengthens

inclusion in public decision-m &gt;&gt; uh thank you Mercedes and thank you uh to the organizers this is a great session uh I also feel like so much has already been said you know I think we've

I was just making note of some of the words everyone has said around trust co-creation uh and uh I think what God have said about skills is also something that sort

of was reflected across the panel. Uh if I had to say one recommendation and I'm I'm just going to give you the headline but I want to dig deeper into some uh other themes. Um I think we need to

treat AI as an institutional capability um and really look at inclusion in design uh and in the in the co-creation aspect at the outset rather than as a secondary or a you know tertiary area of

focus. Um and I think something that we must keep reminding ourselves is that AI is not a standalone tool. uh having dashboards and doing pilots is exciting and it it is something that could get

people interested in uh focusing on the the value that you can get out of AI. uh but it really sort of how well we are able to utilize AI and and really make it work for people is by looking at

whether it can be embedded in existing trusted institutions with trusted data and aligned with statistical standards all things that um Mr. GG said uh but also looking at what is the use of that

data and what is the use of that AI functionality at different levels and that's going to look different at the national level it'll look different and at a community level it'll look

different it will look different if you have a shared device or if you have your own individual device so thinking about the usability I think is something that also needs to come in right at the

outset um I can dig a little deeper there but I wanted to sort of you know go back to what uh Johannes said about the lack of application of AI in agriculture uh and at the last mile in

some form uh and some work that we've been doing uh with the government of India with the national rural livelihoods mission is really making sure how can we tap into AI capabilities

that that exist but make sure that we are working with trusted frontline workers so women who are from the community women frontline workers ers who actually can be skilled and um be

provided with the tools which allow them to access data, access AI uh analysis and share that with women farmers and because it's the combination of being skilled on a

technical area whether that is on livestock management or on specific aspects of agriculture and cropping and it's coming from a trusted person who is also equiped with the right information

and AI powered uh tools. I think that's really in a sense such a great use case uh of what we can do to make sure that AI is actually local uh and is being used by the community and actually then

strengthening what what the data systems are and how AI can actually you know continue getting better at responding to the needs of the community. &gt;&gt; Thank you. I like the way you've put

that kind of two-way street into perspective as well. You know, the importance of having that trust go two ways and have important the importance of understanding and the skills as well

that come along with that as well as the access. Um, so all very important points. We've got just less than 15 minutes left in this session and I do want to open up for Q&amp;A. But before I do

that, so it gives everyone a chance to think of a question, a short and concise question so that we can take as many as possible. I want to ask one question to our speakers, maybe a little bit

provocative, a little bit pushing, uh really on that local global nexus, um which we all see maybe in different ways, but can we ever really have truly local AI in a world where foundational

models and platforms are really controlled by these big global actors? So, you don't have to answer that question, but a little a little seed to think about. And now, if anyone has

questions from the floor, I will come pass the mic to you. Fast hands. I see a fast hand there. If you can introduce yourself as well &gt;&gt; Thank you panel. Uh I'm Anubhuti and I'm

from Nalanda University. Uh my question is uh from uh Ma'am Yu and uh um um Gorovs uh if you could answer how the government launched yesterday only Bharat Vista program and we see how it

is integrating and uh it will be useful for the farmers to look up to the schemes and everything. How do we um make sure at this level when we we are implementing this DPI structure on the

local level how do we make sure that um not to criticize but uh I come from Rajgeir uh where my university is based. We don't have stable internet connections in such areas. How do we

make sure that the uh people are actually able to access uh such database and um they are able to reap benefit out of it. So how do we make sure of that? &gt;&gt; Thank you very much. Let's see if

there's some other questions. Maybe we can bundle some questions here. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Um hello all of you. My name is Vinit Prakash and um I have recently uh started started an organization um

quantum nebula. It's a startup. So basically the organization intention is to bring the combination of the AI uh and AI offerings and so that you know we can we can bring up uh the

processings and the another pattern on the quantum side because I saw the name quantum so I came here. So the question is do you think uh that uh the quantum and the AI can bring the right set of uh

you know use cases across the healthc care and the other verticals as well do you think so based on your experience I' I've done couple of research around and I have a patent in quantum recently on

the authenticity so so but but I would like to hear from the jury as well thanks &gt;&gt; thank you very much maybe is there one more question. Yes, I'll see the hand

right here and then we'll leave it up to the speakers to answer whichever. &gt;&gt; Hi, I'm Himali. Uh I'm I'm a data scientist. So my question is uh since this uh session started with talking

about involvement of community. So currently as I understand there's a lack of knowledge among digital users on how their data is collected and how it is used. Even though the DPDP act is there

but the legitimacy of it in the society is not yet there like people are not aware of how much data the companies actually have on them and what probably company has more data on uh a person

than the person actually understands. So how do we bridge this gap through community participation? I want to understand that. &gt;&gt; Very interesting. Thank you for that. I

think the community participation aspect is incredibly important for us to talk about um continuing. So, so uh speakers over to you feel free to take the mic and jump in on any of those.

&gt;&gt; So, uh starting for the first one on uh connectivity and internet uh problems in rural areas. I think uh one must realize that now we are entered a situation that number one mobile connectivity is near

universal. uh it's more than 98 or 99% in terms of availability of mobile connection internet connection because of the uh Badat digital project uh uh ensuring that optic fiber connectivity

is there to every punchayat uh that also is near universal and a lot of these activities whether it's Bhat Vistar uh there was another one Maha Vistar which was already in operation Batistar was

launched if I'm not right I'm not mistaken yesterday by the honorable prime minister. Uh so a lot of them are also don't necessarily require a smartphone. Many of those activities are

also available on a feature phone. So I think because of uh ubiquity of uh the mobile phone access is something which perhaps is not so much of a problem and maybe a decade or two back it was but

that's what I would I would just like to flag that and leave it at that. on the quantum and AI. I think quantum would have a lot more impact on the cyber security. Obviously, you have uh quantum

computers and you'll have compute so much more faster, but that's still something in the future. But in terms of quantum infecting cyber securityities more threats which are real and I think

at the same time there are enough uh uh work being done to ensure that quantum uh can also be used more effectively for good rather than looking at it only uh at what could be the uh negative uh

aspects uh of that. And um uh the third uh point was on &gt;&gt; community &gt;&gt; on on on data on I think data privacy is something which uh is is is topmost in

terms of concerns that there are at an individual level but I can say that uh each of the uh data sets that are collected especially by the government have very clear protocols behind them. I

think what you are alluding to is the data that is captured by a lot of the for example the social media uh aspects etc. And I think those are things uh which are uh which are work in progress

if I can put it that way. uh but uh the the first is obviously awareness has to be at an individual level and then uh comes the second aspects on what needs to be done to ensure that in case there

is a violation and I think that DPDB act at least has a framework around it and we can of course discuss how it will get implemented in future but I'll stop &gt;&gt; Thank you very much secretary over to

you Sachi. Um I'll just build on uh sir's point from around uh data connectivity um and also add that you know I think why when we are building solutions in India and if we are

thinking about what happens at the last mile we're making sure that these solutions are not dependent on connectivity at 100% of the time. So I'll just reference like maybe a couple

of tools that frontline workers are using and that could be in the health space, it could be in uh the agriculture space, it could be in education. The way that these tools are currently being

designed is that you have offline capabilities. you are able to utilize them when you know you are in a even in a remote area and then once you have access to internet uh strong internet

again or uh or data capabilities you you are able to actually upload the data um online onto the cloud. Uh I think it's really important that when we design we make sure that we are looking at the you

know the last user. It's not for the average user who is going to be sitting in a city with 100% connectivity at all times. And I think it's it's really amazing to see that actually the

government of India has made that effort because of this idea around democratizing and making sure that we are actually uh getting the best capabilities at the last mile. So I

think you know the the way that tool the way we are looking at tools that the design and the usability of tools today we recognize that there will be these few instances you know there they may be

near universal connectivity but there might be some instances where uh data is weak or you know we are not using smartphones etc. But the way that applications are being designed and the

skilling that is being provided to the frontline workers make sure that that doesn't mean they are left out of that uh of this movement. I and I think that's a really strong start. Uh of

course uh you know as connectivity improves and as skills improve uh this is something that's just going to get stronger and stronger. If I can just add in 30 seconds to what

uh Sorab gi and uh Sachi mentioned uh two things which uh and actually in both the use cases of connectivity as well as on um data security data privacy perspective there is a very critical

role of civil society organizations to take this knowledge localize it contextualize it for the citizens they are serving. uh one body alone can't ensure uh a a digital application or AI

application is reaching the last mile. There's series of intermediaries which we have to activate. So local civil society and local academic institutions play a vital role here. We just need to

find more incentives to support them. And second is again we have to make sure that information is localized. there is a need for multilingual aspect uh to be strengthened and and the project Bashani

is trying to do that. How do we further see a larger landscape there where voice data could also be ensured because a lot of languages are not having scripts. So how do we uh ensure that some of the uh

DPP act laws are explained in voice for the local languages for local dialects is going to be a gamecher which we would see in upcoming years. &gt;&gt; can I just add add something to this

conversation? Um and also to bring it back to um to the international level because uh I think the Indian example is super interesting for all over the world. I mean we at Paris 21 work a lot

in Africa and I was I mean if to be very honest um one point that I think we are not discussing discussing eventually enough is supply versus demand. For me this is often a very much supply driven.

We have AI, we throw it at the people and then see if demand is coming. Hey, we have to see what is the real can we turn latent demand. Can we make farmers um citizens demand those services? So if

we do this, what are people concerned about living in in rural areas, living in cities, whatnot, they are first and more foremost concerned about public services. Public service meaning

healthcare. If I go to a hospital, do I pay under the table payment? It says officially is free for all. No, but often you have to pay under the table. Is there teacher showing up in school?

Is there is there quality education? Is there security? Is there sewage? Those things matter for people. So, how can we turn this latent demand into into something I think that their civil

society can help but also for profit sector and I think we should also and that's something maybe for the researchers here we could we could think about a bit more is about what are the

lessons learned from the ICT revolution. 25 years ago, 30 years ago, I was working for a research institute in Bourne in Germany and we started research about ICT, information

communication technology. Is it good or bad for poor people? I mean not in the sense of oh bad for poor people meaning uh does it benefit the poor? Have mobile force benefit the poor more

proportionally? I would say definitely yes. What was the success reasons for this? I mean many of the things that then also private sector has come up is now look at Kenya you have insurance

payments via mobile phones it's even more advanced than in rich countries so can we get those things in in the world as well and what is needed so I think we have to focus also a little bit more on

the demand make it effective &gt;&gt; thank you very much I think those are all really interesting uh ways to answer these different questions we've had all very different questions as well

covering different areas of of this debate here I know we had that alarm clock that went off and all woke us up a little bit uh and and is definitely our cue to to wrap up here. So, just in

wrapping up, um I think what we've come to hear a lot from all of our speakers is really this importance of inclusion. I don't think that's news to anyone, but I think the angles that you've all

presented here and coming from the different perspectives has really shaped how I understand inclusion in this space of AI and where the different stakeholders and and different groups

all play a key role as well as the the stakeholders that we have in the room, citizens, people coming from uh different types of institutions, different countries and backgrounds as

well. That is what can really make these systems, these solutions the strongest and I think that's also where we can understand the demand as you're saying Johannes it's exactly true I think a lot

of times in tech the demand is uh preceded by the supply uh so how can we flip that and make sure that these solutions that are being invested in uh both in terms of financial resources but

also environmental resources how can we make sure that they're responding to the demand that's out there rather than just throwing spaghetti at the wall to see if it sticks.

Um, so we've got about 10 seconds left. Let's use that time for applause. Thank you all for coming out and thank you to our speakers. Namaskar.

Our distinguished guests, respected dignitaries, industry colleagues and innovators and friends. I welcome you to an interesting conversation today. I'm not a monol you know with a with set of

speeches. That is the agenda actually and instead we would like to everyone in this room to uh participate and take pride in becoming part of this uh historic moment of uh India impact AI

summit because this is the world's largest AI expo and what better that our honorable PM has himself been putting in efforts to make India reach to this place that we are now hosting many

nations. ations there are dignitaries there are industry colleagues from many nations who are you know joining hands they are seeing India progress on this front so this is a proud moment for us

and let us you know enjoy let us contribute to this moment so the point of conversation discussion in front of us is uh the India AI stack you know strategic framework for national growth

and pride uh before diving into the discussion I I want to read an adapt adaptation of Ram Dhari Singh dinarji Rashmiri or modern take on patriotic

verse of that it goes like this. AI adv. So I read these lines for our esteemed panelists who have joined us today and have embodied the character to develop

India stack. Our panelists have lived these lines by their work in their respective fields and immensely contributed in building nation strength and to give wings to the AI revolution

in India. Please join me with a round of applause in welcoming our guest today. In the order left to right, I'll I'll introduce uh our our panelists.

So, Swasti Jakarvatari is the vice president uh technology at Network Technologies India Limited where he leads strategic technology innovation and uh AIEL product development for

large scale digital transformation solutions. He drives the design and development of AI enabled platforms to offer complete sovereign AI platforms including GPU systems, AI storage and AI

cloud stack. And maybe if I if if I can have the liberty to introduce myself also. I am Hay Vikram. I'm senior vice president and chief sales and marketing officer with network technologies. So uh

I have been on the uh you know on the AI front and HBC for last uh 20 plus years. So I I uh want participation for from each one of you to make this moment actually

uh moving forward to uh Dr. Pratt Prahi, professor of computational biology and uh also serves as founding head at center of excellence in healthcare information technology at triple IT

Delhi. He has also contributed to research at as New Delhi and served as a visiting faculty at Stanford University's school of medicine. He was CSIR quick hire fellow at the C CSIR

fourth paradigm institute. Please give a round uh of applause for Dr. Tapesi. Then we have Dr. Manuri. He's a professor at IIT Delhi specializing in neuropformic computing, artificial

intelligence, hardware and advanced memory technologies. He's also the founder of Sirean AI solutions. He has been featured in prestigious lists like MIT technology reviews innovators under

35 and FOBS 30 under 30 Asia. Dr. Suri leads pioneering research and on next generation brain inspired computing systems that promise to revolize revolutionize AI hardware. Then we have

uh Colonel Amit Mana director AI DGIS Indian Army. He is a senior Indian army officer serving as director artificial intelligence defense geospatial information service that is DGIS for his

distinguished service of the highest order to the nation over 28 years. He has also been awarded the vicious sava medal VSSM. Then we have Dr. Sultan Singh. He's a

distinguished geospatial scientist and director of Hana space application center. He also serves as chief geospatial officer for Hana state development authorities including GMDA

and driving geospatial governance implementing AI for urban planning infrastructure and environmental monitoring across multiple authorities. Under his leadership, Harseek has

executed over 270 geospatial projects spanning agriculture, water source, forestry, disaster management and disaster resilience. So we have such esteemed panel and we we all would like

to you know get you know enrich ourselves with the thoughts coming from them. So let us try to take part as much as possible. So goal is definitely you know to provide various perspectives on

the topic of India AI stack you know fostering uh and engaging the information experience rather than having discussions in I solutions I would say.

So for our audience quick understanding India AI stack comprises of three important elements application layer that basically covers the foundational models text speech vision

multimodel different type of models. Then the second layer comes hardware layer where the applications the models where these applications run on. How each ingredient are being enriched

by Indian manufacturing ecosystem and uh you know how the implementation of the hardware which is used for India stag how this is getting done in the country. We are going to know about both the you

know layers. Then comes the important aspect that uh how these organizations be it PSUs, central PSUs, state PSUs, defense organizations or the education research

institutes they are implementing the both the layers that is the AI stack the applications layer as well as the hardware layer because with these two applications only with these two layers

only we can really see the India AI stack in real action. And that is what we would like from our esteemed panelists that how they have implemented during their uh you know

tenure what they have done what difficulties they face. So that is the objective for you know all of us to know that how India stack is getting built in India how it is basically leveraging the

technology. So before I dive into the session I'll I'll in quickly introduce the flow of the session to the panelists and even the audience as well so that you know we

can be on time frankly speaking on covering all the inputs I uh request our estine panel to first share their respective thoughts on the importance of India AI stack the strategic framework

for national growth and pride I request the panelists to cover their thoughts initially in 2 minutes thereafter we'll uh dive into the details real discussion and we'll have some questions for which

our audience would like to hear from you. So uh maybe in the uh order starting with Dr. uh Tapraeshi sir please let us know that what India stack means to you and what you have done in

the past you know building this India stack for the country. So starting with you sir. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you Netweb for having me here. Um I think uh India as we know

if it's a famous saying that if you solve it for India we sol solved it for the world and I think it's very much true for especially for healthcare which is my area of expertise and I work in

health tech and health AI. Uh so India AI stack for health I think is a very important component um that that should have all the layers of sovereignity explanability also inclusivity. I think

there's several countries that have been trying to build AI um from several lenses, right? We there can be more capitalistic approaches. Uh but India I think has taken a very balanced approach

towards building inclusive AI and that's what all these discussions on responsible AI are about. Doing that is not simple. It's easier said than done. U the blocks are already there. the

building blocks of having data sets for example and having a framework like ABDM is a fantastic uh step towards uh that direction which allows um interoperability of data and then

perhaps applications to be built. My particular work has been focusing on ICUs a lot um building models that can predict which baby is going to crash in next 24 hours with things like sepsis or

shock in the tertiary care settings. But very quickly we recognize that that's a very small proportion of um what healthcare is. What we really need is in the stack how do we build these models

for low resource settings. I work with as a nurse may be visiting a bed maybe every 30 minutes and monitoring equipment exists. Maybe not all not all

ICUs have that re that kind of resources right. So we've also built models which actually do some very interesting novel tasks like resolution transfer where such equipments may not be collecting

high density data. So how can we build the transfer learning to settings where low density data can also um help with with the same kind of accuracies. I think those are some of the things that

we've been doing. Then we contribute to antimicrobial research, drug discovery and all of that. But happy to talk about that more later. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you Dr. T.

Dr. Malan if we can have your inputs uh on on India staff please. &gt;&gt; Thank you Re thank you to that web and the organizers. So so in my opinion u you know there is no understatement that

u AI is important and we are headed to an AI dominated age. So uh the India AI stack is important because uh as a nation we should inspire to be AI OEMs you know and not just AI service

providers you know uh sector after sector for whatsoever reasons the economy or the approach has been more towards services but when we are faced AI is an inflection point so we have a

chance here to aspire to become a OEM. So when you have to become an OEM uh you have to own the stack right and so that is why it is important not just from a sovereignity point of view but also from

a growth national growth national value creation point &gt;&gt; change the service economy to the manufacturing economy &gt;&gt; manufacturing economy so so that is the

core thing here now in our own experience how we have contributed to the India AI stack we have contributed on two sides one is the application side our team at siren and at IIT Delhi we

have built many indigenized applications uh specifically for geo AI or geospatial AI, defense AI, computer vision AI uh these solutions have been uh you know built indigenously they are all also

deployed and they they are operational as we speak and proud to say that some of the uh you know co-panelists and their organization institutions also use that and it is uh so so that is the uh

you know fundamental owning the stack at the application layer and the best part is some of our deployments run on uh you know net hardware which is uh flawless in terms

of the physical layer. So so this is this is so that gives you some confidence how you're owning the uh stack. Uh the other area where we are where we have been contributing is the

R&amp;D that is uh what are the future building blocks of this AI hardware uh puzzle. you know it's it's GPUs uh you start with extreme CPUs GPUs accelerators

uh FPGAs so on the academic side we do a lot of work on the hardware building blocks nuts and bolts of semiconductor IP uh that is neuromorphic computing or brain inspired computing so so that is

something which will probably hit the ground say 5 years from as a product as a product which will hit the ground say 5 years from now or so so these are the again I can go more in details but uh

these are the stack level interventions that we are doing in our &gt;&gt; that clearly describes you know how the India stack is important from your perspective and I think you know one

thing very beautiful here is that just imagine that now the situation for the country is such that on one hand we have the uh you know the solution providers like siren AI solutions we have got the

contributor in in terms of IT Delhi and then we have the users on the other hand the Indian army and then the manufacturers who are manufacturing the systems so this This is called the true

sovereignty that we have got application user and the manufacturers all sitting on the same dis. That is the true sovereignty that is the true achievement of India mission or I would say you know

India summit. So you know definitely we appreciate the efforts of you know government of India honorable PM that we have resulted into this situation. Thank you so much sir. Thank you. Thank you

Colit Mana please. &gt;&gt; Hello. Uh first of all thank you uh Mr. Naven and uh Mr. Reid for inviting me to this panel. Uh as far as sovereign uh India

stack is concerned it can't be more important to the Indian military right. uh I have seen our journey started about uh say about 2 and 1/2 years back as far as the AI absorption uh within the

Indian army was concerned and what we saw was over reliance on you know all the foreign stacks uh whether it LLMs open source LLMs the hardware everything and recent uh you know the skirmish

which we saw opsendur it further you know emphasized the need to absolutely go sovereign right. Uh reason is we are planning to have even the critical aspect of military decision making at

some point in time uh being aided by the AI part not given to AI but aided by the AI. So the commanders with their own cognitive uh you know thought process which they have developed over a period

of time uh the processes the workflows of the military decision making how does AI help it uh help the commander to you know uh fractify whatever he's thinking maybe give a different option give a

different thought process but this can't happen if I'm you know overreiant on some foreign technology or a foreign stack uh military decisions are made uh in the shortest span of time uh the

udaloop has to be faster than the adversary and if we have to do that if someone on whom I'm relying say a foreign technology pulls the carpet under my feet what do I do and where do

I go right so the requirement is that absolutely sovereign stack is the dire need of the Indian army there are some steps which we have started over a period of discussion uh we will have

those uh steps I'll elaborate on that uh we have been working with you like co-panelists like siren and everybody wherein just to give an example simple thing like uh say an application layer

of uh satellite imagery change detection right uh I have seen some models working outside I've gone and visited some foreign militaries also uh they are using their own stack but let me tell

you the terrain there and the terrain here is totally different the objects there and the objects here are totally different what we are looking for from my perspective is not what they are

looking from their p perspective So they are working on or training a model on their own concept of warfare fighting where I have to train it on my own set and once I have to do I have to rely on

absolute sovereign India stack and this is one example where we work very closely with the team from IT from Sang and the model is a functional model today within the Indian military. Uh

thank you we'll discuss more about &gt;&gt; sure thank you thank you for inputs uh Kina. So uh Dr. Sultan if we may have your inputs please. &gt;&gt; Thank you. First of all, thanks to

organizer and uh I great regard thanks to all audience in front of me. Then I thanks to their thoughts. They are the keen to attend this kind of uh sessions. Uh in Hiana we are thinking like in a

different way of that space to citizen stakes all citizen stakes how can we build in the complete sura staging system. to be working on that means every stake of citizens

right from birth to end of the heaven how can we work out that platform we are working on that almost last seven year for that we need to very very high-end computing

infrastructures so we are seeking that way of the understanding and uh hana in terms of area is very small in compared to other estate but using this

such kind of the technology we are working in I can say we are the basically create a oxygen in between citizen and governance so we are the basically media of that on that account

uh we work each and every citizens using this technology probably hana only state every citizens know about the entire satellite

utilization up to partial and pixel level. So that is our basic capacity building at the end user for that this AI summit is a more important probably in across this entire participants hana

is more actively in across the all in morning I'll see that everywhere the hana stakeholder is actively and uh adventurously they are the participate so we can detail out in that's in

continue thank you &gt;&gt; thank you so much sir and I think we definitely appreciate even we all understand that how you know state governments function despite all the

limitations, despite all the restrictions I would say in simple words or in you know frank words you still use the technology especially the AI in such a way that you have implemented those uh

you know uh the the AI framework so that you know you can make the departments like uh script function in the state. Hana space application center has basically you know designed and

delivered such GIS solutions which are even deployed across country we really appreciate and uh I'm I'm sure with the with the questions following we would like to know more about that how it has

been done practically so over to you swastik now &gt;&gt; please your &gt;&gt; yeah so thanks and thanks the esteemed panel members and also uh you know the

the viewers or the the people who are in uh in the um in the room. uh with reference to Netweb uh we have been uh you know in this journey of uh manufacturing

uh high-end uh computing systems for last 25 to 26 years now off with uh with you know a AI and proliferation of AI uh and and that's why the India stack comes into picture wherein you have uh

high-end AI infrastructure which is housing uh different uh you know uh you know chips which are primarily deployed for AI applications and then you have that application tier uh which is

leveraging this underlying platform the investment of the customers to basically take it for a citizencentric services or for the usable business related applications at Neteb we are focusing on

both these aspects the first thing first is that we are one of the seven global manufacturers design manufacturers of NVDA so we have uh servers uh which are uh which are configured with the latest

and greatest uh you GPUs that being manufactured by or that is being offered by uh Nvidia. One of the biggest advantage for us is since we are the design partners, we get to have access

to the uh uh you know systems which are going to be released in the market maybe 6 or 8 months down the line. We have that access you know right now. So we can keep our customers way ahead of the

curve. Uh so when Nvidia or principal launching their product I mean we have our products ready so that customers can leverage the latest and greatest technology much more faster that is that

is one aspect and towards that you know if I have to take certain names like you know we had been having H100 H200 and B200 B300 u and we have all the all the systems ready today and also for the

future right you know there are NVL72 which is going to be a kind of rack scale uh GPU design. But where we have made a difference again the relevance of India AI stack comes into picture

wherein we are creating a differentiated value of the same architecture but making it available for our Indian customers with the Indian usage needs which is NVL4 in a 2U form factor. Two

numbers of processors and eight numbers of B200 GPUs. Basically tells you two things. One is you know we can actually increase the the the the the computing power per rack and the second thing is

that a local innovation can actually keep our customers well ahead and know than any other innovation that are happening. On the other hand from an application perspective we are also

talking about you know some of the solutions that we build and know sir has talked about some of the healthcare solution but one of the perennial problem for India happens to be the

public health system and how do I actually build that. So we have been doing a lot of application development so that I can reduce the time to cure for the for the common Indian citizen.

We can also increase the productivity of the doctors. We can also increase the productivity of the lab workers as well as you know the the radiologists who are doing this. So I think you know from a

network perspective both in terms of the stack which is infrastructure as well as the applications which leverages this underlying benefit is the maximum and and icing on the cake happens to be if

we have to reach the age the age AI. So we are also having our smallest form factor systems that can be deployed at the age which can do an age AI and that can deliver to the rural or the most

remote part of the of the of the country and that is the the the biggest benefit of an inclusive AI bringing those uh you know citizens also within the purview of serving the the go I mean government or

citizencentric services through those platforms as well. So that is the way we are structuring our hardware and software. &gt;&gt; Thanks for that. I think that really you

know defines the definition of India stack and how you know what importance even the hardware carries and what India has achieved on that front. So I mean delving into more uh details I I would

like to start with Dr. Yinatav. Sir, we have been seeing that on the medicinal research side, India has been progressing, you know, uh in in many ways, but for an outsider, you know,

maybe there can be some uh members in the audience who may not be able to understand that how do you basically use the foundation models which is part of India AI stack. still you are able to

basically render such services which are directly helping the citizens that that chain is not understood by the audience even by you know many times despite we being part of the technology world we

also don't understand that how the benefit of those India AI style foundational model is benefiting the you know the patient or the user or the citizen so please please throw some

light on that &gt;&gt; sure I think um Swastik we were outside just chatting and you hit the nail right on head that um u being a very diverse country and and the technical terms that

medicine has. If you just take a model out of the box and essentially try to and we we we we tried doing I mean taking all the foundation models two years ago at that that were available at

that time and we were deploying for the Madhya Pradesh primary healthcare settings in um uh the Sanjivni clinic not the Sanjini but the Sanjivni clinic model right and the use case was very

simple we have a data science-driven model which will basically enable let's say uh the drug stocking the drug stocks not being out of stock So we discovered some incidental very interesting

findings such as the antibiotic overuse etc. But that's another thing. The use case that we were trying to build was not all nurses know how to interact with these kind of models, right? Not all

pharmacists know how to interact with. So can we build a voice interface for this? If you pick up a out ofthe-box model, it won't work in this setting. And that's where I think the India stack

we need customization with all the dialects with all the uh languages and dialects that we have. we need those kind of um uh interfaces to be built along with the application layer that

needs to be built for the models. I think that's just one example where we we have to think as India differently than than just using English or just using Hindi or or or a single language.

We are a very diverse country, right? So that's that's one one side of things. The other thing is that I think there's a lot of scope for as Swasik said about the public health data itself to be

actually collected. Asha workers are the most overused and I think overworked uh segment of the health collection uh I would say layer of uh public health system in India

right perhaps 18 different applications that they have to enter data with a redundant uh data entry in many of these um applications as well and they we have to make their work easier by using AI

right and that's that's not a and that's again where voice-based interfaces come into picture ABDM frameworks works once only data entry mechanisms they come into picture and that has and that's

what we are also contributing in the space of um antimicrobial research um uh working with the government government of Karnataka and PATH and and ICMR and data 1MG to contributing to at least

that one application like the pandemic that's already here is MR how can we actually make that data um layer also strong on that aspect because every country across the globe is actually

entering into a post antimicrobial real world. So those are the kind of challenges which are unique to India but also opportunities which are unique to India to leaprog to to because I don't

see an ABDM like architecture anywhere. We actually make them make that happen and of course voice based interfaces would be a way to go. I think I'll &gt;&gt; maybe maybe you know the India stack

what you were defining for the medicine research maybe the the day may come that this the same model may further be tuned for the respective territories of the other other territories of the world.

&gt;&gt; Absolutely. I think that is how the absolutely on one hand we are talking about sovereign AI stack for the medicinal research helping country. Thereafter we are talking about the same

AI stack getting replicated and tuned for the respective other territories of the world and I think that that defines that how we are progressing on that front and using making use of India

stack. Thank you. Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; So Dr. Man, I mean my my question to you is that you know you have been working on the innovations on the you know nonvolatile memory and the neuromorphic

hardware exploration and all that. I mean it this is something which is very different from a uh I would say a normal user normal citizen perspective because they never get to understand what is

this area and how this is going to use the India stack. Can you please throw some light and let us understand that what are your plans what you have seen in your tenure that this kind of a

hardware innovation can also make use of it please? &gt;&gt; Sure thanks so I'll just try to you know cut aside the jargon and uh make it more translatable. So, so let's let's just

consider one thing, you know, the a typical GPU would consume anywhere around few hundreds of uh watts, right? You you plug in four GPUs in a motherboard and you start talking about

a power supply of 2,000 W with a gold rating, right? That's what we are looking at. &gt;&gt; If you plug in even four GPUs, now consider biological intelligence, right?

Two meals a day, maybe three meals max or sometimes even on one meal and whole day. uh biological intelligence is running multimodal models. &gt;&gt; So the dissipation of biological

intelligence is estimated to be around 20 W. That's human brain or any intelligent organism doesn't dissipate more than 20 watts of power in a day for all the signals that they're processing

whether it is speech, vision or text or whatever. And all of this simultaneously and your GPUs would draw 300, 400 or 2,000 watts for the duration that you run them. So uh neuromorphic

computing uh essentially it hits at the core of uh energy energy dissipation and we have to see even from a usage point of view as AI becomes more and more mainstream as we all start finding more

value in AI as it starts solving our problems the consumption of AI will be much more. So for a billion scale inference or for uh how do you get that how where do you fulfill that energy

requirement from right so the core essence here of uh neuromorphic computing or bioinspired computing is to come at those building blocks which are energy efficient right because if AI has

to succeed uh in the long run then it has to be more energy efficient so that is where the you know uh the core motivation lies &gt;&gt; and how how do you plan to use the India

stack for for that for that part. &gt;&gt; So so again you know India as a civilization as a the ethos of the Indian charter is uh sustainable you know

&gt;&gt; more uh green consumption or getting more output on less resources plus whatever the &gt;&gt; so this is hitting on the you know the fundamental layer of hardware in that

case and you know probably that is where you are starting with you know hitting at the aspect of energy which is ultimately translating to you know uh taking advantage of uh you know maybe

reducing &gt;&gt; new hardware. So I see absolutely we talk about you know AI for all the impact for all. So if this has to really go in a sustained way

&gt;&gt; so it has to be more energy efficient there. &gt;&gt; Do you do you think that this model can you know be directly be helping the citizens of the country someday or it

has already reached that stage &gt;&gt; the way you are trying to transform? Think think about it in the sense how traditional compute or electronics industry has evolved right we we

initially there was functionality then there came the concept of threestar uh electronics fourstar electronics or carbon emissions or you know you take air conditioners which don't have a

emission of of a certain point so I think AI will also go through that cycle where your building blocks will become more will have to become more and more energy efficient the hardware building

blocks will have to become more and more energy efficient and that will feed back to the wider audience or wider you know citizens in in in general that that will make AI sustain

&gt;&gt; interesting interesting that that's very interesting actually that how the low energy stack which you can infuse at the maybe edge level which may definitely leave an impact on the lives of you know

billions of citizens and I think uh this is something we can see arriving very soon in the market also even maybe if this is that conceptualized stage at this stage but I think this can see the

reality very soon if if I may be uh if I'm right yeah &gt;&gt; absolutely so a lot of these concepts they have crossed the prototyping stage now it's just a matter of mass uh

&gt;&gt; understood &gt;&gt; production or mass industrial adoption but they have certainly crossed the prototyping uh stage &gt;&gt; interesting so I I go back to klmit mana

so kl I think uh there is absolutely no doubt that sovereign AI India stack as you rightly explained in the initial uh you know inputs also that that plays a very important role but now the

question is that do you think that this is absolutely non-negotiable although you have explained if you talk about developing models you need definitely something curated for army you need

hardware definitely that has to deal with the problem of you know infiltration or intrusion happening at the hardware level. So please please throw some light that is this

non-negotiable for you that India AI stack has to exist and there has to proliferate. Okay. So uh before I delve into the answer proper uh let me just uh bring about what we are looking at right

uh I have trained a open-source LLM right for any kind of decision making a simple tool like uh say I am asking a small VLM uh what is that you see in this you know image

the VLM or the LLM has been trained on some data set I do not know what when the critical time comes and I have you know fine-tuned this LLM uh for my specific need within the military

at the critical juncture what kind of biases hallucinations it can inject into my military decision-m and military decision-m is very critical because it involves you know a person dying or

living and there are humongous uh collateral damage which can be also inflicted if a wrong decision is taken. So therefore I don't want to leave even a iota of chance on a open-source LLM

which is fine-tuned or tuned by us for a critical decision making within the military. So how do I subvert that or how do I you know overcome this. So what we have started is uh we are training as

we speak today a military LLM to start with a small uh uh 10 billion parameter model uh within few months you'll hear the news that uh the first military LLM of India is you know onboarded which has

been from the scratch made on by the team within uh the Indian army trained on the military data set absolute military data set which we have trained on so that there are no biases there are

no hallucinations there nothing and this is the journey which we wish to take from 10 to 50 to 70 to 100 as we go deep dive into how do we want this LLM to function with a deep reasoning what you

see 253 uh billion parameter neatron models and all I'm looking at such journey and this is the journey which we intend to take now coming as far as the infra is concerned right uh uh you are

aware we have taken the GPUs the H200's the H00s now people are going for B200s B300s and this complete infra is coming up in you know various locations within the within the military within the navy

within the air force now but finally the dependency is still on the hardware you know I do not know what bug is there today I do not know &gt;&gt; that's right

&gt;&gt; uh so what is the option now so the option is I'm now looking at you know obviating the requirement of GPU altogether. Let's see. This is a problem statement which we have given to

the environment and this is a problem statement for all of us uh in the audience too. Uh what I'm looking now is I'm not directly jumping to the LLM. I'm saying let me make small SLMs first,

right? And there are some uh you know teams and some startups and some industry who have shown some kind of promise in uh training a SLM on a CPU instead of a GPU.

inferencing on a CPU. So CPUs are still you know although they are foreign make but still you know the the journey of the CPU has been long enough and therefore I can still rely on

the Indian players or the make in India thing. So let me see can I join these SLMs to make a multi- agentic platform train different SLMs on requirements specific to the army and give an answer

which the LLM is uh designed to give. So my journey starts from there. So this is an open statement which we have you know given a challenge to to the environment and let's try and see you know how far

we can remove the requirement of a GPU all together. The third most important facet for us is also what we some of the co-panelists touched upon is a sovereign capability

at the edge right so there are requirements which are met by central resourcing of these GPUs today uh say at Delhi or say at wherever we have the uh networks uh so I place that central

resource I train those models I place those models on the central resource but at the same time I'm looking at the AI capability at the edge and the edge is what you talked about you know small

boxes so which have got VLMs which have got uh you know agentic vsss which have got yolo models for object identification and therefore I want to obate the requirement of you know

sending this complete video stream back to the central resource choke my bandwidth and do the analysis there at the edge and finish the task give the analysis to the commanders who are

looking at it. So this is our journey which we have started uh and as as I told before also we are opening out in a major big way to the industry to the academia to the startup the complete

ecosystem. We have established a stall here uh at hall number four. We are showcasing what are the dual use technologies which the military is using today and how could it can benefit in

the civil industry and vice versa. Obviously we have to you know learn and take from each other how how do we get these technologies into the decision making as such. So this is where our

journey is and I'm sure you know there are ideas a floor in this complete floor and the complete bat bat mandapam uh once the voice reaches that what is the Indian army looking at how do you join

this into our journey to you know make it absolutely sovereign network has taken the lead and let's see how others uh join our training thank you &gt;&gt; that's very interesting to know in fact

this is for uh you know for the knowledge of our audience also so what konel mana has talked about is that army has worked on if if you please correct me if you find me wrong somewhere has

worked on all the layers as of now first is the paramount important thing was that they wanted to develop their own uh LLM and I'm sure that adoption of AI does not limit to the level of LLM or

creating SLMs or VMs I'm sure about it this is a good way and seeing I mean seeing that how enterprising our army has become that now they have you know put out their uh booth out uh talking

about their product. This is the progress. This is what we talk about what India AI has achieved and let let us have a you know round of applause for our army as well because we all

understand you know they work under so restrictions there are many limitations still they are they they have reached to this level that is very you know tremendous and on top of it he's clearly

talking about that there is no negotiation possible across all the layers be hardware beat you know the uh you know LLMs or SLMs or even the adoption of AI at the edge level there

is no negotiation possible at all. So that is something you know which is very interesting and I think this clearly uh reflects the efforts of army which have gone into it. Moving on to Dr. Sultan.

Dr. Sultan I I have been you know I've been fortunate enough to know about your work in the past and uh do you think because in your case geospatial data has been used in many forms. I mean frankly

speaking I have been knowing that you use the same for you know studying the crop yield you know serving the data to the ministries and thereafter you know you

also understand that whether there is a land which is unutilized whether they there can be you know change in crop which can take place. So all that work is going on that is just one aspect of

agriculture and you have been dealing with you know mapping the entire city mapping the canals mapping the rivers everything has been done by us. When did you realize that India AI stack or your

sovereign AI stack is important for you because there is something important that you might be having some readymate software available but was it important to you know gohead in that direction and

build India stack for that purpose? Yeah, this is a different kind of way I can understand. Initially for understanding we need to existing any oper operational

established software any technologies there. First we operate that since 2006 on 17 or 18 then we come out that our actual requirement like Colonel Ni has already expressed key how we come out

this Indian system. Then we realize we need our own way of that. In Indian ecosystem each and every citizen their own thought, own will and own commitment on their own way of the understanding.

So I can say every 11 kilometer in geographical area everything is a change. So the variety of that understanding no one is international any software is understand Indian

ecosystem. So this is a more important we only only solution is Indian AI system I can say within the India is a multiple India &gt;&gt; true

&gt;&gt; that's so true so for that way we realize in hana in hana we also classified as per the agricological John topographical John thought of the citizens we understand how dialogue that

they understand so on that way we understand this only is so system is served our purpose initially I can say being a academic I can understand the entire ecosystem the

all academia activity so that is a basic limitation without in India Indian so we can't process that &gt;&gt; no one is any international even then

operating system existing in there they are not able to serve the our actual delivery Because our individual within a family if it is a five five person is every have their own understanding.

&gt;&gt; So how we integrate and how we create the all LLM and all system. &gt;&gt; So that is a basic limitation that solution is there &gt;&gt; with the help of geospaceial.

Geospaceial is nothing each and every pixel of the location we need to integrate. &gt;&gt; You need to map &gt;&gt; with the map. Map is one to many many to

one integrations. So I can say in terms of consumption of this high and partial image in coming time I can say as I understand one citizen use the

almost 2.4 four TB data sets one single citizens. &gt;&gt; So that is we understand how can manage that way. &gt;&gt; So for that we need a highend

computing in analytic way. &gt;&gt; So every citizen is very fast &gt;&gt; thought is so fast. How can we work on that? So that is a basic our approach but we are mainly

work on the citizen centric governance. So every citizen stake we can make in this system and we have a lot of things is there and anybody can audience can visit our one

of the stall is there all number four and then we are open for the all academy and all R&amp;D. Very very interesting actually you know the way they have made use of geospatial data and further

rendering services to the different ministries in the within the state that is something which is very commendable and I and again you know state governments function in a very different

way priorities are very different you know functioning in a central government environment is so different than functioning in a state government environment and really appreciate your

your efforts on that front. So swastik I I come back to you and uh would would like to understand that uh uh what is the current status of readiness of hardware to achieve India AI stack

capability or to achieve India stack sovereignity? &gt;&gt; Is data center to edge readiness there already? Yes, absolutely. Absolutely. And and Netweb is actually uh in a front

runner for uh for this kind of deployment as Scondar has also mentioned right there are age AI applications which are on the rise and having a kind of age deployment. We already have

launched our age uh server or age deployment with AI and and then how do I actually connect back to the data center and there is an application stack which will basically work beautifully which is

called you know um a kind of H to the core connect uh connectivity so that it is called speculative decoding. So we have applications using that so that you know the local inferencing can be done

there. In case of any bigger thing is there it will basically forward it to the bigger model which is running out of the data center. So with reference to the data center we have we are readiness

with NVL4 which which is going to be you know a kind of four GPUs in a liquid cooled machine and you can have uh you know at least 21 numbers of the servers considering power is there. So that is

NVL4 is what we have launched. uh we would in invite all of you to come to the hall number four with a net booth where we are showing not just the server but also all the individual cards that

are actually bringing that server all of them are being manufactured here in our faridawad factory. So so that is one along with that we have B200 and B300 both liquid cooled and air cooled

systems are positioned there. We also have the latest generation of H200 uh based know PCI based servers that are also being there. So we are cutting across that entire spectrum of the

hardware required for us to be more impactful addressing the India AI uh uh stack that we are talking about and sir was basically mentioning about you know CPU based inferencing. Yes, we have

capability to run even the CPU based inferencing on the SLMs and we can cluster multiple number of CPU servers put together to create a distributed inferencing cluster. So that is also

possible for us. So I think from a hardware and application perspective we are there which can help us build more capabilities using this India AI stack. &gt;&gt; Nice. This is very important. And I

think uh this is for the consumption of audience also that what we have talked about is that on one hand there are four different verticals who are progressing on the India stack. There's a vertical

you know uh related to healthcare medicinal research. Second vertical which is dealing with the cyber security you know the uh low power AIcentric edge devices. Third vertical which is

directly related to the army. Army themselves are behaving now as an enterprise and you know started building their own solutions. On the other hand then we have got state government

departments also who are now you know not shying away from building their own sovereign and AI stack. So I think that beautifully exemplifies that how India is progressing on that front and at the

same time to empower these divisions, empower these verticals, the hardware which was required to be manufactured in the country is what swastik has talked about is now getting manufactured in

India itself. And important part is the same was not the situation. I would say 2015 2016 before 2015 2016 and I think now we have arrived an era where we are talking about producing world's most

powerful GPU platforms what he talked about that is NVL4 with pro which probably houses 80 GPUs in a single rack absolutely cooling &gt;&gt; which takes care of your training

happening at the data center at the same time we are taking care of the AI happening at the edge level also &gt;&gt; what Colonel Mana clearly talked about that we just now we want this AI

adoption to take place in such a way that the user sitting probably at the at the you know the uh I would say the border touching the botting nation there also we want AI to leave an impact for

that uh you know army man to see how it can basically help the user to take an advantage of quick decisions maybe you know looking at what is there in your stock in infantry or maybe if we talk

about the asha worker who is working day in day out and the asha worker is not basically aware of that what is the medicine stock I have how the you know different type of treatments may be

required to be given to different patients that is what you know you know this uh uh AI stack or sovereign AI stack is going to embody uh the character of that application likewise

what uh you know Dr. Man talked about that how basically cyber security related or the low power AI edge devices can be designed now in the country and at the same time how GIS applications

can leave an impact. So this is something which is clearly showcasing and progress you know showing the impact I would say the India AI has uh done on the overall industry. So now the I mean

in the interest of time I would I would uh like to hear from audience also that what are your uh please let us know that what are the curiosities you have in your mind in terms of understanding that

how healthcare is behaving how healthcare is basically catching up with the EI speed or you know the uh Indian army if there are any questions please I mean you are welcome to ask please

&gt;&gt; uh there's another concept of federated learning models &gt;&gt; okay &gt;&gt; are we experimenting on that also we have some individuals

placed right then we transfer that learning from there to the hospital &gt;&gt; so Dr. if you can &gt;&gt; yeah in the healthcare space that's very

very important I think it's something that we are also doing with between tertiary care hospitals like as and max because obviously data exchange is not so easy but also with even between

different as that we just signed an MU with CADC where several as who subscribe to the same uh sort of the HMIS model how do we make models move um and believe it or not I mean every single

setting has a different kind of challenge um so So federated AI is definitely one of the things which is super important for um uh healthcare especially in the current DPP scenario

as well. So we want these models to be sovereign at the local setting as well and I think u sir mentioned about even at the sir mentioned about even at the citizen level right giving sovereignty

ultimately the control of the data patient data to the person that's what ABDM is about so thank you &gt;&gt; great I think that yeah next question please yeah

my question on what are the top metrics how do you decide that uh the deploying uh will work on the how do you how do you decide &gt;&gt; it's not easy to explain here in this

audience right and there are a lot of things which I can't speak also uh uh but uh suffice to say that the agent platforms which we are talking about today uh there are a huge bouet of you

know these agentic platforms all across whether lang chains screw whatever you talk about the most important facet is how do I tweak this platform to the army needs right and we have very specific

use cases they they are not generic use cases you know enterprise type uh what you use in banking or any other industry for that matter for that you will need a very specific data set which we will

give we will define sitting with the you know the developer uh domain expertise which you will require because uh we have seen in this journey of two years the most uh difficult difficult part is

you know transfer transferring my domain knowledge to you know you can work in a banking sector within a month but you will take at least 6 months to work with me because you'll not be able to

understand the requirements which are very very peculiar to uh the decision- making in the army as such so that uh I can't go into more details you can have one-on-one with me whenever you wish to

uh but these metrics are defined with us what we are looking is defined with us uh very soon we are also you know uh opening out to the industry and uh there is something in the offing which we we

can have oneonone &gt;&gt; so this is this is interesting and I think Dr. Man, if you can also throw some light on this. I understand you know uh Colonel Mana has to basically

you know he wants to limit himself in terms of you know sharing data in such public forum but since you are also dealing with you know uh with such problems how do you see I mean the

question he asked and uh do you think that you also design these cyber solutions which are using you know AI models and all. How do you decide? Do you you know invest time or uh you know

to see that how whether it is impactful or not because this is something uh this is a very closed domain and there is no data available as such deciding what is going to work, what is not going to

work. How do you basically work in you know what what is your strategy in that case? &gt;&gt; Yeah. So there is a very systematic process to it. You know the very first

thing that you need to achieve is the functionality right first to get the functional something functional doing the job. uh that you desire and once the functionality is achieved then we go on

to the metrics you know whether it is so uh you know it can be any metric whether it is accuracy whether it is latency precision recall so th those are that is the typical

direction now edge edge and data sensitivity again brings uh more unique uh aspects to it they're different compared to enterprise you know for enterprise the evaluation

is more uh standard for for edge when you have data sensitivity involved. So sometimes you let go of the you know the standard metrics &gt;&gt; and many times what we have seen in

these new use cases you have to deise your own metric depending on the use case because &gt;&gt; you may be chasing an industry metric you may achieve a very good uh score on

that metric but at the end you realize that it has no equivalence or no correlation to your uh use case. So uh we have been in most at least in our work we have more often we have been in

a situation where the industry standard metric gives is of no use like we we have to devise a new metric for that &gt;&gt; this has to be absolutely curated you know based on you know whatever

observations your system receives and all &gt;&gt; yeah and fortunately unfortunately after certain time we say AI is automation but it becomes more human because then you

are literally conversing with the user that Does this help you? You may have a very high precision. You may have a very high uh accuracy or a very low latency. But if it doesn't meet the expectation

of the uh you know the human at the other end uh so so that is the you know the ironical part of I I'm throwing open I'm undoing the whole panel when we are arriving at the end.

&gt;&gt; Correct. I I understand &gt;&gt; but uh I I hope you get what I'm saying. &gt;&gt; I get I get a point. Any any more questions please? &gt;&gt; Yeah please. Yeah.

So my question is actually from a very different industry. I come from the agriculture industry &gt;&gt; and you know I would like to ask Dr. Manpecially that do you at some point of

time see that you know the farmers will be using AI to you know understand what are the in or even as you say I mean you're talking about the healthare industry will they

be able to understand what is the that their crop has what is the stage of infestation because it's a very very it's a massive area that we're talking about and once they get used to this I

think a lot of problem in the farming community will be &gt;&gt; I get a point so basically you want to say that how by when the practical usage of AI in the space of agriculture can be

seen by us &gt;&gt; farmers not by the corporate &gt;&gt; I I get a point yes basically the end user &gt;&gt; yeah so the theoretical ical answer to

your question is that yes there are solutions there are problems also and there are solutions which are in agriculture which are being solved very well by AI you know the if you look into

the domain of precision agriculture and we also have other space scientists here you know the hyperspectral data or any space data is being used very aggressively to monitor the aging of the

crops or the nutrition value of the crops now whether the farmer gets to use it it's more of a economic question that uh at what cost at what infra cost the solution is delivered. So there might be

entities there might be you know public uh there might be entities which can afford and obtain that solution but uh whether the whether the last mile farmer how they

&gt;&gt; economics plays a role there. Yes, I can extend on that. Uh basically farmer in our state right from we can say seed to seed we monitor. &gt;&gt; I see

&gt;&gt; right from the day a moment you are seedling in the your soil with the particular moisture to finally I can say up to bite also we are working on that also. Today you buy

some uh food, I can track that also. But right now in our state we are monitoring right from sewing to till harvesting each and every parcel of the land up to or I can

less than one acre then growth pattern of that particular plant. If it is any stress due to any environment conditions, due to irrigation stress, any other any fertilizer in that

everything we use that daily satellite imaging every day we are using &gt;&gt; talking about satellite imagery &gt;&gt; but but that's how come come out that that is available data is available

depends upon which satellite data which sensor We apply either optical, either microwave, either SAR, either thermal and many of the weather related. It is a

combination. We predict the yield before the harvesting. How much yield is particular even than 10 by 10 m area of the that so that is there and then entire system is used by the farmer.

So I think the the information thereafter takes place in their in their you know the state department scenario because whatever data they capture that they disseminate

the information to the respective department they issue the directives to the farmers or they you know guide them with some recommendations. That's how the practical usage may take place. For

now your question is quite valid. the practical usage the farmers himself should be himself should be capable of capturing the data on his own and make use of it I'm sure I think the day is

not &gt;&gt; these are very simple stubble burning is one of the chronic problem in this NCR region I &gt;&gt; I would request the participants to ask

the question outside because other speakers are in the queue we would present a goodies to all the speakers thanks for coming &gt;&gt; sure sure thank you in the interest of

time we'll have to wrap this up discussion it'll pass thank you so much thank you so much the panel &gt;&gt; yeah yeah yeah May I request the dignitaries to please

join on stage? Mr. Sanjay Kumar Agarwal, Mr. Simon Torson Bibush, Miss Elizabeth for Dr. Loki Mukaji, Mr. Anan Chandra, Mr. Mole Bansali and Mr. Matur.

&gt;&gt; Okay. Uh may I request for a group photograph first uh for the dignies? &gt;&gt; Thank you. So uh we start with the session. Uh good evening distinguished guests, esteemed panelists and

participants. On behalf of Viki, it's my privilege to warmly welcome you to this important session from policy to harvest leveraging generative AI for datadriven agriculture transformation.

Being organized as part of the AI summit 2026, Indian agriculture stands at a pivotal juncture as we work towards enhancing farmer incomes, strengthening climate resilience, and ensuring food

and nutritional security for a growing population. The emphasis must increasingly move beyond policy intent to implementation excellence and measurable impact on the ground. In this

transformation journey, digital innovation, particularly generative AI offers unprecedented possibilities. From precision farming and predictive crop analytics to climate risk modeling,

personalized advisories and smarter supply chains, AI has the potential to reshape agriculture into a more datadriven, efficient and farmercentric The key question before us today is how

we can responsibly and effectively integrate these technologies within India's evolving digital agriculture architecture to create scalable and inclusive outcomes.

We are deeply honored to have with us Shri Sanjay Kumar Agarwal joint secretary department of agriculture and farmer welfare government of India whose guidance and leadership have

significantly contributed to advancing digital reforms and innovation in the agriculture sector. We are also privileged to be joined by eminent panel representing government global

institution industry technology and agri entrepreneurship. Mr. Simon Torson Vibush Chairman Fiki Committee on Crop Protection and CEO Bearcrop Science Limited and Country Division Head Crop

Science Division of Bearov for India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. Miss Elizabeth for representative and country director World Food Program India. Dr. Alogi Mukhaji, director research analytics and

modeling leads connect service private limited and chief system scientist AI programs BL Agro Industries Limited. Mr. Mr. Ananch Chandra co-founder executive director Arya EG Mr. Mo Bansali chief

executive officer Neteb software to share this important dialogue we have with us Mr. Mendra Matur Chairman Fiki Task Force on agric startups and venture partner Bharat Innovation Fund who will

be moderating the session. With these words, I once again extend a warm welcome to all the distinguished speakers and participants and I now request Shri Sanjay Kumar Agarwal to

kindly deliver the special address. Thereafter, Mr. Mendra Matur will take the decision discussion forward. Thank you very much. Uh good evening everyone.

First of all, I would like to thank Fiki for organizing this seminar for discussing a very important topic agriculture and AI. When we are thinking AI,

how can we forget agriculture transformation through AI? Earlier whenever we used to think about agriculture, the image in our mind comes with a poor

farmer. using the old technology, using the hen bale. But now things are changing. Now we have educated farmers,

we have progressive farmers and farmers who are using technology as an essential tools for agriculture and AI is moving towards agriculture sector.

Today government of India has launched Bhart Vistar a AIdriven module to enrich every farmer to reach every

farmer because without farmers if technologies are not reaching to the farmer. It is very difficult to increase the production it is very

difficult increase the quality. There are many challenges before the agriculture sector and low use of technology is major challenge before all of us.

Farmers are not getting good market. Farmers are not getting good prices. Farmers don't know what is the market demand. Farmers have any very few knowledge

where their demand can get their produce can get better prices. They don't know the right advisory. They don't know from where the seed will

come and where they can sell the produce. There are many questions which are remains unanswered and because of that farmers are compelled to sell their

products at lower prices. They grow what is not needed in the market and ultimately farmers become a matter of concern for everyone. Now young farmers are coming. The youth

role in farmers, the young farmers are coming. They are coming with a vision to enrich farming. They are trying, they are using many technology. They are not satisfied what their father

used to grow. They want something new. And that technology is making lots of changes. Earlier they wanted advisory. It was

difficult to get advisory. Now every mobile is having some chatbot and they are getting advised. Earlier farmers used to have some grievances where they should go.

Now at the click they can lodge their complaint and they get can get the answers. And today what our bat wistar chatbot bharti

is going to solve many such problems and we are going to use in different languages. Language is was a major barrier for all of us. Our farmers they

don't understand many farmers they don't understand Hindi also they want to chat in local dialogue local dialect and our chatbot is being used for different languages and later on we are going to

use all the languages of our country. Farmers need is second is they want weather advisories. Weather is uncertain and again a major challenge for our farmers. Now all types

of weather advisories, weather forecast are easily available and accessible. They are more accurate than earlier because of many AI technologies are being used.

The market prices earlier what is market prices? It was difficult to know. Now all the mundies all the markets are integrated with one system. You want market price of Berelli, you want market

of price of Chennai at a click you can transportation was a major issue. Now transportation is there. Agriculture mechanization again a challenge before all of us that

our farmers are using very less technology and mechanization. Now young farmers and the progressive farmers are using it extensively and with use of AI they are doing irrigation

they are doing use of fertilizer they are taking use of pesticides and all based on AI now storage cold storage warehousing

these are also these were also problem areas for us. Now with the help of various private partners, credit, warehousing, logistic

is also made accessible to farmers. Now any farmer wants that he wants to store his food grain. Earlier he used to sell at throwaway prices. Now he can take decision that I am not

going to sell it right now. I will keep it but I need some money. So now financing is also available through So it's a complete ecosystem is coming and that ecosystem is working in such a

way that ultimately farmer will benefit and the consumer will also benefit. Now we have a challenge that our farmers are aging. The average age of farmer is more than

50 years. Young students who are who wants to become some uh to do some career they don't want to come in agriculture sector through AI through technology we can

bring that those talent in agriculture sector also because unless they will come the more progressive farming more remmonerative farming more export

oriented farming more diversified farming will not be possible. We want to diversify our sectors. We want to come out from patty and wheat

culture. Many things we are importing. We want to be self-sufficient. We don't know where is the deficit and where the production is. Now through

various decision supporting system in agriculture ministry agree stake we are doing digital crop survey and all these data are coming agree course and in future this agree course will

provide data to everyone. We have a great database and we are accumulating that database and we are creating that database for better use of AI. Now many AI tools are giving

advisories but they don't have sufficient data to support that advisory to validate that advisory. Now in agriculture sector sector we will

not have d of data in future through PMISAN scheme. We are giving at least around 10 10 crores of farmer every month some pension some incentive and that data is

coming into our system. If any farmer is having any problem they can go to chatbot and they can ask any question and AI is answering their problems. Why my installment has not come? Why why

my payment is delayed? So just I want to summarize that agriculture sector is not very far from AI and if you want to develop this sector

more we have to use AI extensively and various private partners are helping in this regard we alone can't work and we need support from all the private stakeholders who are working

in this sector and I hope to together we will achieve the aim to make agriculture are more vibrant. Thank you very much. Um, thanks Sanjay G for a very insightful address. Uh, good evening

everyone. I know it is the last session of the day. Um, but we'll try to make it interesting. Good to see a full house and especially a lot of young minds sitting in the room. Um, so very very

delighted to be part of this gathering. Thanks Vicki for organizing this uh wonderful session and um the topic that we have today how AI can transform um and I'm really blessed to have a

fantastic set of panelist with representation from policy makers and industry software providers uh and and bunch of startups. So I think this is going to be

very interesting. So before I get into question and answer just couple of minutes to set the context for the panel u as I always said agriculture is is heaven for data scientists not just

because it is a large part of our agree and food economy but also because of the gigabytes and terabytes of data that we generate almost every second from 160 million hectares of farmland and 150

million farms um 14 aclimatic zones different types of soils with 7,000 mundes and you can go on and on. So I think we are sitting on a repository of data uh which is which is quite

spectacular and I don't think any of the big AI giants have really scrabbed it. You know they've scrapped whatever whatever is available on the web but what about the data which is lying

within our universities in a weather stations and things like that and and that's where it becomes far more interesting and the volatility of the data and the variability of data. It can

hurt to go up the best of the data scientist you know in terms of how to model such various data points how to triangulate it and how to make sense out of it but yeah we all believe that it

has a huge power AI has a huge power to solve for challenges that we see in the country in terms of especially farmers access to markets price um soil testing uh pest detection u you know bio

discovery and all that so that's where I think we're going to discuss some of there's opportunities that are there on the hand and how do we scale some of these use cases and how industry and

policy makers can play a very critical role in enabling use of AI to solve for challenges that we see in the country. Uh so with that context I'll start the discussion probably Elizabeth if I can

start with you that's okay. Okay. So Elizabeth represent world food program that we all are aware of. Uh Elizabeth, I would like you to talk about how AI can help especially in the post-h

harvest value chain. I'm sure most of the audience will be aware that we waste almost onethird of the food that we produce um both in volume and value terms. Uh and that needs a lot of

attention and that's where we need technology. Okay. So, Elizabeth, if you can share your thoughts on how do we use AI to make to drive food security to drive nutritional security at scale.

&gt;&gt; Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; Can you hear me? &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes, you are. &gt;&gt; Good. Well, thank you Vicki for organizing this dialogue. Let me first

of all I want to just situate this in a broader context. At the World Food Program, we are particularly concerned about um the food crisis that are currently happening around the world.

When we think about AI and technology, we're thinking very much about how can we um how can we use these technologies to uh address global hunger and I just wanted to share a few overarching

figures with you because um it's quite staggering and and I think it's important for our awareness. Um you know global hunger is at an unprecedented level globally. um 318 million people

are facing crisis level um hunger and and it's really uh very much concentrated in a um handful of countries where we see particular um acute need for example in in in Gaza in

parts of Sudan, Afghanistan, Yemen, Haiti um the Sahel, the Horn of Africa and at the World Food Program we have launched a new AI I strategy. We're the only um the first uh UN agency to have

done that so far. And it's very much around how do we use data for predicting um crisis for anal analyzing also where when a disaster hits um you know where are the hungry poor where what kind of

situation they find themselves in. So very much around um around early warning systems um but also for targeting our programs um and finding you know data to make the right decisions at the right

time that's at the global level um and just to highlight a couple of tools that we have one is called a hunger map live u and it's it's very much um you know it's based on satellite data you can see

where people are facing food and nutrition insecurity around the world um in pra p practically real time and that enables um us and partners and governments to be

able to address that. Um I haven't answered your point about post-h harvest losses in India. The cornerstone of WFP's partnership with the government of India is very much around strengthening

the food um the food systems the the uh the big uh public distribution system that is the largest uh safety net in the world food safety net in the world and of course so much grain is moved every

single day as part of this um public distribution system and world food program has worked on streamlining these um these supply chains. For example, through root optimiz optimization,

optimizing the routes that go from the farmers to the warehouses to the you know 600 um thousand plus fair price shops um so that people can get their entitlements.

um also smart warehouse solutions with sensors to reduce the posth harvest losses um within warehouses at all the different levels um and I just launched um an exhibition just now where we were

showcasing these solutions. One is for example very new one is a robot an autonomous mobile robot that circulates around the warehouses and that can provide alerts when the spoilage is

happening or where there might be other uh you know pests rodents and so on and so forth. So we're trying to work very much with the government to bring these technologies and these innovations um to

improve the quality I would say of the of the food but the quality of these safety nets that is designed for the most vulnerable people which is really the the lens through which the world

food program is viewing all of this may be quite different from some of the other panelists here. &gt;&gt; That's great. I think WFP coming up with proprietary a tools

and taking a lead on it is is is very enlightening to um learn about. Uh with that coming you to Simon. Simon is a veteran from a from the crop protection industry.

He knows India probably than more Indians know. Uh so so Simon the question to you you know of course I think agree inputs is a large industry and the multiple possible

use cases of how AI can be used especially developing new molecules and R&amp;D and of course farmer advisory I think Sanjay also talked about that so can you throw some light on you know how

we can use technology AI uh to drive some of these innovation on the agree input side &gt;&gt; yeah be happy to do that thank you Hant and Um Sanjay G um I really appreciate

what you said in terms of saying government and private need to work together here because going back to how he opened up the complexity of Indian agriculture actually has been waiting

for something like AI and when you look at the atomization of land ownership the small hold of farmers that we have in the country we have struggled for decades to try to really help them to

advance because often we wouldn't understand their own fields. Yeah, the interaction points were not often enough. Let me let me try to give you a very concrete example and move a little

bit away from just making better chemicals, right? But um imagine all of us, right? We we go to UP in our minds. We go to UP and think of a

FPO that has give it 200 farmers, 200 hectars of direct seated rice. Right now imagine we've been watching these fields with satellites. We know more or

less what was temperatures over the last couple of of months since growing season. We've been looking at moisture in the fields and we actually have this FBO together with a better life farming

center a buyer which has let's call them five or six drone dies government program right where in the mornings they would fly drones just to for surveillance reasons and look at those

200 plots and identify in each individual plot whether it needs fertilization whether because of the weather data we're trying to We could already see there's risk of diseases

coming in, potentially pest migration being seen. And then you start applying what needs to be applied. You apply fertilizer where the field might need some fertilizer. You apply pesticides

where you need maybe just in the vicinities and not on every single field because you can predict that if you kill the pests on the sides, they're not going to go to the other fields. Each

individual farmer on their apps on the farmrise app will know what is the interventions which is happening in their fields and can potentially also say whether they want it or not right

a trace is built on what exactly happened on that field for this batch of rice and then you have somebody like I don't know whether in the room fortune buying that rice off of the FPO and

exporting that rice to a UK supermarket where This UK supermarket knows exactly what has happened to this rice. Now, this rice has been grown with low water input. It's not patty. It's direct

seedated. It has not emitted as much methane and the farmer will probably get a better price because it goes into export and there is a trail of evidence that

this is sustainably grown rice. Now if we get things right, you'll even have the cherry on the cake and the government will have a carbon trading system in place where he gets carbon

credits for have growing that rice. All that is only possible for 200 fields with AI. Now imagine this around the country on maybe 20 million hectares, right? I mean this is probably the

biggest of wishes one could have. But only AI makes something like that thinkable. &gt;&gt; Fantastic. No, thanks for sharing that example. So it's um very inspiring. I

hope it percolates to different parts of the country and we get few million hectares under under this kind of surveillance. Yeah. So that's represents two organization BRO which is

a large agri business and leads connect which is a startup within B agro and has done phenomenal work on developing some interesting tech tools. Look, the big question is of course AI is great and

it's it's doing lot of good for everyone. The big question is uh is AI making money? You know what are the use cases where you see an ROI coming especially for someone like you who's

already using it at scale. Good evening. Uh I hope I'm audible. Uh namaste and good evening everyone. Uh this Aluk Mukharji and uh firstly thank you so much Viki for uh giving uh this

opportunity to share our thoughts on this very important uh topic. Uh yes sir. Uh my answer would be yes uh with some challenges. But before I go into the details uh I would like to share our

experience in this regard. Uh we have been uh working uh on agriculture. we are we we are uh an N analytics organization with core focus on agriculture and climate extensions. So

when we started this journey so I just want to give a kind of some pointers and then with this curve we will understand that what is the reach and what kind of developments happened actually in the

context of application of AI in agriculture and and and the business aspects also and the interventions also when we started we worked with governments also the private sectors

also foundations also we have been working currently it started with one district currently standing at 155 districts across India uh for different uh things when we started it started

with the ill dynamics modeling project and all and then in this regard when we talking about ROI and all in this journey we saw and delivered and we got opportunity the market the entire

ecosystem opened up and especially in last five six years we have seen this uh very it's kind of a huge transition so what happened today we see the AI the use of application of AI uh

kind of in the uh smart irrigations, the precision farming uh the dynamics. We see the application of AI and the solutions uh developed and driven by AI on the forecast dynamics in

the context of productivity dynamics the crop mapping and one more thing in the opening remarks sir mentioned one very important thing that like uh the farmers the way they were cultivating now it

means a kind of a change is required and all now we see and we have been working with the value chain because we we we come from the entire value chain 360°ree implementation of value chain so now we

see a huge implementation of AI in the dimension of in the context of value chain dynamics identifying new value chains. Recently I would like to say that uh we did one kind of pilot tested

in Uttar Pradesh only and there we implemented this uh the uh our propriety algorithms and frameworks to understand that the current cultivation pattern if it can be changed and at least 20 to 30%

other crop can come into the picture. So it just doesn't increase the income of farmers plus it takes care of the ecological dynamics also. So if you see now where does AI stand in the context

of agricultural dynamics. So it is in the precision farming it is in the productivity dynamics not just post harvest it's a pre-h harvest analysis entire entire the value ch spectrum and

the market linkage and the price forecasting side also. So the entire uh the entire dimension is now opened up uh through this one. And one more very important thing that uh since these

options are uh coming and uh and one more thing in the context of this one why why this is encouraging now if I have some kind of chat boards okay fine we will keep building we'll keep we'll

make our advisory advisory engines more robust and all more parameters more stacks will come into the picture but what happens now we are uh lesser dependent on a very kind of a asset

heavy infrastructures and plus then we see one I I would like to share one use case I will not go into the details I'll not take much time we are working with some of the apps in his uh in Hiana

there we were supposed to take care of the soil dynamics also in the context of forecast and there's a huge demand of soil sensors now I want to give one example for one district if I have to go

with 100 sensors instead of that if I have some kind of proprietary algorithm or frameworks AIdriven if it can help us to reduce this 100 number of 100 to like 10 20 and this one then cascading anal

can be taken into the picture. It helps both sides for scaling also in the context of finance also the the costing requirement and the fast deployment of this one. So sir my answer would be yes

that uh the situation has been very increasing because uh day by day we have we we have witnessed that the use cases are increasing and the penetration of AI right now it's it's no more kind of

alien thing on the ground also sir thank &gt;&gt; thanks no that thanks for that positive remark an coming uh coming to you um I don't know I'm sure a lot of people will know area is one of the largest

aggregator of grains in the country uh they only talk in millions of tons now. Uh so Anand uh coming to you you know especially for a startup you know you know of course when agree techch started

I think the focus was more on digital and AI what didn't exist and now it has become more and more mainstream. So how do you see how startups can use it can create value

especially the kind of work you do for providing credit for example for doing quality are saying for providing storage in the post-h harvest value chain &gt;&gt; no so hi good good evening everyone I'll

just correct you AI word still existed in agriculture it was called as artificial insemination &gt;&gt; I was about to say &gt;&gt; so that's the first time when I heard uh

doing my BSC in agriculture I heard about AI. So it was like 25 years ago. Uh coming to the topic even I think uh uh uh as a country we always get excited when new technology comes in. I remember

3 years ago we were focusing more on blockchain and we thought blockchain is the penicia for all our problems. Uh and hope is not a bad strategy but it should not be the only strategy that AI is

going to solve all our problems. you know we should be excited about it but uh before any happens the structural issues or I would say the perceptional agriculture which we are dealing with

needs to be sorted out that data which we talk about I have two datas in front of me and both are contradictory to what is there uh global hunger index rates as 102 among the 123 countries which

participates in that but the day India put a ban on export all the WTO members were crying Please send wheat, please send wheat. How come uh you know a country where people are starving,

people are requesting to export? And they were crying. So first data at the perception level has to align with what this country is capable of. Number one, at a global level. Number two, the at

the policy level you we always been 22 years in the industry, we always talk about private public partnership. there has to be an alignment on that front. Uh still the efforts are there but it gets

diluted by the time it reaches to the end. The third and the more important point is while we talk about agriculture we should not always restrict it to

farmers. That's what uh I see most of the forums the discussion should not be only on the farmers. there are other participants who are equally important to run the

supply chain and show the discussions I enter always gets concentrated on the farmer uh which is important we and and uh the fourth important structural issue which I always keep on you know as a

feedback to government sir is the welfare and the business should be separated the uh that is uh the structural issues once sorted out. Trust me uh

technologies are enough available to solve most of the problems we have otherwise data uh as you asked me you know people uh AI AI end of the day who will pay for it see a farmer has to pay

you for the data if the cost of AI is so high who will pay end of the day it will come back to the government and come back to us through taxes it's a vicious cycle

&gt;&gt; so while we evaluate any technology uh We should be we should start with a hope but we should also start with a caution as to the value it will generate which will make the consumer or the farmer or

the users of those uh or the people using it pay for it. What value add it and in the country till in last 22 years I have not seen people paying you for data. Everybody wants data but when it

comes to you know taking out money from your wallet we will see we'll come back and then those datas which get used are those islands of excellence in certain pockets say one person here one FBO

there two FPO there if if something is very critical like the UPI infrastructure which government has created look at its acceptance because it had a use case and it had like a

growth grocery store arikala everybody found utility in it and got adopted. So something like that is what is needed in agria. Thanks. No, thanks for bringing some very

&gt;&gt; difficult points. But it's it's important to have a contradictory point of view and though I've also sat on forums and I've gotten got beaten for it when I say don't build AI for the

farmers. Build for the layer which can be trusted by the farmers you know. So uh and that's where the value chain becomes more and more important. Agriculture to me is a case of embedded

AI rather than a a farmercentric AI. you can embed AI in so in so many ways in across the value chain. U so with that coming to you Malik and sorry for keep you waiting I've taken the liberty of

proximity. Uh the question to you is um um how do we make the question which Anand raised you know who's going to pay for it you know um and frankly AI needs a lot of investments we seeing venture

capital putting billions of dollar every $30 billion deal looks like a just another deal in AI uh so how do we you know make it more and more affordable where does public platforms comes into

picture where DPI comes into picture where data sharing comes into picture uh and you know as That point is also being raised you know how do you make authentic data sets available so that AI

tools become foreign for robust to be used by farmers or anyone in the value chain. Too many questions right um and fantastic uh you know views from our

friends here. So thank you for having me. If if you look at uh two different data sets again talking about data right um one is uh what's the workforce that's in

farming in agriculture in the country close to 45 48%. Right on the other hand if you look at the contribution to the GDP right which is much less than 20%. less than 1/5 of

the GDP there is a huge gap out there. So what it means honestly in my understanding putting technology on on the side being a technologist but thinking the context

of it right uh there is a huge gap to be really filled I mean we looking about productivity which is much much much less that's what it means per person per farmer productivity how much it is I

think it tells some story about that so I think there is some gap to really work on and it's a transformational need out there in my honest opinion and can AI help there? Yes, it can. But we

need to look at uh from the context in terms of what and how, right? And the point of making it affordable is very very essential. All the large language models that we've been talking

very costtheavy, resource hungry, we all know it, right? Can they help? Of course can they can help. What we need is more focused, more solution, more uh sectordriven,

more taskdriven, smaller models and I'm sure someone like friends like Alo can possibly uh second to that and Anand you can also possibly can relate to that. So I think we need

something which is very focused smaller not giant GPT like kind of a heavy model to look at. That's one. Second, we need something which is more focused on various different uh you know data sets

possibly. There are various different things that you solve and Simon talked about best detection and disase for example. How do you solve that? We talked about value chain. We talked

about uh logistics. Yeah. In every which if you think about it's a model in its own way and different problems therefore to be solving using that model. So there is no one single LLM possibly that can

really solve it and if it does it's too cost heavy too resource hungry right but what we need is more focused approach out here that's one second I think it's equally important to

understand how are we really building that infrastructure right uh in terms of solving that problem right I think public private partnership is very essential we heard about that uh there

are initiatives which I know I do not know how much far it has gone ahead is in terms of how about the agriculture uh producer organizations or cooperative societies possibly buying a pool of

resources cloud credits for example and giving out to the farmers and to the users and I think government possibly also can intervene then in terms of giving out

such credits to the farmers as well and to the point that Anand made uh you know UPI it has done wonderful uh you know impact it has made a wonderful impact right um data

is essential but access of data and making that available at large democratization that is even more essential so first is of course to bring the data together right the data sets

right that's the first thing I don't even worry about computer right now honestly I don't I would not not that it is not important but data is even more important to be able to then kind of

extract necessary data points from it and then of course work on how we are able to really make it accessible affordable right so for example

we recent just talked we just heard about uh you know bat vistar right it's an amazing AI tool which kind of shares the resources can we do that for other data sets as

well. Can we do that for other parameters as well? Right? I think that brings down the cost of access. Of course, it also democratizes. Furthermore, it will be more accessible

by startups like in case of VPI that we've been seeing to be able to then integrate within their solutions, within their applications to come up with some wonderful solutions. So, these are few

ideas possibly that we should possibly look at and work on. And I think more than um just solving one problem, I think if you do that, it's not just about scaling and helping AI scale.

Honestly, it is actually nation building if you think about it. Absolutely. I think frugal engineering is is critical and this sector is known for frugality. I think the startups I

know who have done the best are the ones who are the most frugal in terms of spending and figuring out where does capital need to be deployed and I think the point you made around data

infrastructure shared infrastructure I think that that's extremely critical to for these AI tools to be more affordable with that Elizabeth I'll come to you um you know I think clearly for a sector

like agriculture uh policy is at the core of it you know if you have to scale anything I always say capital is a multip multiplier but policy is a bigger multiplier especially

in sector like agriculture. So how does policy enable adoption of technology? You have Sanjay G sitting next to you. You can if you can make some recommendation how how government should

be looking at it. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much. So let me share that one of the groups that at the World Food Program we've worked with closely um and and you know where there's

there's really extra support required is with women farmers. Um you know there are so many excellent um government schemes that seek to support women farmers. But we do see when we speak to

them that often they are feeling a bit left out um sometimes the status of women farmers is much lower than men. They tend to um they can be seen as not necessarily as farmers in their own

right but as doing work that is an extension of housework. Um that's something that you know that we've noticed through our work at the grassroots. Um they often need a special

support to access certain schemes um and training and financial products and loans and credit and so on. The reason I'm mentioning this is because perhaps some of the colleagues in the panel

would have ideas on how we might join forces. We've talked about public private partnerships bringing um AI and technology solutions uh to support um these groups would would be excellent.

So one of the things that we've worked on with with the government are is to set up climate adaptation information centers for example um some chat bots and apps that can provide advice um on

whether it's you know climate smart approaches or plant clinics very practical things like that where we're trying to bring technology u to to that level and and I would say that what the

gentleman said about small models and testing small models I see an application there in terms of partnering at the field level where we could be very happy to to look at things like

that thank you &gt;&gt; thanks no wonderful and thanks for bringing the gender lens I think that's extremely critical not many of us realize whenever think of a farmer it's

a picture of man which comes into mind but go to villages I think the number of women which is employed in agriculture is is is large and growing especially articulture and animals boundary. So

totally with you Elizabeth on this. Uh Simon coming back to you um I think you gave a very good example of that FPO. Now I think one of the challenges that we see with a lot of advisory and lot of

solutions is that the it is not contextualized or curated plot by plot you know it's it's it's more generic. uh first of all is there a need for it or you know or and if if yes can AI play a

role out there to make it very far farm specific probably what agree tech also intends to do whenever it gets open sourced &gt;&gt; yeah

it's a it's a very fair question it's a touchy question right um I mean obviously when when when I look at FPOS and be it also women FPOS's I look at the opportunity for collective ization

which means decision making is done more in cohesion. Right? &gt;&gt; What I was trying to get at is obviously if you start using drones ideally all farmers will let those drones fly over

their fields and take pictures and also give recommendations. Right. I think we are not at a point yet where we can say the farmer has no intervention. Right. Right. It's just doesn't feel right in

the country yet. So I would say it is still it needs to be a recommendation which might be because the FBO puts pressure on and says hey we are only going to do DSR. Yeah. So either you are

a DSR farmer or not. But I think we need to find a middle way in this country always right. What is important to me though is also when we're talking smaller models and stuff is the topic of

agri stack right there is a need for public infrastructure on data right because if everybody generates their own data and especially with advice we say see it

today one model says A the other says B it's completely contradictory it's a bit like the guy from buyer and the guy from tenta goes there and recommend different products right that's something we need

to overcome and I do believe in a longer run you're going to be sitting here as a government and say we don't necessarily want people do certain interventions on their own. Yeah. We will come to a point

where what I call the pesticide is taken out of the hand of the farmer and it is applied by a machine which is controlled where it's very very clear that there is a trail of evidence why it needs to be

done. Yeah. So it will be at points where I do believe the intervention will become universal and the farmer will not take the decision any longer. Thank you. Thanks Amon. Uh with that coming to you

Aloc and Anan maybe you can also comment on it. I think one of the challenges that we are seeing is is climate uh and the kind of rains we saw last monsoon. It's not just the intensity of rain.

It's the distribution of rains. The heat wave that we has seen this year you know we are already one of the hottest summer for Delhi in the last 5 years. uh and as some of you will know one degree

increase in temperature is 5 millions of wheat getting lost right so this that that kind of impact so how do we tackle this whole climate change issue how do we make climate supply chains more

climate resilient uh using some of these u technology tools you can comment on &gt;&gt; uh so I have means uh just to say on uh this particular question uh and before I go into this one I just want political

liberty just to share one thing mean I have been hearing this one like uh when we are talking about LLM SLMs and all so it's like uh data centers and the huge requirements and all so if we change the

requirement from the like datadriven to context driven the day we orient this one the moment we go into this picture just I want to give one example that when we build things like this one

suppose one base indexes or something where just just a raw example if we fix that at particular stage this index gives This kind of idea about the agriculture plus a kind of indicative

analysis per soil then what happens? Suppose hypothetically I have five parameters the maximum combination is 120 I can reduce it to 30. So what happens data points decrease. So these

kind of dynamics need to be taken care of. So it requires the shift from datadriven to contactdriven analysis. Now coming back to these questions sir very important. Now but but we need to

understand that when the climate thing is coming into the picture. The story cannot be confined to the farmland the ecosystem dynamics should come into the picture. Ecosystem dynamics means uh the

entire idea is the land system vibrations. What we see is the consequence and all. So it means if we are even aiming or targeting the agricultural uh dynamics means what is

the impact of climate change on that? So what actually happens the journey starts from the root causes the process parameters. So I I would like to give two three pointers on this process

parameters means the land system dynamics will come into the picture. Landscape profiling come into the picture. Atmospheric profiling will come into the picture. So dimens will come

into the pictures. All stacks then merge into one. So what happens different domains different skills has to be merged at uh at uh one go. So what kind of architectures we may have to tackle

this one. So I would like to share one thing mean the entire respected AF fratern is here. We started the journey with the conventional level then the deep tech and then right now strong we

talking about strong AI architecture. Why to tackle this one only? Because if we have to have a solution on this so entire ecological dynamics should be put on one uh on one scale seamlessly. Now

this requires the understanding of th local complexities the thresholding the trigger parameters from different domains. So it means we have if if if I have to say it means uh not

hypothetically it's a kind of a kind of a basian architecture it's it's it's it's it goes in in that direction. We cannot have a blackbox kind of uh understanding and then we understand

that my data is also authentic or not or it's triggering or not but it's right for that analysis. So here actually AI not just AI I I'll make it very specific strong AI architectures will have a very

very strong role to play and and actually have been playing sir so him to answer I think climate change is for real it's it's knocking our doors there's no two way about it but I think

the first department which needs or the first industry which needs AI in the country especially for agriculture is the media if million tons for one degree would

have damaged India would not be in a position to export allow export they have huge stocks with us right now our warehouses are full government I think sir would can comment so the department

which needs data right now data is the media because they blow things out of proposition most of the time and and especially when it related to farmers it's a very sensitive and this

negativity sells much faster than a wildfire in a forest so the data so it's it's for real we have to be prepared for climate smart agriculture. There's no two way about it. But not at the cost of

you know spending our entire energy towards it. See we as agriculture what is happening? We are taking too many priorities in one go which makes the execution difficult. We have to pick up

two three things on a I say a five to seven year horizon and do it. But what happens if we pick up something too many things? That's where things are taking time.

&gt;&gt; Thanks. No, that's a that's a good message for the media to be more realistic and datadriven. Thank you. Thanks, An Mik. Last question to you. So clearly you talked about data

infrastructure. Now when it comes to agriculture, there's a hardware part. So you know we are using a lot of remote sensing. Uh Simon talked about use of drones. There are weather stations under

winds project. There are about two lakh weather stations which are going to be installed. Uh there's IoT being you. There's sensors being used. So how do you see hardware play

coming in? That's one sort of source of data and of course the the data that you need to store to run these interesting AI algorithms that most of us don't understand. But yeah, you need a lot of

infrastructure for that. Right. I I all I know is that it consumes a lot of energy, right? I think uh one you talked was from the more from the data acquisition point of

view. I think which is more operational need operational technology classically we call that in industry which is an essential item but that too can be

worked in a very frugal way. Um coming to the uh point that you know we heard about LLM and uh small models as well. See what we need here. The best models here are not the biggest models.

Okay, the best models here would be the deepest models. Uh more context aware models, right? So thinking from that point of view, then you come to an understanding in terms of what

infrastructure would you then require, right? It would require edge computing. Possibly you will need to run these models on your phones, smartphones, right? you will need to run on your

local CPUs more than just GPUs, right? Uh so architecting it, designing it is something which is very essential to it and how we kind of break this into what is really required to even deploy,

right? And again coming to the point that we talked earlier, but how do you really do it? The point is edge computing is out there, cloud computing is out there, right? But

we have to figure out a solution somewhere in middle in between such that it is available as an infrastructure to people at large. Right? Which again comes to the point of digital public

infrastructure. Right? And digital public infrastructure by by that we mean it is governed, it is democratized, accessibility is out there, right? Bringing out the cost down

and therefore you have more innovations around it. you have more API economy around it, right? What we are seeing is in API economy, right? Even in within UPI, what we are seeing is API economy.

So I think it kind of helps to kind of scale as well. It brings the cost down as well. So I would not worry much about honestly speaking again on the compute power for example

it can be something which can be designed for your simple uh CPUs and some edge computing as well and to an extent GPUs as well but not that heavy if you're talking about small focus

models here which is very important and essential. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thanks. No that's a very practical suggestion. Um Sanjay G any closing remarks from you? So I think there's a

lot of excitement in the private sector about the public stacks you know agree and batwistar which got launched you know just educate us you know how do we when do we use it how do we use it now

&gt;&gt; I think when we talk about bat wistar we want to extend it throughout the country means to extend it as far as possible to all the stakeholders it is not only farmers but various

stakeholders are involved this in this process And ultimately through varatistar and through various other AI technologies which we are using

we are also going to save the taxpayers money also. I would like to give one or two examples like procurement. We are going to save huge money to save some fake procurement

which is being done in the name of farmers. Similarly fertilizer subsidy that is a huge challenge before us that our subsidy burd is increasing day by day.

Now through all AI help through soil testing reports now farmers are using fertilizer they don't know the problems but they use fertilizers through AI there are so many things

which we are planning to do and that digital public infrastructure that agree course is coming in a huge way the data is not a problem we have a huge database we

have a low but now this is time has term that with the help of AI we are able to use that huge database which we were that was lying with us and now we are capitalizing that database and making it

useful for the larger uh benefit of our country. I think all together we can do wonders and agriculture farmers need it. All the stakeholders need it and ultimately our

country will benefit through all these efforts and hunger will not be a problem for our country that I can assure everyone here. Thank you very much. Thanks for that positive note. Uh

some question can we can we take some question? I I know we have gone beyond two or three questions. Uh so yeah, let's take get the questions first and please be brief and as much as you can.

&gt;&gt; just request to understand when you are inviting when you are inviting them &gt;&gt; Produces like in UFI when you are going to release

unified farmer &gt;&gt; ID. I think if you can say we have already working on farmer ID that is uniform farmer ID more than 10 code farmers are already listed and they got

unique farmer ID and it is going to cover all the farmers in next one year and by the time every farmer will have a definite unique ID with them and with that ID they can take

credit they can go for bank loan they can will take fertilizer that they can take any advantage from market seed to market and everything will be connected with that farmer ID and that is already

in there but the in last one year more than 8 cr farmers have been added to that and this silent revolution like Aadhaar today we all are having Aadhaar ID I think in coming time within a year

or so every farmer will have a different comprehensive ID that will be connected with his land records also and ultimately It will work as Aadhaar for all the farmers and it will

be linked with all the schemes, all the benefits, all the land records with that ID. &gt;&gt; Uh my question is to Simon. You mentioned very rightly that the

decision regarding the P pesticide spray can be taken away from the farmers. Can the entire decision taking in case of agriculture or horiculture be left to the AI

in a given circumstance and from say resource to root from supply to demand and the farmer is merely a stakeholder as owner of the land that he has got and

also his uh involvement is very minimal. You know we have a system called batai. Bai in the sense the farmer is absent farmer and is given to somebody else. In this case this the AI happens to be the

one which takes a decision and can you think about doing this kind of experiment in case of one particular FPO and see how the results come out because you know the problems he has

given a complete summarization of the problem. you have the solution. He he knows about the data as such. But then &gt;&gt; at least we can &gt;&gt; I I understand where you come from and I

I mean there there is a question of infrastructure and that starts with mechanization. Do we have AI ready me recognization in the country? Right? So simple answer in the long run, yes. And

when I was many years back in Bangkok, I was saying exactly because he saw this farmers would own their land. They would be offsite online farmers, right? They would use WhatsApp and whatever and tell

their laborers to do what to do. Right now obviously we've come a long way and yes in theory you should be coming to a point where AI can do most intervention for the farmer but the farmer will still

take a choice he will say I'm an organic farmer I want to have high yields I want to whatever preserve my land this year right so I don't think it's going to be 100% but the decision points will be

much more as you say contextual and might be limited because yes a government might at one point say I don't want people to decide on fertilization themselves if AI can do it

better because maybe the simple solution I don't want to pay so much subsidy the better solution obviously because I want to have ecological services come in right and ultimately that's where you

want to come you want to have an incentive system where the farmer that takes the best ecological decisions actually earns Thank you. I think one last question

&gt;&gt; It's a very interesting panel. I I come from the AI side. So I my question is uh purely towards uh the food processing and the food uh waste. uh this is something that I have I'm doing a

project in northeast and I find that the amount of food wastage that is happening which is uh um posth harvest it's not uh at the consumer level it's the food waste uh

because of lack of market access at the same time there are lot of food processing possibilities which are there but that doesn't get really uh accomplished now there are two different

ministries really handling it. So it doesn't become uh a viable proposition. Every every effort that is really happening is to really address to the farmer but then uh food processing

becomes a different uh industry altogether. So why can't we really look at what kind of uh uh systems we can develop to really look at the food wastage and try to see how we could

reposition the extra food that is not getting marketed uh through a food processing mechanism. Now that's the research that I've done and I have practical uh this thing which is there.

We have also identified certain crop certain uh vegetables and fruits uh which can be really brought into that area. This is through a proper data analysis. Now these are things that we

really don't know who should be addressing it and that's something that is a question for uh you plus where do we really get that food wastage data right now there is no data available. uh

so there has to be a conscious mechanism to really look at the kind of food wastage which is happening. Most of the time the farmer is not able to really accomplish what he can uh just because

of the wastage in terms of all kinds of problems that one has in terms of transportation in terms of market access in terms of uh perishability and so on so forth. I think when we talk about

seed to market the concept is that that there should not be a food wastage rather farmer should get the right price for the his food because there's no wastage but they are not getting the

right price for the product. So now in current two policies the recent two policies of pulses mission and oil seed mission we have kept this into mind and we have added food processing meals on

that pulses processing mills and oil processing mills are also included to be set up in that particular area where the this is grown more than 1,000 pulses mills at at the same time more than

1,000 oil seed mills oil processing mills are being set up under these missions so that the this wastage or this force selling can be reduced and as far as other marketing concerns are

there because perishable goods are there many agriculture products are perishable so there are some such problems comes many times now the FPO farmer producer organization they are playing very good

role to address this problem they are providing a bridge between farmers and market and I think in coming time as they are going to be more strong things will be better and through this

only we can reduce this gap of wastage. So my question was in context with northeast. Northeast has a typical problem of this because of many other variations.

&gt;&gt; Is there some specific effort that can be done to really have a AI mission on that where we can actually address because um um I am um volunteering to really work on that. That's something

that very share your data and your findings with us. &gt;&gt; Sure. And our government there's a 10% funding is reserved for northeast as most of the development schemes welfare

schemes. We have a separate dedicated funds for northeast. &gt;&gt; And if you have data and some findings certainly it will help us. Please share

with us. Thank you very much. &gt;&gt; So thank you. I think one good thing about the last session is that we can extend it and we have taken the liberty of extending it by like 30 minutes. uh

but yeah thanks to all the panelists for some wonderful insights and to all the audience I think it's been a for all your curiosity and your patience and thanks to my Viki colleagues who have

worked hard to make this session work.
