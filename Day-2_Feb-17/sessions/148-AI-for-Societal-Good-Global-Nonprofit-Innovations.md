## 📝 Transcript

maybe I need to be a part of this. &gt;&gt; He's in a nonprofit for God's sake. So he he kind of lowers the average. [laughter] &gt;&gt; So anyway, so we get together doctors,

lawyers, academics, CEOs, VCs, nonprofit heads as a diaspora community and we started in the US. Then we now have chapters also in the UK, Singapore, Canada, UAE and Australia. There are six

countries where the diaspora is extremely strong and influential. Of course, diaspora live in 200 countries, right? So, we can't dismiss the rest of the countries, but as a core group,

these six countries are most visible and influential. So, using this community to be a force for good in the countries we live in, but also to be a force for good in India. So, that's the intent of

Indiaspora. Our website is indiaspora.org. We have a great newsletter if you want to keep in touch about the news about the indaspora. We also are doing a

global forum next month in Bangalore. So all these details are on our website. But this session really is about focusing on the work that nonprofits do. So we have four amazing panelists to

talk about how AI is used in nonprofits because a lot of discussion in this event and conference centers around commercial activities of AI, scaling of AI, the use of AI in corporate offices

and so on and so forth. We decided to give a different perspective here of how AI is used in nonprofits. Not only to create efficiency in the nonprofits but use of innovative business models in AI

so that the communities that these organizations kind of work with actually are the benefits of AI uh as we know it. So we've got four great panelists. I'm going to give a little bit of an

introduction to each one and then dive into questions. Uh to my left is Vas Dar. Villas is the president of the Pat McGovern Foundation based in the US. Uh a fact about the Pat McGovern Foundation

and Velas is they're the largest donors to AI in the nonprofit space. They have given away over $500 million in the past five years. Okay, that's what they do is they they give money to nonprofits to

put AI into their business models, into their organizations and so forth. And he'll tell us a little bit more. Next to him is our new entrant and she is part of our diaspora now honorary member of

of the Indian diaspora is Vivian Schiller. She has worked at New York Times, NPR, many different places uh in the media space and now she's with Aspen Digital. So welcome. We'll give you an

Indian name by the end of the session. We'll vote on it at the end. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Uh next to her is Manu Chopra. U Manu runs an organization called Karia. You might have heard of them, but they again

have great models for how women and rural people are empowered by using AI on their smartphones and very very innovative model. You'll hear from him. Then finally, Utkash Sakenna. Huttkash

is now bringing AI into the justice system. So again you'll find many use cases. You know Vivian is going to talk about misinformation and disinformation. Manu is going to talk about employment.

Utkers is talking about social justice and Vas funds all these people. At the end of the day they're going to leave with big checks, fat checks. Vas is not smiling. Sorry.

&gt;&gt; Smiling. I love it. Uh so Villas the first question to you probably look at dozens and dozens of proposals and grants that come from nonprofits to you looking for money

looking for uh grants looking for funding capacity building new programs and so on and so forth. So from a high-end perspective give us what the landscape looks like in terms of AI

being used in the nonprofit space. &gt;&gt; Love it. Thanks Amar. And um just a note of appreciation to you. You've been such an incredible convenor and a builder in representing India around the world and

the diaspora. So thank you for that. Really um friends thank you. I have to say in this room I'm so happy. I think this is the fifth or sixth talk I've given in

the last few days and these rooms are often full of curious people but not everybody's curious about what we're talking about today which is not what is AI not is how do you use AI to make the

most profit possible but a different question. How do we use AI to fundamentally support the dignity, the agency, the rights of people and communities around the world? And you

cannot have that conversation without nonprofits, without civil society, with the organizations that we task to go to the very front lines of vulnerability to ask the question, what's wrong and how

can we help? Now, if you don't think about how AI can support those individuals, those organizations, and those communities, then what are we even doing here? But I'm going to take it one

step further. It's not just how nonprofits use AI. If we stopped our conversation there, that would be a conversation about how nonprofits become customers, become clients, in some ways,

become subjects. Our work with everybody here on this panel is to change the game entirely. How do we make sure that people, communities, and the institutions that represent them are the

architects of what AI looks like? How do we take the capacity to build frontier models and move it out of Silicon Valley and move it into the communities that we live in? How do we ensure that the

application layer, the translational layer of AI is being built in ways that actually incorporate the wisdom and knowledge of people where they live? And how do we make sure the uses are

conditioned not merely by how you get more attention or more engagement, how you sell more products, but actually in ways that enforce the community dignity of people, that make sure they have

economic opportunity, that they have access to education, that they can access health care when and where they need it, and that they have political dignity to participate. In order to do

that, we have to build an entirely new model of participation. That's what the folks on this panel do, and it's why I'm so happy to be here. We work together to change the game. We do it in a few ways.

As MR has mentioned, we fund and I would tell you that's actually maybe the least important thing we do as an institution. Instead, we change the public narrative around AI. We lead from the front around

purpose. We work with communities to tell their stories in effective ways. We ensure that we're creating compute capacity and data and talent that's embedded in countries and communities

around the world. And then we invest in nonprofits and say together we can not just be something different than the tech companies than the Sam Almans and the Open AIs but rather that we can be

something that works with them in complimentarity that they can build incredible innovation from the front and we can build the translation architecture that makes the world a

better place together. &gt;&gt; Awesome. Uh now let's get to Vivian. Um I know today's world is filled with deep fakes, fake news, all kinds of stuff out there. So as consumers of digital, you

know, news and and other forms of entertainment, uh the biggest challenge has been how do you know if you see a post, is it real or is it fake or the types of posts that you get to see kind

of take a certain point of view and try to kind of enhance that? How do you deal with this in today's world? And that's you're the center of all that. So, give us kind of a a bird's eye view and then

get into some details on what I will this is all about. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I will. I will. Yeah, thank you so much and thank you for having me. I'm I'm really delighted to be a honorary

member of the diaspora. Um I I I will come to your question in a second. There's a very simple answer, but I just want to say first that at the Aspen in just a couple of words about uh the

Aspen Institute and what we do. I run a program at the Aspen Institute called Aspen Digital and our focus is on many things. Um, and AI touches all of them. Um,

you know, security, information, which we're going to come back to. um just every every every way that AI is touching all endeavors around the world in human endeavors and we work across

the entire Aspet Institute trying to help trying to help all our colleagues understand how AI will impact what they do and how they think differently they try to engage in a different way with

people to make sure that no whether whether it's a group at the at the Aspen Institute that's interested in climate change or income inequality um or indigenous youth what have you to

understand how AI will impact their fields. So that's a little bit about we do uh about what we do. But um because I come from the news media and it is my and I consider myself even through my

very various incarnations as being a journalist in my heart. I care most first and foremost about the information ecosystem and AI is having a profound impact on the information ecosystem. A

lot of it is actually very exciting. We work with news organizations all over the world of ways that they can use AI to help their audiences have deeper understanding of events happening in

their communities and around the world and there's a light lot of exciting ways to do that. Um but we also look at the negative consequences which as I think is what you were getting at and I will

just say that AI is impa impacting um the information ecosystems in in two broadly profound ways. Um neither of which is particularly good. I'm I'm sorry to say. Um, one is what you

alluded to, which is this concept of deep fake, sometimes called synthetic media. It could be, you know, a video that, you know, some of the AI uh companies are making available to make

it very easy to, you know, pretend you're somebody else or you're with somebody or you're doing something that you've never done. Um, but also it includes um, you know, uncanny audio

recordings that that could be a telephone call coming into you. Um, it might be a a a a fake audio of your child um saying that I've been kidnapped and you have to send money to X Y and Z

or they're going to kill me. Horrible, horrifying things, audio, video, photography. It is also filling our um social media feeds with junk. And a lot of my colleagues in the field

are very afraid of of synthetic media because they think there will be some piece of fake video that will set the world off on World War II of you know I don't know what some world leader saying

something or pretending to do something. I actually don't believe that's true. I think people are now so cynical about what they see that we that will uh turn into an even bigger problem which is not

that some fake will fall for some fake but that we will stop believing anything at all and when we see actual videos you know whether it's from war or a celebration or what have you could be

something wonderful could be something terrible we'll think h I don't know if that's true and when you stop believing anything you see that opens up a face um for um autocrats or worse to be able to

say don't believe them just listen to me and I'll tell you what to do what to think what to believe and that's a terrifying consequence the second reason the second thing to think about AI with

your information ecosystems is that because people are more and more finding news answers to questions about news through their chat bots basically anytime you see a box on a screen and

you type something in no matter what platform it um it is giving you information. It might be accurate, it might be inaccurate, but it is taking um clicks

away from news organizations whose reporting whose critical reporting is is the foundation of the models that is then giving you the answers that you get in your in your in your chat bots. And

that causes a vicious cycle of um sustainability for news organizations. Um, and the more that these news organizations are hurt in their business models, the fewer sources of information

we'll have. I could go on and on, but I'll stop there. &gt;&gt; Fantastic overview. Really great overview of &gt;&gt; I'll tell you how we solve it later.

&gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Uh, Manu, um, Manu runs Karia. So, why don't you give a brief overview of what you guys do because that's implementation of AI in a very

interesting way, but people don't even know it's AI. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Uh, super happy to be here. Thank you so much for setting this up Mr. Um so you know at KA ka is a Sanskrit word

for work that gives you dignity and we think deeply about the entire value chain right um and the AI value chain or the AI economy starts with data collection as we all know builds onto

model building goes on to fine-tuning and of course ends with evaluation um and I'll tell you about one of the districts we've done something interesting in which is very relevant to

Velasa's point there's a place called Nandbar uh in Maharashtra which is four hours from Sura that's absolutely stunning if you ever get to go. You should go. This is like an ad for how

beautiful Nandbar is. Uh and in this district working with astep, working with uh uh working with Bhashini and working with the district collector Dr. Matali who's a rock star and they

you know in her district she has six tribal languages none of which have any AI models and the question she asked us was we have 45 days before the AI summit. Can we do something right? Uh

which I love as a question. I love a challenge. Um and we did uh we ended up starting you know I we sent three members of our team to this district and we started doing data collection in

these six uh tribal languages. We collected data on how these languages are spoken. What are what are different dialects within these languages like Bili and Ahirani and we are doing you

know all the data collection by the district in a project funded by the district and thus all the data sets are owned by the people and by the community of this district and the district of

course is the is the least hierarchical of our you know Indian system. We then had to build the models and then the models were built in the district by coders in the district. We had to do

fine-tuning that was done in the district and the evaluations of these six technologies across healthcare, finance, education, legal were all done in the district by the same people who

would use these technologies and if you go to uh once while one if you're here on 19th uh Dr. Midali will be speaking about this work uh uh on on the prime minister's uh day which is very

exciting. There's also a booth at Bash where you can try out these technologies and we actually had community members from Nandabar today try them out and I got the most incredible videos of them

saying oh it knows my language that's incredible and again 45 days right which is to say this is this is you know this is not a hard problem should we want to if there is will India has over 19,000

dialects and as Dr. Kalikabali uh my dear mentor says uh you know a dialect a language is just a dialect with an army right so we have at least 19,000 unique unique subcultures that need to be

protected that need to be preserved that need to exist online in a way that they make sense for our communities and I think at karia what we're trying to do is change this definition and vased this

so beautifully our communities are not passive beneficiaries of AI I find it slightly patronizing the way tech sector speaks about our communities like you know Yes. Yes, we can solve problems.

But you know, India doesn't have an information asymmetry problem. We have a power asymmetry problem. Right? So it's not as if uh if I built a chatbot that can give me access to information, I

solve all the problems in the world. Right? And it's very important. We get very excited by these technologies. So unless we change how these technologies are built and unless we change the fact

that unless we change the fact that technology remains a foreign force for most of us in the global south and it needs to come from us instead of coming at us, right? Unless that happens, we

will not be able to center our communities in this process. Um, one of the things that we've been looking at is evaluations. Uh, when we started doing evaluations around a year and a half

ago, again, we had some of our clients say, "This is where we lose you." Right? Your communities are incredible, but an evaluation is really hard. You're looking at an AI model response. you're

judging it on a rubric that is complex uh like trustworthiness or local relevance or um is this crop guidance the right crop guidance for this part of the of summer in this part of the

country and so on and so forth and we've now since that meeting I had with that client we've done over half a million public and expert evaluations including some with Kash which you're very excited

about which we just launched uh yesterday uh with Enthropic and again the the idea is that who should who gets to decide whether an AI model is working for for us it should obviously be the

people we are building the set models for. So we've now done these large scale evaluations with Microsoft research with entropic with government of India um to show that our communities are best

suited to do this work and of course that brings them these economic opportunities which we care so much about but it also makes sure they're not just that they're really being taken

into account and they're owning these data sets if possible or they're benefiting from them in a way that hopefully doesn't make a repeat of the things they've seen in the past. Right?

So I think at karia to summarize I would like for us to redesign the AI economy from the ground up because the way it is set up today it will never work for the people in the global south or in the

global majority right and I think if we can uh make sure that these um you know communities are are are truly centered again like that would be that's the only way we get AI to work for all of us

&gt;&gt; right thank you for that insight uh and we'll come back to you Manu on on the business model for you and so forth uh utkers is fighting social justice in a very unique way and uh Utkash why don't

you give us a kind of an overview of what Adalith does. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So uh as you said I think I started my career thinking I would fight for social justice. I was young and

idealistic and I said cheesy things like that and and then I got to a courtroom and I got a rude reality check because courtrooms in the global south are completely broken. Uh and I found myself

spending more time trying to find a right document and calendaring cases correctly. uh and you know sitting for hours not preparing for a cross- examination but looking for a piece of

paper uh that you realize that I was misled in law school uh I was sold only half the story justice is not just a question of law in India and the global south it's a question of logistics it's

a question of manual and clerical processes that clog our systems and slow the systems down um and that you know and then you suddenly start realizing why Bollywood actors are screaming tarik

for tarik uh and why there are these delays and backlogs and Why? It's not just a systemic problem because my clients were either languishing in prisons as undertrials because their

bails were not getting listed or my other clients were slipping into poverty and pulling their kids out of school because it was a punishing process. And so the idea of Adalat AI is to Adalat is

means courts and AI is AI for courts is to build AI and tech solutions specifically for district courts across India and the global south to help them automate these manual clerical processes

and reduce delays and backlogs. And what that means specifically is to ident identify these really mundane clerical points like one of the biggest problems we work with is stenography because in a

courtroom every word needs to be written down the oral arguments the cross-examinations but in courts there are no stenographers in India so judges write everything by hand if Mr is a

lawyer and asks Manu a question uh and the the question answer happens everybody will pause and then judge will ask will write the question and answers down. By the way, I have terrible

handwriting, too. &gt;&gt; And and that's part of the problem because judge A will get transferred and judge B will come in saying, "I can't understand what you've written." So,

judges create WhatsApp groups sending each other deposition photographs saying, "Hey, what have you written?" And Judge MR will say, "It's been two years. I can't read my own handwriting."

And then to resolve this, some states have come up with creative departments called fair copy departments that take these judge depositions every day and rewrite them by hand. Why? Because there

are no keyboards in Tamil and Malalam and Indian languages. So that's the kind of stuff that our court systems are spending time on. And so I think many lawyers have this realization that if

you want justice to flow faster from the taps of the court system, someone needs to unclog the pipes. And so we are the proud plumbers of the court system of the global south where we're just

automating these clerical pain points so that we can give back time to the judges to the stuff that really matters which is decide cases and in the process ensure timely justice for all.

Uh I want to now kind of move into the business models for nonprofits even though nonprofits are supposed to only get donations and contributions. Uh how do you implement AI in a way that

there's a business model significance to nonprofits and Vas you've seen a lot of these. So give us some ideas of how AI can help these organizations not continually go to people for grants but

sustain in a different way. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Thanks. I uh I want to start by saying and I say this with the kindest words in my heart. I think of you still as young and innocent. I think of myself

as young and innocent. Everybody on this panel because you know what we do is we still do fight for social justice. And if that's the definition I will take it all day long. Maybe with a white in my

beard maybe more enthusiastically than you. But look um your question is very good. I have to tell you, I think we often think of nonprofits the wrong way. Nonprofits are not grant seekers. Their

job isn't to go out and ask for money, and they don't. What they do is they try to drive enough revenue so they can do what they're deeply passionate about, which is change the world. The fact that

we've set up a system where the only way they can do so is to go through labyrinthine and archaic ways of trying to get a grant should be a responsibility we hold and not an

indictment we put on nonprofits. But we are seeing some things change and change in meaningful ways. The first will come directly to your question. The use of AI to change the way in which nonprofits

engage with donors because much like the description you provided how the court system works, traditional philanthropy works in some of the most arcane ways you can imagine. Many of you probably

already know. Trying to work with development organizations or aid organizations or even foundations. Submitting hundreds of pages of documentation. Writing essays about what

you do that aren't read by anyone other than one person in the organization. Well, AI can help all of that. One of the things we've done is build the first AIdriven tool. It's called Grant

Guardian. It's used by philanthropies now across the world to use AI to automate the practice of looking at the financial strength of a nonprofit of changing diligence so that you no longer

have to sit and fill out those forms. You submit your financials in whatever way you have. We have a customdesigned platform that takes that, evaluates it, identifies risk factors, and without

making a decision, feeds it back to the grant officer, the program officer, and says, "These are some questions you should probably dig into before you approve." So, we've got tooling that's

changing the practice of grant making. I think that's an important start. The second is the efficiency of organizations. And I hope Vivian will speak a little bit to how AI is being

used inside of news rooms, but across all kinds of nonprofits. We're seeing AI being used to take away the frictional day-to-day administrative work. And when nonprofits operate on such tight budgets

and margins, every dollar you save by automating internal administrative work is money you can spend on programs and outcomes. Now, in order to have that happen, and this is a core theme of our

work, the answer is very rarely what does the AI do? Because whatever the AI does, the question is what do people do with it? And what we face across the nonprofit sector is both a challenge and

an incredible opportunity. I think the social sector really did step away from digital transformation for the last 25 years in a really unfortunate way. I think for many of us, we were so focused

on the work we were doing that this new fangled thing that was happening with enterprise software and technology and it seemed like a world apart from sitting in a village hut having a meal

with somebody who told you that they couldn't quite figure out how to make sure the next harvest was safe. I think there was a reason for it and I understand it but it also feels like we

left an opportunity on the table. Now with AI we have that window open again. The question is will nonprofits step forward and ask the question as executives as leaders as workers in

these institutions. Can we figure out how to adopt these tools faster than the private sector? Can we bring them into our workflows in ways that actually create not just efficiency or

productivity but a new leveraged way to serve the communities we care about? And then do we make sure that they have the tooling they need in order to do that? Because again, it won't come from

platforms that are just generating chat bots. We need custom connectors that say this is what nonprofits really need. How do we build the tool sets that enable them to do it? How do we invest in the

behavioral leadership transformation? And when we have amazing exemplars, how do we lift up and celebrate those leaders in the same way that we celebrate the leaders of tech companies?

I think we could have that full arc, you'd see a transformation of our capacity to deliver impact. And I think that's one of the conversations that has to happen at conferences like this.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. Uh Vivian, can you expound on what Velas said here? &gt;&gt; Yes, absolutely. And I I think it's I I want to sort of change your question in answering your question, change your

question a little bit. I don't know that AI is is necessarily going to change the business models for nonprofits, but it's going to significantly and and these are two absolutely extraordinary examples.

I'm I'm ready to give you both money. Um even though I am not a I I I I do not run a philanthropy. I'm so sorry. Um, it's how AI can can uh have a huge uh can greatly affect the impact of the

work. So, one of the big misunderstandings I've worked in not for profofits for a while and a lot of health people go, "Oh, that sounds so wonderful. You get to do such

interesting work, but oh god, I'm sorry you have to fundra." And I think that belies a deep misunderstanding about how nonprofits work and and why nonprofits can be effective. It's not about going

up to people. And if it is, and if you run a nonprofit, I highly recommend you don't just go up to somebody and say, "Will you give me money?" It doesn't work that way.

&gt;&gt; To be clear, that has happened to me at least seven times today in this room, in this building. So, don't do that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Don't do that. What you what this is about is finding mutual interest and

passions around having an impact in a society in in a society critical area. So whether it's about the impact that you're having on being on on agriculture and being a having people across 18,000

dialects being able to understand or the extraordinary stories that you're telling about unclogging the being the plumber of the court system. I'm was so moved when I was listening to you hear

that you are using AI to have a much more profound impact than you possibly could have had without it. And again coming back to the world that I come from before Aspen in news media I am

seeing and sorry I felt like I was Dr. doom a little bit earlier. So, I'm sorry about that. But actually, on a very hopeful note, what I'm seeing is is not for-profit news organizations or even if

they're not not for profofit, they are sort of, you know, society missiondriven news organizations using exactly what Velas was saying, using AI to make things um more efficient that are not

about the core purpose of reporting and engaging with the community about uh issues and topics that are relevant to their lives in their community. So if you can sort of move away all that other

stuff and just focus and use AI for the for for good to focus on your core reporting whether it's translation services uh that makes it so much easier to reach people or whether it's

transcription or or those are just tools or really rethinking the entire way that you engage in the ent entirely new ways that the people that you're the citizens in your community are sort of engaging

with information and how they use it. We need an entire rethinking of this and that is beginning to happen with the most advanced news organizations many of which happen to be not for-p profofit

because they are unburdened from the tyranny of necessarily having to show quarterly results for shareholder value and it's been really really thrilling to say see

&gt;&gt; awesome and Manu can you kind of talk a little bit on the business model of you taking money but you take money to do services and thereby created a new business model for the end person who is

working with this product. So walk us through that how that happens. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. I mean I I'll start with something generic that I think in this uh current time running a nonprofit

right obviously very challenging uh and I do think I encourage nonprofits I meet to have a strategy of working with the market have a strategy of working with the government so that uh you are able

to find partners who can carry your work forward. Uh at Karia we've been very lucky to have had a uh like a business strategy focusing on the market from day one. Uh we work uh with all the major AI

labs in the world. We work closely with governments. We work closely with uh large foundations like the government foundation and and they would fund us to build data sets um in often low resource

languages or in the case of like major clients to do evaluations. Um we now engage with over 140,000 people. I may have already mentioned this. Sorry, this is the fifth panel of the day. Uh

did I already I did not mention this. No. Okay. This is I appreciate I'm getting deja vu. This is my third panel in this room which is hilarious. Uh but uh we work with I work with over 140,000

people across every single state in India. Uh we've been able to engage with them to do over 65 million jobs like 65 million tasks over the last two years. Um and they've been able to build

foundational data sets in over 70 Indian languages. Right. And I think that to me is super exciting the scale of what we've been able to achieve and that's only happened because of how sustainable

the model is. Last year we gave away 81% of all the revenue we made from data contracts as direct wages to workers which is very exciting. Um and worker wages grew 6.8x last year yearon year.

So we are seeing tremendous growth in the work that we are doing and we're very very excited about um the prospect of what the market is doing here. Right? So you see all of these major AI labs

the the one of the goals of the summit is talking about how multilingual multimodal models is a priority. I think that's very exciting because we genuinely believe that our communities

and by our communities I mean the communities uh you know that that all of us serve are the best people to do that. Uh yesterday working with Bhashani we launched this thing called Samodai. I

always say every good nonprofit needs a path to its own relevance right. Uh otherwise we're just building uh you know legacy projects. Um and yesterday we launched this thing called Samodai.

We've now trained these 140,000 people. They've done work for all of these, you know, fancy AI labs. And Samodai is a portal run by the government of India where any of you can go and directly

engage with career workers without us. And as long as you pay them a living wage and as long as the work is not content moderation and as long as the work protects the mental well-being of

our communities, we will help transfer it from your desktop to our workers' phones. We will help the workers do the work. We will not charge a single penny and the worker will get all of it.

Right? We're very excited. We launched it yesterday with with you know senior mate leadership and we're very very excited to think about clever ways we can work with the government. Now we did

that because look the government of India spends like I mean you know the India AI mission budget is incredible right like we we have the resources to spend on this stuff. Uh we have state

governments that I mean I know of a single state that spends $50 million a year just on protecting their own language and doing digitization in that language. And the chief secretary asked

me how do I bring that money from my you know from my uh state directly to the people of the state who could benefit from that $50 million. And I think things like Samudai can do that and

again because we're a nonprofit this is like like destruction of moat basically for a typical startup right but because we operate as a nonprofit we are excited about this because for us success is how

do we bring more economic opportunities to our communities and of course in that process how do we make sure AI works for all of us. So I think that's the you know Shannon Farley from Fast Forward

calls it the nonprofit judo which is what are things that nonprofits can do that for-profits can't do uh because they're just different incentives and nothing wrong with that but I think

those two things both the market and the government u again have been extremely successful for us and I think is the path that will get us to our stated goal of a billion dollars in wages to a

million people in the next five years. &gt;&gt; Amazing. I love that. uh saying you're going to kind of kill yourself many times over which a company can't do right a commercial enterprise can't do

and think of very different innovative models on that uh having said that uh Adalat uh give us a backdrop how many million cases outstanding in India and and kind

of what Adalat can do in terms of reduction of cases fair justice talk to us a little bit about that &gt;&gt; yeah so India has 50 million cases spending in courts and studies show that

at our current rate of disposal it's going to take us 300 years to clear this backlog whatever that means &gt;&gt; nobody will be alive the defendant or the plaintiff

&gt;&gt; which is why in in India property cases are fought by the grandkids not the original deed holders because that's just how long cases take um u 80% of India's prisons not many people know

this this is I think one of our most depressing statistics comprises of undertrials so they're not convicts serving a sentence they're under trial waiting for their cases to get over and

they're just trapped in courts which is why we say the process itself has become the punishment. Um we're currently [clears throat] in nine states in about 4,000 courtrooms. That's 20% of India's

courtrooms, one in five states. Uh our internal studies show that we are doubling and tripling the judicial output every day and cutting case resolution times by 30 to 50%. Um and

we're doing a randomized control trial with JPAL. We are thrilled to be guided by Esther Duflu Abujit Banerjee and the Don Achimogu the OG OG kind of RCT gang who are doing the first randomized

control trial for courts and AI to see how much it can actually reduce delays and backlogs. uh to come on the the business model point actually before I talk about the business model I want to

share a little bit about how we think of our scaling model because I've seen a lot of uh you know fascinating AI solutions out there and in our experience especially in a space like

the judiciary which is very new which has no experience of engaging with civil society unlike education and health where there are multiple nonprofits and there's a lot of legacy work there

painkillers work better than multivitamins it's just a very simple mantra that we follow You know, it would be lovely multivitamins. Oh, it would be nice for

you to have this nice end to end solution that'll make you more productive, but there's no kind of pull demand from the system that's asking for it. Whereas, if you go for a painkiller

that there's a high fever in the system, the scaling is much faster. You're dragged into the system and they're kind of pressuring you to scale. Which is why people were confused. We chose

tenography. But when a judge is writing depositions by hand, it's physically exhausting. They're scribes and not judges. Um and so the pain killer model becomes much more effective. And then

once you have a foot in the door, it becomes the means to have a conversation about the multivitamins. So now that we've demonstrated our impact with the stenography solution, scaled it in

multiple states. Most excitingly, by the way, two states have now mandated adult AI. So Andra and Kerala, if you go to any courtroom in Kerala today, they're no longer recording evidence by hand.

It's happening on our platforms. It's the first state in the world to actually mandate an AI solution. Um and now that we have their trust they are the ones coming back to us and say hey can we

build these other multivitamins can we build the paperless filing the digital transformation the systems that actually will last was talking about that unfortunately civil society's neglected

and I think that sets us up for a business model where eventually we are also seeking irrelevance and government adoption the entire idea is to build this in a way in partnership with courts

so that at some point today computes expensive the courts don't have GPUs they don't have internal talents but at some point What are today's unglamorous IT teams in public sector need to be AI

teams that talent needs to be in-house the compute needs to be inhouse so that we can migrate these systems and the state can run them and especially for sovereign AI functions where things like

confidentiality security privacy are such high stake it's actually better the sooner you mig migrate uh those solutions and so our approaches philanthropy is a stop gap arrangement

as stop cap capital to kind of fill in that gap demonstrate the possibility of this model but at the same time equip the state to kind of embive internalize the solution and adopt them in the long

run so that we can have the UPI moment but for the courts. &gt;&gt; Fantastic. Uh so Vas turning back to you you look at lots of uh models lots of grants coming in grant requests coming

in any other interesting ideas you've seen that you want to enumerate uh in in the nonprofit space? Yeah, I mean I could keep you here for hours. We don't really take grant applications, but we

do a ton of work with partners. I could give you a hundred use cases of how AI is being used in incredible ways. One here in India, in Rajasthan, we're working with an incredible group called

Kushy Baby. For 20 years, they've been here doing work at the front lines on maternal health in last mile villages. These are the villages you take the road as far as it goes, the bus as far as it

goes. You get out and you walk to find these villages. What they've done in just the last few years with our partnership is um take all of the data they have from 20 years of this work

across villages across Rajasthan built a geospatially informed AI model that then lets them ask some questions. One of those questions is show me the clusters or the areas where you have worse health

outcomes than other places. The first time we ran this model and this was in the first six months that we worked together. We identified six villages where consistently when young mothers

had their first child, those infants were having very low birth weight which as you all know is an indicator of a lot of other health complications that come. They then sent in folks to ask the

question why is this happening? They learned there was a a practice cultural practices around diet and other things that meant there were specific vitamin deficiencies. They worked with the

government and six months after that they had shipped in supplements and began to see statistically significant changes in health outcomes. Now that's a very detailed story but let's talk about

what it means. You take analog data that's really only held by nonprofits or the government. You build an AI tool that lets you extract from that data meaning and wisdom. You then bring

humans in to say what actually happened here. And then you're able to deliver a solution that materially changes the lives of potentially millions of people. None of it requires 500 billion dollars

in compute infrastructure. It doesn't require putting data centers in communities where they extract water and power and create negative externality. It does require communities who

understand data who can do the work that Manu described so so powerfully. It does it does require institutions that care about people and it requires a mechanism that says we will put purpose over

profit. This is maybe the most important lesson that comes from this is all of this is within our hands. There's nothing that keeps us from doing it except that we have to maintains the

fundamental expectations of what we expect from technology, what we expect from government, and maybe even what we expect from ourselves. &gt;&gt; Awesome. Uh I know there's some

questions. I'm going to kind of lead that. Keep it extremely brief, 10 seconds or less. &gt;&gt; Uh stimulating conversation, amazing stories. Uh the reason I needed to

interrupt, I'm I'm sorry for that, is because I'm questioning the very fundamental of what's written there. societal goal global nonprofit innovations as a corollary our profit

social hazard and is AI going to turbocharge that it's not 8020 it's probably 982% and my question sir is that without earth federation you know we are still

loitering uh with the sovereign nation states getting weaponized and burning 2.7 trillion dollars which could come to you and you and do lots of societal good so my point is that are we signed on

human extinction? Have we asked the children and the younger generations for that? I don't I don't think so. &gt;&gt; So the question is what is the next generation think about all this stuff?

Anyone want to opine on that? &gt;&gt; Should we take a few more questions? Give me a few. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Let's go for it. Sea

&gt;&gt; thanks. Uh Vas, just you know in what struck me was the brilliance of you saying woke yourself to irrelevance. Why can't we just change it on its head? There is not enough money in the world

of philanthropy to solve all problems. What if we say how can the seed catalyzing private capital and switch that mindset to saying instead of irrelevance I'll become for profofit.

&gt;&gt; Uh hi guys, you know it's a fantastic job you're doing here. uh AI for nonprofit is by itself a great topic a very important topic too uh in my field I'm president and founder of educational

organization we are into educating young children from grade 1 to grade 10 and we provide them free education how does AI allow us to bring this quality education to all these marginalized folks 200

million of whom were unexposed to education during the covid it just tells you the mammoth amount of problem that exists. It beats my head. How do how do you do this?

&gt;&gt; Question. &gt;&gt; Hi, uh I am Prina. I work at answer building global capability centers India. My question is for the Adati. Uh quite amazing to see that we are

stepping in and putting AI solutions to good use where we really have a problem of cases. My question was uh do you feel and you might have experienced firsthand the uh challenges uh basically

restrictions and u uh people opposing the AI infiltration into legal cases because what I see is cases are all about how you handle the defense, how you actually

speak in a court and it actually tailors the mind of the judge. So those capabilities AI still has or not But are people okay with AI judicial statements? AI making the case itself?

AI giving the jurisdiction all alone and all by itself. I know it might be human in the loop right now, but do we see maybe an AI defense lawyer coming up soon?

&gt;&gt; Specific. So, Villas, why don't you take the first one on uh the funding, you know, that that Sema brought up the question. Yeah. keep my question. &gt;&gt; No, we'll come back. We'll keep your

controversial one for the last. &gt;&gt; Well, I like this question. Um, I absolutely agree. I mean, I think look, we have to be innovative. We often spend a lot of time talking about innovation

and technology. What's the next frontier product? What's the next frontier model? We don't spend enough time talking about in innovation in our social institutions. And I think the question

was a good one. Now, I'm not sure that's the right answer, but how do we expand the scope of what companies are responsible for, what philanthropies can see, and what technologists can build? I

think we can do something great with that. &gt;&gt; And and can you make a nonprofit a for-profit? It was part of that. &gt;&gt; I mean, of course, and it happens all

the time. Again, I want to be very clear. Nonprofit is a philosophy, a tax code status, a state of mind. Nonprofits can generate revenue, can do so profitably, and can use it to sustain

their work. It happens all the time. &gt;&gt; Let's take that after the session is over. Uh go ahead. Just wanted to add one quick one quick thing on that which is this is a very important point. If

you are you if if you are a non not for-p profofit or a nonprofit, you still have to make bring in more money than you're spending. I know this sounds so s I mean it's the same as a for-profit

company in that sense. The only difference is what happens to that to that differential. But it a nonprofit is not a a magic wand that makes all of those your need to have revenue go away.

Sorry. Very important point though. and Manu can you answer the question on education 200 million kids how do you get to the kids any thoughts on that that you have

&gt;&gt; uh it's a tough question let me think about it but when we have a &gt;&gt; yeah let's do the court AI defense lawyer AI plaintiff and AI everything &gt;&gt; no so that makes me nervous as well

which is why our philosophy today as I said to deliberately automate the clerical pain points to create the windfall of time to leave the decision-m to the human judges right I don't think

the technologies at at a point where you can hand over decision-m and there are lots of low-hanging fruits. You can make incredible impact by automating these clerical processes and giving them back

time. However, we should be prepared that there will come a point in this journey where the technology is actually very solid and in the global south one of the biggest problems is that our

judge population ratio like our teacher population ratio or government bureaucrat population ratio is incredibly low and we have to ask ourselves should the judges be listening

to traffic tickets? Is there a world where you can automate just traffic tickets where there is no risk of hallucination or bias, right? Take those cases away from judges. Maybe the first

decision comes from an automated uh bot and then it goes to a human judge on appeal. We could I think that's where the world is headed. But today, I'm with you. It makes me nervous. There are no

AI judges or prosecutors. The point of AI is to remove the hurdles that come in their path to do the work that they're supposed to do so that you can expedite justice deliver.

&gt;&gt; Awesome. &gt;&gt; I'll say I'll say a quick thing on the education question. Uh Dolberg uh Dalberg announced the GILA thing today which is the global alliance uh for

learning uh and it's incredible. I think it tries to answer your question. I don't know who asked the education question anymore. Yes. Uh please check out the Gala charter. We're part of it.

So many incredible organizations are part of it and it tries to answer the question on on what does how does the future of AI and education look like for so many people. Yeah.

&gt;&gt; So your controversial question sir. So who wants to take a shot? Give us what you want from us. Turbo, you know, 85 seconds to midnight on January 27.

&gt;&gt; Okay, there's a doomsday clock. Companies are making too much money. What do you do? &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; I'm sorry.

&gt;&gt; Yeah, I I don't get it. So let's move on. &gt;&gt; Okay. So sir, &gt;&gt; so sir can we can we move on here? Please take that off record. Okay.

Offline. Uh so question on uh the last question for you all of you is u where does AI go? Just imagine in five years or 10 years in the nonprofit space or whatever space we call it at that time.

It may not even be nonprofit profit but what is uh your take on it Manu in five five years or 10 years is Karia still around? Is Karia forprofit? Uh do whatever be it what what do you say?

Look, I think one of my favorite researchers in this space is Eric Benjoffson from Stanford High and he has this beautiful line in his research paper where he says, "If we automated

all the work that ancient Greeks did, we would have gotten to vaccines faster, right?" Which is what I think about. There is no limit of human ingenuity, right? We are incredibly creative. We

are like I I walk these halls and I just feel so inspired to see what human beings can create when they come together. Look, yes, AI is going to create, you know, it's going to bolster

economic productivity for some of us. It is our moral responsibility to make sure that AI works for all of us equally. That's what all of us are trying. We work very hard like genuinely to try to

make sure that happens, right? But at the same time, I'm excited about this future where you know like AI is a partner to all of us and what what is the vaccines of our time? What is stuff

that my kids would have that I would be like oh my god like how did we live without it? I would love for V
