## 📝 Transcript

partner at Health Co. Mr. Mahipal brings experience of over two decades in healthcare investing and having backed several pioneering health tech companies in India. He offers a unique perspective

on aligning the patient capital risk appetite with long-term system transformation. We are also joined by Miss Namita Mayanil from Visa, an innovative global

health tech platform where she drives development of AI enabled mental health solutions. And as a technology leader, she brings in an innovator's perspective on

navigating complex challenges faced by innovations to scale both in Indian and international markets. From the CSR space, we welcome Mr. Nitil Vashisht, deputy general manager CSR at Indian Oil

Corporation Limited with extensive experience at the IOCL. He brings in insights into how large public sector enterprises are aligning their CSRs to promote AIEL innovations for improved

health outcomes. Finally, the session will be moderated by Mr. Himmanu Sikka who is the chief strategy and diversification officer at IP Global and a senior director at Samrid Impact

Solutions. He brings in over 20 years of experience in health system strengthening, health financing across India, Asia and Africa by working closely with public, private and

philanthropic ecosystems. With such a distinguished panel, today's discussion will move us towards pragmatic actionable pathways for embedding AIE innovations into public health

architecture not just as isolated pilots but as sustainable inter interventions. Thank you all for being here and I look forward to an encouraging discussion. &gt;&gt; Thanks. Thanks anal for setting the

same. Thanks first of all to all the panelists for joining us today. Uh I know how difficult it has been to reach the venue itself. So thanks for making it on time and thanks for the audience

to be there uh full house people standing. Apologies for that. We don't have any role to play with the arrangement. So can't help that. the point very well that uh

[clears throat] AI solutions are all everywhere. It's like uh what we had 20 years back with that everywhere you saw. Uh but initially there were hiccups that how it will be scaled. There were

technology issues, there were regulatory issues but that for in many ways has kind of crossed that pathway. But what will it take for AI solutions specifically in healthcare space to take

that leap and that's something that we want to kind of discuss today with this great panel coming from uh different spheres uh and see how it can be taken forward. Uh without taking much time I

think I will just get into CK and would request you kind of your thoughts. You have been at the helm of affairs when it comes to government of India's efforts in the healthcare space as well as in

other ministries. Where do you see is the opportunity for the Indian healthare system to kind of really adopt AI and at that to scale and take things forward in in India's journey.

&gt;&gt; Oh, thank you. Is it all working? So thank you Himmanshu and uh yeah very timely discussion because I think this is one aspect in healthcare delivery

system which we really need to seriously sit and discuss. While technologies are developing and coming to fruition, I think the minds are still a bit hazed. So we need to bring clarity not just on

AI in health and how but also AI in health and where. So these are two critical elements we you need to keep in mind when you're talking about adoption. Let me begin with something which is not

agreed by everyone. My strong belief is that that AI today particularly in Indian setting is the greatest enabler that health sector has seen so far.

At the same time, I also believe that this is not equal to healthcare delivery in India. And that is something that I would like to stress why I say this.

See there are a few questions you need to ask when you are talking about AI. But before I say this let let us remember that we have come to a stage where you just cannot do without it. So

now the issue really is how to adopt it. You need to ask questions to yourself. Does this improve access? Is this creating better quality equity? Is this being more affordable

particularly in you know uh a low resource setting in India and does this have acceptance and understanding. See ultimately any technological

intervention must benefit someone. There are two players in this. One is the healthcare providers and one one is the health seekers.

So who does it benefit and how is the great question that we need to debate and most of all I feel that we need to really look at AI from the angle of how well it integrates

with the current programs and policies because standalone systems so far have not shown good result to One of the best usage of AI today is in

the diagnostic sector. Particularly if you look at the tier 2, tier three cities in India and the kind of uh resource setting that it is. the availability of diagnostic tools is

very limited and that is where AI becomes one of the biggest enablers to reach that tool to a person who can then you know uh I mean uh diagnose on the basis of what AI is. So diagnosis is a

very powerful instrument. The hubb spoke model which many have tried has been successful to a great extent and should be pursued. Second is that we can use AI

in screening that is one of the India's biggest problem in medical uh mobidity and mortality so far has been that patients come to the clinic or the doctor whoever

it is very late and then it is very [clears throat] difficult to handle the situation. A screening is an alert system and it eliminates unnecessary hospital

visits also. These are two great advantages that a patient will have if you use AI in screening and it is already in use and I think there's a potential of its growth to a large

extent. One example I can give is let's say TV screening. The best weapon to finish or eliminate TV from India is to do a proper screening and make sure

that we do not miss anyone and AI can be a great enabler there. Then I think we can also use AI for another purpose that is surveillance.

Disease warning systems particularly in today's setting are very critical to warn people and take precautionary measures and surveillance tools in AI have known to be very

effective. So we can use that in there. Then there is this whole question that people keep asking what about primary health care? What about preventive promotive health?

And that is where I feel we the clarity is still lacking. We tried uh tele medicine. Many people talk about let's say e sanji and other such modes. If you take the

total time that the patient spends on the call, I don't think any diagnosis is possible. We only playing around with numbers. So pyramid is seen at the end of the day

also needs a human face at the back end and we are finding it so difficult to get that. So the entire circle is not getting completed. I strongly feel that we will need to develop newer tools if

we want to enter preventive promotive health and primary health care very strongly in India. We still do not have that perfect tool which will define how it goes.

And there are many other things in the primary sector. I mean the biggest problem in the primary sector is the person who's using it at the PHC or this CSC or even the subcenter level has no

idea of what he is using. So when you reach this technology to him I think you need to reach awareness before you reach the technology otherwise the usage will not be the

best. You know, basically AI is a great tool when it comes to infrastructure building, particularly given the climate impact,

when it comes to resilient infrastructure, when it comes to reaching out to people with diagnostics and

it has to integrate with the national program and policies. It has to be an integral part of the entire pie of healthcare delivery system on a standalone basis as on date I don't

see much happening but signals are so strong that this will be one element which will drive our healthcare delivery very strongly in future and I hope in the right

direction. Thank you. Thanks. Thanks sir for for your insights and specifically when you mentioned that things like diagnostics, screening, surveillance are

the areas where AI can play a role. Uh seeing the ecosystem and seeing the kind of innovations and the expo one feels confident that solutions exist but one needs to now see that how they can be

scaled up and you also rightly mentioned that at the primary healthcare level is where the real challenge is both on the preventive side as well as maybe in the referral mechanisms that we have. term

medicine isn't the right solution. So sir glad to mention that under one of the program which you have also led at the national level the India partnership initiative a decision support system for

health and wellness centers has been prepared which kind of tries to take that step forward but of course we will need to see how it can be scaled going forward and I'm also glad to say sir

that we later from Nangata on the preventive side at least on mental health now solutions are coming up which can can act in in that space and can be scaled up uh But now going to you Mr.

Fin based on your experience of uh research and innovation systems in the European context as well as globally with other countries, what do you see the core foundational elements that any

systems or a country like India should have to enable institutionalization of these solutions which right now are there around us but we need something some common ingredient which is missing

right now or which needs to be there to take it to scale. what would that be in your view? &gt;&gt; Yes, thank you very much for for your question. Um,

actually I will I will first give you maybe a background but I will reply to you because the complexity of India is as much as the complexity of the European Union. You are several states

in one country. We are one union with several countries. So we depart from differing angles but we have the same situation. What I want to start with is uh that AI is not new. You mentioned the

dotcom uh boom. uh I remember when I graduate uh I had my first degree in medical science and then I moved to a a it because I was passionate about it and this was it back in ' 89 I was student

in Berlin University and at that time I was programming I don't know if there are telecom engineers here uh uh expert systems expert system in prologue in cobalt uh looking at database complex

database we had expert systems it was not called AI But AI is absolutely not new. What is new is the scale and the investment. And we have Mr. Mahipal here. Uh so but it it has existed. We

always had issue of how to make a system of accessing database more user friendly uh more sound uh and for me this is where AI is primarily coming from. Now uh so AI is coming from the data angle.

uh now on top of the data angle we are going to plug several type of tools. So but just to make it clear that AI comes from data and uh before I tell you what we Europe Union should do with India I

think we have to be extremely clear and we had the EU India summit with the EU president just three weeks ago here. AI is about data. data do not belong to one country do not belong to uh one company

I'm not quoting name on the western side of Europe but we in Europe and India we must own our data we must own our digital technology we must invest more uh probably India has been slow in

investing in digital even though you have talents who are working in America uh or in Europe similarly for EU we have to take recapture shows this. It cannot be that one country predicts the world

and it cannot be that five companies predict the world on our data. Data belong to the owner. They don't belong to anyone else. So this is a regulatory uh starting point that we especially

government and I'm sure Mr. Mishra would agree we must fight for. Number two is uh what AI is unfolding. AI is an an enlar especially you mentioned the context of in India in rural areas in

global source. Uh AI for us in Europe is different. AI for us is a situation where we have less and less doctors. Uh you have large population we have less. So AI will help to replace the doctors

not to replace the patients. Uh so we are starting from different angle but those could be complimentary. Uh what we must work together between EU and India is uh using AI for example for modeling

new molecules. Of course all the screening especially in India because you have a large population on a rare rare disease AI makes sense but a screening uh is not only the one

plugging uh second plugging is design of molecules with a rapid rapid development. My sister is a head of Novatist in Switzerland. So uh they are using AI and just to tell you and give

you some some examples. Last year the European Union we enabled an act by which we recognize the European medical um association and agency European medicine agency is recognizing the use

of AI for prototype team uh is recognizing the use of AI for clinical trials. So this is quite new. It's only two years ago. uh so another aspect of between EU and

India must be the interoperability of data. So medical records we should use AI clearly uh in order that if a patient uh is moving or traveling abroad uh uh the medical record follows uh so of

course within the EU because it's a common market but even outside uh and to be interoperable and and and having a common standards is the best way that no one is owning your data. uh you are

extremely strong uh and I have this telecom background to uh so I know what I'm talking about in in in India of opensource you are open-source defender we are the same in Europe we must depend

uh defend open source especially in a domain of healthcare so uh those were a few pointers of what we could do together uh maybe in the second part of the panel uh we will um discuss about

financing financing is a big issue uh uh because if the money is not going to health maybe it goes to somewhere else and we in Europe we need health uh improve

improvement of health systems as much as you do in in India you need it in India because you have a large population we need it in in Europe because we have less less medical staff so but we need

investors we need VCs uh and maybe those VCs I was speaking with Mr. Mahipal should work together. It's not only gov togov. It's not only business to business. It's the VC's fun of funds in

Europe should work with fun of funds and identify common pilots to run in India. Back to you. &gt;&gt; No, thanks. Thanks Mr. Felen. I think very valid points in terms of data forms

the basis for uh the entire AI infrastructure and I think you rightly said that AI is not new. I think it's just that computational power has increased now that we can make use of

the algorithms that existed in the past. But your second point is much more on point that capital is what is going to be required the most to take things to scale. And before we go to the VC world

or the private investment, I think two key pillars that come before that is the philanthropic capital and coming to you Dr. Ishita coming from CIF's perspective and what kind of changes are you seeing

in the public health space and how is your thinking as a philanthropic organization which has been on forefront of development working with the communities how do you see AI playing a

role in this space &gt;&gt; is this working &gt;&gt; okay uh thank you for that question I'll start by saying that uh the foundational principles that have driven philanthropy

uh are not changing with uh the emergence of this uh AI uh paradigm. So for example, for us at the Children's Investment Fund Foundation, we remain committed to reaching women and children

who are the most vulnerable. We remain committed to backing solutions that are evidence-based and driving impact that is measurable. We also remain very intentional in our approach of aligning

with the government priorities because we uh recognize that sustainable impact can only happen through the public systems. Having said that while those principles are constant um our

operationalization of those principles is definitely shifting. So for example uh like like seek commission sir said to begin with there are existing inequities in the health system and what we are

observing is that uh with the advent of AI especially its deployment at the front lines there is a chance that some of them might get reproduced or might get amplified. So our role as a

philanthropy comes in to safeguard against that in the systems that we help build for the government. We are going to be very intentional to prevent emergence of these new inequities or to

help bridge these access gaps if they get created somewhere. We see a lot of examples now you mentioned decision support systems LLMs a lot of them when they are being used by the frontline

workers they need to be deeply contextualized. We see a lot of computer vision models or even for diagnostics. Our job is to ensure that they are trained with the right kind of

representative data sets especially for example uh on children with rare diseases or children with disabilities. uh we need to ensure that the digital tools that uh we are creating they are

made to work in situations where there's going to be low bandwidth where there is going to be an operate the operator using them is not going to have the highest levels of literacy. So we see

the role of philanthropy in coming in here to stress test technology uh to ensure that it is adaptable in these realities of the public systems. Apart from that uh what we are also having to

change is definitely our own agility. So the pace at which the AI uh adoption across the health systems is progressing. We are definitely having to come in a lot earlier and support faster

cycles of innovation. However, at the same time, we are having to ensure that the faster pace of innovation still meets the rigor that is needed to uh for it to be adaptable in the public

systems. Uh and while we are uh fastening up pace of uh operationalization, I think there is also an increasing understanding in philanthropy that the

capital that we deploy will need to be very patient. These systems are evolving in real time. The innovators are learning. We are learning with them. The government is adapting to these and we

are we're sitting at the AI summit today. The government has been very responsive to these changes. But at the same time, we understand that there there will be a need to iterate these

solutions till they are made uh absolutely fit for purpose for the situations where uh they are going to be deployed. So broadly the why is not changing for philanthropy but the how is

shifting. &gt;&gt; Thank you for bringing the points around the need for be agile as well as patient. So while it means that AI is moving fast so we have to be agile but

at the same time we have to have the patient capital available to ensure that those catalytical solutions are kind of tried tested and showcased to the government to take it up further and

Nathan to you as well like it's it's great to see CSR doing a lot of work but then also a PSU like Indian oil spending up lot of its CSR on technology solutions. We have seen you support

drone solutions in the past for medical supplies. Now you're also looking at AI solutions. What is the thought process behind that? How much is AI being driven within Indian oil itself as well as how

you are seeing uh it impacting your CSR work? Uh thank you Machu G for the question. Uh well I'll pick up from uh what Mishra sir just stated uh as far as uh and link

it to CSR part. See he said uh as far as CSR is concerned I'll say the belief the faith combined together leading into acceptance of what is being done as far as AI

interventions in the systems are concerned is very important and where they are being implemented. So now at Indian oil being a PSU and uh I'll talk maybe you know having an

opportunity to interact with other PSU members also we are still uh uh like uh more into when we talk about the AI uh interventions in the healthcare sector

we are more into the equipment part we focus on the capital expenditure. So now that is uh uh one we consider this as one of the barriers and uh the barrier is in the sense that uh that is how the

policy gets defined. It's the the what we are looking at uh is the support from the government infrastructure uh from the government hierarchy in the sense that uh we are able to you know

take the solutions which are provided by the AI. Now AI solutions are more or less if you see apart from the equipment if you look at it at the other uh sustainable if you want to make it a

sustainable models they will be more of operational expenditure which more or less majority of the PUS PSUs tend to avoid again due to there are the policy uh interventions which are there uh

which uh you know prevent us from uh seeking or asking uh maybe measuring the benefit the measuring the impact on the uh the beneficiaries that are uh coming up uh

uh in this in this entire process are covered in this entire process. So AI still to us is uh like a stethoscope in this century as far as healthcare is concerned which is uh reading diagnosing

and you know trying to enter into the ecosystem of the PSU's uh CSR. So uh that is something where uh uh you know we want to progress more and more. We want to have these interventions more

and more and uh as you just said uh uh that we at Indian oil itself if I talk about we are already sir was talking about measure s was talking about diagnostics screening we've been doing

that we are providing high-end equipment to uh you know not only the premier institutes but even at uh the at the rural levels we are providing TV diagnostic equipment which is again AI

based equipment but Again the equation is that everything goes around the capital part of it, the equipment part of it but the end result how do I measure it? How do I benefit see the

benefit out of it takes some time. Now the policies the nuances associated with it do not allow me to go beyond a period of 1 + 3 years. So the AI system that or the interventions that I might have in

in the current scenario or in the future to come in the re recent future would be something that will not allow me to go in for certain projects which might be very beneficial for the community as far

as CSR is concerned. So what we are looking at is that uh we are having maybe in the near future and what we have done is we have started doing that all the PSUs have started doing that

that and uh we are having now collaborations we mainly focus on the capital part but then we have collaborations with the AI innovators and uh the institutes or the

organizations who are working in this field and we go in a hybrid kind of a model. So that helps us in the sense that we maintain the capex part also the focus on the capex part and the

collaborators that are pitching with us they help us in getting the data or the benefit which may be beyond the cycle of four years which may take time and which may need does take time to sustain or

give us some benefits. So that is how what we we look at uh CSR and then again CSR there is one more thing that uh maybe in due course of time will uh come in and will have to come in if we have

to look at uh the interventions that are increasing the way it is increasing is the thought process of the PSUs needs to change and it is changing I can assure you for that PSUs like the entire CSR

budget for the country is around 35,000 crores We contribute the PSUs contribute 17th of it. But that is the C and CSR fund cannot be looked at as if it is a

solution to the entire problem. CSR fund is basically a gap funding. So when you look at a gap funding you have to identify the right processes you have to and the most important thing in CSR as

on date in the country is the compliance the statutory compliances that we have to do to ensure that there is no misappropriation of fund at any level. So we are looking ahead with the for

partners and like this year itself in healthcare we have we have come up we have gone ahead with three particular projects where AI intervention is on a higher side. But now the problem that as

a PSU I am facing or being a functional head of a oil giant in this organization which has an average budget of around 500 CR to spend in uh every year. The problem I am facing I do not have

benefactors who are coming to me and asking me to you know have a collaboration. So that is something where we want to portray ourself all the PSU the entire

PSU network want to portray itself in the sense that we are looking for partners. We are looking for collaborations because the AI intervention as far as the PSU is

concerned will be most probably in and you can say in an entirety will be a two-stage process where in for the first uh 3 years maybe we will still continue with the traditional aspect and uh have

some small collaborations and then uh gradually maybe after four to five years we'll have uh when once the AI solutions provide provide us with the confidence we will have uh you know more funds

getting into it. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thanks a lot Nathan for bringing across a very key point collaboration. I think the point that you made that while you can put in money for capeex given your

constraints and policy issues and constraints on the CSR law in the country you need collaborators to come in who can provide the longterm vision for the programs and we cex is just

plugged in and I think maybe at some stage CIF and PSUs could also talk together and see how collaboratively work could be done. Uh but the big elephant in the room uh AJ is the

private capital because government will come at one stage but a lot of money will need to be pumped in from the private capital side and uh both at the VC level and as well as the the P level

and you have played both roles across your funds. Where do you see the appetite for Indian AI solutions from the VC world from the P world and how is you seeing that market maturing? Are you

seeing enough pipeline of solutions uh that are investable? You have already invested coin quite a few but what's the road map that you see forward? &gt;&gt; Yeah. No uh that's a very interesting

question and thank you everyone for being here. Uh um and uh everyone has essentially supported this initiative at healthquise. We are essentially India's leading healthcare innovation and impact

fund and fortunate to have backed some of the uh marketleading companies in the healthcare AI space which have not just solved for affordability, accessibility and quality of care challenge in India

but also at the global level and some of the examples being and uh you know some of our portfolio companies are already here we have visa on the panel and we also have cure.ai AI being represented.

Uh both these companies essentially built their frugal innovative model in India and uh took those model after essentially scaling up in India for a certain time have then taken these

solutions global and both these solutions are now deployed in over 100 plus countries. Uh VISA in the AI and mental health space and cure in the AI radiology space. Uh so it's a classic

example of how uh you could essentially build uh great technological solutions uh at the at the cutting edge of uh innovation and uh it's built on Indian data. Indeed it was built at a time when

data was not even uh priced so heavy. Today if if somebody were to aggregate that kind of patient data that itself might cost you $200 million and above. uh but uh they were able to do this and

now they have a repository of over a billion images. uh so that allows them to essentially uh come up with uh solutions. They have 19 USFT approvals cure uh which is probably the highest

for an Indian company in the disease screening space and they have taken the solution from tuberculosis as my f fellow panelist said before 28% of the TB burden is in India and uh it's an

autonomous tool endorsed by WHO and is essentially used widely not just in India but in other emerging countries as well. Um similarly visa essentially uh has supported and promoted public health

uh not just in India but also in other emerging countries. So we see great solutions coming out of India. Uh however when you look at any AI company who's devising a solution in India, you

need to look at uh three pillars. Uh one is uh IP development. This itself the product development itself takes a lot of time and that's why it needs to be supported by long-term patient capital

in any form. uh plus also grant funding uh because these product to be developed essentially takes a certain number of time. You need great talent to essentially develop some of these

algorithms and essentially that becomes your uh foremost foundation for a great solution. Second pillar comes uh is adoption which is when you do pilots in healthcare specifically because it's a

sensitive sector you essentially need to drive numerous pilots and third comes your state of commercialization. So all of this essentially in case of great product companies take a lot of time and

that's why uh as my fellow panelist said you need a lot of patient capital and all forms of capital uh whether is government support grant funding private capital uh CSR funding all kinds of

capital for either at a project level some at a company level to essentially uh uh take these solutions uh to sort of all parts of the country and this is the only way because in India we are short

by 1 million uh doctors 2 million nurses, 3 million beds and if we essentially want to solve this linearly, you would essentially need over hundred billion dollar of capeex and maybe about

9 [clears throat] to 10 years to essentially do it infrastructure wise. So you need technology and AI solutions to essentially solve for this in a resource staffed country like India and

I think some of these companies have done a tremendous job and more are coming across the across the space from disease screening to diagnosis to uh to drug discovery. uh we are now seeing a

multitude of players coming up and uh it's a very exciting time to be looking at some of those early growth opportunities in India. &gt;&gt; Thanks. Thanks AJ. I think it's

encouraging to hear from you in terms of that how the solutions that we have already invested and how they have grown over the time and what kind of barriers new solutions would face entering who

are trying to enter now. Namita coming to you uh visa as as AJ also mentioned has scaled in many countries uh it's an Indian startup uh the idea came from India but I think scale up in across the

globe has been much faster and quicker than in India what is the key difference that you are seeing in the Indian context which which you have not faced abroad

when you have been scaling AI solutions so some light on that would be useful &gt;&gt; can you hear Hello. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I think it's better. So, I think

uh thanks for having me here and great question. I think so. VISA has been there for 7 8 years now and uh we have had successful commercial launches in uh US, UK, a bunch of other countries. uh

coming to India I think the two I would like to highlight is one just the socio cultural economic diversity in India and just understanding the nuances uh for us when we started I think the struggle was

how do you make this visa or the health care mental health help that we're giving available to a 13year-old girl in a tier 2 or a tier three city in Maharashtra right I think that was a

question and how do we make it intersect her real life so I think just the kind of u nuances that we had to face and solve for uh has been a eye openener in the Indian context. Uh so that's where

we came up with a very innovative solution of intersecting the phys the digital tools that we had within her physical world right and that that was the idea where dreamkit was born. uh

more about that later but yeah I think um that was a very very interesting learning experience for us and a challenge where we spent a lot of on ground effort to understand how do we

cater to the Indian problems how do we cater to the Indian mental health ch like what exactly are those like what are the mental health challenges that are there or pertinent to the audience

here uh I think the second one which was also a big roadblock was the lack of just a reliable um reimbursement pathways right like coming from US and UK uh there are very uh centralized

reliable systems of insurance or NHS in UK where they do the policy there there is a pay somebody who's willing to pay for uh general therapy but in this case even preventative therapy right I think

that was one thing that coming to India there was just a lack of like a central reimbursement pathway for us uh typically There are four players in the market right there is the user who is

the person or the patient in this case and or there is the employee and then uh employer and then there is the insurance right in India specifically for mental health and in more so in the

preventative mental health none of the three players are willing to pay uh so how do we and it could be lack of awareness or lack of just having a paying channel for it so I think just

being able to solve and just being able to commercialize uh or at least in the towards the idea of commercializing it has been a challenge. Uh so I think uh yeah those were the two big ones. Um

thanks thanks Samita for that. I think you rightly pointed. Yeah, you rightly pointed that uh besides the solution being there, besides the other the kind of ecosystem players sitting on the on

the DSC, you also need ecosystem players beyond that who is going to pay for that service ultimately is is the user going to pay is the insurer going to pay is the government going to pay because

that's very very critical for uh for scaling any solution. The bigger point that you made was that cultural context is very very critical. Uh for a solution like visa which is into mental health a

first generating awareness about mental health in the country is a big issue. Then saying that AI could solve a solution can provide a solution becomes a much larger challenge and that goes on

for other things as well. How comfortable are we in in this room? If tomorrow AI was to kind of suggest a prescription for us to kind of uh take medicine on, will we be comfortable with

that? So those cultural things also come into play a lot. I think it's been a very interesting discussion and I'm just also conscious about the time. So the second round I would want to kind of

take a very quick one. If if we were given a kind of a magic wand and uh we were to suggest few things which would change the paradigm for AI adoption in the country which will enable scale to

happen from perspective of the government from regulation from international corporation perspective what would that be uh CK sir would request your thoughts from the

government perspective what do you see as as the key game changers oh thanks in just about half a Thousands and thousands of brilliant solutions are being designed.

Not even 1/4 of them are going to scale. If they don't go to scale, do not benefit the large masses of population. So what can we do to ensure that they go to scale? I mean I won't go into details

but three quick points. One, stabilize them. finance them and encourage the one which you think is best suited for the setting for which it is being designed.

Second, integrate them with the overall national program in a manner where adoption becomes easier and acceptance becomes the norm. And third, I think if you want to design something

brilliant, it must reflect the felt need of the people. You can't design in isolation, however brilliant it is. You must address what the people want and what you think is most needed for the

country. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thanks a lot, sir. Fant from your perspective on global learnings. &gt;&gt; Yes, on global learning and I will be quick. I will not speak only about money

even though we definitely have to invest more. Uh it's a technology transition AI uh so any technology transition need a huge amount of finance. Uh no I want to outline quickly two aspects that we have

not discussed enough on the panel. Number one is a talent. Uh we must between Europe and and India you have talented engineers, talented doctors. we must train them to AI. So we must have a

curriculum of what this technology transition is bringing to practitioner to people in a hospital to so this talent aspect we is important. Number two ethics. Uh I believe this is a

common point uh at least that we have between Europe and and India is ethics. Everything you do has to be ethical. uh so from the I mentioned a lot about who owns the data but everything how you

have developed your software system how you you use it with your patient uh so we must work together and I will be very inclined to have master programs on ethics and AI in health uh bringing

European universities to to come to Indian universities how we do it in Europe how we approach how we teach young talent on ethics uh so I I don't speak about money, I speak about people.

&gt;&gt; Thanks, Dr. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Uh thank you. Uh sorry. Yeah. Uh so I think what is really needed uh and I speak from the philanthropy

perspective where we want solutions to ultimately be transitioned into the public system. uh what is really needed is again um incentivizing innovators to build for the problems

that are high priority on the government agenda and solve for the public systems. Uh you have Himmanu sort of wave that magic wand and brought together different types of capital. I think us

working together can ensure uh that we encourage the tremendous amount of innovation that naturally gravitates towards the private markets to also solve for these problems. Philanthropy

can be a starting point. we can help derisk those solutions and get it to a point where more sustainable forms of capital the eventual being government adoption but also private capital and

CSR can come in and support them. So that &gt;&gt; thanks &gt;&gt; just a just a quick one. I think government has taken a lot of

initiatives. I think we will see a sea change in next five to 10 years the the RDIF fund which has come about on the deep tech side. There's a separate 2,000 cr allocation for deep tech investment

separately and lot of DFI capital both from India and globally which is getting channeled into this. I think this should essentially allow for lot of patient capital to come in and uh uh lot of uh

innovative startups essentially now getting that uh funding to essentially build scalable sustainable solutions in India. So I I think exciting times are ahead for uh the Indian startup

ecosystem especially in deep tech and R&amp;D and AI &gt;&gt; with CI CSR perspective. I would just say that uh the evolution of AI systems will occur with governance, changes in

uh governance, financial measurement and the ecosystem levels. That is the only thing that will be required internally. The PSUs uh need to change uh with their approach. We have to move from an output

based uh approach to an outcome based approach. So this will definitely help in uh leveraging things. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I think two things I would like to highlight is one is if we could just uh

enable more collaboration between public and private. I think there's a lot of learnings on both sides and a lot of overlap. So if you can just bring all of it together and maybe from policym

perspective and running pilots perspective if you can come together more effectively and second is I think just a little bit more support from uh after I think the topic of this

conversation uh once we are done with a pilot and we know what to do with it I think that's where the support ends right and that's where we need more support uh so I think just more support

there would be really appreciated yeah &gt;&gt; no thanks thanks for ending on that point and that's where our initi ative that summit comes in where it tries to kind of take successful pilots to scale

and I we hope just that we can do that with many more uh startups. I think a very intriguing panel discussion we had and if I'm just trying to take notes and trying to take just the key words that I

heard which I think resonates with everybody in the room things around talent needs stabilizing solutions incentivizing and I can keep going on. I think it gives a good menu that one

needs to kind of take to the policy makers and say that okay you are doing ABC how can we tie all this together? how can we create an ecosystem or how can we create a platform which brings

all the players together and I think if we are able to do that as an outcome of this summit uh I think that will be a big step towards taking AI to scale in the country thanks a lot uh for all the

all the discussions we may just take one odd question if that's possible now before you take the question yeah I think we need far more attention on you know organization and we need many more

subsidies basically. &gt;&gt; Okay sir. &gt;&gt; Uh can we just take one more one question maybe? &gt;&gt; Yeah.

&gt;&gt; Um thank you so much for very interesting discussion. It was lovely hearing all of you. I was just wondering why AI is inevitable. The expansion of AI is inevitable in market uh markets

like India where uh labor is uh uh available extensively. How do we counter AI in service uh services not taking jobs of people uh because unemployment is a big issue. You mentioned about this

uh staff shortage in India. But while uh AI expansion uh as I mentioned is inevitable. How do we counter it with uh people losing their jobs and especially in uh countries like India where we have

uh 70% young population &gt;&gt; that's that's really a great worry but in one sentence you need AI in health to aid the worker not to replace it [snorts]

maybe quickly So I in expanding the insurance system because like if we adopt preventive care and all it will beneficial for

healthcare financing and this will become more uh I mean this will become more. &gt;&gt; So uh maybe I will just quickly answer that. See uh AI can play a big role and

already under APDM also NHA is using AI quite a lot to understand where the frauds are happening and as we are able to plug in those frauds uh the insurance premiums will come down and the coverage

would increase many fold. So yeah definitely has a big role to play there. With that thanks a lot. Thanks a lot everyone for being there. Thanks a lot to the panelist for your time
