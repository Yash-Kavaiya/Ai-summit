## 📝 Transcript

Director BIMTech Dr. Paramjit VP Data Science and Gen FI [applause] Mr. Prakash Tari Senior Director Engineering Ops Hub

Due to unforeseen lastm minute changes Dr. Praep Singh will not be able to join us. We are pleased to inform that Mr. Chhatt Jan COO Blue Machines will be joining us. [applause]

I now request all the panelists to kindly join us for a group photograph. It is truly an honor to have such a diverse and accomplished group of leaders shaping today's dialogue. I now

warmly invite Dr. Shoubachi Ray to initiate the panel discussion. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Good afternoon everyone. I there's a timer running in front of me which you

guys cannot see. So I won't waste the time and straight away jump into the questions. We got a great gathering of experts here and so we don't want to waste time listening to me. So I

straight away jump into the questions. I'll start with Shivas G Shivas G Japur Institute of Management is positioning itself as an AI native institution. Uh what do you think in that now that AI

has automated lot of decision making and other efficiencies of in the processes what do you think students must certainly learn in the coming years to become useful in the organizations or

wherever they they are? &gt;&gt; They say maybe live in interesting times and it was meant to be both a boon and a curse and I think uh we are definitely living in interesting times. uh we are

seeing a complete revolutionization of uh the white collar of the knowledge economy that was created in the last few decades. I think humans still have an essential role to play uh in this

economy irrespective of how much it changes. Uh few things are going to change for sure but as knowledge gets democratized today it's easy for each and every person to get the same amount

of knowledge uh from an LLM. So irrespective of your expertise, you have that knowledge. So one of the key things I think that is going to be extremely important is action orientation, right?

Do you want to seek more? Do you want to do more? Do you want to ask the next question? Do you want to pick up that phone and make a call you've been avoiding to do? So I think action

orientation is going to be extremely important. Secondly, practicing uh this AI and human partnership. So students need to work with AI continuously to see how this partnership works extremely

well. They can't just assume that one day we'll go to AI and figure it out. Uh the relationship between human and AI is going to be complex and working with it is going to be extremely important.

Thirdly, working in teams irrespective of how many AIs are there, the world is going to be inhabited by 8 billion or so people. So you're going to have some sort of humans in the loop making

decisions. How do you work with them? How do you do persuasion is a conversation that we were having just as we were waiting. Verbal communication is going to be increasingly important. And

lastly, I think a breath of knowledge, I think the MBA in that sense is very well placed. Uh because a lot of domain knowledge is going to be democratized, but how do you connect dots across

various fields of human and technological uh innovation is going to be extremely important in times to come. So these are the five things I think will be extremely important.

&gt;&gt; Thank you Shivasi. I think the young generation and the students in the audience should take note of it and these are absolutely on the mark. Uh I would now move to Mr. Johan. Uh you

could you elaborate a little bit about the idea of an online university and what is it that you as an university as your university is doing in the AI space? Uh thank you so much and thank

you Shivatz for having uh me here along with the Amity team sitting in the audience. Uh Amit online today is pioneering digital online education not only in the country but across the

world. Uh in 2019 uh 2018 the government released regulations to formalize online undergraduate post-graduate degrees like a BBA or an MBA or computer applications. In 2019, Amit was the

first university in India to get approval for licensing online degrees. And we are now uh educating more than 200,000 students across post-graduate undergraduate degree programs and it is

such an important requirement in the country where 40 million students have to enter the higher education ecosystem in the next 10 years. Uh it is impossible to open campuses, physical

campuses across the country. So through the power of digital India and the distribution of uh distribution of technology you know Amit online is really scaling uh online education

across the country where we are through AI really trying to personalize the entire education journey as well where we have a virtual uh professor virtual tutor on a learning management system

which can solve doubts through a socratic way through a socratic dialogue with the students to answer any doubts, any academic questions, administrative questions that the students might have.

We do a lot of AI simulations, AI assessments in our programs. All our examinations are AI proctored where students are personalized by there's an individual proctor AI proctor watching

each student while they're giving the assessment. A lot of our content is AIdriven uh where now because of AI power of AI the cost of content development has reduced by 10 times

which is a significant you know cost for any academic institution. So AI we're really in a remarkable time you know Dr. and and it is uh for institutions to really take the lead in trying to

implement and trying to uh pilot with platforms because why I say pilot is because we're also in work in progress as we know that models are changing every few months and now models are

building themselves so it's a really transitionary period where universities institutions like Japura like amity have to take the lead in the country and really uh get the best of AI practices

for students. &gt;&gt; Thank you Mr. Sean and the scale of operations that you've mentioned indeed a great fit for usage of generative AI in your kind of a setup. So look forward

to hearing more stories from coming out of AM. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; I'll now move to Dr. Rajiv. Uh you are a leading BIM techch and uh and I think uh

you also come from a finance background. I read your profile very keenly. If I ask you the question about trust, I mean we are all using AI uh a lot in our day-to-day life. Even students are

using, practitioners are using, but who is responsible? How do we answer the question to the stakeholders as to who builds trust? How do you deal with this question of trust in the usage of AI?

especially if you can focus on an educational institution setup &gt;&gt; the trust uh thank you I mean giving me this opportunity a very right question in today's day when we are talking to me

when Messen is you know doing lot of things so um to my feeling is the trust has to be you know the party who is developing a particular AI agent or model like

Japurya and uh you know amiti who are developing those AI agents or AI model the fundamental responsibility lies with them to integrate the trust component into that. So that is the first and

foremost thing they have to of course there is a lot of regulatory we are we are in a very exciting phase as Shivat said over a time period over some time period

you know the regulatory landscape will evolve right now regulatory landscape is not so uh strong and um uh so my answer to your question is going to be the fundamental responsibility lies with the

organizations the behemoths who are designing these you know AI I agents who are even AI agents have started building addition new AI agents. They have started becoming you know socritic and

so the primary responsibility lies with them and that can come only through a human intervention. A human will be having a ethical values you know what is right wrong the fairness component has

to be incorporated in fact I'm going to be giving an example to you that recently I heard that one of the B school has used a AI agent where they are screening students for their joining

the MBA program after that process they realized that the AI tools screened about students who are from vernacular medium. So speaking English is treated as a communication skill. Communication

skill is far beyond than speaking English. So communication skill is that I may not be a good speaker but I may be the one of the best communicator. The way I'm looking I'll be able to convince

talk to you. So the fairness part of it, the reduction of the bias, reduction of you know all these things has to be incorporated by the party who developing a AI agent. So I would like to be

sharing with two gentlemen who sitting next to me who are designing lot of AI tools. How are you going to ensure that fairness is in incorporated? How are you reducing your biases? How

are you ensuring that human oversight is there? If you are using a examination tool for a student, you are giving a grade. How do you know that the student is really really graded properly? Some

kind of a human oversight probably at some point in time is required. &gt;&gt; Thank you. I think very vital points about the responsibility lies on the human especially the developers. I'll

now move to Dr. Talwart. Uh I have clustered the questions. So I've got the four academicians and the leaders of academic institutions in one cluster and the three industry people in the other

cluster. So that's how I'm doing it. So Dr. Talwar, my question to you, you are leading a global university in India. So there are clearly models that come across about how AI is being used in a

global setup and how we are looking at AI within our education setup. When you look at Scandinavian countries for example, there's a move which is a push back. they are saying that let's do less

of that and more of books and pen papers more of where the cognitive forces are more much more needed. So what is your take and how do you see this kind of a dichotomy?

Thank you very much Dr. Ray. I think it's a very valid question. Um obviously um AI in whatever form we'll see it trans transitioning is very useful for a country like ours right. So if you have

1.4 4 billion people and of course we are looking at trying to evolve a lot of people in terms of education uh it makes a lot of sense to adopt it. Now u to your question about uh University of

Southampton and how they are able to integrate this from an Indian context perspective. Obviously we have a long-standing AI policy. Now this AI AI policy is around responsible usage using

it for critical thinking purposes and of course academic integrity. So these are the core principles on which the AI policy exists and the whole idea is to be able to in a sense transliterate or

transfer transition a lot of that thought into our growing campus as we speak. But what you have to remember is from an Indian perspective there's a lot of um variation a lot of difference you

know why we using the AI for example um so the question is not necessarily just about technology the questions about humanity questions about the leadership uh one is able to uh you know

let's say practice in this context there's massive language diversity right u there's massive massive differences in terms of the access that people have so there's a bit of an assumption sitting

here that you know all of the people who might make use of AI are very much similar to us which may not necessarily be the case. So are we factoring that in? Are we contextualizing that as well?

Are we ensuring that we ourselves you know in universities and academic institutions are able to make that kind of investment? Right? What you have to remember is from an Indian perspective

and this is not just about Southampton. I'm talking in general. I think there are certain aspects and the bigger aspect is you know our ability to be able to invest in the computing power

that you know is required to make full use of AI as we speak in the Indian context right. uh what's going well for the Indian context we know the corporate world has moved on right but what is

required from our perspective is how is a student able to experiment how is a student even a faculty able to able to experiment in that context are they comfortable are they utilizing it in the

right way how AI is being used in the Indian context maybe a little different language um diversity is different how we think about English is quite different and then we express that

language uh in the way the world wants to see it maybe we don't want to express it in that way are we factoring that context in apart from that I think you spoke about the trust that becomes a big

element right um sometimes you know we tend to um you know uh believe that somebody's guilty before proven innocent so maybe that kind of thought process also works when somebody's using chat

GBT right uh those are things that we obviously have to consider as we go forward so what I'm trying to argue here is that yes we will be you know any university coming from abroad will be

applying a certain AI policy but is it contextualized is it fulfilling employability outcomes is it fulfilling usage outcomes is it fulfilling trust outcomes that becomes very important

yeah thank you thank you Dr. Well, I think I think the diversity point and the localization point that you referred to is extremely important and I think uh anthropic opened its office in Bangaluru

and I I think that's a big move towards perhaps more localization for the Indian uh context. Uh I'll now move to Dr. Paramjit. uh as someone who has actually implemented AI solutions in

organizations and you have spoken to leaders across various industries. What according to you because we are all all hog into full steam into AI but what according to you are some of the

fundamental misconceptions that you may have come across when speaking to leaders about AI that will be extremely important for us within the education industry also to understand. Please

&gt;&gt; uh I think first of all thank you I would like to thank Japur Institute for for giving me the opportunity and and allowing me to share my experiences. So when it comes to the business leaders

especially uh around the AI adoption so there are there are few changes what we observed in the last couple of years right not maybe in the decades but especially in the last couple of years.

So I remember I think just three or four years down the line four years earlier I remember that when we when we were visiting some of the business leaders right and we were

trying to convince and we were trying to understand their businesses and how they can leverage how they can leverage the data into into their operations how into their businesses right so they had a lot

of data but they were not sure how to leverage it right so that time that was the one extreme part of it but now suddenly I think in the last two in the last one two year what we have observed

suddenly the game has changed and now the expectation and everyone wants to get into the AI but Now their expectation has gone to the next level. Right? Now they want to do everything

with the AI. Right? So there are a lot of applications, there are a lot of use cases, right? From the education industry to finance to healthcare to automotive, whatever industry you take,

there are hundreds of use cases. Right? Now the the one of the misconception still as of today what we observe is now the expectation has gone to the next level. So their expectation basically

that whatever the solution whatever the use case they have in mind they want to achieve sort of the 100% accuracy right so in AI world there is nothing 100% accuracy there is sort of approximation

right so maybe the accuracy start comes with iteration and that's how the system evolves right in two months in 3 months in 6 months or in a year in the first draft we cannot have a working solution

which gives you the end to end solution or which works for each and every scenario that that doesn't work every system every product whatever you have in mind that evolves over a period of

time that needs a lot of I mean lot of feedback lot of feedback goes into the system keep on evolving keep on improving right that's how system improves and that is I think one of the

misconception that they want to achieve right they have a lot of expectation and they want to achieve everything through AI there there is a that's that's where the feasibility analysis comes

Right? There are things which are possible through AI but there are few cognitive skills which still AI lacks and maybe the R&amp;D is going on maybe in the next few few years down the line

maybe agents might have the cognitive capabilities as well and right and maybe we might be one level ahead but as of today there are certain limitations and those limitations I think every

businesses have has to bear as of today. &gt;&gt; Yeah great point Dr. Wjit I think you're very right. I think geni or AI applications are always work in progress. I mean it's never a final

frontier because not only the model is changing but your own data is changing, context are changing, efficiencies etc. Thank you. Great point. I'll come to the youngest member on the panel now but uh

he leads uh blue whales.ai one of the top voice agents perhaps a pioneering one in the country. I used to watch air.ai AI which was available in US at some point of time I don't know if it's

still there which also did something like what you are doing now maybe something more you are doing so I would my question to you would be uh from an educational institution point of view

Shivaji mentioned about what are the important uh you know skills that today's generation of MBA students need to have I would like to ask you that what would be the biggest impact that a

voice enabled environment an AI I chat bots or voice bots you may say would help or can facilitate within an education uh industry or a setup. Uh thank you Dr. for uh sharing this

opportunity and extending this. Uh I think uh see when we think about blue machines as a voice AI platform uh we are basically use case agnostic. Uh the use cases don't essentially come from

us. Uh we are limited by our own imagination. A lot of times students and faculty and leaders are the ones that are coming to us with hey these are interesting examples of uh how voice can

improve the educational experience inside a university inside a school. Um there's a couple of areas we've been exploring with some uh educational partners. Uh and I think some people in

the audience might find it relatable. Um so first of it is I would say teaching assistance. Uh so a lot of times uh you know you have a course uh maybe you missed a class maybe you were sleeping

in class uh whatever happened but you missed a certain concept that was critical that the professor was explaining right now you're studying before an exam at 12:00 in the night and

you don't have someone to call right like you have uh maybe your friend has gone to sleep you don't have a teaching assistant to call so an AI voice agent that is specifically trained on the

lesson plan that was available uh that morning or or the past week allows you to have a very personal and safe conversation um and understand uh you know the student can ask a question

understand the concept and then of course learn how to apply that uh for an exam the next day so teaching assistance has been an interesting area uh one that we've doubled down upon uh at UPNA and

blue machines is uh basically supporting students with uh interview prep so every time again you're going out for interviews especially many of you that might be graduating soon. Um the idea is

that uh you want to share your story, your narrative uh properly. Uh often times we're conscious about our uh you know language skills. We spoke about English uh being a criteria that uh you

know many organizations are looking for. So I think a lot of times an AI coach is available to not only help you fluently speak uh and of course it's all about practice uh but also I think in any job

role that you have you're able to simulate uh a potential interview and again practice your answers, practice your responses. So these are just a couple of areas where we've seen voice

AI have uh interesting applications for students uh universities even in assessment for that matter. um you know we are seeing universities think about uh viva based assessments right like

that uh a lot of times now offline it's easy to submit assignments using chat GPT or perplexity or other tools but the thoroughess of your understanding is communicated when you are explaining the

idea um and uh and at least an early assessment can be done using an AI agent and then of course professors and faculty uh follow from there so again as I said like a lot of use cases just up

to all our imagination &gt;&gt; yeah thank you very much and I think as educators we fully realize that point that you know particularly in the area of assessments I mean I think some new

fresh ideas innovations are time has come for that today I'll Mr. Mr. Praash Tari last but not the least on in this round you know when we build AI solutions there are lots of pilots are

there that are happening in every organization even in educational institutions even at Japurya but when you try to scale them up you know build for larger audience maybe larger

audience beyond the institutions sometimes what challenges you foresee when you're trying to scale up AI applications especially for the education sector

&gt;&gt; or even in general like scaling up large AI in &gt;&gt; so uh based on my uh experience in building integration solutions for

enterprises one uh one lessons quickly coming right uh is AI generally AI solutions fails uh not because model is weak it fails

because it doesn't have access to right data at right time this is very important very critical and the same thing can happen in educations as This is called uh data silos problem.

Very common and very challenging problem in industry. Uh and it will miss the context as uh Mr. Bisal has pointed out if you don't have context it will very difficult to uh work with that. Okay. Uh

so and there like you know education educators has to think like how how to define their data pipeline very carefully and very thoroughly. uh very simple examples I would like to

say in education setup right suppose a school wants to deploy AI options which uh identify a student who needs academic uh support in earlier stage and a school is just giving access to let's say uh

attendance record and LMS record the school has data of extracurricular activities so of course in this setup if you see right uh AI We'll find uh like something if uh a student having low

attendance and low scores quiz scores probably the right candidate but may not be true if you see in the holistic right if he has full context right it the same student may be leading maybe like you

know captain of cricket team who is bringing lots of glory and medals to the schools. So okay so data silos is the real problems and uh educators has to think in that direction. Second problem

which is very very critical and I come from that background integration is everything. Okay. If you want to esco scale uh to adopt AI if uh you know the questions uh you should

keep in mind or you should ask right how seamlessly AI solutions is uh getting integrated in your systems. Okay. If a teacher has to if a teacher is a professors come into the class and

he has to do lots of work just to use a tool then probably uh right you know your AI adoption is going to fail that's for sure okay so it works in your context okay and the last part everyone

is talking on that that I just want to give a structure in that like AI must explain okay if AI solutions doesn't have like you know explanability

uh then it won't build the trust uh so and uh these are the challenges uh sorry lessons which one have to keep in the mind. &gt;&gt; Thank you. I think these are very

classical challenges for any system and you're very right. I mean you can't just leaprog into an AI system until your data is done right. you have a data warehouse or a lake and the the topology

and everything is set and great points and I think the same reasons why systems fail continue to persist even more AI applications. Yeah. So I'll come back to Shivas G now. Uh

Shivas G taking a leave from your first point and that Japurya is an AI native school. Could you highlight some examples where where Jaurya is investing or will continue to invest that would

you know take the the offerings and services and the educational experience of the students to the next level. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So when we talk about the learning experience, we have to realize that

there are two sides to it, right? One is the technology side. What can technology do? But then there's the human side. What in terms of human cognition, in terms of human learning, human

motivation, what works? And uh as much as I'm uh all in on AI, we have to realize that all the studies say that relatedness, the relationships that students have with their teacher,

whether it's in primary school, grade school, university, business school, and the relationship that they have with their peers inside the classroom, outside the classroom are extremely

important to learning. So AI is unlikely to completely append these relationships even if it is technologically able to do so. We still have to download this content or learning or skills into a

human being right uh not into a computer system. So we will continue to invest in the student teacher relationship through better pedagogy through more mentorship through more peer-to-peer interaction

which I think even as I answered in my first question is going to be a key skill uh for tomorrow. So in terms of teachers, it's not that AI especially towards the higher end of institutions

is going to replace the teacher but yes it is going to replace part of the job of the teacher and uh faculty members who are able to use AI in terms of course development as Ajit spoke about

or in terms of teaching assistance and so on are likely to be better teachers are actually likely to have better relatedness in the classroom. Coming to the part which AI will automate. Um I

think specifically there are two resource constraints right. One may be a context or expertise resource constraint. However good your faculty is they cannot know everything. Uh and the

second is their time. Uh they are likely however good your student faculty ratios are they cannot be available for each student 24/7. So when we talk about uh as my colleague from up now also spoke

about uh as we uh think about you know training people for interviews AIS are likely to have better context from what the job actually requires then any faculty can have for hundreds and

thousands of available jobs. Their AIs are likely to better be able to use your CV along with uh the context of the job. they are likely to be available 24/7 uh at midnight at 2:00 a.m. if you want to

practice for something. Similarly, I think it's going to come in practice assessments as well like uh right now there's only one exam uh because mostly there's only a certain amount of faculty

available to create exams and check exams. So even if that one exam remains human assessed, you may be able to have practice exams that are AI assessed so on and so forth in times to come. So I

think um towards the higher end of learning it's going to be a partnership between human beings just because of the relatedness factor relatability the human relationship factor and AI for

doing tasks where there's a constraint on human time or on human expertise and context. Thank you Shivaj. Uh coming to you Mr. you uh talked about the scale of your operations and kind of AI

implications you're doing but looking at your the next 5 years ahead what would be your strategic priorities as far as AI would be concerned given the scale of operations that you have.

&gt;&gt; Uh very important question but firstly let me compliment you Dr. Subji because not easy to manage a panel of seven people. You're doing a wonderful job at it.

&gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; they're cooperating 100%. &gt;&gt; Um 5 years down the line is very difficult to tell Dr. Subju because &gt;&gt; the technology is changing so fast and

getting disrupted so fast. Uh it is difficult to predict what will happen 5 years down the line. But one year down the line uh we have a clear-cut policy and uh as Amity and um Amity online

particularly we have a governance framework and a policy framework in place where uh AI has to be implemented in these respective fields and piloted in in these respective fields whether it

be for students like I mentioned for personalized learning one-on-one learning with uh the um AI bot that we have whom we call professor Amy she's in a third version now a Socratic Socratic

version. So more dialogue with the student and really leading to positive outputs than just giving direct oneline answers to the students or be it you know with our content team where we have

where we're developing a lot of content and a lot of that goes to to your question because now with AI tools we're able to really replace a lot of content that is getting obsolete perhaps every 6

to 8 months. Uh with AI tools now it's possible to develop that content in in few hours. We recently launched a school of AI where we have launched 11 new 3-month certification programs for

different industry tracks. So whether it be an AI for manufacturing, AI for educators, uh AI for healthcare, AI for you know IT telecom etc and so on. We've launched a three-month industry oriented

uh taught by industry practitioners courses for students, final year students, working professionals, enthusiasts and curious students who want to learn uh and who can really plug

in these courses into the real into their into their work life. So we have a governance framework in place and a policy framework in place where we are taking conscious decisions on where we

want to implement AI and how we see the outcomes of those experiments or those integrations that we are doing and and after one year we will take a call on what has to be what has to continue what

has to be enhanced and what areas of AI implementation AI integration uh have to be uh kept with the institution but it goes without saying that AI is disrupting every single sector and

education will be one of the most important and like Shad said that teachers will never go out of loop because there has to be a human in the loop system and uh and for

that I believe there should be and I believe uh through the impact AI summit there's a Delhi AI regulations coming out which is being released where hopefully there's an education

regulation as well that where all or what are the use cases of AI integration AI implementation and how far can you go and how far and where should you draw the line that you say that okay human

works with the students in in the future. But as we know that for students uh Shots like you mentioned AI bots will be like digital teammates in a workplace you know where uh where they'll be with

the individual throughout the working journey or the student journey. So so it's important for students uh to really understand uh AI before they get into the workplace. Right. So another another

thing that we're doing is um we for all our students for all our online students but also for our uh regular full-time students we have launched a basics of AI fundamentals course as well where it's

mandatory for all students to take up that course because one should know you know what you're really experimenting with and students should be aware that these are the tools and these are the

areas that can be implemented for productive purposes and productive uses. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you. That's a very pretty diverse portfolio you highlighted. Uh Dr. Rajiv coming back to

you. Uh uh so traditionally we know how to do ROI evaluation but if an education institution is looking at AI applications in its education processes or or dealing with faculty and staff

what I mean it's it's it's not a solved problem yet. How do you look at ROI uh of such uh investments for an educational institute? &gt;&gt; So he you are choosing to ask finance

question to me. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Your finance. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. &gt;&gt; So um um see

building you know investing in chairs, tables, buildings we have done. every institution has done. Okay, those are core requirement, core ingredient

and today time has come for every institutions to invest in AI and we many times we see the ROI in a very short-term narrow view. What is my

return next year and next to next year? human development the impact of any investment on human development has to be looked from a very distance point of view and I'm sure all of you will agree

that education is not aiding life education itself education is the life so if we are taking students investing in AI making them more industry ready making them see uh what probably is not

visible to them awakening their joy of learning you know their 2:00 they have a you know AI assistant which is helping them to become a better individual I think this is the best thing which we

can do and my you know you know institutions which are reposing a significant amount of faith and investing in AI I think they should not be worried too much about uh the

immediate ROI because I strongly feel feel that you know this ROI is going to help their institution the uh you know the uh students in a in days to come immensely. So in fact every institution

like my institution we are empowering my faculty members any AI training any analytics training anywhere you want to go go ahead and do it. We have invested in Bloomberg lab we are investing in AI

analytics lab. So every institution is doing and probably this is the right thing to do without worrying too much about return on investment. Return on investment is going to come. It will not

be in in the instantaneously it will not come. It'll take some time but I think we must invest in it. &gt;&gt; You're very right. I think we should have a much longer horizon and a much

broader understanding of return of investment and not just a pure financial metric. Thank you Dr. Dr. Talbar coming back to you. I mean uh uh could you uh kind of uh from your experience uh

highlight if there is some adaptation challenge of a global model to an Indian context that you may have encountered at your institution and uh what were some of those nuances that you might have

faced uh during that adaptation. So I think that's a very valid question. Obviously um you know foreign higher education institutions are looking at um extension of global curriculums

contextualization of global curriculums and a similar thought process has to also uh be brought in with respect to anything that aids or helps learning. I think the fundamental principle of um

you know uh remains the same you know whether it's uh in the UK whether it's in Australia whether it's in India. uh and the bigger question there is that are we looking at this as support or are

we looking at this as intellectual outsourcing right I think if I look at it from a work perspective and what's happening to work if I if I kind of look at three layers if I look at skill set

as three layers high skills medium skills and let's say not so you know high skills or lower level skills um the middle level skills are where uh most institutions possibly operate right

especially when early career students are giving the institution and going forward. The middle level skills is where a lot of shrinking is expected to happen. It's already happening, right?

So the bigger task for us as institutions is how do we push a lot of our um students up into the higher skill side? This links up to the critical thinking. This links up to the problem

solving. Now for that to happen successfully, should we just look at this as a mechanism for intellectual outsourcing? And that's that's the biggest challenge,

right? The biggest challenge for us is how do we create frameworks within the institution to ensure that the AI is able to help and I'm you know I'm very glad with the kind of products and the

kind of solutions that are on offer here as well as let's say at Bhat Mandapam and the kind of showcasing that's happening but I think it's a very thin line the thin line is depends entirely

on the academic structures it depends entirely on how the faculty and everybody else in the system are also trained enough to be able to ensure that the nudge is happening in the right

direction. Right. So I think while the global global frameworks are fine while we know that we can extend a lot of these frameworks around academic integrity around responsibility around

responsible AI how is it being used and that's where culture comes in right and somebody said and uh is this thing about you know culture eat strategy for breakfast and you know supposedly

Michael Porter had said it but a lot of people say he hadn't said it but whatever whoever said this &gt;&gt; is actually very relevant right how do we ensure are we designing for the elite

Are we designing for the median? Right? Are we being able to uh calibrate the faculty? These are big questions that we all have to be able to answer when we are setting this up as leaders within uh

any institution. It's not just about foreign enterprises or foreign universities. It's about um even uh Indian higher education ecosystems. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you Dr. Talvwar. I

think very valid points indeed and and both of you and Dr. Rajiv emphasized on the fact that faculty upgradation is also equally important and they they become fully aware of uh how best to use

this and not cognitive offload whatever they're supposed to do. Uh coming to Dr. Paramjit I think uh I wanted to ask you a question about uh trust you know I I mean you talked about misconceptions and

expectations from AI last the previous question. Uh how does one build trust? How does one go about building trust? I mean is there a few two three four things that one must do for stakeholders

students parents or anybody else who's using the system to have trust in that system. So I think trust on AI system I think that is one of the fundamental questions. Yeah

&gt;&gt; right that that generally come across any businesses you interact with anyone the first question is that how would I trust your system that that is the fundamental question we get from

everybody right so as I mentioned earlier so first of all the [clears throat] system evolves right you won't get a system right in the first iterations that is an iterative process

right so the similar to right if I interact with someone right maybe on the first interaction I might not believe him 100%. Right? So the more interactions right the more number of

times I interact with him the more interactions I have with him right so there will be a mutual trust which eventually builds up the same principle applies here right so in the first model

that you get the first output the first application that you would get that may or may not solve 100% of your problems that is where the human in the loop is is very important here I think madam was

also pointing pointing out the human in the loop. So human in the loop. So I think to to answer trust there are couple of things and the trust basically there are certain other

KPIs right. So when we talk about the trust so indirectly we are talking about the accuracy of the system indirectly we are talking about the helpfulness of the system right we are also talking about

the explanability part of the system which I think sir was also pointing out right so there are certain KPIs right once you have once you met those KPIs it builds the trust into the system right

so now indirectly we have to make sure that to build those systems we have to go at par against those KPIs. And now that is where the human in the loop comes in because humans are the expert.

They have that cognitive capabilities. they have that right they their compute power may not be as at par with with the AI systems but their cognitive skills right but their their power basically to

remember and to have that historical memory right that's far more than the AI system as of today right so that basically human in the loop helps you to improve your system right so once you

get that feedback slowly you try to improve your system right you add that feedback you take that as a positive and negative feedback and you try to improve your system. So that is basically an

overall evolution right. So with the evolution with the proper feedback with the right feedback at the right time right you make sure that your system is giving the right set of output and along

with that responsibility right the responsible AI framework ethical AI framework those are the standard frameworks which every application has to has to have into their into the

system. So trust is not just about the accuracy but it's about the responsibly presenting the content to the right people right so obviously in the education system that has a much more

relevance right so the the content that we are presenting to the student we have to make sure that it is right it is ethical it is responsible right there should not be any any illegal content

any any unharm I mean harmful content we should not present to the to the to the I mean to the users so that is where the trust comes into the system right and that

comes with the sort of feedback right evolution right that's how it builds up &gt;&gt; thank you I think there's a common thread that is emerging across the fact that there's a human has to be in the

loop all the time and uh I mean that's that's fundamental other than the frameworks that are already existing uh thank you Dr. Uh coming to you once again. Uh

you have you are leading an AI company and you are seeing a lot of changes that are happening in the space with agentic AI now and with lot more autonomy agents performing on their own and maybe little

less human in the loop than earlier. So how do you see the job roles that are available in the market? what kind of transformation you are seeing that it's very important for young students to

understand you know what is becoming what are job role looks like how what are the main areas of change that is happening today no that's a very very pertinent question uh for today's uh day

and age uh see I think any big technological shift that comes in right like whether it was the internet in the late '90s cloud mobile like all of these new technological shifts come with new

opportunities um I I think the the entire archetype of the job itself the the role in the workplace itself changes and we are seeing that happen in the uh AI space as well. Um I think I often say

that you know when answers are now available in abundance the person who's asking the right questions is the one who's really standing out. So I think as uh everyone sort of preparing for roles

in the workplace now it's a lot about uh thinking of a generalist mindset right like uh uh I think as many of us in the panel just said that there is a human in the loop so who is that human in the

loop right like uh so I think when you I think there's a title now that's uh that palenteer originally popularized these are called forward deployment engineers and then there are uh evaluation

engineers uh these are two job roles which are becoming very very common and And I suspect like these are areas that enterprises will continue to hire from. I know I am currently hiring for a lot

of uh forward deployment engineers. Now I use the term engineer quite liberally here. Uh it's not necessary that you've had to do an engineering degree. You know how to write code uh to be a

forward deployment expert. Uh what this basically means is that a lot of enterprises are still in a very early stage of adoption of AI technology today. uh right and they need uh people

to come in and support that process all the way from identifying the right use cases uh to writing prompts in natural language I think everyone asks questions of chat GPT it's essentially a prompt

that you're giving to the model uh so prompt engineering is becoming very very important u and then finally as uh uh Dr. Dr. Paranjit also said that there is it's an iterative process right like so

you know you work with a model you get a response you evaluate the outcome and as a human you are still the one in control who's monitoring the outcome and deciding whether it was a good one or a

bad one so this evaluation process this iteration I continue to believe a lot of uh you know humans will be in the loop and for a lot of young students today being early adopters of technology I

believe they're very well positioned to educate others in terms of how to use uh AI technologies uh in their enterprises but it has to come with a very generalist mindset where you are equal

parts a good management and business person and an equal part good uh technologist as well. &gt;&gt; Thank you Sh I think very important and I think you are brought to the four two

very interesting roles that you you're hiring and what young people should be aware of. Thanks for that. Last question of the panel and to Mr. Praash is uh in critical applications of AI, what kind

of a governance structure would you recommend uh institutions to have uh for I mean if those are critical applications you know in terms of the policies frameworks the the data

governance rules what would be your advice to such leaders that how do you ensure that your application that you've created is actually uh well monitored let's just say

&gt;&gt; sure so I just want to refer Mr. Rajit talk which he has already discussed like how well he has implemented AI in educations with full governance and uh now coming to some of the terms and the

policies right so the first very non-negotiable which everyone is talking about and audience can now also tell human in the loop okay for any high stake decisions human must be in okay

teacher should not for examples like you know in the classroom if you are having AI solutions teacher should not surrender to the AI algorithms teacher should be uh given liberty to decide

human in the loop everyone is stopping this is a non-negotiable terms in the governance okay so educator must ask these questions whenever like you know they are adopting or deploying or

accepting an EI solution who decides this is a very critical part okay second part uh uh which I would like you know again uh explanability right AI must uh

explain why it recommended which uh Dr. Pam Pamjit has talked right now. It must explain why students, teachers, uh parents all deserve to understand why this recommendation coming, why this

career options coming for me. Uh Chit [clears throat] is also mentioned in that uh third part which really like which uh Mr. Prjit has frequently I mean in both talk he has referred this right

uh very important very underestimated continuous monitoring and the feedback right it's very very very very uh underestimated nowadays people like you know deploy solutions

and forget this is not going to work uh model decays population changes environment context changes right uh so you require to continuously monitor it Okay, feedback loop, iterative feedback

loop. Everyone was talking about that you require to have it feedback loop to improve. Okay. Uh so these are some of the things and uh as far as like you know one thing more I would like to say

like never uh one things which uh probably like you know we are underestimating is education for the teacher. Teachers also required to be well educated about what is AI and as

Chis told right it doesn't require a really engineering degree. They should be very much aware about what is confidence level, what is this terminology which how to use this uh to

make it successful. &gt;&gt; Thank you. I think we had a wonderful discussion. The timer is running short. I would have loved to summarize it but I'll just take 30 seconds. So there was

this very wise man who had answers to all questions. Think chat GPT. So one of the disciples decided to test that wise person. And he said he the disciple caught a fly in his hand and went to the

sage and said is the fly dead? Now if the if the if the wise man says yes then he'll let the fly live and open its palm hand or if the wise man says alive then it'll squash the the fly. So it was in a

little fix. The wise man was in a fix. So the wise man said the answer is in your hand. That was the answer. And that is exactly what everyone has said human in the loop. which is how we use AI is

what is going to determine whether we become subservient to AI or AI serves humanity. So thank you. I had a wonderful time having this panel. I'm like overwhelmed with all the points

that you have made. Thank you very much. &gt;&gt; I request the distinguished panelist for another group photograph and I request the faculty colleagues to join us. Thank you all to join us. Your exit will

be on back side on right hand and you can go straight to the entrance area. Please, all of you look at the camera, please.
