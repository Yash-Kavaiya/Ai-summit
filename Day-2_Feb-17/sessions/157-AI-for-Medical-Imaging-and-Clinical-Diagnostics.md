## 📝 Transcript

So great buzz, great energy and wonderful ambiencece. It's my it's my honor, it's my privilege to have a very distinguished panels sitting with me. First of all, let me

introduce myself. My my name is MK Duta. I'm a computer scientist. I I particularly work on artificial intelligence. have some experience working with healthcare technologies uh

developing AI models for healthcare particularly imaging biomarkers and currently multimodel I work in amit university I'm the director for center for artificial intelligence uh amit

university noa so I will request uh the panelists to introduce themselves for in a couple of lines so that will be better so from left uh professor sujit from sdpi pro nidi from India Gandhi

technical uh educ university of woman uh professor chandas a very distinguished person from as delhi uh professor chufal and professor I mean Dr. Aloo so I'll request you to sir a couple of lines

from your side &gt;&gt; just a couple of lines about your place and your work interest &gt;&gt; hi good afternoon everyone uh myself Dr. Sujit Goautam. I'm professor department

of anesthesiology at SGPGIMS. My area of interest is chronic pain management and presently I'm working uh in an ICMR project to develop AI model uh to diagnose chronic pain physician uh

chronic pain conditions uh to help uh diagnosis of these conditions at the level of the primary care at our primary healthcare level. &gt;&gt; Uh good evening all of you. I am

professor Nidi Goyel and I'm a professor in department of electronics and communication engineering Indra Gandhi Delhi Technical University. I've been working in the area of deep learning and

AI since last few years. Guided almost six PhDs in medical domain with AI and have several BTech projects and all. Currently I'm handling a project with Ames Delhi on gastroenterology

department on vis capsule endoscopy. Yeah, &gt;&gt; good evening everyone. I'm Dr. Chandan. I'm uh I'm a professor of radiology in department of uh uh radio diagnosis

intervention radiology name as New Delhi. So uh my uh research area is cancer imaging and we have worked uh like for the last four five years on AI and machine learning and working with

Dr. Mallay University and I Delhi. We're working on gallbladder cancer modeling detection prognostication then kidney cancer prostate cancers and working on uh colorectile cancers also.

&gt;&gt; Hi uh everyone uh I am Dr. Kundan Singh Jofal. I'm basically from Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute. Uh I am heading the department. Uh I'm basically the chief of radiotherapy services for thoracic as

well as saroma and uh lymphoma malignancies. uh we have been using uh doing research using AI for maybe last five or six years down the line and uh we have

almost 40% of our publications are AI based publication for the last 5 years we have published more than 25 peer-reviewed papers in uh major journals and one of the leading paper is

where we have actually uh that's the best use of AI where we have actually cailed the time for the patients from 3 days to 1 days there is one uh way of assessing patients where we actually

decide which which what kind of treatment we are going to give to the patient on the basis of three days of assessment. So what we did is on the basis of one days of assessment we cut

short and we could predict that this patient is eligible for that treatment or not. So this is something actually which which which has helped us. So yeah &gt;&gt; uh very good evening to everyone. I am

and thanks Dr. Da for having us on this panel. So I am Dr. Alok Sharma uh I head the R&amp;D services and the department of pathology and electron microscopy Dr. Alpatra as you must be the largest

diagnostic service provider in the country and uh with that scale we get a lot of responsibility to stay ahead of the curve right and AI is one area which we are very actively working trying to

get new modalities which deploy AI into routine diagnostics which can be used for patient care and we've been working across industry as well as academia so a lot of academic collaborations we have

where we are actively building great solutions AI based solutions which will soon see the day of the guide into routine diagnostic practices and it's wonderful to be here on this panel and

looking forward to the discussions. Thank you. So uh so it's great to have such a distinguished panel and interestingly you see we have uh you know people from

all domains we you have a chronic pain uh uh you know expertise you have a radiology expertise you have a you know oncology expertise you have somebody from the pathology the hystopathology

expertise so it's a great thing and Nidi is an engineer and I don't know I mean maybe I'm a half doctor by by the time because you know interestingly I'm guiding one doctor in King George

Medical University in PhD. So uh well we have some time constraints also. So we'll start the discussion quickly. I'll request the panelists to keep their views short because your your views are

very important. Uh let's start with a simple questions. I mean you are doctors. You are all very successful. You are very you know distinguished doctors uh except Nidi. Nidi will talk

about the engineering part. So my first question to the doctors here is how do you think AI is going to help you? uh let us keep it very simple in your maybe you can use your own use cases maybe you

can use your own areas the question is simple how do you see AI is going to help you maybe current times and maybe in future so I'll request you to keep it short and have your opinion maybe we can

start from Sujit sir and ni you will talk at the at last yeah well healthcare services usually work in the form of a tea so to begin with like uh uh when a patient goes to a clinician

it identifies the condition based on a few set of clinical features which are present then uh there is a kind of a diagnosis is made and to confirm the diagnosis a few investigations radiology

imaging and blood investigations are asked. Now based on all this information a diagnosis and treatment planning is done. And if we look at uh artificial intelligence, artificial intelligence

contributes uh to this team approach uh thereby uh diagnosing it more accurately and in a more shorter period of time. So whatever delays are there and uh with more accuracy AI is going to help

because what AI does is that it identifies it uh uh looks at the data and uh looks at the pattern in which uh the data is uh being present and also it correlates the huge set of data which is

uh given to it. So at the end we have got a more accurate clinical diagnosis and uh uh also uh with uh as the time is evolving and models are evolving uh the AI is also offering individualized

treatment uh that which particular patient is uh going to have more optimum uh uh relief and uh positive aspects of the therapy with which with which particular treatment.

Yeah, very very insightful things uh very insightful comments for the young listeners you can take the points next sir maybe you can have some input from Dr. Ch. uh uh I can give you a clinical

perspective on this issue. For example, somebody is like having a pain abdomen and going into the uh associate doctor in the outpatient department or in the emergency. So once the doctor like uh

entered the symptoms of the patient and if something added some blood investigation added there or into the system the then automatically tell you which investigations to perform

basically for example if the patient has got a acute abdomen pain abdomen or then the the model will tell the you have to do an ultrasound first or if the patient has got some discomfort in taking

breathing so it'll tell uh that you can go for the CT scan or something some other blood markers um so that you can to suspect some clogging in your like blood vessels. So by this way it will

cut off the uh like the waiting period. So patient will unnecessarily will not go into other investigations. So then after like once you enter now say the patient has gone into do a CT scan or an

ultrasound. So after doing the scan then the AR will help you out basically what happened for example X-rays. These days we are uh we have we do a lot of excess x-rays like 300 400 x-rays but we do not

have that much of doctors to all the read those x-rays. So for us a battle they just flag it's normal on abnormal. So what have been the normal scans we do not see the abnormal comes into hardly

20% then we see the 20% then we find out he uh these are the problems. So that saves us lot of time. So for us AI is a force multiplier. So it not only helps in our diagnosis but it saves lot lot

lot of time. &gt;&gt; Yeah I think very insightful comments from Dr. Chanel. Very nice. Thank you sir. Maybe Dr. Chufal I can tell Dr. Chufal is a half engineer because he

himself is using some GPUs in his home and training models. Right. &gt;&gt; Yeah not not really. You are the engineer. So we are the clinician domain expert. So both are

equally doing their job at their own pace. Uh I would keep it simple uh like uh uh for doctors or for a medical fraternity. So there are three important things which AI is helping us. It is

basically seeing better, deciding better and working faster. So making a workflows more fast. Seeing better as Dr. Chandan has already told you. So it is helping in an immense immense way in

radiology. The way it has made inroads into radiology I don't think 10 or 20 years down the line we would have imagined. Uh deciding is clinical decision and support system still it is

we are working on it. So I have been a part of few startups where I I have been like their domain exploit kind of a thing. So we are working on that part but we have there is still lot of work

has to be done especially when it comes to a clinical decision support. So we cannot give everything to AI to decide what kind of decision it uh we have to take. So it can actually help us as an

assistant where always a doctoring loop is always there and it can as Dr. Chandan has already told you it can scale up the things like if uh without an assistant you are seeing a patients

you can only see 10 patient in a day and then you can take some fruitful judgments but with the help of AI probably you can take see 20 patients and 25 patients and still do a better

job. So that is that is where it is helping and finally the faster workflow. This is where everything now the major inroad is in this particular arena like the the documentation part where you can

actually do the summarization kind of a thing like the patients come with lot many documents and there's one uh doctor whose job is to see patients he's sitting there in the OPD and just

juggling through all the documents and spending half an hour or 45 minutes to go through each and everything and maintaining a case report. So that can be done in hardly two to three minutes.

So those kind of solutions are already there in the market. So this is the area where it is like helping in a in a very very uh fast and rapid way and it is almost validated in these areas. Other

than that still we are we are still hoping that it will help us in future. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Okay. Last maybe we can have uh from Dr. Aloc I think your perspective will be a

little different. You come from a different background. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Thank you. So it's not really different but I I would reiterate the point. So there was a common theme here

in which you you kind of realize both the speakers did it kind of reduces the effort you would need to actually make on areas which you are supposed to work right. So this is a concept of triaging

which works very well for pathology especially when you work in a very high volume setup. I'll give a clinical example for this when we when we face it as a routine diagnostic uh large volume

setup. We have almost 50 cases of gallbladder rejections which come to our department every day. Right? And all 50 will not have cancer. They do not need equal time from a pathologist. So what

AI does here is kind of screens it for us and tells us these are the eight cases which you kind of need to look more intensely into. So this triaging is a fantastic area where AI has actually

helped us a lot and it allows the experts to give more time to cases which deserve more time and that's it's a great clinical add-on and it actually translates into great results going

forward. Second thing if as a pathologist if you ask me when we look at pathology slides and other thing I'm only talking about hisystopathology I'm not talking about the data science which

is another domain of pathology where AI has played a great role is again there is a lot of interobser variability. So what I see as a hystopathologist and somebody else sees a hisystopathologist

there is always a very subtle difference of opinion in a lot of cases and that is the reason a lot of patients when you come you go for second opinions right the second opinion is something where

there is a difference of opinion between two people looking two experts looking at the same thing and what AI has done here because it is looking at standardized sets it's trained on

standardized sets it has kind of reduced significantly reduce the inter observability so when a pathologist sees and If you have an AI trained algorithm which is seeing the case simultaneously,

it's like a second expert seeing the case at the same time. So that inter interobser variability is reduced and it it kind of does a lot of mundane work which a pathologist has to do like

counting mitosis, counting number of cells. So these are so that we can put our energies more into more fruitful work. So these are areas which really AI has made a lot of impact into diagnostic

pathology especially from our perspective. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So he comes from an R&amp;D center where he's dealing with the country's highest pathology uh you know

diagnostics that they're doing. Thank you for very interesting insights. Now the next question I go I'll uh because there is a oh uh no no I I'll before I go to the next question you can see

there's a timer also ticking so we have to stick to them. Now uh before I go to the next question uh yeah Nidhi maybe you can summarize and no I didn't leave you actually I have uh you can actually

tell from your AI point of view &gt;&gt; you know how you integrate them you know how you scale it up because doctors have been talking about the clinical point of view how do you look at as an AI you

know architect how you go ahead with that &gt;&gt; as an AI engineer and as a common human being all of you are aware that AI is helping us a lot. I guess all the

doctors are sitting over here. They are facing a problem that the patient that comes he or she is in a half doctor himself or herself because they'll go to the chad GP put up their symptoms and

ask. So they just want the doctor to you know verify what they are saying is correct or not. Actually they're asking the ch to verify the charge GBT. So AI is already helping us a lot. But the

problem is we cannot follow it blindly. Doctors are not happy with chart GPT. I must tell everyone if you disagree with me, you can just raise it out. So they're not happy with the usage of

chart GPT per se for the diagnosis because AI is evolving and still in testing and training phase. what a doctor can tell his or her experience cannot be you know uh rem removed or uh

by the chat GPT. So AI is already helping and in the next 10 years we'll see that AI will be a very virtual assistant to the doctor and we'll ease out the tasks that the doctor does. For

example, the sir said the accuracy, all the diagnosis, the reduction of time, all these things AI will be able to help. Just uh example, the project that I'm handling with as it deals with 8

hours video almost a lack of images which a doctor takes almost 4 hours to you know go through and find out what is the problem and on the first hand is there a problem at all. By using deep

learning and AI we have reduced that time to uh those one lakh frames to almost 20 frames. Now the doctor can take out 2 minutes 3 minutes check those 20 frames and find out what is the

problem. So this is the power of AI and this will become more evident and you know uh more visible in our lives in the years to come. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Okay. So very interesting points made by

Dr. Nid. Now we go to the next question and u see like if you ask me uh I have some experience with working with doctor like I'm already working with Dr. Suju Sid we're working in a ICMR project

working with Dr. I think I'm working with all uh uh you know doctors here also work with many ICMR labs like ICMR NI I have a big database of 56 lakh patients where doing a virus diagnostics

with NIHNI Dr. one was supposed to come here some reason he could not come. Now my next question to the doctors will be and maybe Nidi will sum it up like see India is a India is a diversified

country and still the healthcare is we are not up to the mark we should accept. So how do you think AI is going to make some kind of hardly diagnostics intervention because I'm particularly

talking about the screening mechanism. So a can AI help as a diagnostic tool for screening you know because cancer diagnostics or any critical disease if that if it is diagnosed at an early

stage you know the chances of recovery are better. So my question will be my question to the panel is how do you think AI is going to help for early diagnostics if your if you're maybe I'll

request you to keep your uh uh response particular to the context of India. So we can start from that side. I think this side this time. Yeah. And we'd like to keep you brief points that the timer

is already ticking. Yeah, of course. So we we'll keep note of that. Thank you. So that's a great question actually. That's one of the main aims or one of the main important measurable outcomes

of impact of AI in healthcare is kind of uh predictive. So we know that medicine is moving from a diagnostic perspective to a predictive perspective. So right now we say what do you have right and

going forward 7 or 10 years down the line we would be asking your doctor what will I have in future so that's the predictive power of diagnostics and the main enabler of that whole

transformation is artificial intelligence I'll give an example so if I take my specialtity as as as pathology as a specialtity so once we train so let me tell you so one very important reason

why this whole domain of AI and pathology has developed is because of whole slide imaging so once you start scanning these slides as a digital slides they become a

great source for doing any kind of study based on artificial intelligence or any algorithms going down. So that's the basic building block of artificial intelligence once you train your slides

a large number of cases so you can detect you can develop predictive powers on them. So based on the patterns and the recognition patterns which the AI can have. So already there are a lot of

algorithms coming in diagnostic practice which are kind of predicting what disease you may have in future by looking at a slide which actually does not have the feature at this point of

time but it has been trained by thousands and thousands of slides that tell you that this particular subtle feature is a marker of early disease onset and not only in cancer this is

even done in chronic cases like diabetic nephropathy for example. So if there are a lot of patients who get biopsied or even who have a data a lot of tests you get done as a diabetic even that data

which lies with a lot of diagnostic company like us we have huge data we use that data to train the models and those models can predict what kind of complications of diabetes you are going

to have and lot of these algorithms are being created as scores. You must have seen you maybe as a common man you may have seen the cardiac score the health score the risk score. So this is the

actual outcome of doing AI in pathology where the risk score is a predictive risk scores are being developed and I'm sure a lot of my panelists here would agree that uh as an we accumulate more

data these predictive algorithms are going to get stronger and stronger by the day and for that we have to kind of break our silos not work in silos but kind of share our data. I remember in

the previous discussion there was a talk about sharing the data but unless the ecosystem partners share the data and build those algorithms specific to India we will always be relying on western

data for our predictive analysis which probably is not a very good idea going forward. So those are my main points on that. &gt;&gt; So thank you Dr. Chupal. Quick comments

from your side please. Yeah, I think screening uh triaging and screening is something where actually the AI can help in a in a very big way and probably uh that can scale to a a situation where

you can save lives in population lives actually. Uh but I will not go into the screening part. I think Dr. Chandan will be better person to dwell into it. The very important aspect of uh early

detection is in in a in a in a situation of opportun opportunistic detection. So this is something which I came across a paper which was a very interesting paper where patient is being investigated for

something else but you have AI algorithm in place and they get detected. This is known as opportunistic opportunistic detections and uh the x-rays of all the patients who were uh came for a

respiratory medicine uh kind of a OPD but finally out of those over a period of 10 years there was detection of almost 7 to 8% of lung nodules which out of which 25% of the nodules were

malignant. So this is something which which actually can be utilized. You don't have to have a very large or vast screening programs. you can just put these algorithms in the hospital for all

the imaging modalities and probably uh we can actually detect some other diseases early in these patients. So very interesting. So AI is uh you know crossing borders. So one disease you get

you come for a disease maybe you get something else. So that's what he's saying. Great. So Dr. Chandan maybe we'll have your thoughts on that because you are working on as Delhi you're

handling a huge amount of critical patients. What do you think how AI is going to help in early diagnostics you know early screening especially in tier 2 tier three cities. Can we have your

opinion on that? &gt;&gt; Yeah, this is this is a great uh question basically and more important and more trust of AI in future will be in early detection of any sort of

disease not only cancer maybe all like metabolic diseases like all fatty liver diseases how much of them will develop into uh uh liver uh like fibrosis and then liver failure. So uh I have a very

fair uh like uh bit of experience working on screening of the uh like role of AI in screening. So initially we worked with our uh the colleague urologist basically to find out uh the

basically how the uh the if you like if you know about the prostate cancer and breast cancer any cancer these days there's called there is a scoring system assigned for basically so how to the

scoring is basically varies from individual to individual because one radiologist that has got a very inter observer variability so with uh then I uh Delhi we uh develop a like uh a

machine learning model where we train the model through give assignment assign the u stratification of those proet basically process MRI and uh surprisingly it it becomes it out to be

95% accurate compared to doctors basically the doctors were 87% accurate and we have like published all those similarly with Dr. We have uh diagnosed we have developed ultrasound screening

model basically for detection of gallbladder cancer. So you know gallbladder cancer is very common in modern part of the India and where the Ganga Gangazi has gone. So this is

called a very high-risk belt. So it's called gallbladder cancer belt basically. So it's very it's not common in southern part of India. So even though the ultrasound machines are

available throughout the like India but the ultras or is not there to actually qualify to perform an ultrasound scan. So basically our idea was that so if we train some technician and then can take

at least a galler image and and send to us with our model so we could uh identify lot of gular problems. Initially we used uh the open source data then now we are we'll be verifying

that data that that program we created with Dr. Malik uh with our as inhouse data we have already collected 5,000 ultrasound data for that similarly we have like created golar cancer detection

model with a also and with it deli also for not only diagnosis but the prognostication of the uh of the glor cancer. So one of my colleague are working on uh mangroraphy to predict uh

the early detection of breast cancer and similarly another of my colleague is working on lung cancer detection based on x-ray and CT scan. Just like the our pathology colleagues

said we have worked on the train model depending on genology images they can tell you about the histologology report. For example if there's a kidneys so if it is a cancer

or not so if it is a cancer he'll be knowing it is basically what type of cancer kidney cancer has different different grades and similarly if we do a biopsy or prostate like so it has got

different score. So we will train our model to find out score. So it the has gone to that height basically. So in near future basically the aspiration of will be a role of uh

the most important role of AI will be in the early detection of anything in in prostate cancer not only in the cancer as I said in the metabolic diseases all certainly.

&gt;&gt; So great insights and I think AI will have a great role in early detection and that's must be the first thing AI should able to do. we're running some kind of you know time pressure. So while doing

that I'll shift the next question to this side. Uh we heard we had enough on that part. Maybe I'll ask Dr. Sujit about the trust you know how much you trust you know let's say you train a

model and you are generating a report or you're making a diagnostic. So I will I'll pass the next question to Dr. Sujit. You can we have you are a doctor I mean I'm not sure how much you

understand the maths behind it and you know there are so many things behind it. So as a doctor how you look into that? How do you you know you know trust that AI? That is what we want to hear from

you. And maybe Nidi if he has some trust issues can you help him to you know can we have your comments you know to justify like from the engineering point of view if the trust is actually you

know maintained. So &gt;&gt; yeah one small comment I would like to add regarding the screening. Uh one screening tool which has been developed in the state of Uttar Pradesh I was very

much keen to discuss it like Rashni. So it's a mobile app based uh screening tool with the help of which pupilary images are taken and uh with those cataract is identified so that those

persons who are going to be blind in uh due process of time that cataract is identified and early treatment can be provided and this kind of thing is very important as far as Indian perspective

is concerned where we have got a large number of population large number of people. So screening at the level of the doctors is going to be very difficult because uh there are no not so many

doctors that they can be applied to the periphery to for the screening purposes and with this kind of app uh screening being applied for cataract kind of a common condition this is really helpful

now regarding the trust part will uh trust should be evidence-based well what happens that uh so far whatever technology in the field of AI we are uh uh using uh most of the data sets have

came from the western population and uh when uh an AI tool is applied in a different population uh the expected outcome may differ. So it is very important that uh when an AI tool is uh

supposedly has been developed in the other part of the world is going to be used in our country first or in other hospital also or other geography also it should be locally tested and seen that

what kind of results are being generated. Then second part comes that it should be continuously mon monitored over a period of time like the output is being affected by the data drift that is

uh if there is a change in the data uh the output is coming coming similarly and finally the important thing is that uh uh the whatever output is being generated by an AI tool should be

explainable. Uh the doctor should know that how the output is being generated. So uh in future if some kind of uh uh uh AI might be telling AI might be suggesting us uh good output but if we

are not understanding how this output is being generate uh generated uh some mishap might happen. So these are the few things which I feel like uh uh should be there when we are using AI

tools. So Nidi how do you think you are an engineer so you are an AI engineer so you can your comments you know so that the audience and at large can have some kind of trust on the AI models being

trained with healthcare data. Thank you Mallay. It's a great question and if I talk about trust earlier uh it was very difficult to trust AI honestly the clinicians doctors they are not ready to

trust it 100% maybe 70% also know why because AI not only for doctors but for engineers also is a it's a black box you give some input it gives you some output you have to rely on that it was a black

box but with time since last 3 four years the explainable AI is into picture and it tells you the features that you are using which feature holds what importance and you want to increase or

decrease the features they are clustered or not clustered the ways of the uh features. So with this explainable AI not only engineers but also the doctors they are able to understand that it's

not a complete black box and it has reasons why it is giving a so and so output. So we have different plots by which we can make that black box as a uh explainable box or I can say that black

box is slowly moving towards white box. It has become gray and with time it will become white also. And I also agree with Dr. up uh that uh when we have an AI system which is trained into western

part of India, it may not give good results for the eastern part of India or maybe the central part of India because uh there are uh with area the problems changes so the

problem changes the symptoms changes for example I don't know how many of you are south Indians but uh south Indian people they have problem with their gums Why? Because they don't chew hard food.

They eat idli. They eat dosa. They eat vada which are very soft. North. So the moment you give a mfali kipati to the south Indian, he or she will develop

problems in the gums and teeth. So it varies with place. So whenever we are saying that we are training an AI system or maybe we want to trust the AI system one basic thing is we need to train our

system on a diversified data it has to come from north south central eastern s everywhere and not only the regions it has to come from different age groups and different genders males females

children and maybe age groups also because With past you will uh you might have witnessed for example some diseases for heart patients or maybe stroke patients they used to come at the age of

70 60 plus 70 plus now they are happening in 30 and 30 plus if our systems are trained on the older data which wherein the stroke or the you know heart disease occurs at 70 it will not

detect the problem that's coming at 30. So once our uh you know the system is trained on a diversified balanced data the output can be trusted it can be made explainable that's all

&gt;&gt; sir I have a few questions from the panel and if anyone is involuntary &gt;&gt; yes please &gt;&gt; it's just regarding what is the road map for killing AI diagnosing to PSC or CSC

centers in rural India so what is your recommendations what is the low cost product which help really uh to be developed by our various youngsters uh by our startup firms. So they can

develop the ideas because in the field if you assume a cold chain handler carries the vaccine and it will be frozen under the distinguished temperature like - 8 to 2° centigrade if

vaccine can be uh transport. So for that e introduced that is only for one person uh purpose that is for cold chain vaccine management. So for the point of

screening for rural India how the villagers can be uh uh use the technology of AI where the coast also involves in that uh matter. So easily everyone facilitate that uh technology

because if we use the technology the cost also implies and for a village person who is handling at a Phc level not be able to use AI so much for that way. So my question is only so what is

your vision? What is your road map? So how India is developing that type of tools in rural PSC and CHC's? &gt;&gt; See uh uh here uh the basic the initial the problem with AI is that once you try

to incorporate into the existing health system the cost. So as of now most of the like AI programs are costly. So in in initial integration it will be costly. So probably government has to

take the burden of that and then as you said you have to work go into the foot levels basically. So there you know the assa as assa workers actually. So the technology should be like that. It has

to be very simple also as because it's a AI. So it has to be simple easily usable by those assa workers for example screening program some so we uh government is using some some tools to

find out the the maternal mortality rate then the iron deficiency status in the in the different um like uh uh rural areas especially all the tribal belts basically. So uh initially the

government has to think about that for if it has go to the every like every nooks and corners of this country and it has a cost because integration will be costly but if it is developed under the

umb of the government basically is a government funded just like government has funded a vas uh that software uh for all those LLM development for all those different different language. So

probably the first task has to come from the government side. &gt;&gt; Thank you sir. &gt;&gt; Okay. So that's a very relevant question and important. Anyway, so we're coming

to the close of this um you know discussion. Maybe one last question maybe wait just let me finish then audience will maybe this is the last question

we'll keep up like the question is um what do you think like Dr. Chandan is handling a big institute. I mean all of you are from handling. What may be the relevant challenges from the Indian

scenario if you want to deploy AI what are the challenges you see for a hospital to you know in this mission because we are desperately trying to do that India is already doing this India

AI impact. So what are the possible challenges can you make some of you know can you mention some of the challenges that uh uh we'll have while deploying AI solutions in hospitals. So can we have

your input? Anyone maybe anyone who can yeah maybe you want to speak yeah Dr. Ju uh yes the first one if I uh would say is data privacy and interoperability. So this is something which is the which is

bas basically a biggest uh stumbling block. What happens is uh the uh you have a system already existing system in the hospital and then you have one AI system which is doing something then

another AI system which is doing something. So clinically it is not possible to to have three systems in in front of you and you are seeing a patient and doing something here and

doing something here. So there should be an interoperability. So there should be only one screen where everything is is being done. Uh other than that uh the adapt uh the adaptation. So you you

bring a technology it's a very wonderful technology but but nobody's using it. So to educate the clinicians because there is a huge gap between the clinician as well as the technical guys. So you have

done your job wonderful job. You have a very good model but the doctor doesn't understand what how exactly it has to be used when it has to be used. So something which is maybe I'm asking

about the pipeline because you see AI is not a single stakeholder business. There's a doctor involved there is a data involved. There is a it's a pipeline. It's an ecosystem. So um Dr.

Chandal how much are we ready do you think because &gt;&gt; so I'm sure we are not ready because I'm I feeling because uh we need to train all those our hospital stuff first

because uh when we are working on uh this X-ray model for reporting so many of the like people say they have to click on that basically they said key sir I have to I'm retaining in 6 month

so what is the use of learning this right now basically so that is still there so more about the AI has to be humanized basically so humanized AI with supervised AI basically so that

there's no trust efficiency as uh my the other colleague said so humanized AI and uh then uh scalable AI and then uh if we train our staff maybe in that case probably you will be uh ready plus uh

when we give a solution also the the patient should not feel that okay this machine is answering the doctor is not helping me out basically so that should that feel should not be there basically

so what happens basically whenever we use some uh like some uh digital uh boys calling from our institute from just to have a uh feedback. So they feel that actually after getting a phone call they

said it's a answering machine or something like that. So let's cut cut the phone. But same like same problem if my B called up and ask hello sir I'm calling from Dr. Sundance clinic then

they responded nicely. So that is also acceptability issue is also there but probably as of now I feel we're not ready maybe &gt;&gt; so because um it's not only the

clinicians the healthcare is a big system maybe Dr. quick thoughts from you and maybe quick thoughts then maybe we can take up some questions from the audience I mean madam is have questions.

Basically the challenge presently in Indian scenario is that we need uh Indian models or the AI model trained by Indian data. we currently lack it and uh so that so AI really data is a big

challenge we may not have data in the which is ready to fit into the machines mostly we have in files and hard copies because whatever output we are going to get depends on what kind of data with uh

with which AI model is being currently trained and uh regarding your query that what uh additional things or what additional thought processes which we can institute at the level of primary

healthcare because there is what we are lacking presently is that schemes like or AI models like thermalytics. It is a uh AI enabled uh device uh with the help of which which uses infrared camera to

identify or screen the possibility of breast cancer present. What it does with the help of infrared uh uh rays are sent and uh whatever uh heat signatures it captures it tells the possibility that

the person may or may or may not have uh breast cancer present. Now these kind of uh uh uh possibilities uh these kind of solutions India needs because our pro our uh problems are different as far as

western population is concerned from uh from whom which uh presently we are basically getting most of the AI s AI models &gt;&gt; maybe last comment from Dr. Al.

&gt;&gt; So I I kind of look at it from a more bird's eye view in the sense I think sir talked about interoperability. I think it's a very great point but interoperatability within a hospital is

very different from interoperability between hospitals and when you talk about AI algorithms being developed and putting into large scale use scaling them up for population based studies the

hospitals have to get together the healthcare institutes the larger diagnostic centers they have to get together broke those silos within the laws of the land governance

being there in place and once you share that data and combine that data and build algorithms specific to our Indian population. I think that's the where we will be able to scale it up for our

population. And ma'am talked about east, west, north, south. This is not possible with a single institution. It has to be work of institutions getting together from east, west, north, south, putting

together the data, create an interoperability pipeline and then create algorithms which will benefit and of course keeping the logistics and the costs and everything into control within

the governance. I think that is where I see the whole AI algorithm actually translating and transforming our healthcare going forward. Sir, &gt;&gt; thank you. Nidi, you want to share

something? &gt;&gt; Yeah, I'll just take one last minute and would like to answer your question as well and this data problem as well. For your question already there are several

schemes from the government which are currently being implemented. For example, in south diabetic retinopathy or the cataract is being uh done by a app developed by Sundar Pichai.

&gt;&gt; Yeah. Google has massively invested &gt;&gt; uh this uh sir said Rashni is also there breast cancer detection is also there mobile vans are moving and they are helping women there is also an app which

a woman can use at in from her mobile in the house and detect that that will cover the early detection. Secondly, uh as sir said, it is not possible for the east, west, south or center to come

together and you know get the data. One institute cannot do it. I would recommend uh as an AI engineer Malay will also agree with this. As an AI engineer, we

say that data is the fuel. Data is the oil for our uh AI engines, deep learning engines. So if we want to develop trust, if we want the AI to be you know in the medical domain uh dominantly then what

we want we want is a good data we want the institutional standardization for the data. For example, if I talk about a cancer or maybe just a simple throat infection, there should be a particular

file in which the data should be recorded and this should be done from a private clinic to the hospitals like RML, Gangaram or any hospital of the south. The data format will be

consistent patient name, age, gender, symptoms or maybe you know if it is a skin disease &gt;&gt; we have to we have to cut it short. &gt;&gt; Yeah. we have to standardize that data.

So if all the institutes fill up that form and send the data or upload the data on a cloud platform, it can be easily integrated and make a big pool of data from across India. So if we have

such kind of data, the AI machine is trustable very much. &gt;&gt; So let us take some questions from the audience. This madam had a question. Can we take

it from you can introduce you can introduce yourself ma'am. &gt;&gt; Yes please. Thank you so much for such an interactive uh panel discussion. I'm

Dr. Hinata Bhya U and I'm a clinical geneticist who was leading max healthcare for 12 years and right now after my MBA I'm actually the vice president for genomics for SL

diagnostics a very close competitor to Lalat lab. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. So the thing is that uh so I think one part of diagnostics which we

really left out was genomics and AI. Right. Now there are three distinct parts in that one is the clinician. As a clinician I was seeing patients. So that is one part of AI where I can integrate.

Second part is of course the diagnostics the whole genomics and diagnostics and the third part is of course the drug development gene therapy which I'm working I was working on. Now as far as

the diagnostic goes my question is to Dr. Nidhi and Dr. Duta that uh what questions uh because I've already worked on lot of AI genomics and innovations. My question is that if suppose say some

company or some organization comes to me for some integration of AI and all that in my organization what are the precise concerns I should raise and what are the questions I should ask these companies

so that I am able to protect my company's data I'm able to kind of you know uh in a way that um uh I can safeguard the privacy of DNA of my Indian population

uh and you know how I can kind of monetize that data. So that kind of stuff you know uh so that is the question I want to know. &gt;&gt; So you were talking about preserving so

we have some time. &gt;&gt; So you mean to say you want to preserve the secrecy of your data and still get a model trained for deployment. That's what right?

&gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So see this is not a easy question to handle because uh data will be required to be exposed to the model by any means the federated learning. But let me talk

let me tell you like this uh once again depends if are you using a language model or actually you are using R our programming. I mean what is the nature of data? You know these days LLMs can be

trained with rag models rag rag retrieval documented generate. So rag is a vector database where you keep the data somewhere else and llm keeps talking integrating with the rag to

generate a response it doesn't need a frequent fine tuning of that data every day. Now if you have an option you know when you can lock and key the rag to yourself and the LM is interacting with

your rag there's an option to answer your question is you we need a detailed you know we have to give you a very detailed proposal federated learning has come up there is federated learning rag

models are there uh but once again you should understand madam once the data is fed into a model and the model is trained it's a black box nobody can take anything you know the data is anyway

safe in a model please understand whatever data you train we say in our language we say weights we say 80 billion parameters you've heard about this 80 billion parameter parameters are

nothing but weights and weights are some numbers so these numbers makes no sense even if you deploy it your competitor or anyone they cannot decode anything out of it because they anyway coded so

that's safe I mean for it's like this openai has used New York Times data to train their model and giving output so you know what the data of the New York Times magazine is saved on that AI but

you know it cannot be decoded and it cannot be pulled I mean so that's how it gets. &gt;&gt; Yes. But then uh if you realize there was a lot of

&gt;&gt; I think we have shortage of time. &gt;&gt; Okay fine &gt;&gt; maybe but the question is very interesting we can take it offline. &gt;&gt; Absolutely.

&gt;&gt; Yes please. &gt;&gt; Black box gray and then white. &gt;&gt; Do we foresee any time then AI can do or respond on the critical queries without man or without man in middle?

&gt;&gt; No. You see what she was telling there is something different. Let's say five years back, six years back you do a let's say an MRI scan or ultrasound scan or any imaging scan it will tell you

grade one, grade two, grade three, grade four best breast cancer. Today what she was telling let's say there are shops you know there are great camps there are explanabilities where do attention

mechanisms where particular points of that images are colorcoded with red ink or some other ink which actually you know aligns with the diagnosis of a doctor. So that is what she was saying.

So I think that's what she say sharp models to make it more explainable but what you are saying is I don't think any see even if you say whatever you say the uh the future is exciting and uncertain

so it will be hard but what you say it may come up but very uncertain midi &gt;&gt; uh it probably won't happen very anytime soon reason being uh all of you are aware we do x-rays right the report is

generated automated But it is not given to you till the time radiologist sees the report. Scan and sign it correlated.

&gt;&gt; See make a I'll make a statement. I'll make a statement. &gt;&gt; X-ray is long back. AI is now evolving. &gt;&gt; Listen, I'll make a statement. I'll make a statement. I am a pure AI scientist.

My bread and butter is AI. But still, I will tell you something. Artificial intelligence in itself is a wrong term. Anything which is intelligent cannot be artificial.

&gt;&gt; Yes. It is as intelligent as we make it. &gt;&gt; No, no, it is it is a maths 80 million parameters. So you do a GPD you write in GPD what is the problem of Russia and Ukraine 80 billion linear for me AI is

linear graph forward propagation uh error analysis that is your probability and a back propagation that is differential calculus three mathematical operations happen 80

billion mathematics operation will happen and your GPT or your Gemini will return something. So it is only a it's a mathematical model. AI is not intelligent. A great man coined the term

artificial intelligence. I've got huge respect for him. But still important question important question is not whether the doctors will be there or not. Important question is whether this

AI can help doctors to save more lives. So that is the more important question. &gt;&gt; AI is not a in fact if you if you hear the statement of Jaffrey Hinton I think 10 or 11 years back he told that

radiologists will be out of job. So nothing nothing nothing happen also says &gt;&gt; you see the the maximum AI is used in aviation industry you know the pilot the

the the AI mode but basically when you after taking if you're going in a long flight so it is it will go the autopilotic mode that is nothing but an AI mode but now how many of you will

will go into a flight put the pilot there &gt;&gt; and so AI will also be like some of this will be also likely it has to be

humanized Otherwise that's why they not compete is only to compliment. So thank you panelist from my side &gt;&gt; for your precious time. I request my

colleagues to come forward and &gt;&gt; thank you.
