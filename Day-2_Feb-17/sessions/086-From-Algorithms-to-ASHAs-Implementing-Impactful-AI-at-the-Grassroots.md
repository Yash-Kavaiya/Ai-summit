## 📝 Transcript

AI's true potential and my objective for the session today is we can go beyond talking about generic statements talk about specific insight from implementations from experiences of

implementers and from uh from a perspective that has actually driven innovation in the space. Um I'll take a few minutes to introduce our our speakers. So first we have Dr. Para Hay

who I think has many fans in this audience. uh and she is the founder of uh of Arman and a a eurog gynecologist, social entrepreneur and she's really pioneered the work of Arman which is now

re reaching over half a million healthcare workers u focused on maternal and child health and um and also is working on um implementing AI based solutions on the front lines. Uh we also

have urva shivatal who is with u is the country lead for evidence and impact at koshi baby also an organization that has pioneered some excellent work at the community level and she has a a gloried

history at jal and is driving evidence generation in the space. Uh we also have again Dr. Dr. Anurag Agural who many of you may know dean of biosciences and health research at Ashoka University.

He's a physician scientist a leader in genomics and has many many hats that he wears but I think he's also dribbling in the in the ecosystem that is then further has a ripple effect downstream

and then finally we have Dr. Mitun Kumar Mitra who's a professor in the department of physics at IIT Mumbai and he's a theoretical physicist who's working on physics of living system

statistical mechanics and uh is also leading some of uh some large collaborations on uh TB treatment strategies and um and analytics. So please can we start with a round of

applause for our panelist and uh oh um our panel today um I hope that we are able to address three core objectives. Uh we want to honestly examine what are some of the most promising AI

interventions predictive models diagnostic tools large language models at the last mile. We also want to talk very honestly about why they often fail to translate into measurable health

outcomes for last mile smile communities. Um we want to identify what excellent practices are. Right? We don't have strong evidence yet but we have nuggets of insights from the community

and we want to see what those are. And then finally, we really want to be forward-looking and we want to honestly recognize the limitations and chart a way forward that prioritize some the

technology and real world impact over just algorithmic sophistication. Um so just a few key issues that uh we will be talking about today. Uh the first of these is and as it pertains to

last mile populations is um data representation. uh it starts with a recognition that over half of our clinical AI models they use training data from US or China and uh we are

deploying these tools in contexts that look nothing like the populations that they were trained on um and we do have some evidence about how this impacts last mile populations right we know that

uh they have 23% higher risk of false negative uh rate of pneumonia detection we know that having um actually if we've been trained Um here we know that uh melanoma detection errors are much more

prevalent in dark skin patients uh because of data set imbalances. So there is some fundamental mismatch between the models and where we are applying them and there are steps already that we are

taking in India to address these issues and we'd like to talk about what those are. Um there is also a second point of infrastructure gap. Um because what it takes to deploy these tools is

developing, training and maintaining LLMs. Um it does require or other computational models. It does require computational resources. Uh which can really create barriers in low resource

settings and these computational resources are beyond servers and cloud computing. Uh there is a element of human infrastructure which cannot be addressed quickly, right? which is a

decade two decades in the making. Um and achieving best outcomes does require a high level of collaboration between various experts and implementers that are in place. When we think about

community health workers who are managing 2500 3,000 patients um they may work offline, they may work in areas without reliable electricity. They may work on basic mobile phones and most AI

tools are less accessible uh to those without these technological resources with limited digital literacy and in languages other than English. So even when we design offline offline capable

tools we face challenges uh that that are essential for adoption. And then the third challenge is that of translation and this is where the gap between AI capabilities and health outcomes becomes

more stark. Uh predictive models can tell us that someone is high risk for hypertension or an adverse pregnancy outcome. But if there's no medication supply or no follow-up infrastructure or

no accessible clinic or no trained doctors, we still can't act on it. And what that results on in is a diagnostic and knowledge gap. Diagnostic gap without any therapeutic power. Right? Um

so anyway, I I know we've spent a day and a half um singing sort of the praises of AI and so I'm not here to dampen uh dampen our enthusiasm, but really I just want to uh ground this

conversation in reality. Uh so we can design solutions that work with our current infrastructure. Um and it's only when we acknowledge these constraints honestly we can allocate resources

effectively and create AI tools that can actually reach the last mile. Um so with that I can get us started and um maybe um since Aperna you're sitting right here uh I'll first um ask you to to

describe in in the context of Arman um how AI is being used to leverage to support um community health workers their learning and as well as identification of high-risisk

pregnancies. &gt;&gt; Can you hear me now? Yeah. So thank you so much for having me here. So Arman works both with women and children directly uh because our programs which

give provide information using M health solutions to them and then we work with health workers at every level of the health system the ASHA the&amp;m the medical officer specialist so that they can pick

up risk factors in time and manage in time and refer uh apply. So I'm going to focus only on the AI bit of it right in this whole context. So we have a program called integrated high-risisk pregnancy

management and tracking. So what we found was that if you look at high-risisk pregnancies in urban context you know when a woman has a high risk factor she would go to an obstitrician

would manage her end to end but in rural context you have a three- tier system of referral pathway which is important because only then you can have proper triaging you have an auxiliary nurse

midwives the medical office specialist but as a partial care guidelines committee government of India in 2019 and I've got to notice that unfortunately each carder does not know

their part of the They don't know what treatment to give at that level, when to refer, what counseling to give, what to do when the woman comes back to the village. It is

for each of these three cadas. Very important to create technical guidelines which are very simple for each kada in addition to operational guidelines. Then we were given permission to create these

guidelines for the government of India. So for 35 high-risk conditions, potentially any high-risisk factor a woman can face, we created algorithmic colorcoded large detail protocols, very

simple, right? for each carter right and then uh there's a vetting process that happened with the national government and a lot of multilateral agencies and doctors from all over the country and

then covid struck in the meantime several states accepted the program right we've gone to seven states now 14 the next year so what did we do and we think this is the AI you know for

community health workers and I'm giving you this context because this is why the program is successful because within the context of this program so what we do is when we go to any state so Telangan is

an example where we first We prioritize the conditions responsible for mortality in Taliban's 22 conditions with the doctors of the state. We modified a protocol to suit the state

because every state is different from the other with the doctors of the state at every level. Then it became policy and then we doing training. So literally 14,000 A&amp;Ms in the seven states of DR

have got trained through cast classroom training through the master team of the state and all of these protocols and in modular format and uh section wise phases and every obviously in every

state we have you know prioritized different numbers of conditions and different condition responsible for mortality. After classroom training we have a learning management system. So

every protocol has been converted into live action videos, simulations, interactive quizzes, notification. It's on their phone or the tablet the learning management system and it's app

agnostic. We go with what is available in the state. Then this is where the AI comes in. Now when they so they are training the classroom, they are getting this on their phone. But then when then

when they go to the field and they have any query it's impossible to cover every part of the you know uh issue right then they can ask any query to our&amp;m chatboard right and we're very lucky to

have J here who has collaborated with us from art so it's an excellent excellent uh&amp;m based support system LM based support system for the ENMs any query they can ask it answers right and uh you

know it answer within 10 seconds latency because it was 30 seconds earlier now 10 seconds. They can send questions in the format of a voice mode or uh uh in a um text format. It gets spelling mistakes,

grammar errors, right? That's multimodal, you know, and it answers back and it's because it draws only from the protocols we created. It's exhaustive. Nothing is left to chance.

And then uh you know, so that's why the answers that come are pretty apt for the situation that the unions are in. And we're very happy to say it has reached around 6,000. the whole of Tanangana

five districts of Uttar Pradesh and one district of Maharashtra as we speak and we're going to scale it up to around 12,000 by March then there's plans are for large scale scale up for this chhata

and then we'll discuss more about how it works but then you know the for example the real life question that came in from the field right is pregnant woman hemoglobin 6.8

they can allergy home iron tablets. Now obviously you're not going to include that in the protocol. So very specific real world questions that are coming from the field right and the question

are coming in on other aspects not included in the HR pool. So their plan is to now expand include even other conditions that the AM needs and then take it to your childhood right and then

we track right so the whole idea is that you train you handheld you answered questions and then we track the you know uh outcomes uh the way we do it with protocols are giving layer in Telangana

all the RC database of the Telangana government itself every state has an RCH database we able to inch the database which a few more questions for each high risk factor is getting layered so that

we can then track what is actually happening to the women and then we can go and train again. Now that is where the chatbot hopefully in the future will do it. It will just answer questions we

can send byite-size lessons we can send you know data on you know where the has gone wrong to the end based upon her performance or basically the performance of the area that she's serving. Right?

So there are a lot of these possibilities to the chatbot not just you know giving an you know answers to the question that she asks. Right? So this is where we are. We've reached um

seven I mean obviously the program is in seven states and hopefully this chatbot now will go through the country. Yeah thank you. Um great thank you and thank you for explaining that in uh quite a

lot of details. So there is uh learning management system and then support and what do you do when uh the chatbot does not answer questions? &gt;&gt; Very important question. We also have a

human in the loop right? So obviously there's another question that's going to come in that's going to be difficult for the chatbot to answer or the not satisfied with the answer. Right? So

there's almost 98% satisfaction with the chatbot answers, 97% uh you know uh it's been verified as numerically accurate right but when there is any you know issue there's a human in the loop who's

always monitoring and answering the question that the chatbot can't answer that the human in the loop is really really important it's tech plus touch yeah great so I think that's a great

takeaway tech plus touch um okay let's move on to Vishiashi Kushib is testing uh a number of AI based tools tools at the community level including for detection of anemia as well as community

level support to Asha and other frontline Asha Sahili specifically. Um can you talk a little bit more about these interventions and the types of resources that have been uh needed to

deploy them? &gt;&gt; Sure. Thanks uh and thank you so much Misha for having me on this panel along with everyone else. So I think just to give you all a context about Kushi Baby

itself, we are a not for-p profofit that works to strengthen public health systems through the use of data. Not just collecting data but also trying to translate data into insights and action.

And I think like many people I think who are interested in AI or in this room we've also been sort of you know looking at this question of how do you leverage AI to strengthen public health uh

services and delivery at the last mile. So there are I can talk about sort of two projects which are at various stages of sort of development and rollout. The more advanced of them is uh I think very

similar to what Aperna described but for a different sort of carder workers the Asha Sahili this is also an LLM chatbot uh that's WhatsApp based so uh the Asha worker can communicate with the chatbot

on WhatsApp application that they already use and ask questions about their sort of regular routine activities any questions that they have about counseling that they need to provide to

the households they go to and and for those of you who may not be familiar with the sort of larger public health context, Asha workers are sort of the last point of care for a majority of the

rural population in the country and so they're sort of talking to households about uh delivery about vaccinations for children about nutrition uh and they're interacting with various kinds of

ailments on the ground and what we've been doing is sort of leveraging our work in Rajasthan over the last 10 years where we've worked uh many for many hours with these Asha workers to then

identify certain pain points and one thing that sort of came out from the work that we've done is that uh you know they have intermittent refresher trainings uh and it takes a long time to

sort of get a response from an&amp;m or you know other officials to queries that they have sometimes maybe only the monthly meeting that they go to and so the chatbot is kind of a tool that they

can use in the entire when they have some immediate questions when they need to counsel parents or households immediately about any ask that they have uh and so we initially did and we've

sort of I should mention that we've rolled this out in collaboration with Microsoft research they the technology partner behind this uh and we've been rolling it out starting with 20 ashas

and udipur district a region we worked for in for many years expanding to about 500 and now 11,000 ashas across um Rajasthan as well as Maharashtra um and I'll just sort of share like one example

of the sort of response we got in the initial uh 20 sort of pilots that we did with Asha workers which was that uh often times when they had a question from the household that they couldn't

answer uh they would have to wait for the&amp;m to respond uh or they wouldn't be able to answer immediately and therefore having this chatbot is sort of like a confidence booster for them when they

are out there in the field as well. Uh in terms I think your question was sort of you know what's enabled sort of this to you know scale at least up to 11,000 and hopefully more in the future. One is

of course having Microsoft as the technology partner um because they are the ones who sort of designed the tool itself. [snorts] Uh the second is I think all of our experience in terms of

health systems, Ash's constraints, their environment uh that we have developed working over the years. Uh and then this is a project that's also been supported by Microsoft CSR. So I think having that

initial sort of CSR or philanthropic capital to do these kinds of investments and develop new solutions working with organizations like ours I think is the sort of other element of this. Um could

I ask Rishi or what types of questions or what types of queries uh do you see Asha's? &gt;&gt; Yeah. So I mean it could be about uh you know uh I need to counel the household

about family planning. What are the different sort of options I can recommend to them or a child is a certain weight uh you know is the child like sort of severely malnourished or

not or is it moderate? Those are the kinds of questions that they might be asking um uh to to the chatbot. &gt;&gt; Okay. Okay. Thank you. Um okay, let's move on to uh to Mithan. Um u of course

you're working on applying uh a variety of novel analytic techniques to improve TB testing and to assess effectiveness and impact of post TB screening. Um can you describe this work and also talk

about from a data standpoint what are the opportunities and gaps you see in in in doing this type of work? &gt;&gt; Thanks Michelle. Firstly, um I think I come from a little bit of a different

background than the rest of the panelists &gt;&gt; and that's the beauty of the panel really like we want to talk about the data for the last mile too. So

&gt;&gt; um so in general you know what we try to do is to sort of um make sense of complex healthcare data right so that's the broad overarching goal um and make sense of them through models both AI

models and otherwise so it's both machine learning and old school modeling so I'll use both of them &gt;&gt; and maybe can you hear now okay Right. Um right.

So what I was saying is that you know the main sort of work that we do is to try and make sense of complex healthcare data. Um and make sense of them through building models whether machine learning

models or more other traditional models you know statistical models or other classes of models that take into account this data that we have but also sort of considers the different levels of

heterogenity that we have. And in India any sort of modeling that we do has to be sort of responsive to these heterogeneities whether these are you know geographical heterogeneities

whether they are soioeconomic heterogeneities or whether they're are cultural ones and ultimately the aim through this sort of modeling exercises is to synthesize this data and produce

actionable policy insights. Right? And uh we work with programmatic data uh from the government but we also sort of try to you know build in uh local data. So local surveys uh local studies and so

on wherever possible so that our models have sort of have you know inputs both from the large scale as well as the local scales in context of TB uh smasha since you asked so there's this work

that we've been doing with collaborators in Hopkins in fact um uh and where we're trying to look at you know post- treatment outcomes of TB and you know in India um tuberculosis is one of the uh

major infectious diseases in your contributes a huge proportion of the global burden of TB. Um we've made of course uh excellent strides I would say over the last decade to bring down you

know TB incidents, TB mortality but there is still a long way to go before we meet the goals where as where we want to be as a country. Um and you know TB is in that sense it's a social disease.

There's a lot of stigma associated with tuberculosis. People don't seek care. people try to hide their symptoms and there's a lot of u efforts that's going on uh you know state governments the

national government in order to go out there and find people you know convince them to come forward and to seek care um in this context if you look at what are the major drivers of tuberculosis one

main group is people who have had TB in the past you know so people who have recurrent TB infections in fact the national prevalence survey of India sort of estimated about a quarter of our all

TB cases come from these people. Now that's of course a concern but that's also an opportunity uh that's also an opportunity because these are people who are already enrolled into your system

right they've come for care before and therefore if you can optimize followup for these people you know if you can go after the complete treatment you go back to them after 3 months after 6 months

after 12 months and ask that have you again had TB symptoms you can potentially uh catch a lot of recurrent tuberculosis in the community and this is important not only for the patients

themselves but it's also important because when avoid transmission in the community. If you do early detection, you know, it's not just that person who benefits, it's the community who

benefits. And these are sort of things that we are looking at from a modeling aspect. Um, and also sort of, you know, in different geographies, different factors come up. Maybe in some

geographies you have large number of migrant workers who are then lost to follow up. You know, they don't come back and they don't follow up with the healthare system. um in our community in

other uh geographies you know there might be adherence u you know concerns so we can tailor our sort of solutions to the geographies to particular geographies so that whoever is

responsible for the last mile care in this case let's say the district TV officer can go and put some of these recommendations into action um more broadly if I may so I'm also part of a

consortium called the national disease modeling consortium um it was set up uh by uh blessings of the ministry of health and family welfare. Um and it brings

together in expertise from the ministry so programmatic expertise um expertise from ICMR um expertise uh from epidemiologists, public health experts in order to sort of develop models that

are tailored to the Indian context. We don't just take global models and just feed in our data. We try to sort of tailor these models that take into account this vast heterogeneity that we

have in India as a whole. Um and we work in different disease domains. So we work in infectious diseases. We have also we now work in non-communicable diseases. Maybe I'll use one example uh from a

different disease. So uh lymphatic ferasis. I don't know how many of you in the room are aware. Um it's a very common vectorbone disease which means that you get it when a mosquito bites

you. you know common mosquito culix and that transmits the parasite. Um it's it's a concern in that you can have the infection and the infection can stay dominant in your body for a long time

and one year 5 years 10 years. So you can harbor that infection you can spread that infection in the community. It's only a small proportion of people who develop acute disease acute lympadeema

in this case you know which we call as haty bow you get swelling of the lymphatic glands and so on. Um so again this is a major concern in India. This is belongs to a category of what we call

as neglected tropical diseases in that there's not a lot of funding globally perhaps to address these. Um so what we are trying to do is to and again similar to TB we've made a lot of progress over

the last 10 years to sort of uh in various in reducing the number of endemic districts you know endemic districts are in Bihar up Horisa parts of Maharashtra

um but still you know there's a lot to be done um so and what again we're trying to understand is what are the socioeconomic what are the cultural reasons uh behind this hetrogenity so

you might have one block which has achieved elimination But just the neighboring block you know uh even after five rounds of drug administration. So this involves something called mass drug

administration where we give medicines to all of the people in that block right um even after five rounds six rounds LF is still endemic and what are the possible reasons behind this you know um

so like you talked about data gaps and in this context you know one of the data gaps that we have is we don't have a lot of good enthmological data in India so especially in the context of vector bone

diseases you know it's not just of you know malaria deni um lf uh um encphilitis all of these we have data for the human component we know who gets the disease but we don't have data about

the vectors you know how many mosquitoes are there where are they breeding um so and this data is very important if I want to build a complete picture I just can't you know recommend policies or

interventions without understanding the complete picture of the vectors uh similarly there's socioultural reasons so for example when you give this drugs uh often times people don't take them

and there are groups of people who don't that take them systematically right year after year after year. So we call them these people people who are never treated in the parliament. Um and what

and why don't they take them? You know we may not take them because they may not have perhaps um faith in the public health system. Maybe there is a lack of communication as to what these medicines

do. What is the what is the reason for these you know three tablets or so on that you give them? Maybe there are religious reasons. And again this is where where we have to leverage you know

the last mile healthcare workers because they are the people that are reaching the communities. they are the people that can inform inform the modeling as to why this is taking place but also

then can take the solution back to the community so that you know these socioultural reasons do not stop us from achieving elimination. So &gt;&gt; thank you and I appreciate that you

brought the example of lymphatic ferises because it is actually I think people may commonly know it as elephantis right like so uh because it is a last mile condition that is neglected and and the

fact that you're able to have data about it is that is that &gt;&gt; yeah so we do we do have programmatic data on ferasis yeah &gt;&gt; uh great okay so I will uh move on uh

finally anak um to you of course you oversee a vast number of interdisciplinary projects and implement a number of interdicciplinary projects. Um I think

what I would love to hear from you is where do you see the greatest opportunities for now and where do you see the shift for the future right like what is now what is future

&gt;&gt; I guess to answer that question one way to look at it is what is new because what is old the opportunities are mostly salt and we could see that from the discussion occurring earlier that

chatbots their capacity has risen with jai and llm with rags, our ability, as long as we can find grounding for the truth, our ability to reduce hallucinations has become much much

better. What is missing typically is what to ground them on in terms of local data, local protocols. And we went to the other extreme of life for one use case,

the end of life care, paleative care. As India ages, the demand for paliotative care is almost guaranteed to go up. It is usually at that point not a diagnostic problem. It is an

implementation problem of a plan that typically has already been built by the doctor. But almost no one ever understands the plan given to them by the doctor. If you were to go out into

this relatively low health literacy system that we have. Problem is not in creating the plan. Problem is in getting people to manage the plan. And they keep coming back to the health system again

and again for something that could have been dealt with at home. So that's an example where by using more modern genai multi-agentic workflows quickly

cross-checking all the time very importantly building the answer I do not know or I will not answer this you need to go back to the doctor for something critical

and also a building knowledge repositories by working with partners like paleium India we have seen success but then came the next big problem that I think was good instruction mechanics

You know, we tend to think apps. When you think only about an Asha, you would think of an app. But what you really need is a voice- based interaction that is even possible on a non-s smartphone.

And again, we found with Bhashini, with Gemini, different layers of architectures, it is quite easy to put the AI behind a phone call. A person can actually call a number and it's already

implemented now. We haven't put on to the public, still in test mode. You can start speaking in the language you speak in. It'll be autorecognized on the other side and answers will come back. And you

can even have redundancies where you can move from a platform that has multi-indic language support to currently only Hindi, English, Morati, which worked out fine for some parts.

But this is I think an area that I see scaling quite well. We are trying to break the digital divide by recognizing that AI does not have have to exist on the smartphones

of the people that use it but actually on the back end where they connect by voice. The second big problem that I think I'm going to mention is the biggest problem

in down the line is going to be procurement. How will you compare the various solutions that people will come up with and unless the government has a

mechanism or forget government even a hospital has a mechanism to compare and benchmark everything will come to a paralysis because you simply don't know which

solution works it may even be that no single solution works for all so there are two programs that we are looking at one is with Microsoft research gates foundation which is voice rich data for

benchmarking of voice solutions that's a separate category But more important if you think of India where we'll see more and more open-source models tuned on local data

being deployed and what you while classical thinking for evidence is RCTs I fundamentally think it's flawed because RCTs are sometimes for quantitative measures many of these

tools that may have already been tested already come with a quantitive measure what you want is a massively online AB testing by people who are going to use it for the type of people that they are

seeing in their practice and they should be able to deploy multiple solutions together preferably open source so that any answers that you get of where the model is going wrong

can be used to retune retrain the system called pman and it's a offshoot of a system called move massively online validation valuation by any heartland so there's something that we plan to bring

this will solve the other problem of building an evidence database for how useful different models are and building a community of users and building

incentive structures for them. This I think might be more useful for what you give to Anasha than a centralized program because we have now seen that even for tuberculosis right in the

[snorts] beginning chest X-ray for tuberculosis failed in a did well in Africa came to India failed dirty lungs of India was probably the cause got Indian data it worked

mega cities now has gone to northeast India and is again failing in some ways so India itself is so hetogenous that any one central program for the around the country is not going going to work

well. What you need are platforms to locally evaluate your problems. &gt;&gt; Great. Thank you. And um since I hear this um constant theme of heterogeneity, so if you hold on uh hold on to your to

your mic, I think both you and Methun have talked about about the issue of heterogeneity, which is that uh there is of course a variety of data and we do have a variety of subgroups, cultural

contexts, languages. What can we do? Um you know historically maybe the first point is that what we've seen is that the communities that are the largest minorities have the lowest

level of digitized data and lowest level of data that is actually um portable that is making it to research entities and universities. And so there there is um almost a onetoone correlation between

being a minority and having data in some sense. uh it has to be a very active process of figuring out how do we get these data um into digital formats into formats that can be aggregated and so um

I know there is work underway on it and so if you could speak to that and I'll pass &gt;&gt; to you m the biggest limitation in gathering digital data is because you're

adding to the burden of overburdened practitioners so high quality voice to digital data such that interactions are captured with consent of

and constitute the data repository is absolutely critical. So that's I think the quer foundation is investing heavily into creating a better ecosystem for voice traditional data. But I'll say one

thing if we wait for models to be built until we have all the data we will never build the models because it's simply not going to occur. What we need instead is a way to test these models continually,

look at where they are going wrong and use that with a basic corpus of medical knowledge in general to retune and retrain them and we may end up with, you know, different ones in different

places. But that's the only way I see it going forward cuz capturing data becomes tricky because of privacy and a variety of other issues. The ones who are least represented might also be the most

susceptible to abuse and we'll never sort that out. But I personally believe in data solidarity in which you use legislation to prevent abuse as opposed to restricting the accumulation of data.

&gt;&gt; Um, thank you. Um, I I think voice to data is a technology solution, right? Maybe I'm pushing you a bit more because there are lots of non-technology solutions, right? uh about community

empowerment, mobilization, education, capacity building &gt;&gt; and the data solidarity bit was about that. But data solidarity as a principle is somewhat conflicted

also because at the time DPDP acts are coming. A variety of other things are occurring. The burden of collecting data might rise. Which is why I loosely hinted at the problem by saying

legislative solutions to misuse of data. as opposed to making data gathering harmful and education of the public in terms of how and well to share their data is required but the data ecosystem

is absolutely required &gt;&gt; and going down and empowering communities in terms of understanding it how to best operationalize and you know there are a lot of loopholes not

loopholes intentionally left provisions in the DPDP act that allow researchers and the health data exchange which is written in the act but nobody has built one yet is the other project that we are

looking to do right now with ICMR try to build the first real health data exchange where you leave data where it is completely fed architectures but allow it to be used but until it is

built I don't want to go there but we do need to build it &gt;&gt; great and mthan same question to to you &gt;&gt; um so yeah I completely agree with an uh but just adding on to that um so for

example you know one of the ways or one of the reasons we collect data in India is mostly perhaps record keeping you know you keep track you don't really collect it to be used in research and

there is a whole vast amount of data that is just lying there in some sense whether in paper form or even in digital form you know that is not being used to answer the

some of these questions you know that who are the communities that are being missed who are the people that are being missed um so I think there's a lot scope there. Um, so we have to incentivize,

you know, data not just as performance metrics. So if you report a death, it's not bad. It's an opportunity to go ahead and correct that. And I think that comes again in these underserved areas. You

know, people are afraid, oh, if I report a high tuberculosis death rate in a tribal area, you know, I do I have to then answer to the program. But that's not the way that we should be looking at

it, you know. So I think ensuring or changing our mindset in some sense that data is not something to be afraid of but it's an opportunity that we can build on can hopefully answer some of

that and I also agree with that you know models can actually help point out where there are data mismatches. So you know if you if for example an epidemiologist or a local health worker is saying that

in this area we should have these many whatever TB deaths or these many in uh other infections but the models or whatever notifications are captured in the government databases are not in tune

with that then that can go act as an incentive to sort of go ahead into these communities and try to collect the data that is missing. &gt;&gt; That's great. Thank you. And I

appreciate the summary of data not just merely as performance metrics to drive uh last mile. Um I know uh that you have thoughts about this idea of data representation but uh maybe um you can

reflect on that but I'd like to add a question for you and uh this is around um often solutions fail because um even if they are good solutions um because they are implemented in a context that

is just not the right context and early on in in in digital health we saw a lot of this um let's send messages to pregnant women about their behavior years and we haven't seen what mobile

phone ownership is in pregnant women. It's under 20% migratory population. Husbands are phone owners. Um so of course it's an intervention that's unlikely to serve last mile and many

examples of of similar problems being scaled up actually before anybody looked at impact. Um so my question to you is of course around the enthusiasm about AI. It is immense. Um but what do you

think is the critical underlying ecosystem that is needed to implement these solutions including data which might be one of the &gt;&gt; yeah I'm going to keep it very short

because of lack of time right so I'm going to answer from the from the context of our own program our&amp;m chat mod is working well also it's via WhatsApp yeah same thing yeah it's

working well because within the context of program that's working right if you look at the protocols and the question answer that it draws from The the chatbot doesn't draw from the worldwide

web. You know, it draws the answers only from the universe of the protocol that we created which have been vetted so thoroughly at every level. It's so algorithmic absolutely last detail that

nothing is left to chance because we have that basis really done well. Secondly, we also when we go to a particular state, we also then do kind of a mapping of the clinics whether we

can actually implement the protocol we're talking about, right? It's not enough to have oh give maxf if you have got eclamsia but is max available there right is it possible and every state

differs from the other. So when we go to particular state we really really you know work with the state to understand what is possible and the protocol modified based upon that and then the

chatbot draws from those protocols for that state and only then can it answer right so honestly nothing will can work in isolation you cannot create an asha chatbot or chatbot unless that ground

work has been done right so that is the thing I want to talk about and something as simple as language and dialect right in Mumbai we have a chatbot for women directly right And you know we use a

word u um you know anemia anemia everywhere right you think it's well known but they don't understand anemia they know ki kami right same thing with diabetes right if you use uh you know

translation regular hindi translation of the word diabetes they don't understand that you have to use colloquial terms like sugar right so your the context is so so

important of where you're working right and whether things are possible lastly about data representation you know the thing you talk about us your data won't work in India one thing we need to

realize is even for women all the data comes from men. It's a huge issue in medicine overall that if you look at cardiac data even pregnancy data or you do any kind of

data for it comes from male data. So you already understand how not the models are biased because you starting out with biased data right and then what we find is that if you look at you know um

a context that we are working in right that the we work with shaka children migrant mothers we work with Muslim women or we work with adolescent mothers their data is actually not there at all

because and then technology if not intentionally designed can worsen access to these women. So we're really working very hard to get these women into the system these children into the system

and then build models based upon the data that we collect and the other then otherwise it's all biased data right yeah so just very shortly yeah &gt;&gt; I mean and second everything that has

already said I think I I'll talk about three things that additionally also very important in the context that we work in and especially for health one is I think similar to what um uh Aana was pointing

out and you were saying we also chatbot is based on rags So we limit it to sort of protocols and guidelines given by the government on what Asha workers can counsel people on and that's really

important because you could end up in a solution where the LLM uh chatpot is hallucinating giving sort of wrong advice. Um so I think safety is a really important question I think especially in

health it becomes much more important to think about how do you design for keeping that in mind and potentially like sort of having more guard rails around that is something that's going to

be useful in the future. The second thing uh that I would emphasize is and this is the case with any digital solution uh which is designing with the user in mind and how they are going to

use the solution uh and what are their constraints. So you know we often talk about digital readiness as like okay do they have a smartphone or a feature phone? Do they have internet

connectivity but like one thing we've learned in rolling out the chatbot is that even the way that the Asha is able to ask questions from the chatbot the kind of prompts that they use they they

will not be the same as what you and I might end up doing. Right? So that's another element of literacy and they need more guidance on how to ask the right questions to get the kind of

response that the chatbot is capable of giving. The third thing I would say is and this is something we sort of looking at not just here but in some of our um yeah other solutions is designing for

scale right like right now we're working with let's say 11,000 ashas once this moves beyond it how do we do the same things and and how do we sort of check for the same safety and update them and

as the model updates how do you account for that right so uh I think that's something to also keep in mind &gt;&gt; um okay um okay I think that that really

summarizes us and that was a very loud timer. I know we started late but uh but just so that the rest of the sessions can continue on time I will actually uh move towards wrapping us up

and just want to have a loud round of applause for our panelists please and um I think some excellent uh some excellent very insightful um ideas here first of which is the designing with the user I'm

so glad you said that uh And then really making sure that the models do account for heterogeneity that we are considering hetrogenity of context. Um I see the organizers move towards me so I

will wrap this up with gratitude for this panel. Thank you.
