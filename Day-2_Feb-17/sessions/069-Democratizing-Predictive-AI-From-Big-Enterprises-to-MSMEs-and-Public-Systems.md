## 📝 Transcript

PhD in AI. So in this panel I'll be uh time to time adding some research perspective to complement uh the panelists who come from very impressive as well as the diverse background. Uh so

first I would like to start by uh just asking each panelist to briefly introduce themselves. Ga if you can start. Thanks. &gt;&gt; Hey hi everyone good afternoon. Uh I'm

Goa. Uh I head AI and applied ML at Swiggy. Um so I bring the industry perspective uh to this panel. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Hi folks, I'm Bhanupa. Uh I founded and run a consulting firm uh in technology

diffusion into the public systems. Uh it's called Zinga Labs. Uh I also currently advise the BLA AI labs as a senior adviser and also consulting senior partner for selfsquare foundation

on AI net tech particularly looking into the education sector and mainstreaming AI into that space. &gt;&gt; Hi everyone uh I'm Rich uh I'm the founder of campus fund uh we invest in

student entrepreneurs college dropouts. So I bring in the perspective of investing in entrepreneurs who are building the uh building at the edge of what's possible and especially uh AI is

a very heated uh you know subject when it comes to the startup ecosystem. So yeah &gt;&gt; right thanks uh thanks again to all the panelist. So let's get into the

discussion. Um the first question so I mean there's a subjala outside Bharat Mandupam city today. I I just uh crossed him and uh I'm pretty sure he's good at predicting the demand that he has for

each vegetable stock based on the footfall season or the weather patterns. But his setup is pretty small, right? If you have to scale up to let's say thousands of uh SKUs on platforms like

Zep or Amazon, it will not hold. So my first question is where exactly is the line where you can separate where predictive intelligence can add value over the human uh human intuition

because it's important to define it if you have to build AI products out of it. So go would you like &gt;&gt; yeah I'll start with that. I think the problem that the subjala is facing even

at the scale of instamard we do face it when you bring in for example new items on board in new locations which are you know very hyper local in nature uh you exactly don't know what kind of demand

pattern you're going to see. So I think the problem of uh predictive intelligence and driving uh you know better decisions for planning it exists at different levels in different

organizations but I think we are closely uh we are reaching a point where it's not anymore u you know an advantage but almost like a hygiene need for you to run businesses efficiently even if you

take like medium and small enterprises they almost make 30% of our GDP so I think At a national level, we are at a scale where predictive intelligence and the technology adoption is at a level

where we can start uh building efficiency uh and effectiveness into the supply chains. &gt;&gt; Got it. Got it. Uh Banu, would you like to share your perspective from

&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think you started with an agree example. So I'll just jump the sector and go into health. So we have Asha workers all around the country, right? I think India has one of the largest

network of frontline health workers in the form of asha workers and all of them are digitally collecting various little bits of data of somebody's sick here, somebody's sick there and all of that

stuff. Right? While we have all of that data, uh the gap really uh in situations where epidemics and pandemics kind of things start up is that there isn't a layer which is looking at all the data

constantly and uh giving us uh predictive intelligence to create that time to be able to proactively respond to an emerging situation as opposed to kind of fighting against it once it has

already happened. &gt;&gt; Right? while the data exists that layer of predictive intelligence is missing right so this is one classic example where uh we already have the data but

the layering is missing and that's where I would really uh and I'm taking a public systems example here where there's workforce where there's data but then the middle layer is missing to be

able to strategically predict and respond or preemptively deal with these things which are coming out. &gt;&gt; Got it. Yeah, that that's a very good insight. Thanks. Uh

&gt;&gt; yeah, so you know predictive as the word suggests it's about being able to see what the future is going to look like with a fair degree of confidence. So I think predictive intelligence uh can be

used across segments right it's just not one it can cut across it can be a great horizontal for us to become u more efficient and cut down our losses you know if we are able to you know predict

with a fair degree of accuracy right so it can make u public systems you know much more better and efficient and the most important thing is cut down loss process so that you know they can

produce more right so it's I would consider it to be a horizontal cutting across different verticals and uh you know to be used in places wherein you know a certain degree of um you know um

like a certain degree of inaccuracy is okay it's not life-threatening &gt;&gt; anything which is beyond that predictive intelligence would you know work for it is what we would think think about it

like yeah &gt;&gt; right uh no yeah that's that's uh totally correct just to I want to add on to the point that Bhanu briefly touched upon that missing layer of predictive uh

intelligence uh especially in public sectors and we live in definitely an interesting era uh foundational models have revolutionalized multiple fields and gone beyond uh language applications

and in fact being used even for structured data such as time theories table which is fundamental which is 80% of the uh organizations and very crucial in taking decisions but we have seen a

very common pattern I would say and maybe you will agree that usually uh AI breakthroughs go in phases and the big players are the early consumers they benefit a lot so Swiggy for instance or

flipkart they gain the they gain the benefits but let's say a vendor from uh a place in Mumbai he just reads about it so my question is like is this recent wave in agentic AI um as well as let's

say the structured data foundational is it is it something different can we expect that it will break that norm uh or are we just seeing a pattern that the gap is widened uh between this big and

small enterprises and we are mistaking it for democratization &gt;&gt; see I think like richer pointed out if you look at uh you know predictive intelligence to become like

infrastructure. If we thought if we think about it, you need intervention at multiple layers, right? Foundation models are one thing which is almost giving you the fuel to be able to say

now we have time series foundation models that have learned you know across different diverse time series that's available you know publicly and it can detect patterns and now you can use

zerosot almost you know just use it for inference for any case but to be able to do that there is a layer below that which is data right now when we talk about techies like swiggy flipkart the

data they are very native ative in that sense you are collecting all the data but when you look at public sector and medium and small enterprises we have to have a way of standardizing

data as well to be able to make use of it and there are initiatives like AI kosh etc which are enabling that like what UPI did to payments you need something like that to standardize data

collection and bringing it all together to really enable it &gt;&gt; got it uh Manu would you like to &gt;&gt; yeah I think uh I'll I'll swing across sector sectors. I will go to the

education sector. How many of you have children here? Just a raise of hands, right? Uh imagine what happens to a child if they don't understand the borrow the

concept of borrowing from for subtraction and they are getting promoted across grades. Right? And we are seeing this in our school data as to how you know math is becoming a

difficult subject because very fundamental tasks which are uh capturable are not being dealt with right now. If you look at uh uh you know like God pointed about

the data of what each child is in second grade third grade math is all hiding in their notebooks. It is just a set of photographs away from coming to any predictive model. And if I can throw a a

lack a lack of sheets worksheets from a second grade to a predictive model system, that is all what is required to kind of start isolating who are the children who are getting stuck with

minus or carry or whatever and then very surgically intervene inside the grade two before I can send them to grade three. And and this is the this is the dilemma right the the data is within our

hands at some places digitization of the data is a gap at some places structuring the data is a gap and even after the data is structured I think the access to predictive models

&gt;&gt; uh you know can a district education officer have access to a model to run some data through right those are the gaps which I'm seeing and which we need to plug

&gt;&gt; just want to add one more point like we were talking about the layers. I think the point he makes is very valid that this is where I think government can also play a big role because you need to

democratize not just the foundation models. You have to democratize technologies to standardize your data. You have to democratize access to compute and a way of us like the

usability aspect of embedding it into your processes. &gt;&gt; All these four layers are very important and that's where I think you can build more public infrastructure around that.

Right. &gt;&gt; No, no, completely agree like GA mentioned you know it's like it should be an open stack like UPI is right and then you know people can build

application layers on top of that for different kind of use cases right and that's the only way you know it can be truly democratized right and that is when everybody will have an equal chance

it'll just not be about the bigger guys who have access to data and therefore they are building on top of it I think UPI is a great example example I think when India has done it when it comes to

the fintech ecosystem why can't we do this you know for data in general across sectors and I think that is something that the government is also trying through ANRF right uh their whole

objective is to build open stacks across ecosystems and let startups build on top of that for different use cases I mean when we could do it once why can't we do it again right as a country and that's I

I think we should hope for that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. No, that that's an uh interesting point for sure. Um so when we talk about UPI for example, it is shown as a golden example of democratization. But in my

opinion uh so UPI has made a technology uh en it has it has been a technology enabler and it has just digitalized the way uh events happen. Let's say anyways in the past you paid uh we just exchange

the cash and we have easier ways to do that with the UPI right uh so now the problem here is not just when it comes to predictive intelligence the problem here is not just with the uh the tool or

the interface that you have but it's also about using this technology for something completely new uh because predictive intelligence is not active at different segments if you uh think

properly. So it's it's mostly about the trust and the the barrier uh that we have uh to use this technology because uh one has to trust these machine over the human intuitions that's always

difficult. So what do you think uh from the the ecosystem point of view how could we help this bridge this barrier? Uh would love to uh know your comments maybe rich you could just continue. I

think uh the startup ecosystem has a huge role to play in something like this, right? I mean um and you need a few uh examples who succeed in certain verticals and others can follow suit,

right? You need a few successes. Somebody can pick it up on the education side. It can be um you know there are so many edtech startups, right? and AI is a boon for them if they can implement it

at scale alongside with the government. You know, there will be trust which will be built right. So I think obviously the larger organizations and equally startups right because that is also

something that we as a country are you know ambitious about. Um it takes time to build trust but then if you can you know um prove it in certain segments education, health uh and a few other

critical places I think people will start believing uh you know in the predictive capabilities that a machine has right &gt;&gt; just drawing a parallel to it right

before co happened it was like for every small little meeting we used to travel from one city to the another city but when covid hit everything moved to zoom or virtual meetings and it has sort of

become a norm at least the travel has reduced right &gt;&gt; so I'm not saying we need a pandemic to make that happen but something at scale which can be implemented which builds

trust apart from UPI which has already happened tangible benefits when people start seeing maybe it can be how you know the quality of education is improing improving at the grassroot

level or the kind of health services which can be provided to people at the grassroot level. If some proof points can be built at scale, I think that builds trust right and I think postco

era humans have gen in general have more belief in trust in machines. I think that has also happened &gt;&gt; right. Uh yeah nice nicely put just to add on to that I think from our

experiences at Blay Labs we have been running some pilots so we can clearly see that trust is also linked to the application that you have as you rightly pointed out in earlier conversations

right if you are talking about a predictive system uh which will uh deal with prediction of let's say low number of high volume trades now that's critical because consequences are quite

dire. Uh but if you talk about automating some uh inventory stock at some Swiggy store outlet then definitely uh so we could start with these early wins these applications and gain trust

and move on to more complicated challenges. &gt;&gt; In fact we we did experiment with a few open weight uh you know time series foundation models. It's also the trust

also builds up through experimentation because then you'll realize what it works for and what it does not. Right? For example, if we take just zeroshot, you know, using them out of the box, u

you need to exactly know what are all the time series I need to give to the model. Is it just my sales? Is it also about the prices? Is it also about the weather? Right? So, so it's not just

about the models being available. Trust gets built up with you iterating with the usage on it to say what exactly works and then you publish it, people talk about it and then somebody else

tries it. So there is also that virality associated with people experimenting, sharing and then building trust around it. &gt;&gt; Yeah, true. I do have a comment on that

but I would like to give Bhanu a chance to speak about his perspective first. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean trust is an important ingredient to any design at public system level and you know or a

population scale right but I think we also have to understand what is happening on the end user side right so in the in the traditional IT era we were really

expecting the builders to ensure that it is accurate and the users were using it knowing that the builders have ensured accuracy right But with the emergence of

last mile AI use cases on uh photos, layers on photos on the social media and all that the attitude and behavior of a last mile user to experiment and play with tech and be

okay with some things coming right and some things not coming right has already been shaped. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. So I think at sometimes we we

kind of overgate ourselves with trust but I think we should also not forget the fact that the end consumer is also now maturing to be able to deal with part of it not working part of it

working and the fact that I can be a beta user in a population scale system &gt;&gt; right we see this in the social media we see this in networks we see in all these places so I just wanted to give that

count of view &gt;&gt; uh and a lot of people today who are already touching Meta AI or Gemini or any of these tools and they play with uh you know uh this is good in generating

pictures, this is good in generating audio, this is good in translating. The common citizen is also experimenting and they have also kind of grown towards a scenario where they know that not one

tool is great for everything and I need to figure out which one is good at what right earlier that was the kind of role which the gatekeepers were taking but now I think the citizens are also

maturing on that direction &gt;&gt; right no it's a brilliant point uh on that beta mindset that we need to adopt to enable the technology to grow uh great what just wanted to add a comment

to God's point where she gave a reference to time series foundation model. So just in case if it's a new term for audience, it's a it's a foundational model that's trained on

huge amount of time series data and uh used for predictive task in out ofthe-box way as you use uh tools like charge or clot to generate text and uh even in in this area from I can add my

two cents uh from research perspective is and go you'll agree that usually every business has its own metrics when it comes to evaluating model and also That's also one of the reasons that it's

very difficult to cross-co compare the performance of different methods and different models and research community has been actually actively working on curating this standardized benchmark uh

to test these different models and we are also actively uh contributing to that at BAI lab. So I think that even industry should play a role here and help curate uh data sets to have this

evaluation done in a more credible way. What do you think? I mean definitely I think there are uh areas where uh you know like if you take for example I worked at Ola before or if

you take like transportation data for example when Uber shared it right so industry does play a role in opening up certain data sets so that people can leverage and build on top of it and

predictive intelligence is definitely an area to add more diversity with industries's uh data coming into some of these foundational capabilities. It need not be built only on publicly available

data. &gt;&gt; Right? Sounds good. So let's move on to the next thing. Uh let's talk about moneya. Yeah. So startups uh who are building solutions for MSMES uh usually

fail to get traction in the beginning as you'll agree and uh without without initial traction investors are not tempted to do the investments. Uh so it's a chicken and egg problem.

[laughter] uh but still I just want to uh add this perspective that now there are there are two ways that one could infuse this AI into the

the current workflows. one is having standalone AI products and another one is integrated integrating them to the existing workflows at MSME such as let's say Katabbook or Zoho ERP uh for that

instance or otherwise go at a very low uh price entry point in the market from standalone product point of view as Jio has proved in the past and even uh Chad Guptity uh is doing something similar

right now. So my question is like what is uh what is the preferred way uh do we need an ecosystem that provides this sustained capital for a long time or is it better to uh do the smart work and

embed this AI workflows into the existing workflows. &gt;&gt; Very good question indeed. uh you know so I think I have a slightly different take you know like see um if we make

standalone applications it becomes very difficult to convince MSMES to sort of buy into AI it's adding to costs embedding to existing systems yes like Zoho katabok etc etc it's possible uh

for from a startup point of view there's a lot of cash burn because you're just acquiring customers you're not necessarily making money out of it right I think you know a startup which can

succeed in selling to MSMES is the only startup which can say that if you implement this predictive AI system of mine your cost to run your business will reduce this much and I will take an X

percentage of the savings and that's how I make money if you can do that everyme will buy into that right they just know the language of you know costs right &gt;&gt; if you can I mean yes it's a very bold

thing to do uh you know like investment bankers do only if this transaction goes through will I take a certain cut of it you'll have to change the model for it to you know become acceptable for MSMES

and the MSMES are fair from their perspective right why should I just add something which is adding more cost to me &gt;&gt; if you know like predictive intelligence

talk about predictive maintenance right just for an example if I can prove that you know by implementing this application my energy consumption reduced produces by XYZ this is the

costsaving give me a percentage of that everybody will be happy to do it right that's the approach that should be taken according to me and that's the startup which will succeed to sell into MSMES so

yeah pretty interesting &gt;&gt; I think I'd just like to also come in right uh when we look at the startups which are in the predictive intelligence area or in AI right uh there seems to be

a the game plan seems to be like everybody has to build a model right and a lot of People are trying to build a lot of models which are

not great, mediocre, whatever. And a lot of energy is going into building models, right? But when you look at the markets, you really extract value out of the markets at the application layer, right?

Uh and the model is a game of a more a horizontal player. So I think startups also need to start thinking do I go after building a model &gt;&gt; or do I look at somebody who has built a

let's say for example time series foundational model and I actually focus only creating six or seven application layers on that &gt;&gt; right and then commercialize on the

market end &gt;&gt; right and connect it to the logic which I talked about like how do I charge and pass back on to the model owner right so if everybody gets into creating models

Then firstly there isn't enough money to give to every startup to create a model &gt;&gt; right uh secondly there isn't enough patience on the capital side right so I think it is it is time for model

startups also to kind of take their bets like are they going to be the horizontal model owners or are they going to be the application layer which is commercializing and working back

integrated with the model owners &gt;&gt; yeah that's a yeah very valid point would you &gt;&gt; just one point I want to add which is the fourth layer that I was talking

about right which is even if you have the model, you have the data, you know, and you know how to use it and infer, but the usability layer of embedding into their gen like their process as of

today is as important as using the most state-of-the-art model, right? Because change management is always tough, right? So, how can you make it part of the DNA of the processes that MSM is

already have today, right? And then of course the point of getting the cost benefit of course holds but the mode of startups will come in the data that you hold because you have built this

application and how well you are solving that problem that somebody else just that's the barrier to entry &gt;&gt; true no totally totally valid point u just

&gt;&gt; I'd just like to come in here please so uh in the context of MSMES uh the time series model is pretty particularly important because no MSM has enough data to inform a model.

&gt;&gt; Right. And none of the MSMES want their data to be mixed with other MSMES as well. Right. &gt;&gt; Uh and and in there the predictiveness or the accuracy goes for a toss. Right.

But if there is a temporal time time series model which has been trained then I come with my little data and I just go zero shot and get my output and go do my work. Right. So that layering and is is

also something which I think uh needs to be thought through. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Absolutely. Absolutely. Uh just continuing on the model part, I think we are we are at the India AI summit and it

would be unfair if we don't talk about sovereignity, right? Uh so would like to uh know your individual perspective in predictive AI sovereignity. &gt;&gt; I I'll just take a short hit. Uh I mean

of course uh there's sovereignty at multiple levels, right? Sovereignity of the data sets, sovereignity at the model, sovereigntity for the compute, sovereignity for the power systems which

are uh you know powering up the compute uh and can they be sustainable but around sovereignity there is also particularly when it comes to the when it comes to

India as a market there is the affordability sovereign affordability is also another important layer for example if I'm a if I'm a if I'm somebody who's going to the public health center and I

got my lung X-ray done because I'm coughing. Can I add 2 rupees more to get my X-ray run through the TB predictive model right that pricing sovereign pricing is

what I or you want to call it affordability whatever you want while there is sovereignty in terms of ownership across all these layers there needs to be sovereignty on affordability

as well for a country like India to be thought about. &gt;&gt; Yeah that's that's true. Uh would you like to add a point as well Rich? Yeah. So I think um again uh as he mentioned

there are different layers to sovereignity, right? Uh and again there's an opportunity I would bring in the startup angle here. there's an opportunity to to build in every layer

but the kind of cost requirements are different to build in every layer right when it comes to compute uh you know the kind of cost that'll be needed right like it's insane probably it'll take

some time for us to get there right &gt;&gt; so I think from a data point of view at a nationalized level I think that is government's you [snorts] know should be government's prerogative to sort of get

that through right across different segments in some places you know startup ups can you know build their own um sort of you know systems across different layers. So different players including

the government and startups and large enterprises to try and bring in sovereignity across you know uh AI as a whole right and some will require a lot of investment some can do with a

relatively lesser investment but I think it's very critical I mean as India um we have this ambition of atmanar bharat right we've done a great job of it wherein our domestic markets are shield

with a lot of external issues that happen. We are still shielded to a large extent but AI is the future and it becomes very critical for us to become atmanhar in that right otherwise

dependency is never good on anybody right we know that as a nation right and I think we all understand how important it is the government should open more coffers to be able to build those

capabilities within the country large organizations should also increase their R&amp;D budgets If you look at it in India, I mean the large organizations don't spend that much on R&amp;D and it's a great

initiative that you know BLA is doing with AI labs. Things like this are needed and [snorts] obviously VCs and private equity need to be able to pump in

&gt;&gt; more and more money to be able to build that. I mean to build compute in India, you can also imagine the kind of capital that will be needed, right? True. So different actors have to come together

&gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; to make this happen and I think government can be a good orchestrator for that an enabler you know it's important but it's very critical for us

as a country for a long term. &gt;&gt; True. No just to add on to that point, government is definitely supporting from compute point of view and also let's say data point of view but uh that efforts

could be extended to also to distribution and go to market strategies and &gt;&gt; awareness increasing awareness about the adoption.

&gt;&gt; Correct. Correct. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Just one point to add is I think like she said serenity is too it's too important not to do it right. Uh I mean

the summit happening itself is a statement in that direction. uh but I think one thing that's important is given India has population scale and the kind of complex problems

that uh you know the plethora of them that we have to solve I think it's important to invest as much in the application layer so that there is enough ROI being built up as we talk

about being sovereign in the model and the data layer right like he said in an affordable fashion can I price it and leverage the population scale to get the ROI on this that's That's why

application layer is equally important on the server aspect. &gt;&gt; True. Uh totally &gt;&gt; I just like to come in here. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I think one of the angle which I think a

lot of startups in the AI space miss out is that there is a duality of who you're building for, right? One is you can build for the private market at the same time you can also build for the public

market, right? And a lot of times what I see is the startups really have a blind uh blind side on the public uh side of the market. Let's just take a simple example and stick with that X-ray

example, right? Yeah. &gt;&gt; So you can you can allow a diagnostic center to use the model at 4050 rupees. You can also allow the same model to be used by the public health center at a 23

rupees and it can come from the same start. Right? So that duality is also what I'm seeing as a missing gap in the system. Right? But once you get the duality and penetrate into maybe one or

two states &gt;&gt; the scale which the public public system has the private system can't provide you. &gt;&gt; True. Correct. So just to add to what he

said there's another source of capital which is actually the CSR capital you know that can help in this duality right because you know for doing at public scale um startups may not have that kind

of money right because they eventually have to you know make money sustain themselves probably it can be you know this can be included in the CSR ecosystem as well to be able to fund

this for public good at public scale right that's enough that's a good amount of money that's available right why can't a significant portion of that going in building the AI sovereignity of

this country why not &gt;&gt; no totally true uh just want to add my uh perspective from the research side on this so uh when we talk about sovereignity especially for uh

predictive intelligence with table time series data it is very very crucial to have sovereign models because these uh table and time serious data they are hard bit of the economy of the country

and in fact so western world has already started adopting these technologies there is a there's a model called Kronos by Amazon which is being used in increasing the operational efficiency of

Deutsiban which is IRCTC equivalent of India then there are many enterprises in the west uh who have been adopting these foundational model technologies um I can go on and go on um So it is the right

time for us uh that we develop so structured data foundation models. Uh this is very important because we we need to like we internally talk about what are the uh why the work on these

foundational models space is important and it's from three perspectives. One is the return on investment which is like clear dollar impact. Second one is the return on experience. So you have these

insights from the data that you have uh in a with least resistance and you can make better informed decisions. And third one is the return on future. And I particularly want to stress on that

because some of the things these LLMs are doing now are unimaginable 5 years back and even in table or time series domain itself. Uh already there have been very good models which are uh

which are outsmarting the traditional methods by a good margin. So uh it's the right time uh for us to act on this and in fact we are quite actively working on this domain at at Blayabs. Uh I think we

don't have much time left. So would like to open up the floor for audience to ask questions. Panelists can take &gt;&gt; uh hello everyone. I am Adita Tari from Mumbai. I just graduated as an AI

engineer and I'm also currently working in that space. So um my question is around accountability since uh predictive intelligence the output majorly is decision- making and since we

are democratizing it to the MSMES um there isn't enough education or awareness on their level right it's like a magic portion that's being marketed today um how do we make sure that

there's an accountability in the output with respect to predictive intelligence when it goes to that scale do we do that with guard rails or regulation or with the models or do Do we do that with

awareness or education or a balance of both? &gt;&gt; So anyway &gt;&gt; I can so I think uh there are two two three ways to solve for this right.

Firstly, I think from in the way the offering is itself designed, right? One is to kind of say uh here is my predictive output and I'm giving this with this estimated accuracy and I'm not

making the decision for you but I'm only giving you what I'm reading and it is for you as a human in the loop or actually I am AI in the loop. You as a human make the final decision. Just the

design of how the service is built itself can cover a little bit for accountability. uh but on the other side what we need to be careful about as a builder on the accountability side is to

be very clear about what is the kind of data on top of which we have built and is that data proximal to the kind of people who I'm servicing and if that is not the case and act being transparent

transparent about on what data the model got built so a little bit of transparency and a little bit of assistiveness as opposed to leaprogging to make the decision and actually

forcing the human to make their own decision with the system being assistive is a great way to from a design point of view solve for it right at the end of the day we know that there will always

be some things which will break right so I think this human- centered design is a better way to start with and as things mature then I think the trust will automatically either get created or win

off based on whether the model is working or not Yeah, thanks. Uh, anyone else? &gt;&gt; Uh, you mentioned about uh, predictive maintenance, something similar to this,

but the whole world is either following preventive maintenance or breakdown maintenance. Uh, predictive maintenance is not happening at all. Uh, so what do you say?

&gt;&gt; That's an opportunity, right? Like that's an opportunity for startups to come and build, right? That is what I meant. you know it's not there it's a huge opportunity so anybody who wants to

become a founder in the AI space please try this out you know yeah &gt;&gt; yeah I think I'll just add on to this right uh predictive maintenance even somebody who runs five trucks

&gt;&gt; and has these national permit trucks they can also apply right the the amount of downtime when one truck goes for a task is quite a bit and if I have some IoT related data flowing in for my five

trucks And some model kind of says that this particular truck is at a risk of ABC. That's actually something which can be programmed. You know, this one's maybe more for Rich. Um given

that you're focused on university students who are becoming founders or in the process of becoming founders, are there any just curious are there any themes that you're starting to see in

terms of like focus areas from the university students? uh the industries that they're targeting compared to maybe more seasoned um startup founders, &gt;&gt; right? Uh I think uh you know so some of

the areas which the students are targeting are the ones uh wherein there is not that much heavy regulation right because regulation is something which you know you'll be able to navigate only

once you have the relevant contacts or you've had certain kind of a work experience and things like that. industries which are low on regulation. That's one. Second, because um the

universities in India are actually actively building uh or upgrading the labs that they have, right? So students are able to build on the edge of you know deep tech, deep technologies,

right? So we are seeing a lot of startups building in space, a lot of startups um you know building in battery chemistries and things like that, right? And AI is automatically actually no

longer a vertical. It's a horizontal in every startup, right? It's like a given. So that's what the young entrepreneurs are building towards at this point in time in the universities.

Low regulation. &gt;&gt; Hello. Yeah. Um very interesting discussion coming to demand planning. Uh lot of information comes in from the external world like seasonality like uh

festivals spike due to festivals or something like that. This is quite common across the sectors across manufacturing. Whereas there is some part of the information which is

specific to that business or that particular company like um I mean we were having this interesting discussion about horizontals and verticals. What is your take on how should this be thought

through by a uh a lot of a group of partners and not one right because there is this common piece and there is also a specialization piece here I think I'll take it and pass it back to

you I think a good example I'm just building a use case straight away here right uh I think Swiggy knows a lot about what kind of flowers get ordered by homes in the festival season that's

That's the data they have and if that data can be plugged on to the farmers nearby urban areas saying that this season instead of putting pulses can you put these flowers right so I think those

federated use cases can come but I think I'll go back to what richer said there needs to be somebody who's orchestrating this unless there is an orchestrator all of these are going to sit in islands and

then everybody's going to feel bad about uh something else happening on the other side right so I think there's an interesting case where uh uh some of the organizations who are in the

space really need to add a federation angle to their body of work right it could be the you know uh farmer organizations it could be supplier organizations whoever right uh but with

that I'll pass it on to you know uh Ga &gt;&gt; yeah I think the point is similar to what he's making is uh a lot of external data that you refer to Right? Some of it could be you know just public APIs like

weather or that everybody can use but there are data sources for example uh on Swiggy itself it might be important to know what are people searching for on Google right for us to sense the demand

right now that data sits with Google unless we can deise mechanisms where data sharing creates a win-win for everybody involved it it will always be difficult to enable such horizontal use

cases. Hence some of the thinking needs to go into how do we create those. I know in the airline domain for example uh there is something called global demand data right where all the airlines

share data and they reap the benefit out of it because now you're knowing global demand patterns right we have to devise mechanisms like that to enable this &gt;&gt; right okay thanks thanks a lot for

questions unfortunately we are out of time but we can continue the discussion outside &gt;&gt; I would just request all the panelists to stay back there'll be a photo that uh

the organization teams needs to take maybe you can just keep the mics and stand and we can have the &gt;&gt; [applause] [snorts]

&gt;&gt; Thanks. Thanks a lot. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I didn't know that. Yeah. My question didn't come up unfortunately. Uh you have a business or not for us. You sgest

have any
