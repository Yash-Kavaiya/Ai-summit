## 📝 Transcript

Okay. Hello. Hello everybody. Uh it's a pleasure to be here. Thank you for joining us for this session on scaling AI in the enterprise. Um my name is Arpanched. I'm gonna introduce our

speakers. We have a fantastic panel. Let me start with Mi. Mahir Shukla is the founder and CEO of Automation Anywhere. Automation Automation Anywhere is a RPA in Agentic uh process automation

company. They have over 5,000 customers globally. He has over 400 million agents in production in their client base in India. They work with hundreds of GCC's. Seven of the top 10 banks in India are

clients of Automation Anywhere. I'm excited to have Mi here with us to talk through this. Um, we also have Garthik Ready sitting right next to Miere. Garik is the founder and managing partner of

Bloom. Bloom is one of the original VCs in India. The India venture uh ecosystem has grown up with Bloom in tandem. They manage 850 million of AUM today across a number of funds. Their companies include

companies like Grey Orange robotics, purple and a number of AI first companies that we'll speak about today and he was the chairman of the India venture capital association from 2022 to

24. We also have Shravan Faludu closest to me. He's the founder and CEO of avatar.ai. Um his whole and he will speak about this perspective and philosophy around

applied AI not models. Um he is part of the India AI mission um and fundamental part of building the equivalent of UPI for AI not just for India but for the world. Um they've raised 55 million from

Sequoia and Tiger Global. Um Shravant actually has 10 patents and a partnership with UC Berkeley which is their knowledge partner building Avatar that AAI. And then finally we have Jinme

Sharma. He's a venture capitalist with InfoEdge Ventures. um he is their lead partner uh in AI in India. So he has a very uh broad and deep view of AI in India and what our founders are doing.

Um companies like Ghani uh and if Ghani I think is is is at the is at the AI summit. So we're really uh fortunate to have a panel that is founders uh running companies and AI VCs funding companies.

So we have a front row perspective on the development of enterprise AI in India and globally. Um so we're going to start the panel but we've been I've been asked that we stand up and take a

picture. Okay. So, I asked them to make it a semicircle. We're going to try to make this a dialogue instead of me asking questions. Um I'm going to start by just

putting up a few slides here just like two or three to set the table so to speak. Um obviously a lot has happened in AI a little bit right over the last 18 months and a lot over the last month.

Um and you know as banning company we spend a lot of time working with our clients in enterprises globally India elsewhere on applying AI and we've sort of seen this snowball of you know a

little bit of tenitedness putting your toe in the water and now companies are really realizing it that I I have to figure this out. This clearly I can be disrupted or disrupt. Um and I'm just

going to set the table here and share like three slides quickly. Um let's see if this works. Yes. There we go. Thank you, Shraven. Right, this has changed. You'll see that 20% of

companies are saying AI is our top priority. 53 are saying it's top three. There's, you know, one or two% I'd like to talk to them who say it's not a priority for them. Um, and this has

changed a lot. We we do this survey on a global basis every three months. We'll publish results for the next one very soon. And I suspect we'll see something like 75% say this is a top three

priority for me. Um the second piece which I found interesting this a little bit more sort of US data and we will have India data soon is just the budgets this is index numbers so it's um so

you'll just see the average budget the allocation is going up it's not that companies are just absolutely spending this much more money right this money has to come from somewhere you have to

find efficiencies you have to take it out of other budgets um but the these numbers have been increasing quite dramatically so now companies are like well if I'm spending this where am I

going to get ROI. So this this incredible priority in finding return on this investment is going up. How do I find the skills to go deliver this? And the last one which is the one that I

find interesting is there are winners right this is just a snapshot of open AI anthropic and palunteer revenues in the enterprise and you'll see sort of just the scaling right people talk about

scaling laws and so at scale these companies are growing rapidly you know 18 to 20 billion this calendar year for uh open AAI similar numbers for anthropic you'll see the growth rates

you know balanteer you'll see kind of you know similar type growth rate you'll see the number of enterprises so these technologies are rapidly uh penetrating the enterprise globally and in India I

think Dario said yesterday the most intensive use of anthropics models are in India right so this is this are India is is is right at the vanguard of this so with that I'm going to shift uh to

the panel and the first topic I want to start with is really around signal and noise there's lots noise around AI in the marketplace but I would also assert there's lots of signal now and even in

India we're beginning to see that and so Mi I'm going to start with you just because you have a fairly large base of clients in India uh I think when you spoke you said there's something like of

those 420 million agents in production quite a tens of million are here in India with your clients so how do you think about AI in the enterprise in India and if you want juxtapose with the

US Hello. Yeah. Um the so just to give a preview of it the overall adoption in India across various segment is high among other countries. So hundreds of

customers enter India enterprise customers hundreds of GCC's all these Indian SI partners about 100 universities who are training using our AI course to train about a million

students and about 50 nonprofit people like Akshai Patra and others using AI agents to scale their benefits. So a wide wide usage across Indian spectrum. Um the the the difference we see though

in the enterprises is there is a clear marker among 10% of India enterprises that are breaking away from the pack and accelerating significantly &gt;&gt; and talk about those 10% what what's

characteristic of those that are breaking away what are they doing &gt;&gt; so those 10%s think about the problem differently than other 90%. So there are two characteristics to it. The first is

the enterprise AI is very different than how most of us think about it on a chart GPT. I think of chart GPT as your English teacher. And so uh it works great and then when you try to put it in

enterprise you give an English teacher a math problem, a physics problem and an engineering problem and then then you say it has hallucinations. Of course it has hallucination. This is an English

teacher. Uh so uh what what we were able to do is take the benefit of the 420 million enterprise processes and create the enterprise worker out of it so that it knows how to function in an

enterprise space. So you have to think about enterprise AI very differently because it has different problem than what most of us use for personal productivity. And second is you chase

outcome not promise. Um that's the that's the key. &gt;&gt; Okay. I'd love to you know Cararthik have you p jump in on this particular this point about chasing outcomes

um the breakaway and what are you you know what are you seeing in your portfolio? Yeah. So I think the um it's you know the SAS world which is you know some folks are declaring dead in some

sense &gt;&gt; predominantly thrived on the fact that you sold customers on a per seat b I mean you sold the customers a per seat model or

number of users who are actually using it. &gt;&gt; Uh whereas today the enterprise CTO doesn't care about anything but outcomes and fundamentally ironically they

actually care about as you said the ROI. Yeah, &gt;&gt; which sadly the future is going to be this that you're going to need lesser people right to do repetitive tasks. So

uh the the model shift is is pretty rapid and and and and uh and you know uh moving in moving in a direction where you have to rethink how to do outcome based pricing

&gt;&gt; right or compute-based pricing which is connected to how it's saving you either a cost or is generating revenue for you right and and uh the I think the first layer is essentially um you know you

either have very sort of basic uh chat GPD like pricing which is so affordable that you can't say no but that typically doesn't work in enterprise right and so in enterprise essentially you are you're

you're substituting a $100,000 resource or a $50,000 resource &gt;&gt; but can you actually show that uh that that sort of cost improvement before you can before you're able to charge that

that outcome. So today like you saw in your graphs the spend is going grow growing rapidly but it's just a there is going to be a moment of truth where people reflect and say is it actually

paid me back enough? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And but where you're seeing that saving we're seeing companies of ours fly. So even small companies which have one

company called confido healthcare in the US it works on replacing a receptionist at a small clinic. So you'll say what's so great about that? finding those kind of resources and paying them $50 to

$100,000 is non-trivial for most people and the tasks are very repetitive, right? And so fundamentally we've seen that company grow 10x in one year, &gt;&gt; right? And uh it's because it's directly

pointing towards outcomes. It's not a typical SAS here's I'm you know charge me $1,000 per seat kind of a thing, right? And so depending on call volumes, depending on on on actual work done,

you're able to charge today. So it's almost like you're replacing a human worker with an agentic worker &gt;&gt; and and I think that's a fascinating shift that we've never seen before.

&gt;&gt; Yeah. Me here and then Jim &gt;&gt; if I can chime in I think it's interesting that whenever we talk about AI we we look at the human labor equivalent and that's understandable but

in our example of 5,000 plus customers you have you have spend level in a different area. So you have a cash which is your your capital is your biggest cost and if you use AI we have customers

who would found $200 million in free cash flow. &gt;&gt; So it's a huge advantage. &gt;&gt; Then if you're a materials company you could reduce inventory by $400 million.

That's a huge advantage. &gt;&gt; So labor is involved but there are so many other areas. You mentioned seatbased licensing. We have a customer who spends nearly half a billion on a

ticketing system and with AI agents we were able to automate about 84% of all ticket autonomously &gt;&gt; and they were able to reduce the IT software spend by 250 million in that

example. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; that's that's another cost area where money going to the IT the software vendor seatbased model is going away. So

the the money is coming out of many many other areas, labor being one of them. &gt;&gt; That's fantastic. Jim, you want to jump in? &gt;&gt; Yeah, I just wanted to make a point on

uh pricing, whether outcome based pricing, how it works, etc. Here's a few things that we uh definitely know. Um time and expense based pricing does not work any longer. Um which is perhaps a

conversation that uh the Indian IT industry has been having for the better part of two decades now. seatbased pricing does not work any longer which is perhaps a conversation that uh the

broader SAS industry has been having for two three years now. Those are the things that we do know. The things that we do not know is what is the ideal paradigm for pricing. I

mean we of course talk about usage based pricing. Now usage in the AI world that we live in is of course measured in different uh terms. So for example I do not know how many customers are

comfortable paying basis tokens. How many customers actually actually genuinely intuitively understand what is the meaning of tokens? And I'm not even talking you know a consumer where you

know uh claude will tell you you know you're out of tokens you need to upgrade to the you know next higher tier or you need to wait for 4 hours before you can chat with me again etc. I'm actually

talking about sophisticated enterprises who are dipping into foundational work. Nobody really knows what is token. So token based pricing while it has become you know as popular as it has become

today I'm not personally sure that that is the end state the world will live with. Similarly, you take other manifestations of usage. Whether you know in the customer service context, it

is number of tickets resolved. Whether in the voice AI context, it is number of minutes that an AI has had conversations with a customer or in the um content creation world it is you know the number

of uh images you've created or the number of words of marketing content that you've created. All of these manifestations of usage they are again extremely focused on quantity and not

necessarily on quality. You had these many minutes of customers uh you had these minutes these many minutes of uh conversation with the customer. What was the customer uh you know outcome can it

really be measured and so on. That is increasingly the conversation that we are now beginning to see enterprises have with you know our companies our portfolio companies that are selling to

them. So for example uh you know just to illustrate this example uh Gani.AI which is essentially a voice AI company they would perhaps two years ago be able to charge a large India bank basis number

of minutes that um their uh their AI agents are having conversations with customers for. But now increasingly the pricing model is being move is moving to how much debt did you help me recollect

and if you help me recollect X can I give you some bips of that X? what is the number of loans that you actually helped originate and how many of those actually closed with a human in the loop

if these many closed irrespective of how many you originated can I give you a bips of that and therefore the the very limited point that I'm trying to make is that pricing continues to be a little

bit of an art not so much a science of course you know folks like yourself from B and you of course understand that pricing is not necessarily a mathematical equation ever

&gt;&gt; well well let me let me jump on that and then I'm going to come to you because this whole there's this prices pricing conversations linked to ROI, right? Your your clients, your buyers, enterprise

buyers are saying, "Look, AI is a still a denovo technology, right? It's still a horizon technology. I'm a little uncertain. I'm spending a lot. That chart shows that they're a lot of money.

So, how do I measure ROI? And I don't want to pay fixed prices for it. I don't want to pay BNQ, right? Diamond materials for it. I see some of our IT services in the audience. I spoke to one

CEO yesterday said look what I'm doing is saying with AI I can do something in two months with six people which before I could have done with 50 people over nine months and I'm trying to split the

difference with my clients somewhat value based but it's you know he's like I just trying to find my way I know you've had these dialogues with your clients some of the services quite a bit

which is I can do X how do you price for it and that's intrinsically linked to how you think about and how they think about ROI. Can you maybe just comment about your experiences here?

&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think to start with it's tough to follow because you guys have said everything that I agree with. Um but maybe um coming back to your question, the real fundamental switch that I see

happening um both in terms of boards wanting it and AI native startups now fitting in is a shift from usage based like Chinme was saying um towards outcomedriven models right pricing

models and to Admin's point um ROI becomes that bridging the gap from a usage based thinking which is images or tokens or whatever kind of usage metric you want to look at to P&amp;L reflecting

ROI metric. Um our pricing model at Avatar is now literally a risk sharing model beyond a fixed platform subscription where we create the value and then participate in the value that

we create. And to your point um we are seeing hundreds of millions of dollars of P&amp;L cost savings even in a 500 million costbased company. So you're talking in the near term in probably 18

months being able to save 200ish million of the 500 million cost base that someone's operating with and that's huge and that's probably the reason why AI native startups will also start fitting

in because for a boat to decide a 200 million fixed investment upon to your point is very very difficult and that's without any guarantee that kind of a fixed investment is not pragmatic. Um so

I think the way it'll evolve is the boards would want a limited fixed component a measurable way to measure ROI which reflects in the P&amp;L um shows up in the storytelling that maybe the

leadership is doing with their investors and then allow the partners to participate in the value economic realized value in lack of better words. Could you also maybe you shrev me here

speak about this notion that as you speak to your clients on AI and agentic what they're saying is I don't want a 5% improvement from you I heard this yesterday as well from a client of mine

who said I want order of magnitude is that do you hear that now is that or or are we am I off here I &gt;&gt; I think that is what makes successful deployment different than the not

successful &gt;&gt; we we use the term called autonomous enterprise where up to 80% of work is either autonomous or AI assisted. &gt;&gt; And so we would try we would start the

conversation with that and say are you thinking about in that range not 5%. Uh and because that's that's the potential. &gt;&gt; I would totally agree with them. Um and I actually think um Arban there's maybe

a more fundamental aspect here which is most of the companies have tried pilots. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The pilots have led them to a purgatory zone. So they haven't really seen ROI to

your previous question and this one just bringing those two together. Um I think there's a lot of skepticism in terms of an ability to shift from pilot purgatory to a production scale system and it

probably comes to the execution. I I keep saying to my clients the hardest part of AI is not intelligence like LinkedIn and Twitter indicate. It's probably execution. And what you see is

if you do a sandbox accuracy attempt, you probably use a general purpose LLM and still be able to show 70 80% accuracy, which looks great. Yeah. &gt;&gt; But doesn't translate. Um, sorry. Go

ahead. &gt;&gt; Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you. I just meant to interrupt Arpan. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Um, the the the point that I wanted to

make is that I actually would like to discourage decision makers from thinking about ROI too much. whether you know it is an incremental 5 to 10 percentage terms or you know in revolutionary

multiple X savings and so on. That's exactly the kind of thinking that turns AI into a bit of a cost cutting exercise as opposed to an investment that should ideally compound over years. So much so

that instead of asking the question hey will I be able to save 5% of my costs let's call it I don't know manpower cost in customer service and so on the question to ask is can I actually

allocate 200 bips 300 bips of my current IBIDA and actually put that to AI as opposed to asking AI to save me some money because the right way to think about AI is not something that will make

me more efficient today the right way to perhaps think about AI is it's an existential question. Can you really afford to not become AI first if the evidence that it will give you 5%

savings this year was shaky? Can you really afford to? &gt;&gt; I think it's great. I want to ask you guys a question because one of the things we see I experience in my clients

is that you know scaling enterprise transformation is and perhaps some people think of it as a technology problem AI that there is an underwage on thinking through the human elements of a

change process if you're taking out 200 to 500 million you know me you talked about actually that impacts a lot of people that means the way work gets done is fundamentally different perhaps

Guarth services firm that means you need to price differently not the provider but meaning your customer right I have a 40 50% how does that enter into your dialogues as you're speaking to a CEO a

COO whoever it happens to be in a sea suite that like actually you need to think more broadly then about the impact to you know your legacy data and data integration but the human element of

change &gt;&gt; it's the elephant in the room isn't it um &gt;&gt; uh the look I've been personally part of hundreds of this actual conversations

and &gt;&gt; you can talk about the macro impact where uh the best data we have says that there will be more jobs created than that

would be lost &gt;&gt; but that that that that macro doesn't work in a specific conversation. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So what happens in a spec specific conversation is a very compassionate

conversation about team coming together and deciding what future looks like. Can I share one or two to kind of ground the conversation because if you stay at this level it only makes it into the Twitter

feeds or X feeds. &gt;&gt; Um take an example of a one UK large hospital. they they they through AI they automated a process and that ended up saving 4,000 lives.

Now it resulted in certain job changes as a result of it and this was a community hospital. Now you should be outraged that there is an administrative process that cost 4,000 lives

and and so the community said no we want to change this forget about jobs. Yeah. So in that conversation there was no debate. There is another conversation in Europe that I was part of where it was a

unionized labor. There was a team of 50 people and the AI process removed all virtually all errors and there was a 50 people team just solving errors. So the union rep union participated and the and

we say but you cannot create jobs by creating errors. Errors go away, jobs go away. So each of these conversations are a very open dialogue, very compassionate dialogue about what makes sense and they

have to happen. Hundreds of this have to happen in every scenario. &gt;&gt; So Shravant and maybe Gothic Chim I love you because part of what I constantly hear is part of the role of what AI is

attacking is the human putty that sits between systems of records and systems of actions and sideload and um to your point. So how do you how is this must come up in your dialogues? Certainly

does. But Katik, do you want to? &gt;&gt; No, I think uh for us as as investors not not as much of of like sort of insight into that. Um the way we see it, Aran is that um there's a slightly

different insight I want to give. Right. In India, if you see a lot of the the companies that have done extremely well in migrating from trying to be a software only player like a SAS player

&gt;&gt; into a what we used to call uh internally a SAS player meaning you don't sit and sell software you take control of the transaction layer and improve the outcome was happening even

before the AI world. Uh so if you look at all the B2B behemoths that have been built in India uh trying to be like Zetwork and all of these guys they become full stack providers.

&gt;&gt; So now when we look at uh a Indian founders thinking at least in the context of the Indian enterprise we don't see it as are you replacing cost or ROI alone. We actually apply that

same principle to an AI first world where you're saying the the the provider is not going there and selling tech but actually selling the full outcome and actually owning the full outcome. It

gives an opportunity for you to get a piece of you know the the example that Chinai gave that you can charge certain basis points. So so we have a similar company Chunai didn't start as an AI

foundational model. It started as a loan recovery agency business right and two years ago when we funded the company we thought we'll have to scale from 500 human agents to 1500 human agents now we

have down to 250 and the agents have the AI agents have taken over and there you don't actually simply go and say I'll build a technology solution but you actually improve loan recovery rates by

giving better outcomes to the banks and I see this future of this company as someone who actually owns loan books &gt;&gt; okay &gt;&gt; yeah not simply just gives a technology

layer, right? And to the point that may was raising, you have to fundamentally say, are you doing the right thing for a person who's struggling to pay back and dealing with that particular customer

with empathy and making the credit system in this country more robust? Are you worried about like losing five relatively dumb jobs of a loan agent calling and screaming at 10 people? That

was the job. Okay? &gt;&gt; Right? Like how how's that a great job, right? So I think the I think the power of AI is that it eliminates in my humble opinion more dumb jobs than than we were

worried about and a lot of humans should not be doing those dumb jobs. Like if you if you look at weeding for example which one of our agri robotics companies does weeding actually weeding human

weeding. So if you have a crop in India like cotton, human labor migrates farm to farm to actually weed, &gt;&gt; right? A computer vision enabled robot can actually spray weed that much better

than any human can. &gt;&gt; No. So is that a form of employment that you want to encourage or do you want AI to take that over? And the US is US is buying that product faster than India.

&gt;&gt; Okay. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I know being in India, we think of labor as our core competency and so again I'm re rephrasing the question. We always come back to labor. Let me take an

example. We have a large Indian company here that is a very capital inensive business using AI agents. They are looking at saving 20,000 crores in their cash. You

know how many labor it would take to save that? Forget labor. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I tell them in a capital intensive business or I go to Europe with where unions are there and it's a

manufacturing company. I said I don't want to talk about labor. I want to save in material. I want to save in cash because your 90% savings will come out of that.

&gt;&gt; And I I I insist so many times why are you going? I mean there is this knowledge industry where labor is the primary cost &gt;&gt; but for so many industry labor is not

your primary cost. &gt;&gt; Why bother? &gt;&gt; Whatever you go ahead. Um sorry to break your chin. Um but I think you know we could debate for the next two hours on

this and we will see differing opinions and I'll tell you why. um one size will not fit all and if you just take a step back AI is real part is nonlinearity right it's decoupling demand and supply

it could either um translate into cost savings in the near term it could as chinme was saying actually drive revenue growth in you know reimagining the business model from the deterministic

state that we've all architected our business yesterday to the AI native nonlinear way of architecting businesses and that's why I I actually in my experience I put to your This is the

biggest negotiation topic with most companies. What I see is the different cohorts. If a company has demand much greater than supply, it'll likely drive towards revenue growth. If a company is

probably struggling with unit economics or margin profile and doesn't have that kind of a demand growth, it is going to translate into cost savings because it's constraints that they're living with.

And uh the same rule will not fit those kind of archetypes. So and maybe that's just the point that I wanted to &gt;&gt; yeah put forward &gt;&gt; Jim and then after you I'm going to sort

of just slightly tack a different direction. &gt;&gt; Sure. I I'll take a quick minute um I'll just thank uh Karthik for outraging the sensibilities of the urban Indian by

telling us that weeding is done by migratory manual labor [laughter] but um more to the point um I just want to make a fundamental comment that you know because of AI there will be winners

and there will be losers. So there's all manners of conversations happening with decision makers. For some decision makers, the conversation that you need to make this multi-million dollar

investment in AI right now so that you're able to reap benefits uh sometime into the future are easy conversations. Others on the other hand are more lured by the more attractive conversations of

you know how many uh product managers or how many uh you know designers can I get rid of by putting this model in one silo of my ops, right? those are not necessarily the right kind of

conversations to have and therefore there will be companies that are NGMI and simply not going to make it right [snorts] and the real um the real conversation to have in the AI context

is not so much you know what model can IU put in to do my customer service and so on. The real conversation to have is uh how are my data pipelines working? How do I build a unified data

architecture? How do I bring together you know the 45 legacy systems that I have uh put together over the course of last two decades? How does that tech debt get paid off for me to become AI

ready? But that's the boring painstaking expensive conversation with no real ROI in the next nine months. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's fantastic. Let me sort of tack the dialogue a little bit a

different direction. What's come through this dialogue and lots of dialogues I'm sure over the next few days and I know it's in the ether is what is India's role in enterprise AI

transformation both in India and for the globe right for the last 20 years India has played an incredible role both through our services industries and our software industry of help helping

transform companies globally from a technology perspective obviously with a laborheavy model As you think about the next wave with AI, what is our role? Is it applied

technologies? Perhaps it's not frontier models. We will have semiconductors in India, but perhaps not for the next few years. Will we will we be providers of GPUs and TPUs? So what is the role of

India? How should we think think about the role of India in applied AI for enterprise transformation? So maybe well Mahir I'm gonna actually have you go last but I know you have a strong

opinion on this but maybe Sra Garthik and I'm just you know opposing views are okay &gt;&gt; very important point and I think it's existential almost for India to figure

out an answer to this um my view is um I mean let me take an analogy right if if you look at esro um in space tech and if you contrast that with say a US or a China we probably not really competing

on landing on Mars first. But if it's about putting a satellite in the orbit to power our mobile communications, we're probably the cheapest by a factor of 50x. So that I think there are two

dimensions of AI. US and China are primary focused on accuracy and AGI, the artificial super intelligence or general intelligence as it's referred to. But there is also a here and now impact

unlock which is probably what you're referring to as applied which I think would be more on the efficiency curve. If you look if you think of a large volume enterprise workflow the inference

costs using a 1.8 trillion parameter model would be prohibitive. So there is a need for efficiency not just accuracy and there are techniques today like distillation which deepse kind of

introduced uh to the world u which India is very apt at India AI missions doing a lot of that and I think there's a play there where it's you don't really need to compete with US and China but instead

piggyback on that base foundational layer and translate that into real usable intelligence either for enterprises or for citizens or for even governance initiatives which is how

we're framing it as part the India mission but Karthik if why don't you go &gt;&gt; I I think our advantage has been uh quality of people and and uh just raw horsepower in terms of talent I think

there's a massive repurposing of that that's required um I feel like the guys who were doing IT services where the jobs were more as as you said human coding human QA human integration all of

that can be rapidly adapted uh I think the world as a as a whole you see all these hot headlines about uh AI native companies moving very very fast. You your survey themselves said you know

only 20% think of this as the number one priority and that's because I think most companies internally are not as adept to being able to do everything themselves. So the IT services industry becoming an

AI transformation services industry is like on the cards otherwise I think the the big six or 10 in India will lose their advantage very rapidly. That's one small segment as when it comes to the

venture guys like the folks you have on on the panel here. &gt;&gt; I think our opportunity is pretty much like a reset of what we saw 10 15 years ago in SAS. uh so we don't have to

necessarily be the only the AWS or the Google uh uh you know cloud of India uh uh that while that opportunity is the government is trying to set a level playing field on infra as quickly as

possible I think the ability to go and build for an Indian use case I think we will always lie with the Indians because both of both for from a cost structure and an outcome perspective I think it's

very difficult for an American company to come here and establish their presence and and beat beat Indian company our ability to go win the world is it's like there was always skepticism

around that Arpan that how many 10 billion plus dollar companies have we built out of India in the product space right but I actually think this is a added impetus in that direction because

the level playing field is again at at at zero at this juncture so we can move faster we can move our talent faster but it if you if you look at the size of the talent pool in India on IT services

almost all of that has to pretty much overnight magic wand transform itself into becoming AI native and I think that is that is a future that we can win if we can move our talent to to that and

we've shamelessly batted on a company that actually uh upskills people on AI talent so because we think that is that is the next step uh for India &gt;&gt; that's fantastic I want I'm going to

come to you next and just for context info part of info edges ventures mission is to find Indian entrepreneurs right to find Indian entrepreneurs that are building disruptive ly both for India

and the globe. So in this con this question around what is our role in AI whether it's applied AI if you agree with that or something else how do you think about it what are you looking for

what are you finding &gt;&gt; sure um I I personally uh think of applied AI as a bit of a reductive framing I do not think any country &gt;&gt; or any company or any ecosystem will

necessarily have the right to scale applied AI beyond a certain point unless Everything else that is needed to do AI in the ecosystem is also owned somewhat locally. Um so you know um AI

accelerators, high bandwidth memory, power data centers, foundation uh models and so on all of it will also need to be done in some measure some capacity um in India by Indian entrepreneurs as well.

So I'm not necessarily suggesting that you know some Indian founder is going to build a foundational model that is going to take on open AI or anthropic in the next one year. All I'm suggesting is

that we need to have a have our own foundational models whether you you build it using techniques like distillation or whatever have you to be able to tackle Indian challenges number

one. So you know indic languages, Indian voice accents and so on. but also to be able to service some of the more global problems that uh you know the Indian uh IT BO KPO industry has been servicing

over the course of last few decades. On top of that, I completely echo Karthik's thoughts that historically our advantage has been a deep talent pool uh serviceoriented

um DNA and you know an ability to uh perhaps deliver solutions cheaper. But we also now have perhaps the most advanced DPI and the DPI that we have whether in

terms of you know having uh you know data of 1.3 billion people having data around I don't know maybe more than 10 12 billion UPI transactions every month uh having some understanding of how

commerce is being done through these are uniquely Indian advantages that are going to help us build foundational advances in India that subsequently will help us earn the right to do

applied AI. &gt;&gt; It does. Mi I know you have a very deeply held point of view on this topic. So &gt;&gt; I think this is a global experiment. So

we have an amazing opportunity to learn from everywhere this is being run. So you can see the frontier models in US. You can see regulations in uh Europe. I think to your point India's strength has

to be in the applied AI. In my view there is no point in chasing frontier models. I think today everything we wanted to do it if there was no no more investment in frontier models we can do

80% of everything we want to do and with one GPU we can do 95% of everything we want to do. I think it's about infusing AI into every sector of economy. That's where the return is. And if you look at

the example of China, that's a good example because it's a good balance between technology progression but the infusion of AI because uh so take example of the different industrial hub

that India has whether it's Mumbai Pune or Chennai or various hubs for various industries there is a way to focus AI and infuse in those sectors to create a competitiveness that is you can compete

at the world level And that is where the power lies. I think if it was up to me, I would reframe the conversation. This is not about this is an opportunity where how can India outflank everybody

else. And so the way we could switch we could skip a we could skip a landline revolution and went straight to mobile. The western civilization has a trillions dollars of investment done. So they are

slow to move and India hasn't done some of those old investment which is going to completely bypass it into a new AIdriven model and outflank other economies. So I I think it is a it is a

technology moment but most importantly it's a leadership moment. &gt;&gt; And I would I would every time I meet an Indian leader and they say look we want to do this we want to catch up said you

don't want to catch up you want to outflank. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So let me and then Carrick you should jump in. I want to build on this point because let's let's go back to

enterprise AI transformation in India. There's two sides to this coin which is what can India do as providers of services talent software AI but there's the other side which is as a CEO as a

promoter what should I be doing to push further on the adoption of these technology because you know that chart I showed that you know Dr. Caric you referred to as 20 said percent said it's

my number one priority 50% top three I would conjecture if I showed the India only data those numbers would be quite different it would be 10% would say it's a top priority 25 would say it's top

three so and I think that's a little bit your point me which is you have to have both sides to this I'd like to get what what do you say to the CEOs promoters in this audience

&gt;&gt; I'm not in a position to I mean advocate to them but we're seeing the best of those examples come through So like the earnings call which did a lot of buzz last week was Bajage Finance talking

about how the college in volume has gone through the roof &gt;&gt; and their ability to service their customer has has just you know just dramatically shifted in just two three

quarters right and so I think people have to take cues from this and not worry about oh should I should I radically transform everything overnight you can take pieces of your businesses

that are core and actually move dramatically. So we are benefiting right so we have companies I'm sure in all our portfolios or you know uh like in in our case squad exotel etc which are actually

powering some of this you know automation for example so my my point is slightly different I think for the first time India doesn't have to focus there's a there's a US-centric world which was

where we used to drive most of our attention to because India wasn't adopting fast enough and then there's China which has incredible you know technology cap capability but is not

trusted by a lot of the world and so I think for the first time the the playing field when it gets leveled like this the fact that you don't have to put humans in every other market and AI can

actually do the bulk of the work opens up the rest of the world as a marketplace for you which was never there historically so why aren't you servicing Europe, Africa, Southeast

Asia, Middle East far more dramatically because they do not have talent pools or their native models or application areas. It should all be available to us there. Of course it is more challenging.

It's like adding 50 more states to the Indian you know to the Indian market and saying can we go and actually win in 80 different markets but I think that's an opportunity waiting for us to happen and

you can build multi-billion dollar companies and within the Indian context I I feel like you know the Indian enterprise which was broadly as as pointed out multiple times today by

Mahir as well rather than focus on you know how can we be uh process and cost competitive using labor which is the wrong way to think about the problem. &gt;&gt; How do we repurpose ourselves in

building kind of agentic first enterprises which nobody ever thought was possible in India cuz you threw kept throwing labor at the problem but that's not the way to think about how to solve

better for an Indian audience. So eventually I think the the net total of that is there is a UPI like like there is a UPI like moment waiting to happen. &gt;&gt; In India or a or a UID like moment

waiting to happen in India &gt;&gt; on a a AI application layer which suddenly catapults India to a very different you know opportunity set than playing piggyback on what the US is

developing for us. &gt;&gt; I love that. So let's take let me piggyback on what you just said. We have somebody here in the stage who's actually helping to build the UPI for of

AI for India. What would you say to what Garthik said and also just comment a little bit on my assertion that like what would you say to the CEOs and promoters to get moving here?

&gt;&gt; I think there's a two-minut time check they getting. &gt;&gt; So I'll keep my answer short but yes we um we have been given a grant by India mission to build something called

unified AI interface um UAI. It's trying to emulate what UPI did for payments but doing it for AI. Um it'll be a digital public infrastructure eventually trying to accelerate what Karthik was speaking

about and Mir was speaking about right. I I think that's honestly the real opportunity and probably an existential problem statement to tackle as we stand today. The only thing that I would add

is we keep talking about labor and population as a negative in the AI world. If you really want to get to AGI, reinforcement learning through human feedback is going to be the path to get

there. And I think there is an opportunity to flip the hourglass of looking at population as a liability in the world that we are perhaps watching and convert that into an advantage. Um,

and if we do that at a population scale, I think that's what's going to lead the leadership even at a foundational model mayor. So a little bit of a contra contrarian viewpoint on population being

a liability versus perhaps being spinned and utilized as an advantage. I think we are probably over time. So &gt;&gt; fantastic. Look, this was incredibly helpful. I know we're a minute or two

over time, but I do believe one of the some of the things you can take away from this panel is that there's one the moment is now, right? If you were talking to a CEO, if you're talking to a

promoter in the room, if you're not adopting AI, get on it right away. The results stories are real. You've heard it from from these guys. Um the role for India is pro is large both locally and

and for the globe. Um so thank you for the time. This is wonderful. Ja Mi Gartan, thank you so much. &gt;&gt; Thank you for having us. Thank you. Thank you to our esteemed panelists. We

will now be giving away momentos. Can you just call for one photo please with the moment? &gt;&gt; One photo with the Many thanks to Bane for organizing this

fantastic session and thank you to our audience for joining us. Please stay back for the next session with Bharat Jen. We request our audience to please exit

through this gate and the audience for Bharat Jen may please enter through the gate on my left. Thank you so much.
