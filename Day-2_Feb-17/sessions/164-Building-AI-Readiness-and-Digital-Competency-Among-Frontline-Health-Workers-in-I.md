## 📝 Transcript

Hello, good evening everyone. So we will start this session. Um I hope everybody I I Request everyone to settle down please. Oh yeah. Yeah.

Okay, so we are all set. A very good evening to everyone. Um I am Dr. Valerie and I am the state nodal officer for state health systems resource center meala and I would like to welcome each

and every one of you our distinguished panelists our um guests who are here participants. um very happy that you could make it to this uh session today being a last

session of the day. I'm very glad that you could make it. Uh as you've seen, we have distributed some um handouts to you. This session today, we expect it to be a bit different um not a oneway

conversation, but we would like it to be a little bit more interactive. Okay. So to start with um it is with great privilege and honor that I welcome to the ders uh Dr. Satkumar um I

principal secretary um to the government of Migalia for the department of health and family welfare etc. I would also like to welcome to the dis uh Sharma Shridas. She is a senior program officer

for strengthening institutional capacity in the health team of the Gates Foundation India uh office where she leads investments that engage government, academic and research

institutions to strengthen health systems and accelerate adoption of scalable technology. Uh before we go ahead, I would just like to give a brief uh insight on on on a

bit of uh what we want to do here. So as of now we are meeting at a time when healthcare across the world is undergoing a very um profound transformation

and there's a rapid advance in uh technology growing health needs and collective aspiration of quality service as well as equitable services in health. Um with this um context in mind, digital

tools are no longer an option for us, but it is something that we should leverage in order to advance the the needs and aspirations we have for the health uh of our people. So we have

electronic health records. We also have tele medicine which we are already doing. Apart from that real-time surveillance and AI supported clinical decision making. This is how we uh

aspire to deliver services, train health workers, manage data and respond to health emergencies. However, technology alone cannot transform health systems. The real

strength lies in the people who are confident, competent and ethically grounded in using these tools. From the community and primary care providers to specialists, program managers and policy

makers. This panel brings together valuable experience and diverse perspectives. And I am confident that today's discussion will help us explore new pathways and

practical pathways to address the challenges that we have in the health system today. With these words, uh may I um begin with Shri Sat Kumar Sur to uh give a bit of context on the work that

is being proposed in Migallaya. Thank you. So good morning to all of you. Uh nice to see everyone. A lot of uh people who are here in this room. I know most of

them. Uh thank you for attending this uh you know uh session and uh thanks to Shamba from Gates Foundation and uh and also the Dr. Adapa Kartik who's from the WHO. my colleague in the IS and you know

and amnesty professor amnesty from John Hopkins and professor Diwaker from again John Hopkins and and on all my team members like Dr. Valerie and SSRC so what uh u I would like to share here

about uh the the the the why it is so important uh to build the AI readiness and digital competency among frontline workers. So I think while you know most of the health care if you ask me like

you know it's delivered by the front line and why it is delivered by front line you can see in the pictures you know you you have seen how actually the the kind

of a frontline workers are trying to really solve problems at the last mile you know delivery issues. So while you know especially this is all the more important for you know especially states

like Meghallaya under you know underserved or you know hard-to-reach areas where you know the it is a frontline workers who are actually closer to the problem. So it is

important for us to really you know build that capacity or you know the state capacity at the front line. So, so what government of Migalia is trying to do is that how actually we can really

build the state capacity or state capability we call it building state capabilities. Our one of our prime objective to do that you know we started actually looking at like you know by

seeing the context you know how do you you know uh really empower it. So I the when we started this work you know this was the problem just I wanted to share this problem with you. In fact by seeing

this data what you can see is that our maternal mortality rate is almost like a three times than the national average. So so again what is the reason you go and see the difficult challenges. 25% of

the villages are hard to reach villages and you know it's so difficult for any pregnant mother to come and you know you know you know on time to really get a safe delivery. So, so this is again when

we looked at uh this is these are about the data but what was happening was that uh when we were not thinking about the building state capacity the usual default approach was that you know we

have massive national programs massive you know we have but uh the the focus was more on implementing the programs you know rather than solving the problems you know it's a it's a it's a

kind of a you know a kind of a default explanations used to come you know why MMR is very high because we have less specialists we don't have infrastructure you know these are the kind of a you

know general answers and people used to think that like this has to be fixed by some central authority not by them you know not by them means those who are closer to the problem so how do you

shift you know shifting that identity of frontline workers was uh the important you know shift that what we made in terms terms of building state capacity. How do you uh shift the identity in such

a way that you know where you know the there is a sense of purpose you know they you know people you know look at that like you know there they can actually innovate they can solve the

problems you know instead of looking at always you know something from above then the second important thing what we have observed was we used to collect lot of data data was there you know and but

we are not analyzing the data in fact this I spoke yesterday also in the another conference with the secretary health ma'am So we were data we were collecting but we're not actually using

the data. We're not analyzing the data. We're not actually taking make sense of the data. So how do you effectively use the data? So these are the two problems that we try to fix in that sense

actually you know and once you actually empower in fact data is a motivation. Data is really can provide positive public service motivation if you really use it in a right way. So this is

something that you know if somebody knows that you know I'm actually saving lives because of this data. In fact it's much more you know it's it's it's a basically sense of purpose how do you

build it? So so we created this uh you know framework in 2020 and we started actually implementing this work in the state of Megalia just broadly we call it building you know state capability. How

actually especially the main uh purpose is how do you restore the purpose you know how do you you know restore the purpose you know to solve problems you know you know which are you know in the

locally contextual manner. So as part of that one of our main pillar is that building the front line building the leadership at front line building that decentralized leadership at the front

line and then of course there's another thing how you're able to use the data and research and of course we are inspired by some of these theories that I would like to you know I you know I

think most of you are aware but like you know just one of the important theories that adapt to leadership you know giving work back to the people you know those Actually it's a it's it's a phenomenally

phenomenally empowering if you actually if somebody comes that like you know I have a problem you know if you ask them give the work back to them you know solve the problem by yourself it's like

a giving agency so this is what was happening in the state of Megallaya and then how do you you know then of course with a with a purpose that you know state has the capacity it's like a

mission economy like state has the capacity to bring transformative development because uh it is the people you know state means for people. So, so that's where we are working and this is

the the framework with which actually we have been working you know and we are getting some good results. In fact, that's where we we are able to you know share some of this work and uh today I

think Shama will take the next slides how actually we are introducing this entire you know framework you know especially how do you bring this AI readiness and digital competency

framework within the system you know Sham thank you &gt;&gt; um good evening everyone great to see a full house at 6 in the evening So thank you for being here. Um thank you Dr.

Valerie for the kind introduction and to sample for setting the stage. Um so we signed an MOU with the government of Migalia which is centered around health. Uh and to be very honest while digital

health was a component of the memorandum of understanding uh we weren't really thinking AI but like in a year a year and a half AI is center stage. Uh and that's what happens with technology. uh

so in the next couple of minutes I'll try to just uh further the case of why we need uh competency as a core tenant of newer age AI tools. Uh and I scanned the summit I don't think there are any

sessions apart from this on competency. Um so so that I think uh is a relatively uncharted territory in in this field. So uh like any other technological innovations whether it was internet

whether it was mobile phones and today it's very difficult to imagine that both of them were different inventions because they are so closely inter today but with any innovation

uh you will have naysayers and fortunately or unfortunately we are introducing AI enabled tools in the age of digital and super connectivity and mis disinformation. information. So it's

even more important u to understand what competencies would be needed in the ecosystem that the tools are introduced. Uh so this slide uh is very megaliacentric. So the words that are

mentioned on these slides most of you might not be even familiar with and Dr. The Marba will talk about village health councils, Ashas and pretty much everyone knows but what an Asha app does in

Migalia is very Migalia specific. What the mother app does in Migalia is very like&amp;m and maternal and child mortality specific. But the point is that all of these tools today have some features. So

the ones you see in brown are features which already exist. So I'll take the example of say the Asha app. It's for incentive management but we know that it's just a matter of time that newer

features will come in. So features of like decision support, stock management, referral support, it's not too far in the future. It will come but are we designing it keeping the health worker

at the center and the health worker is not one person. It's a heterogeneous group. You pick up states the states frontline workers are heterogeneous. you pick up a carder within that every

carder operates differently and so how the AI enabled digital tool will be rolled out needs to think of that and that's why the competency of the carter of that specific individual needs to be

mapped needs to be measured and like the session says it needs to be built over time. Um if you think of uh MS XL I mean I don't

know how many people use Microsoft PowerPoint now because now Canva is there. How many people use uh you know even the iPhone right people use less than 5% of what the tool can actually

do. So when we are introducing AI tools with such large investments are we even uh unlocking the full potential of the tool and that can actually happen if you enable Ashas&amp;M's village health councils

any carder that you talk of do an analysis of what are the competencies you require to unlock this what are the competencies you today have and what is the journey you need to make so that's

like the big thing the second is Like satso was saying frontline workers are the closest to the community. It's not about deploying a fancy tool. It is about providing universal affordable

care to patients and they know the community best. So if you are not enabling them to use the tool better, it is a disservice to them and to the community. And the third which I think

you will hear in pretty much every room that you enter in these five days is about safety. it's about trust. Uh you have to think of those things and today today I don't think the frontline

workers of this country especially in some settings are ready for it. And so we'll delve deeper into these competencies um and you know where AI fits into the

picture. Uh so can I move it to Dr. Valerie and then she can move it forward. Thank you. Thank you Shama and thank you sir uh for

putting the perspective of Migghala the geographical challenges and the various other challenges that are there but we hope that with the enabling environment that is there uh we will surely uh you

know um uh overcome these challenges and um we would go ahead in terms of improving of our health indicators and I'm sure that with the support of Gates Foundation Shamba has um I should say

nailed the I mean hit the nail on the head right uh when she said about the competencies and of health workers and how we use the AI tools not only I to any digital tool in fact for uh for the

purposes that we we think it is being uh done but then actually because of it's not being it's underused and because it is not as per their competencies the the usage of such tools are very uh very

low. So thank you for that and for our next um discussion may I call on the ders uh Dr. Amnesty uh Dr. Amnesty is an associate professor in the University of Cape Town and um

yes uh next I would also like to invite um Dr. Nayanjit um he yeah Dr. Nayanjit. He is the uh senior consultant for human resources for health in the SHSRC. I would also like to invite Dr. Karthik

Adapa. He serves as the regional advisor for the digital health at WHO uh Southeast Asia region. And last but not the least, we I may I invite Dr. Marba who is the senior consultant for social

mobilization and gender for SHSRC in Malia. So um I hand over the uh the rest of the proceeding to Dr. Amnesty uh you know on on the discussion. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much everyone. So we've

been um cut for a little bit of time so bear with me. I'm going to um cut through some of our slides a little bit quickly. Can I just get a show of hands? Um how many have heard of digital

competency before. Okay, we have some familiarity. Okay, so that means this part will go very quickly. So um and maybe just digital literacy versus digital competency. Do we know the

distinction? No. Okay, some one person in the back. Oh, a handful of our our dear colleagues over there do. So this again hopefully will be quite quick. But I'm going to kick us off before I get

into sort of key terminology. Um this next session is going to have four main messages. The first is that we want to sort of situate digital competency within a larger measurement process. So

not only is digital competency nested within a broader process of competency mapping, we want to sort of understand it as the starting point for assessing further improvements of digital

innovations particularly as Shama and Dr. Valerie mentioned around enhancements of existing solutions, capacity building initiatives, etc. Um you might have seen a lot of different

alternatives ways of thinking about digital competency. There are a number of frameworks on the market. Um I think the the salient point is that they must be measurable and contextually relevant.

Um and translating these frameworks to practical tools is an iterative and lengthy process but one well worth undertaking. And then I think Shama made this point very nicely. We need to

design solutions for where we want health workers to be not necessarily where they are right now. So part of the sort of design of digital competency measurement you'll see involves a

reimagining of workflows and going beyond where current digital solutions are in use and trying to reenter solutions to be around the health workers full scope of work and away from

siloed initiatives. And then finally in sort of layering in the village health committees and including communities we need to really sort of strengthen the state citizen relationship and improve

the connection between communities and health systems. So I I led with this. I think you know it already but just to sort of contextualize you know we don't want to go through an hour of

discussions then at the end people are like oh what is digital competency? I thought it was something different. So um these terms digital literacy and digital competency are often sort of

used interchangeably. Digital literacy is really about knowledge and understanding of digital technologies. There's a definition on the screen from UNESCO. Um but in essence it's

juxtaposed against digital competency which is really about applying digital skills in real life. The European Commission defines that as the confident, critical and responsible use

of technology for a range of purposes including learning, work, participation in society. So it's a broader process of application. So digital competency importantly

includes three pieces knowledge, skills and attitudes. very helpfully who has given us this sort of pyramid of key audiences that we need to think about when we talk about

digital competency starting at the base population people and patients and moving up u practitioners and providers planners researchers developers and then finally at the top policy makers and

decision makers um for the sake of today's conversation we're just going to go through the base of the pyramid just sort of noting our colleagues from the world bank have done some very

interesting work to address digital competency on the top two so if you're interested in that talk to after um but just in terms of starting at the base the I want to sort of introduce

something called the dig comp framework. This is probably the most recognized global framework on digital competency measurement. It emerged first in 2013 and the latest iteration was published

last month. It gives us a sort of helpful grounding of digital competency within five domains. Um I won't go through each of these but just simply to say that within each domain you have

competency areas. The number of those varies based on the domain and within each of these you have a number of different digital skills, attitudes and knowledges which can be measured. For

someone to have basic digital competency, I need to be able to perform at least one skill in each of these five areas. Um, in terms of population level

measurement, um, the ITU has given us sort of this digital skills indicator and full disclosure, we've helped them develop the questions for this. Um and it it's it provides sort of a helpful

foundation and a standardized approach across their 196 member states for measuring digital competency at a population level. That said, it has a lot of notable limitations. Many of the

parameters are very computer centric, continues to be quite eurosentric and not well suited for mobile first populations. In recognition of that, we've tried to develop alternative

measures including a digital access and use index which considers the broader range of access and use um considerations which are more relevant for populations like we have here in

India. Um and digital competency feeds into that as well. So this is sort of one population level resource. Um and so with that kind of background in mind, I want to turn us over to thinking about

practitioners and providers and ask my colleague Dr. Nang to come up and start us off on that conversation. Um, sorry, I realized I have one more slide.

Bear with me. I'm so sorry. Okay. All right. Sorry. Just sort of one more. No, no, please come. So, I realized sort um so when we're thinking about how we're actually going to do an applied approach

of digital competency measurement for Maggalia, we're sort of thinking of it in the context of a four-step process. It starts with tool development, moves on to the implementation of that tool,

and then proceeds with analysis and use. This is not rocket science, but I just want to underscore that underpinning this process is a very lengthy, detailed process to get us to robust data that we

can use to inform action. So, we'll go through this throughout the slides to come, but in essence, um, we're going to start with kind of the tool development process, and my colleagues, um, Dr.

Marba and Dr. Nanget are going to take us through what we're doing in Mgalia to kick this off. Sorry. &gt;&gt; Thank you Dr. Amnesty and good evening to everyone. Uh it's quite an

opportunity for us to present a very humble work that we have been doing. First of all, we had to reimagine the plight of a healthare provider uh within the public sector health

facilities be it from uh the health and wellness centers or the primary health centers or uh district hospital. Uh so we were trying to map about four different cards themses

across different hospitals and facilities and also the medical officers in different roles. Now um so so being a medical graduate myself uh you know we remember we learned what our professors

taught us and we we were certified as graduates of medicine based on the expected outcomes that our professors and examiners deemed appropriate for us. But whether I was capable of actually

seeing a patient after I got my certificate was a very scary situation. So, so uh so we had to really sit together and understand what is it that a healthcare provider in these

grassroots where we have so much of resource constraints uh deserve to be trained on and then uh well the government of India's mission karmogi came into our rescue. So if you all have

looked at the website of mission karmugi the the capacity building commission it talks about uh shifting the paradigm from role uh rule based to role based competencies and it talks about three

major components in terms of competencies. Number one is domain specific number two is functional or technical. Number three is behavioral. So, so it's something like this like in

in towing the lines of Dr. Amnesty. So, if you are if you know how to drive a drive a car Yeah. And you have learned how to drive a car in Delhi, you may not be able to actually drive in Ahmedabad.

Okay. Those who have gone to Ahmedabad, you know what I mean. And then if you land up in New York, it's altogether different because this the other side of the road, right? So, competency uh is

outcome driven in a given context. So our medical uh training, our nursing training, all our healthcare training, our public health training needs to be contextualized within the given role

that the provider actually plays. So looking at that we did multiple consultations across several districts and uh almost everywhere we found you know similar insights. So we like this

is one of the pictures uh in one of the districts where we were meeting a number of stakeholders from the grassroots to the top district uh decision maker and then uh we uh met across a series of

consultations with experts from various domains and uh we sort of did a very interesting exercise. we sort of uh simulated kind of a workflow that a particular patient in a health facility

encounters across uh the experience that he or she has. For example, in let's say here I'm showing the example of uh a woman in third stage of labor in the health and

wellness center. So what kind of situations does she undergo and what kind of interactions and encounters happen? We sort of mapped this entire simulated workflow and then we tried to

understand what are the domain specific what are the functional technical and the behavioral competences that the&amp;m must demonstrate during this uh entire series of encounters and then uh we also

extracted some of the digital competition. So as you see for every such process where um a certain output is involved a digital competency is not an option as Dr. Valeri was alluding to

in the beginning it is integral part of the performance of the EN&amp;M. So therefore just you know from absolutely the the first encounter where NM meets a woman on third stage of labor she not

only has to be able to clinically equipped to assess the vitals but also use the gadgets and the devices uh and record them right so similarly if you go to managing uh let's say postpartum

hemorrhage whether she's able to provide the right sort of uh to at the end if you look at while the woman is exiting the center, whether she's given uh the advices, the right

advices, the right reference, but also whether she's able to record and report so that the loop goes back to the you know district to the state and then the decision making comes back through the

electronic system for uh proper action at different levels. So, so this is where digital competency becomes an integral part of the overall core competency set of a provider. So, we

have done this mapping for more than 50 different role based scenarios and this was presented to the cabinet also by the last uh MD NHM. So, uh similarly we are now thinking about expanding it

to guarders that have to be mapped for such competencies. Dr. Amnesty, would you like to take over please? Thanks. &gt;&gt; Thank you. So again just moving from the&amp;m to the ASHAS. So it's a very sort

of applied process of taking what the existing guidelines are looking at the roles and activities highlighted in red is an example of service provision. I've carried we've carried that slide over

here. You can see we similarly would map the competencies to each of these activities and then the digital competencies on top of that. were able to sort of link back with global

frameworks, hence the patchwork of colors on the right where sort of for example managing digital records securely maps back to larger global frameworks on the the competency area of

safety. Um we can then take those digital competencies and get quite granular in terms of the required digital skills to attain these. Um so this you can imagine leads to sort of

quite an exhaustive list of digital skills. We then have to go through a process of prioritization. you have realistically in doing an assessment maybe 45 minutes with a provider codra.

So this then leads to sort of a cross-checking of the digital skills with different desired target outcomes. Again for time sake we won't be able to go into this. Um and then finally you

have a draft tool and then ultimately this tool will get implemented um initially as a cross-sectional survey in three uh districts amongst five different cadres in Malia. It will get

analyzed. We'll talk through some of the analysis and and use case issues as as we progress further into the interactive discussion. But just to sort of pause on the use um here we're thinking of it as

sort of informing the digitalization of VHC's which Dr. Mara will talk about um helping build health worker capacity and then of course designing new innovations and then enhancing existing ones. So I'd

like to invite my doc colleague Dr. Marva to come up. Thank you so much uh Dr. Amnesty and a very good evening uh to each one of you. Uh so building on what has been shared

throughout by all the the speakers this evening. I think our vision in Migalia is to actually embed the competency at the grassroot level especially within our village health councils. So who are

these village councils in Migalia that we have? So the government of Migallia has actually notified these village health councils or the VHC that we called uh as a nodal community

institution to mobilize action on health and nutrition and also to be able to serve as a critical bridge between the state health system and the communities and as you've seen from the slide that

since March 2022 we have been able to form about around 6,700 BC's that has been formed across the state. So the uniqueness of the VAC's and Malia is that uh they function within this

traditional governance system making the headman or the chief and the village councils to play a very central role in community participation understanding power equity in the local health

governance and thereby with able they were able also to discuss these health challenges with the kind of authority and power that they have within them. They're able to facilitate problem

solving. They'll also be able to facilitate actions and also discuss these health challenges during these VC's meeting that they usually have once a month. Um this is a structure of what

the VAC is. Each vac should have at least 10 executive members which the uniqueness of this is that 50% of these members has to be women and the members are these all of these members thank you

are reelected after every three years. So the typ the headman typically as you you can see from the slide he t he typically serve as the chairperson of these uh VAC's and this actually reflect

a very strong traditional governance structure which we have under the district councils. Then we also have how does the state have actually involved the VHC's. You

can see here when you see the arrow over there we find that the VSC's are also involved in the state implementation of outcomebased budgeting or the OBB. So OBB is being uh implemented where the

funds are linked to this three state goals and that is reducing maternal and infant uh mortality rate and improve life expectancy. OBB uh was implemented with the aim to

build motivation in the health care functionaries by granting autonomy with accountability. But the intention of OBB is that planning and decision making of the healthcare functionaries would

involve the VC's ensuring that budgeting reflects community priorities and that is uh the main role of how the VAC's are being involved. So given this critical role of the VAC's we realize that

digitalization becoming is becomes very highly relevant our goal is not just digital reporting but digital empowerment just like have been said by a speak by our earlier speakers we see

that uh from this slide we can see that digital competencies is actually about strengthening community representation and leadership and as you go along you will see that is actually move into the

local problem solving where the VAC's will be able to create demand generation for the health care and in doing so the VAC's will be part of this health planning and decision making and also in

monitoring and accountability which ultimately perhaps could create ownership among the VAC in terms of improving health outcomes at the village level.

So how do we envisioned uh the VC dilization in Migalia? So we see digital competency assessment as part of the larger transformation process that we we are going to discuss

uh after after I I finish where my colleagues will take over. So how are we planning to do this? So we are planning to actually map first the core competencies and the digital

competencies of the VAC's and after that we actually analyze the existing appbased data that is already there to understand the functionality and then we're also going to conduct survey to

collect some of the key performance indicators such as the percentage of members attending meetings such as the use of digital tools in meetings and so on and so forth. And finally we classify

these VAC based on the functionality levels. The outcome of this whole process will not just be data. It will actually enable us to co-design a performance

scorecard to be able to identify the barriers in data integration and also create the feedback system so that this information flows back to the VAC's thereby strengthening the leadership and

thereby strengthening the ownership because ultimately digitalization is not just about technology it is about strengthening community institutions and in Migalia we hope that when digital

competency is embedded within the village health councils, it has the potential to transform the grassroot health governance. Thank you so much. Thank you so much all our three uh

panelists. Um we have had a a look into the framework that Dr. Amnesty has mentioned we've also taken a look at our uh health system through uh Dr. Nayanjit. We've looked at the

competencies of our health workers and also how it percolates down to our communities and our villages. So next after we've you know looked at all the competencies and all we we understand

that the need of having a competency mapping but when we look at you know we're doing the mapping we need some measurements right we need measurements to be done and what are the the tools

that need to be done uh that needs to be used for measurements. Um these are very important I feel because they will be the the tools that will accurately measure we hope that they will

accurately measure the sens the competencies and the sensitivities that are there in the community that that will be able to uh to you know we might be able to uh take up all these uh

issues uh through this mapping. So um in order to understand the tools uh we have uh other uh other colleagues to to discuss and we hope that all of you will participate in this and may I invite uh

Dr. Dwakar Muan um he is an associate professor research professor at John Hopkins uh school of public health and co-director of the edit consortium and we also have with him our um Dr. Osama

um he's a public health researcher and Mayang Date he's a clinical and data scientist John Hopkins school of public health and along with them we have Dr. we have Nishan Lang Kongla and who is a

senior specialist uh senior consultant sorry of the digital health in SHSRC Megalia and May Banyam Tang he is the KMD consultant in SHSRC so I hand over to Dr.

Uh sir, &gt;&gt; thank you. Thank you Dr. So this is the part that I love kind of making the audience participate and provide the responses

I've been a professor for too long. So this part okay we wanted to be part of this process. Everybody talked about

And there's been so much said about the uh why and what of measurement and what do we look under the hood and see how we go about this process. It's going to be a

very very uh quick session especially because uh we have limited time. In reality we do this over many months and if not years in this instance we want to kind of provide you with a very brief

snapshot of how we go about this So on this right hand side you see this uh 90 you are good hopefully everybody's pointed out it's also the back of the

back of this and all the questions. we actually when we first tested some of our tools we had a really long list of digital competencies and skills that

were mapped to the test. So one of the first key questions that we needed to address was how do respondents understand what you're asking of right so this is very

important because people can have a variety of ways in which they can misunderstand you right okay good people have started coming in with these are some of your colleagues responses feel

free to add on to them if you you This is true. Please vote on it. Probably it. Okay. Looks like something's coming up that seems to be quite popular.

There's so much out here that we take for granted. It is very intuitive to us that we need to make it simpler. We need to explain it in a way that people will understand.

But the process that we make sure to under this uh we do this what we call cognitive testing and within your conference we have provided some material about how we've gone about

this process and our colleague Sama will give you a very brief snapshot of how we go about testing some of these questions In terms of understanding the local So you know once we once we have

cognitively tested our questions uh how do we ask them? So what approaches do you think when when it comes to especially testing digital skills what approaches do you think are most

effective? So we have some options like you know self-reported observed skills both. Uh so I can see both is currently the popular choice.

Let's wait to see where the chips fall. Okay. So it seems it seems both is currently the popular choice with uh with the next best being observe observing the skills.

Okay. Yeah. So in the same vein uh do you think so since a lot of people did say you know observing skills do you think people will over report their ability to

perform digital skills? Oh wow. even yeah. So people the popular choice currently is people will always over respond.

Okay, it's close. Depends on the situation. All right. So this was actually uh a data where we we ran a survey on digital skills in one of the states in India and what we see is even

between men and women while there is disparity by gender uh people do not over report their skills as much as we thought in fact in some cases they under report certain skills and when we asked

them to perform them they were able to do those skills even if they hadn't you know previously reported being able to do them. So I think that is an important So the uh next question is uh talks

about the ashas and just to contextualize uh the question is uh the typical asha profile uh in mgalia is uh someone uh a woman who's in her late 20s early 40s um often married and then uh

uh constricted with family uh responsibilities and also managing uh the health work. So uh to kind of really uh assist in uh in in in in their daily activities as an Asha uh what do you

think if we want to actually measure their competency in terms of their digital competency and how we kind of uh anticipate what challenges might they may face when you're trying to measure

uh a particular competence through a survey. uh considering that the fact that uh their their work realities is that they're uh burdened with uh a lot of workload across different programs

having to travel large long distances in difficult terrain and also being a trusted community mobilizer. Uh their work is really embedded in in in actually building trust in the community

in uh uh sensitizing families uh uh you know uh tracking beneficiaries and uh uh also connecting people to services. uh I feel we feel that uh you know getting the digital uh assessing the digital

competency is something that's really important. So also having an understanding of what the challenges might be to actually uh gauge that assessment is also important and uh as

we see here there's a lot of responses in workload time digital low literacy motivation. This is a very brief snapshot from a survey which shows what were the key

difficulties that workers may have in some of these cells after service. So as you can see literacy seems to be quite a challenge only about

own these were some of the challenges that most likely to face when having self administered service in this kind of a setting.

&gt;&gt; So yeah, once you have the data uh how do you think you know would that data be presented? What do you think could you do with that data especially on skills? Do you think it's most important to use

them as a composite index or to look at individual skills uh as you know units of measurement? Okay. So lot yeah grouping skills by competency domains.

Great. So that seems to be the the winning choice. So there's no there's no right answer to this. Uh you can do both ways. So this is uh these are the uh competency domains that were present in

dishcom 3.0 and you can you know group uh you can aggregate the level of skills at a population level to report on SG SG indicators or you can also create you know scores based on individual skills

to understand your target demographic. Uh yeah. So now as Mayang was saying now that we've mapped up all the digital skills from different competencies, right? Uh so it nice it's nice to sort

of uh think about how do we use this data, right? Uh uh to benefit or help workers. So uh maybe better monitoring and evaluation uh better uh resource allocation and things like that. So it'

be nice to think about it. Yeah. data analytics, better digital infrastructure, targeting training is a good one. After we've seen this data, it's would we be

know we know better which gather would need specific skills and competencies, right? Uh yeah, we would definitely learn the challenges uh from from from the data that we've taken.

yeah, so basically a lot of capacity building and things like that. So yeah, I'd hand it over to uh doctor So we did learn some very key messages from this that we have to tailor some of

our measurement techniques the context and to the person that uh who we are planning to measure. It is also very important to tailor some of these to the questions that we want answered

and I want to give the last few minutes provide us key takeaways uh from our session. Thank you so much uh for this opportunity. I won't summarize and bore

you uh but I'll tell you why the World Health Organization is extremely delighted to partner on this effort. As World Health Organization, we're essentially focused on building

foundations for digital health and AI. And one of the key foundations that you need is building digital health competencies for all healthcare workers. And very often when we build digital

health competencies, people typically start from the top. And I've won I've been one such beneficiary. I work for the government of India. I work in who I've been trained both in digital health

and AI and did my PhD in computer science although I'm a medical doctor so very often globally when you talk of digital health competencies they've typically started from the top of the

pyramid that is physicians nurses and we rarely we've started from frontline workers so I'm actually delighted that the world health organization is partnering with the government of

Megalia in actually building from the bottom as a frontline workers because very Very often studies suggest that frontline workers today have to remember close to 90 to 120 passwords for the

variety of digital tools that we've been implementing at the field level. So with without any competencies without the fact that they don't have digital skills we assume that they'd be able to do a

job of a lot of people and more specifically in India when you think about Asha these are really not even functionaries of the government these are voluntary activists these are

volunteers who provide a lot of health care predominant health care to the most disadvantaged and underprivileged so I'm very delighted that the Gates Foundation is actually supporting this effort

I have also colleagues from the World Bank uh other donor agencies and as a technical agency in at the World Health Organization both from the regional office and from with our colleagues in

the country office. We're extremely delighted to partner and we would really want to ensure that this is a movement which starts in Megalia but sweeps [snorts] over the rest of the country

and the region because I work for countries uh apart from India as well. So want to thank uh the team from the University of Cape Town, John Hopkins and the leadership of the government of

Megalia and we really look forward to ensuring that we not only assess, evaluate and then implement eventually and implement not just in one state but multiple states across and thank you all

so much for coming to a session here. uh very often participants are more excited about more shiny glamorous tools but this is a very foundational work and we've just laid down the foundations for

AI healthare AI in healthcare use by setting the foundational document the strategy for AI and healthcare in India which just got launched about an hour back and one of the key pillars in the

strategy is on is on workforce capacity building and change management and here is a state government which is already leading the light in thinking very broadly about this. So thank you for the

leadership of Sulsur and colleagues and thank you everyone for being here. Thank you so much. I think we'll before I think to end the session I would like to thank everybody.

I hope you enjoyed this participatory work like you know the entire team has contributed uh to the session. So just like I wanted to my final things I was just thinking uh you know when uh you

know be be I'm also like you like you're you're a medical doctor and turned into computer science like the other way around now I became I studied engineering then PhD in public health

okay so what I would like to uh say is that there is a uh uh when the computers were introduced in India I think there was a tremendous challenge and it took a lot of time you know for uh you know to

really take that uh very recently we are using e office electronic office very recently not in fact it has not come to all the states slowly we are doing it imagine so the delay the lag time that

because we have not invested in building the competencies at the right level so I think it's a very fundamentally very important as Dr. Karthik said to start from bottom up you know when you talk

about AI you also start talk about a bottom up moment this is a bottom up moment to really build that uh you know the the competencies and you know and the motivation you know competencies

actually gives motivation public service motivation so we really need to bring a mission bureaucracy or mission government you know system that actually over a period of time so that's that's

the kind of idea and this will be super helpful for the states to get the written return on investment. You know what is the return on investment on the human resources because every state

spends almost like 50% of their budgets on the human resources salaries and pensions and if you really build these competencies imagine that how the state

would deliver in terms of you know the expectations of the people and the outcome. So, so that's I think with this I'm thank you everyone for uh participating and listening to this

exercise and we we welcome you to you know be part of this entire journey that what we have been actually trying to do. [applause]
