## 📝 Transcript

So everyone who's here request and more from logistic purposes purposes let's keep the gates closed we have got people here also we are right now planning to get this over by 1:25 so we have got

just of time so we'll keep a track of it so to start with let me just quickly introduce myself I am bridge I lead the government technology practice for KPMG and also look at AI ICO for government.

We have got a very distinct panelist with us but I will introduce them as and when we go to them so that we save time. Now this topic here today is about democratization of AI.

Now this requires to answer us a very important question. When this entire AI comes to his fusion, is the last man there in the room? Is the last man there in some town? Is the

last man at some village is getting the full benefit of it. And if the answer is yes, we have done a great work. Now for India, this becomes all the more pertinent given the population. We have

around 1.4 4 billion people speaking more than almost 200 languages 22 being official but we actually speak much much more than that also the fact is that we have got people

who live in various types of I would say various places which have got different level of access both the technology as well as the devices

through which we consume technology and that is where it's very very important that we when we go and implement AI we ensure that the language barrier is broken we also ensure that this AI

reaches to people irrespective of their location irrespective of their income levels irrespective of the language they speak so we have got a very distinct dist distinguished panel who has been

working in this space and we are going to look that and we have got people who do this work for their living globally. They do do this part of work as a

breaking the barriers for people where Amitab is here. So I will start Amitab directly with you but before that let me just quickly introduce Amitab. So he's Amitab is the chief executive officer

for of digital India Bhashna division. He leads one of the India's most ambitious IT initiative or at an AI initiative which focuses on breaking language barriers and enabling digital

inclusion across Indian languages. He also serves on key national committees including the India AI data set platform working group global partnership on artificial intelligence and also has an

advisory role across agriculture rural development digital health. Under his leadership, Bashi has evolved into a leading platform which enables real-time translation,

multilingual AI and also collaboration between government, academia, research institution and industry to advance India's language technology

capabilities. So welcome Amitab. We have been fortunate to be working with him on multiple initiatives and while he touches upon on some of them. The very first question Amitita which I

had of you is that when language is treated as an digital infrastructure and not only as an application feature what fundamentally changes the way the standards are adopted the way the scale

is to be done and the way the public accountability is to be put in place. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Means uh when you are uh you know we language where comes very easy to us when you are looking at this as a human

being because you start when as soon as you are born and you are uh you know you're exposed to language actually your mother talks to you your father talks to you so it comes as a very natural

attribute to yourself but when you are treating it as a digital infrastructure it actually is meaning a lot and if it is a national digital infrastructure It is quite different from what it

should you know uh what a normal course of way you are looking at languages. Uh we are looking at languages in national digital infrastructure into multiple layers. The first layer is about data.

You know the digital data should be available, visible and should be in the form of a corpus uh for training the AI model. Of course when you're looking at other aspects of digital data which is

the content that should also be available. So that's the first piece of it. And obviously when you are looking at data to train AI models there are standards there are systems there are

ways in which the digital data is to be collected uh you know annotated labeled. So there are some things which we have to do. The second part of the thing which is there is uh about uh you know

the AI models itself which has to be built up using the digital data and that again has lot of things which has to be put in into the uh lot of things have to be taken care of in terms of

sovereignity in terms of biases in terms of uh uh does it reflect what we want to say as far as language is concerned there has to be glosseries which has to be built in there has to be

contextuality which has to be built And lot of things which has to be built in. There are some soft aspect of it and then there are some tangible definable aspect of it. You know that's how the

language model goes across and top of it comes as infrastructure which is again sorry applications which is actually the layer by which the you know people interact with each other. So

you're looking at uh data, you're looking at uh models, you're looking at the applications and to host all these models and deliver these as a service, you're looking at that platform which

actually is able to take that service capability on service level agreements so that it actually delivers what we want to do. So means it suddenly when you're looking it as a digital platform

you have so many things to take care of. uh and you are right that uh it will perhaps interact with 1.4 four billion people uh for different purposes and hence uh again you know it has to be

despite so much of diversity it has to be still interoperable still having some uh standards and still taking care care of those nuances of everybody being different so you know that's a big

challenge which we would have uh digital systems are known to basically be standard prone if I say so because they want standards to be there and here is a situation where diversity has to become

a standard. So it's a challenge by itself. Thanks Abdan. In fact this is a very very important right now I say that a discussion which has been going on for quite some time

you know that whether these language capabilities and the models that we are currently developing now should that all be developed in house you know and and we've seen the approach that Bajni has

taken where Bajni itself is not developing those models you know it is crowdsourcing it so there are companies you know like Google like Microsoft AI for the education institutes they're all

bringing it all together and that's where I'll bring Kalista because she's one who has been collaborating across the globe you know bringing in the ecosystem together to answer some of

these questions but before that let me just quickly introduce Kalista Redmond she's a vice president of global AI initiatives such as Nvidia where she leads strategic collaborations with

governments ecosystem partners and product teams to advance sovereign AI and national scale AI programs. She focuses on strengthening digital resilience, enabling local innovation

and shaping AI ecosystems aligned with national priorities. Prior to Nvidia, she served as CEO of Risk File International. Prior to this, she also held senior leadership position at IBM

and prior to that she's also done she's been entrepreneur across four successful technology startups. Almost exhausting you know so much you have done. So Kalista but let me bring

you in this this discussion. So in the current role you engage with multiple ecosystem partners you know including government including civil society private sector players.

How do you see these players coming all together and ensuring that an ecosystem is getting developed and uh also there's another discussion and since you lead that pro program across the globe so I

want to check with you on this entire sovereign part of it. Because we are all discussing sovereignty. So is it something which is like a defined word or is it a spectrum where we say okay

find sovereignty can mean different things to different people. But the mood question remains that how do we ensure that while the countries go and develop their own infrastructure locally we

still are engaged with the larger global ecosystem so that we are able to provide our services globally. So the whole &gt;&gt; Well, is this on? Yes. Okay. &gt;&gt; Well, first of all, Amida, and the the

work you're doing at Bashini is absolutely stunning. And what I'm taking away from what you just said is diversity is the new standard, right? And that plays in really well to the

work that we do at NVIDIA in that when I look at and speak with governments around the world when I speak with ecosystem partners around the world it is all about that local diversity

whether it's in language whether it is in workloads in industries in the types of challenges that we're trying to solve for that diversity is actually the new standard and that is where the promise

of AI can help us overcome and accelerate on that so rapidly and so it is my job is so fun every day it's like what fresh new challenge can we encounter together so when I when I talk

to governments about what is sovereign AI I mean that's seems to be a different definition depending on who you talk to in some cases that sovereign AI is how can I help my nation become the

strongest nation for my people for for my companies, for my startups, for my students, for my citizens. How can we become the strongest possible and the best that we can be for the diversity

that we have within our borders, right? And that is really kind of the guiding principle, that north star, if you will, for why nations are pursuing their AI strategies.

No one pursues an AI strategy because they're super excited to build a massive data center. They pursue it because they want to, you know, increase their GDP, because they want to increase their

opportunity for their nation, right? And so that's the democratization of AI that we're trying to pursue with our partnerships and diversity of partnerships that we have and what we

get to go run after every day with partners like KPMG and and others as you know many of whom are sitting here and many of whom you see out in the expo area including like more than a dozen

different startups from India right so that's the diversity that we're talking about that's the the promise of kind of reaching each of those different challenges, whether it's in agriculture

and helping farmers identify pests that are attacking their crops to best handle that in the most efficient and effective way to still reap the rewards of what they've planted or whether it's reaching

remote areas with health care information that will be critical in preventive or treatment types of uh medicine. So those are the types of things that we

get to go talk about. But what's really exciting is when we bring together governments who are laying that infrastructure for a nation together with industries for that public private

partnership to sort of apply that AI to those industries. So when you apply AI to an industry, you accelerate and leapfrog forward in its competitive capabilities. So those are some of the

things that we get to I have no idea if I've answered your question at this point because I get really excited about this topic but it but I think that you know as you can see that is sort of why

we pursue these things together with governments as well as private sector &gt;&gt; fact kista I would not know whether we'll be able to come back to you know so I'll ask this question right away

what we have been doing and and there's a team here you know so Google is helping in doing that so bringing in lot of local data sets together again we have got large data is getting

created locally. The question is that for the people who are getting trained you know so who are going to be using and creating new AI solutions out there now would is it a good idea you know to

get our own models you know who understands our cultural nuances who understands our languages and then get our people trained so that they can go and serve the population this large 1

1.4 for population or you feel that it makes sense to still go and get exposed to and start to use the models developed by someone else because at the end of it we are a global workforce. So we don't

serve only our country but we serve the entire globe. &gt;&gt; You you touched on this earlier in your comments. It's about that invest locally and feed into that global marketplace

that global ecosystem. And I think that's a really important sentiment that we all need to keep in mind. It is absolutely critical that we create those local models based on very you know uh

true and genuine highfidelity local information as you know as we've heard like feeding the most u pure information into those data sets so that you have the most accurate outcomes while at the

same time leveraging those global uh LLMs as well. uh there's room for all of that, right? There's there's fit for purpose and there's different workloads that we're going to be encountering, but

it is absolutely critical that we have those models being built in India by India across all of these languages. I know that we're beyond 22 and less than 200 30 36 I think is that yeah, I have

to change my charts for tomorrow when I start to tell about the amazing things India is doing. Um so yes, we We need to do both. So, we need to leverage both. But it is about that local investment

and it is about standing shouldertosh shoulder with your global peers so that you're working in concert. If you're truly going to raise your economy, it's about bringing more intellectual

currency, financial currency, social currency into your country. To do that, you must engage in those global markets to create and foster the developer ecosystem, to foster global supply

chains, and to foster global markets. Right? So those three elements are absolutely critical and reasons why you need to continue to that local investment while engaging globally.

&gt;&gt; Thanks. I think this this helps because somewhere and I will bring chunker next because what we are creating is large scale solutions. There's a India already has a big story around the digital

public infrastructure and uh but before I go to Shankar with question let me just quickly introduce him. Shankar Marada is the CEO and co-founder of eightstep foundation which is he

established in 2015. He's passionate about addressing social problems through technology and has extensive experience in large scale projects including being head of demand generation and marketing

for Aadhaar India's national identification program and Aadhaar is something Shankar which you know gets spoken about almost anywhere when we talk about a population scale thing and

I'm sure when it started it maybe never had an ambition that I will become so big I will become something which almost everybody would be using but it evolved. Now my question

to you is for DPIs to succeed there multiple things that needs to come together need to work seamlessly with that background you know how do you see an inclusive AI you know getting

created which then is used not only for a specific purpose but it can be leveraged by multiple other ecosystem partners to create something which is countrywide.

Thank you bridge. One correction when we started Aadhaar we were thinking from 2050 and worked our way backwards. So by 2020 we expected certain things to happen right uh when we'll hit 600

million when we'll hit a billion etc. Uh so a lot of it you start with an imagination of what will happen at scale. The reason I'm bringing that up is in India at population scale you have

to factor in two things into your design. One is diversity. Kalista talked about that. Diversity by design and the second is inclusion. If you have reached 1 billion people and

there's still half a billion more doesn't mean you have succeeded. Right? And those edge cases are not an afterthought to be bolted onto your design. You start with those edge cases,

right? The 13 day baby who needs an Aadhaar. The person who's lost his hands and still need biometrics are there. A person who is a homeless person has no address,

right? Somebody who does not remember where when they were born. So those are not you start by designing for that. And when you go down this path what you realize is to achieve scale

and impact sustainably a lot of people have to come together. So as UIDI we made sure we did the absolute minimum possible which means to give a common example if you want to

solve the problem of transportation build roads and let others build cars and fuel and pit stops etc. If you try to do everything you will not scale. But if you can build that infrastructure

well do one thing do that one thing very well so that the rest of the country can depend on you that is infrastructure which is nothing but shared capability. If you are building cars and I'm

building roads you will trust that I will build roads and you will trust that the roads have more have less potholes and more roads. If you don't trust me on that, you'll start building your own

roads and that is economically very inefficient. What Bhashini is doing, what India AI mission is doing and what others are doing is building this capability

in voice. And the other thing is we look at technology to see what possibilities it generates, what superpowers is it hiding. Biometrics was hiding the superpower of if I can prove your unique

identity. I can transfer a lot of money. Lot of good things can happen on top. AI we know is the ultimate superpower. So the question for us is what prevents someone from accessing the superpower?

In India surprisingly it's language. But if everybody builds a full stack solution, the opposite of minimal, then we will go to only the places that they can reach.

But in the way that India has done, collected data, highquality language data as a public good. AF for Bharat, IT Madras, offering language based services as a public good, as a shared

capability. Bashini offering GPU India AI. I believe this is the model for how we can take advantage when the Nvidia of the world are working with the model

builders to create better and better technology. We are while we are also building great technology. We are also building the roads which does not care whether the car is petrol or hydrogen or

uh E right as a car get better people's lives improve because we have built the rest of the infrastructure. That's the path India is on and by 2025 we expect India to be a voice first

Indic language first country that is taking advantage of the super intelligence that would be in our data centers. So exciting days ahead but it places a responsibility on all of us to

collaborate together because each of us holds one piece of the puzzle. The day we think we have all pieces of the puzzle is a bad day. collaboration keeping the 1.501

billionth person in mind that should be a target inclusion by design diversity by design that model or models that India will develop will be very helpful for the rest of the world to reapply in

that context whether it be in Africa, Latin America, whether it be in health, education, agriculture or governance. So exciting days ahead when we crack the voice AI puzzle. Certainly and um Amitab

is here and I've seen him so passionately [snorts] driving that so much so that a chatbot which we in fact we building together with him you know got entirely revamped saying okay fine

this is not voice first this is also voice you know but this will not do and the fact is that when we see our own you know drivers while we give them an address many of them actually do not go

and type they simply pick up the phone and their address so that they are able to take us to the right places. So somewhere our country's already started adopting this and not waiting for

something more to happen first than before we start adopting it. So great interventions that way. Let me also bring in right now Ashwini. So Ashwini because somewhere it's very important to

look at the way government is looking at it and uh at the end of it many use cases which get implemented and somewhere the government is still the custodian of this entire trust and

accountability part of it and particularly when the AI is used for citizen service delivery. So but before that Ashwini let me just quickly introduce you. So Ashwini Kumar is an

Indian aspective administrative service officer of the 2010 batch from the Assam Kad currently serving as a director at the directorate of information technology electronics and communication

government of Assam. A key architect of the state's digital transformation. He leads major initiatives in egovernance, cyber security, public digital infrastructure and datadriven policy

innovation. He oversees flagship programs such as E plus Pasti, E office, Assam state data policy and CPU and then there's an entire list of things that he does. The focus right now is and again

does a lot of work around trust and security. So Ashini my question to you would be as someone who's leading digital transformation in the public sector

what practical conditions must be in place know for AI to become a trusted layer in for the frontline citizen services because it's important that if you're

delivering certain services using AI at the end of the citizen should be trusting it it should not be where it has been done by some system which I don't know much about it's a black box

for me but Please trust it. But how do you bring that trust element to the service delivery which we can do for Thank you so much for uh inviting me for this esteem panel

as we go from private to public sector. So we government is the custodian of the biggest amount of data. So I am project director IT and CSD society where we are delivering around 930 services

citizencentric services to all the citizens of Assam. So, Assam has a population of around 34 million. We collect lot of data and as chief data officer if you see the way data is being

collected, the way it is shared, we need to look that because when if we don't collect the right data, we cannot make right policies. Our data being collected lying in silos

do not talk to each other. when we frame our policies so this data when we don't take it into account so your feedback mechanism fails so what we do is we make policies we make flagship programs using

KPMG PWC big force and we implement these policies at the grassroot level but at the grassroot level conditions are entirely different trust when we talk about trust trust is

the biggest currency if you see banking system what is banking system it is just an intermediary because people need someone they can trust on. People need someone they can rely on for getting

anything and the main purpose of having a government is trust and accountability. AI the most important thing is uh we need someone to take the responsibility

because when you are delivering services when the service is delivered if something happens who will take the responsibility. So first of all you will have to define who will be taking the

responsibility for that. It need to be impartial. We cannot be prejudiced by in uh providing the services. And if you see like most of the tech giants they are US- based. So when we are

having LLMs we have large reasoning models. So until unless we train these models on the basis of the data we collect from the people the they will not work properly. Bhashni has been

wonderful because if you see I had traveled outside India so people you know they use Google to translate but it does not exactly translate the way it should. Bhashni is in itself a very nice

initiative where we have different do local languages, local dialect where we can actually interact with each other and now we are integrating uh Bash Bashini in most of the programs and

where we are having this Assam governance state delivery program where World Bank is again giving us around 100 million uh dollars for this. So in that center for data management is the key

key thing and it is one of the uh basic criteria that when we collect the data and we frame the policies this data should be used in making the policies which will be implemented at the

grassroot level. If we see at the infrastructure level I look after the state data center. So it will take some time building that infrastructure will take time but if we see the safety

security accountability and uh the privacy of the data they need to be you know properly studied only then we'll be able to have efficient implementation of AI which is totally

democratized which is accessible to everyone and everybody feels comfortable in availing all the services based on Thanks Ashony. In fact, one very important thing that you told and it has

been a you know agelong I wouldn't even say a problem but aspiration is to how do you do a datalled policy meeting you know and there are programs which have been there

and uh I'm glad to see asam government is &gt;&gt; actually my focus is that we as government we should be confident that the data should talk to each other we

should share that data with the private sector so that the startups they can use that data they can monetize so that it benefits both the private sector and the public sector and unless we use this

data properly because without data AI is nothing. AI is basically a mirror of the society. So we want representative AI. We want AI to be like us and it can reflect the true society only when the

true data which is actually collected when these basic facilities basic services are delivered to common people only then we will be having a democratized AI thanks in fact that

brings and I'll bring in Stephano or Stephano he leads our EU institutions and serves as an EMA head for government and public sector Now over his long tenure at KPMG has led

major government transformation programs overseen public sector consulting in Germany and guided multi-government engagement across IMAR region. Now his work spans advisory audit and large

scale institutional modernization with a strong focus on public administration, governance and reform. He continues to shape strategic collaboration with EU institutions and national government

throughout the region. And then I want to bring you here because uh actually raised a very important point you know is that how do we actually get these strategy implemented.

We have had those strategies for quite some time know and India had its AI strategy which has been done quite some time back. Multiple other countries including EU has done it. Now what is

currently still stopping or what are certain challenges with the government are facing in converting these strategy into actual outcomes which then can be used by the citizen. So that's that's a

question and that we'll bring our global perspective around that. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Bridge. Um, first of all, I'm very glad to hear from you, Kalista, that you said diversity is the new

normal. To hear that from, I presume, US American feels really good these days, at least for me as a European, maybe also for you as an Indian. So, thank you for that.

Um, okay, coming back to your question. Sorry, I had to say this. Um I'm I'm I'm glad that and what I've seen uh and heard about in India that you already have strategies which is not the

case everywhere in the world and it's for sure not the case in many and most European countries and also in the EU level. Uh we do a lot about regulation that's where we are strong at in Europe.

Uh regulate first and then you know everything comes after. So um strategy still um needs to be developed in most governments. Um honestly um what we see is a lot of piloting. So

there are pilots all over the place. Everybody is excited about AI and everybody all the governments on all levels be it EU level, national level, state level, local level, everybody

wants to try on AI and a colleague, esteemed colleague of mine talked about a disease called pilotitis. So you're piloting and piloting one use case yet another use case but you never

come really into a strategy and into tactics and into rolling out and I come to that back in a in a second. So the main obstacles to really bring AI solutions to life is well mostly quite

simple. It's the homework or the housekeeping you have to do. It's all about data. So data is fragmented is spread around governments especially on different government levels federal

state local several different ministries authorities departments. So to collect them, to sanitize them, to simplify them, to bring them into one structure because this is the underlying what you

need if you want to have um a really intelligent artificial intelligence. Uh this is what you have to do. So I think this is um the biggest effort. You could say, okay, it's a it's a big cleanup. Um

it's it's an effort you should do, but it's it's it's a big one. So that's a practical issue. Um now in terms of what I've heard and about this Indian vision and and and

this program of course when we talk about languages um so data already is in several languages most presumably so to bring them all to one database already is a

challenge but if we look to the output side of things and uh absolutely agree with uh Mr. Amitab um it's not about language it's about semantics it's about culture there's much more than that

comes with language it's about the literacy levels that you have it's about educational levels and if you think about voicetovoice solutions so maybe um someone on the street or which is

illiterate may want to be approached or talked to differently than someone who uh had the chance to get higher education. So these are all very practical issues.

Uh you said diversity by design uh in fact and I think there's a lot of effort that goes into that one. And then I come back to the pilotis. So I think one of the biggest challenges

is really then rolling out AI solutions at scale because what governments typically cannot afford is something like a 8020 approach. say 80% is okay, 20% is wrong.

That's what you also said. You know, do it for 1 billion people, but just and the other 400 million we think about later. That's not possible. And someone has to push the button,

right? In government, somebody has to take the responsibility and somebody needs to be and that's a human needs to be accountable. One, you say, "Okay, now we roll it out. We believe it's not

hallucinating. We believe there are right outcomes." And that is a challenge we all know. I mean if I was in a governmental position and take all the responsibility I also would be thinking

twice or three times before I push the button and really roll it out. So that's a very practical issues that come with governments other than maybe with corporates. Just think about all the

better versions we get from software. No problem. You know Microsoft or Google say hey that's a better version. It's not perfect. um you can try it there will be mistakes so

what this is something that governments cannot afford so that's a very practical reason and I think we still don't know and have no real let's say uh experience what the right level of confidence

should be so it's it will not be the 8020 is it 90 is it 95 99.9% preciseness That's something we have to figure out. This may be as well again a cultural issue from country to country.

I would say in Germany we need something like 110% confidence. [laughter] Um maybe it's different in India but these are would say the practical challenges and the practical obstacles

that we see. &gt;&gt; Thanks thanks be the fact remains that and we've seen also an issue around building capacity. So it's not only for the people who are creating AI but also

for the people who are consuming. So for the people to the general public many times the government servants because they have to first take an approach and particularly when the AI is adopted in

the government sector itself are our government officials ready you know are they equipped enough to identify use cases or convert them you know into pilots and then scale it to

the population and and I understand you've done something around that also anything around the public sector capacity building here Well, yes, of course, capacity building is extremely

important and and and and training and um yes, people being capable. This is yet another big issue and we could talk about that for hours probably and what this is also something that that we as

KPMG are very much engaged to is not to bring the new technology because that's other other companies doing it but really um bringing the capabilities into place people that are responsible and

accountable how to work with that how to deal with that what are the new roots of the game because this changes dramatic ically also for bureaucrats and officials that at the end of the day

will take the accountability. So also they need to be trained in a in a in a very good way and of often they are and I said this yesterday on a topic on a panel often these people are not techies

so it's not people that really know what's really happening in that blackbox AI right however they are the ones that are responsible so this is also an educational point of view still a long

way to go but we are there and I think um especially in this country I can see a great eager to approach this &gt;&gt; oh thanks be and I'm seeing the time is passing up but very

importantly let me just bring hush and hush I'm bringing you you know here at the end of it because a lot of work that Google is doing in this space you know either talking about bringing the data

sets together actually going to the villages taking those data ensuring that everybody who needs to have an access to it gets an access to it open source it so there's a lot of work which you are

doing within Google research which would be very relevant to this conversation but before that let me just introduce you you know to the larger audience here so hush heads the genai

Google research health AI and core partnerships for APAC at Google leading regional efforts across India Singapore Japan Japan and Australia. He drives partnership that advance AI technology

development and adoption across areas such as Genai, Gemma, Medma, international languages, health, AI, agriculture and a lot of things. Now my question

hush right now is now there's already a discussion about the LLM which is happening you know though using the LMS already present creating your own LLMs

then there's a discussion about how do we go into specific sector related you know models and a lot of this is happening in in this area. Now my question to you is that while these are

getting developed how important are the local data sets because there's a common perception is that chart GPT and many other say even Gemini you know is there which has been trained on primarily

non-Indian data sets which may be a misnomer but still that's that's a perception we we clearly have now how are we ensuring that the data sets which are there coming out of the country

coming who has our cultural context get embedded when these models are either getting created or getting revised as Pier said and also ensuring that many of these are

made available you know to the other set of people who are developing those models. So over to you &gt;&gt; super um I might not have even needed the question because of the views I

wanted to reflect. So maybe although at the last a quick 101 when we say data is needed for model training that's a motherhood statement. What are we looking at? Are we talking about

pre-training from scratch? Are we talking about post- trainining fine-tuning? Are we talking about data which is required for grounding or for eval benchmarks? If you go in that

order, continuous pre-training the the pretty large LLMs have been trained yes on trillions of tokens. In fact, every patch of additional pre-training requires tens of billions of tokens. And

that's where it's a misnomer to say that okay, let's start to build a data a large language model using the local data. I have worked enough with Amitab GI because our low resource language

data, speech, text, cultural context is not amply present there. And at the core of these models, assuming you start with uh what I advocate a lot these days from the sovereign angle is you start with an

open model which can be hosted within the country and then you can obviously fine-tune it for languages for domains to solve your particular purpose whether you are doing a medema whether you are

doing an edugema whether you are doing a translate sorry I'm using Gemma but translate X open model right this is one reason that we shouldn't mix up the things and the data set that's available

if it's in tens of millions of tokens which is also by the way very hard should be used for fine-tuning of the models the second reason I I just want to build on Shankar's point is that uh I

spoke to secretary Krishnan also that India all said and done we are investing heavily in AI but can we afford to have a hundred companies all developing models from scratch all spending a

hundred million dollars um essentially kind of competing with each other when today we are sitting in the agentic era. What does that mean? You can have a a sort of a system an

architecture which calls on a specific model as required. Your top layer can be pretty much a a generic model a frontier model. your core reasoning can be a small language model that is there. So,

so essentially I think I just wanted to clarify these two aspects to uh to be there that from a sovereign perspective we should really judiciously use our resources and every startup that I talk

to I tell them your architecture should be super plugandplay tomorrow a new model comes in it should take you 2 days to get your evals and benchmarks on it and get it running and and last thing

again because Google is uh often sort of misqued in in collection of data. Um again I started the largest project of uh speech collection data with a very clear mandate that all speech and

cultural data that's collected is essentially open-source project vani uh it's available on AI kosh uh so that it's available for everyone to fine-tune and even though we are spending millions

of dollars on it we want to ensure that it's available for the ecosystem to use and it is not seen as one company taking that data and using it. Um, last thing on data I'll say there are certain

really sovereign sectors like healthcare, finance and so on where I would heavily heavily advocate that um I was part of these two panels where the models should come to the data rather

than the data going to the models and I think in today's AI world that is 100% possible. We have airgapped environments both with sort of I I believe with Nvidia with Google. So we have airgapped

environments which can have the model and the data reside in the sovereign boundaries of the country. We have open models which can be hosted and what comes out is commercially and for

research purposes owned by the model developer. That's a lot but yeah I just wanted to clarify that. This is this is very helpful because the fact is that there

time many times there's an you know I wouldn't say even say misconception but there's a very clear view and that's where it at times could be competing views that whether we should start you

know from scratch and build something which is very very localized for myself we we build on something which has already been developed but while we are building on top of it we bring a lot of

local context in and that's where we get the both best of the both of us. So I think that's that's what right now we're looking at we are towards the end of our session but I just want to still and

this is completely out of syllable but still I would want our panelists to reflect upon. So if you have this room full of say policy developers and say bureaucrats, what is one message that

each one of you would like to give to them which they can take back home when they plan for the next zone or next level of policy making around AI? So I was starting with you.

See as uh you know uh one of the things which we are always uh having a challenge on AI and what you know obviously uh he pointed out that uh we are looking at continuously trying to

build something new where we should be actually fine-tuning something which is existing. You know we should all be aware that whatever we build in the world of AI has a shelf life which is

too low because somebody else is working somebody else is also picking up data and trying to build something there. So should we chase that or should we look at what is our customer's requirement

and then start looking at building that for him and co-creating that with him. I think that's the crux of it rather than generally chasing everything and trying to do everything in a

&gt;&gt; so customer creativity say centricity and co-creation &gt;&gt; to echo on that slightly the greatest challenges have always been overcome through collaboration and collaboration

can come from shared models can come from shared infrastructure can come from reuse or uh a running start from shared blueprints libraries tech stacks, you name it. So, absolutely

agree. Nobody should start with a blank sheet of paper. No one should start from zero. Collaborate and start from something that's already out there and all of us I think have many things to

start from. So collaboration &gt;&gt; as Kalista has rightly pointed collaboration is very very important and what I feel is private sector should

earn the trust of public sector of the government. Government wants to you know have wants to trust the private sector. They want to share the data. They want to do a lot of things. But it is from

the private side. We this collaboration this uh you know uh initiative should be from the private sector that they should trust the government and they should and government wants to work with those

people only who they can trust. So this trust is to be built up you know stepwise. So if that trust is there I think there will not be any issues. &gt;&gt; Sure. Thank you Shanka.

To the policy makers, I would say this is a generational opportunity to recalibrate our ambition and aspiration and work back from 2035 and think of 10 scenarios. Nirmala from Nagpur in

Marathi can do the world's best research sitting at home. Manish from Maharashtra can get access to jobs and skilling around him or her by just saying here I am. This is what I'm looking for. So the

possibilities are immense but it can only be reached if we collaborate. As Ashwin G said public sector is where the inclusion and the scale will happen. Private sector is where the innovation

risk taking happens. Both have to work with each other. The development sector philanthropy has to help fill the gaps. The bridge between one to the other. We cannot miss this opportunity. Right?

And we have to be inspired enough to run the marathon otherwise after a sprint you'll start feeling tired you've not reached anywhere right &gt;&gt; there's a lot of discussion in the

policy around liability arising out of hallucination who should own that I believe it should start somewhere at the sort of end application level and then it will automatically flow down to the

core model and so on liability should be there accountability but it should start somewhere at the top level I echo Kalista and also harsh uh cooperation is the is the call for the

moment. I'm a big fan of digital sovereignity there where it's needed. Um you mentioned a couple of fields defense and national security would be another one very important and there are others

where it's absolutely okay to go into public clouds to use what's out there and and do this. So a hybrid hybrid model is that what should be should be done and not always to have the sheet of

digital sovereignity which stops you to gain from innovation and everything that is happening. So thank you P and we conclude this session but before we go there's an token of appreciation

join Yes. [snorts] Why not? meeting again. &gt;&gt; Yes.
