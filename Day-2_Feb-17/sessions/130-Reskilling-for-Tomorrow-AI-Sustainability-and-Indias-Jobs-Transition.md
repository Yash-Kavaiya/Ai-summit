## 📝 Transcript

history, social history tells us that we we need to think seriously about those costs which kind of does come back of course to social protection to other kinds of rules. So I think you know just

thinking about this at the global level social protection schemes necessarily are primarily tend to be administered at the national or even the local level in alignment with local contexts and so on.

I think that's incredibly important. But I think there are two issues that are worth talking about when we are thinking about what are the kind of global governance arrangements and global rules

that can help countries, people, companies to manage these transitions. One of course is around the redistribution of wealth. You know in previous eras of technological change

when we had pime primarily national economies it was quite easy to say let's redistribute the wealth from um from the winners to the losers effectively in this um in this moment of change. Of

course, that's much harder now if we consider tax as something which sits at the national boundaries because the winners and the losers are often in different jurisdictions and different

continents in very different parts of the world. So if part of the solution is some form of transfer from the winners to the losers even in the short to help you know even in the short term I think

the institutions through which that's going to be done need to be thought about. At the moment we don't really have the institutions to do that effectively. I don't know what they

would be. The political obstacles as we know would be formidable but I think that does need to be a part of change. A second response to transitions, not just

technological or environmental transitions, but any kind of transitions which people always do, which is hugely um difficult and controversial politically, not least in my country, is

of course migration. You know, we can move money to where people are or we can move people to where money is or jobs. You know, we can move jobs to where people are or we can or people will move

to where jobs are. And in an area era of huge upheaval of where the dimensions and of inequalities are shifting that is always going to be something that people do whether we like it or not. So I think

often you know migration is another huge political debate that we talk about in very different contexts but I think that has to be part of thinking about the global impact of of this big change that

we are seeing in our labor markets. Well, it's interesting you brought up the migration issue because the other aspect of migration is not just the the demand pull of of a more prosperous

market but the environmental push uh resulting from a changing climate. Uh which takes us back to which are the most exposed sectors. I mean Sabina I want to turn it back to you. Um the we

we we've identified as you know at CW we've identified the potential for 48 million new jobs that can be created in across 36 new value chains in the green economy. But the first question we have

to ask is who's going to get impacted more first by the AI disruption as well as the climate disruption. Do you have a sense on that? &gt;&gt; Sure. So I do think this is a really

important conversation in the way that you're articulating it uh Arnaba because if see it's easy to say okay let's look at the impact of AI on jobs but that's not the only thing that's acting on the

labor market right there's also the there's climate change there's also the energy transition imperative there's pandemics there's trade shocks there's so many factors and at the end of the

day all of these forces are affecting you, right? So, it's not just one force. We can't look at these different forces and silos because the labor market, the group of workers is just one. You're

being affected by many things, right? And within that, Ernaba, I like to look at it, you know, rather than sectors because we look at there's a lot of conversation, a lot of research that

talks about what are the next big sectors, right? We can talk about green jobs or we can talk about you know which uh whether we should invest in labor intensive sectors that are more job

creating or um the service you know serviceled growth. At the end of the day I think the fact of the matter is that people make decisions locally and what we're not doing in the job conversation

is having a very local conversation. Right? What do your parents think about your jobs and where you might be able to go to? That's how people make decisions about jobs, not at the 10,000 foot

level. What sectors are growing? Right? So, so that's that's one thing. The second thing I want to say is look at this in a a socioeconomic uh um segmentation. Right? So if you

look at you know this pervasive narrative that developing countries will be less affected right you've all probably heard this oh we don't you know developing countries will be less

affected than industrialized countries because so much of our economy is in the informal sector that is not going to be exposed to AI right that is just not right because if you think about it

there's we have more than 90% of employment is informal employment One way of looking at that is one in 10 jobs is formal and that's such a small number. So if there are disruptions,

it's not affecting the overall economy. But let's flip that argument over, right? Let's flip that argument over. If that is the only number of formal good quality jobs that we have and those jobs

are going to be disrupted and dare I say the people in this room are part of the very large youth population that are going to be applying for those very small number of jobs that are going to

become even less right that affects us directly and so this idea that you know and then there's multiplier effects and then I'll stop you You know, so it's if if the IT sector in Bangalore were to

lay off a lot of workers, all the bars and the restaurants and the eeries and they like they stop spending money and then it has cascading effects across the other parts of the economy too, right?

So we need to come down from the macro to the much more local story and we need to think about this in very real pragmatic terms about how this technology and the disruptions are going

to cascade across the economy. Thanks. So Prager Sabina has in some ways you know thrown us the challenge and when you work closely with governments um what would be your advice in terms of

helping governments manage this transition in a conscious and an intentional way rather than what Sabina is highlighting is often we think that the problem is not large enough because

we're simply not counting the problem in the right way. So what would be an appropriate way of managing this transition with minimal we can't say no disruption? U OpenAI Academy is also

doing stuff. So can you reflect a little bit on what your approach and theory of changes? &gt;&gt; Yeah, I think we're very clear that we're not the experts on this for sure.

Uh and I think we will have to work with you know people like Sabina and Dr. flare to one understand the problem to work with them to also find the solution and then therefore together give an

advice on what is what should the government be doing around these issues um I'm not trying to skirt the question I'm just like being I think very candid that you know we have people in within

open AI we have a chief economist um you know Dr. Ronnie strategy who we've got on board who is actually thinking about this day in and day out and we have a whole economic research uh function

within the company uh within the research lab to actually think about one how is charg being used across the world and then therefore also what is the impact of jobs and we did come out with

a blueprint last year around this topic where we had uh you know the the the chief economic adviser to the prime minister's office also come in and talk about his concerns around the the job

loss that might happen. And of course, I feel like the conversation has really shifted from, you know, last year, February to obviously where we are today um in in February this year because we

can to a very large degree articulate at least what we have seen in the last one year because now the technology is also evolving and in some way maturing. You know earlier there was a very limited

level of adoption. Now of course we're seeing a very high level of adoption not only just within consumers but also a lot around enterprises uh like Nirmid was saying and so we did do a report uh

in in collaboration with IRA which we just launched actually over the weekend and that clearly says and you know we did go out and speak to or survey around 650 companies across India um because we

wanted to root this conversation in facts there was a lot of this you know that oh there's going to be a lot of job loss and then there were a whole set of people saying there are going to be new

jobs so we're all okay and so I think we really wanted to make sure that we are rooting this conversation in a little bit of survey which is localized and talks to what is happening in India as

opposed to a data set which is uh you know international and really doesn't speak to what's going on in the on the ground and what we've se what we've heard 600 650 companies tell us is that

they are slowing down their hiring but at the same time overall growth grow of jobs within their companies is increasing and of course there's a lot of nuance in that fact and in that stat

and you you can feel free to go out and read that report but I think overall what we what we are hearing them say to us is that they are seeing a lot of their um their engineers and their

overall employees not just engineers but people in finance legal HR across functions actually be a lot more efficient and productive uh with the adoption of AI and so I think really our

view on is that you have to adopt and you have to start using this technology to be able to understand what that reskilling upskilling looks like because at least what we've seen is that the

upskilling is much faster and much easier and we are of course making and taking initiatives like the OpenAI Academy to be able to provide all of this content for free so that today if

you're a teacher you can go out and understand what are the best practices to not just use our models but use AI in general plus we're also doing similar by launching certifications of OpenAI which

means the minute you take those courses one you know how to use AI more effectively but also secondly your employability increases significantly after you take that certification so we

want to be part of the solution &gt;&gt; and therefore we want to be able to work with universities with experts to figure out what's the right path and we're doing a lot around diagnosing the

problem as well with Ronnie and our team &gt;&gt; so again both you Praa and what Aditi presented earlier you're we are clearly seeing there is a premium applied to whether you have the green skills or

whether you have the AI skills. The question is um I think as Sabina was saying uh and what you are also I guess attempting to do bringing that down to a place-based conversation rather than

just a macro conversation. So Nimrit as an entrepreneur u what would you say are I mean if you had to give some kind of you know green shoots of enthusiasm out to the policy makers uh what would you

say are India's core strengths in its skill skill uh base or in its kind of demographic base or otherwise which we can present as here here are some strengths that we could leverage through

this transition and disruption. Yeah. Uh so I'll first I'll use a word I think. So with AI and jobs uh I'm cautiously optimistic. That's the word I would use. So of course we need to be cautious but

we also need to be optimistic. See as humanity we run on hope and I can say that without having any agenda on either sides because I also run the biggest human job network for 0

to 7 years which is youth of India and on the same time we also have blue machines AI which is on the AI agentic AI side. So I can be probably uh very I would say bipartisan in in some shape

and form as I talk about this. So at least my perspective on what we are seeing see uh and before Microsoft Excel came out in some ship and form there was like a whole building of people doing

calculations and modeling. Once Microsoft Excel came out all of this modeling work was done by Excel. these people got out from the repetitive task and started doing something creative and

in today's world and I'm talking about AI today uh and I really believe AGI is really far away I uh I think so it's not going to be that like that humanity is going to get destroyed it's far away so

in today's world as I see the jobs are getting unbundled in some shape and form the repetition part of the jobs is going to go away humans are going to be more creative for example yesterday I was

using one AI tool to build. I was with my marketing department. We were trying to build a advertisement and in that advertisement we were trying to say that say a guy is driving the car and and

then and we we but we had to specify the guy is driving the car but the shoot angle has to be from this side and then the car moves in this side. So all of the directorship or that creativity is

still human and I think so we humans are best at creativity and that is what we do more and we will start seeing that more jobs going in that direction. I will also see again there's going to be

a very big rise if the two jobs if I'm going bet on for future is FDE forward deployment engineering because a lot of times big organizations struggle on how do you go and apply AI like say it's a

trucking business they want to apply AI if you don't understand trucking very well enough you cannot apply AI there so think about that transitioning that job I think so that will be very important

eval is going to be a very very big thing for India Yeah, I'm really really looking forward to that. See, India is a very very complex environment, multilingual, multis sectoral, there are

different cultures and to and to ensure that AI works in that way. So we are we are seeing and we are seeing a lot of work happening in that direction and where we have a frontier small lab at

UPNA which is actually building those data sets which big model companies will use in future. So that will be world models are coming up in future I think. So a lot of work is going to get happen

in there. We are also building data sets there. So as we see a lot of this are new jobs that are getting created. So at least my perspective is I don't think so if I am a graduate or I am say maybe two

years into a job I will not lose my job to AI but I will lose my job to a person who uses AI. So at least my perspective is going to be there. Try and learn new skills. I I don't think so we can be

like an ostrich saying that AI is going to change the world. What do I do? I think so. Get the head up as a as a young person getting into professional world. See where you can apply AI

because see AI can do a lot of mundane task but nuances is what we humans are good at. Use your power of imagination, nuances. Ask the right questions. Use AI to then scale it to this and we'll

hopefully go to a world of extreme abundance. And I really hope uh hope that we go in that direction. Let's let's let's stop at extreme abundance and and turn to uh uh CLA

because we've had a diverse discussion on on on the micro issue that uh Sabina Praa and Nit have identified and there's a good story to tell and there is a uncomfortable story

to confront but back to uh governance at a national level or a glo global level um political leaders uh might be aware of the micro but have to articulate a macro and that's where nuance gets lost.

How do we balance this diversity of views when it comes to developing those guard rails those cushions that you want some international cooperation on? What's the biggest risks we want to

confront? I mean I think that the the international conversation on AI is as we all know and as we see here very fragmented and it's perhaps better to

think of it as several conversations. There is a conversation about safety and the sort of existential risk element which is different to this conversation about jobs. Um there are overlaps but

it's just a different conversation and that's okay. Not everything has to be about everything. [clears throat] Um I mean I think on this jobs question as I say I think there's two ways to

look at it and I can see that we have one minute left so let me try to be as quick as I can. I think one is for governments to do the things they've always done but just do them in a new

context. You know governments have always thought about employment. It's one of the main reasons why governments fall is when um is when there is high unemployment and governments are not

meeting people's aspirations. So of course public policy is often very much dominated by questions of employment. That's going to be the same. It's just in this new context. Governments have

always thought about skills. They've always thought about social protection. So I think there's a way in which the AI conversation is not new. It's just a reformulation of exactly the same public

policy issues that have always dominated political debate, but with the new opportunities and risks and therefore I think a level of um a level of urgency that perhaps we we haven't um seen for a

while. There are of course some specific things that governments can do that they must do that are responding specifically to the opportunities and the threats of AI um which are in the areas that we've

discussed here skills social protection all of those things I would like to see my last point I I do think there is a problem with leadership I do think that although there are many governments who

talk a lot about AI and it's a train that everybody body wants to be on. I do think that we perhaps have seen a little bit less in the way of specific actions confronting the complexities.

Everybody wants to be the person who shakes hands over the new data center in their country and things that look great. People are a little bit less keen to talk about what the implic what the

costs and beat might be and how they as governments have a responsibility for managing transitions. But finally, you know, governments do stuff because we as citizens make them

do stuff ultimately. You know, I think we can't pass the buck to companies anymore than we can pass the buck to to companies or to anybody else. If we want this to happen ultimately, it always

comes back, you know, as the jobs question does, it always comes back to the individual and to what we want. Oh, that's that's uh that focus on ultimately our our individual

responsibility is spot on. All sorts of sirens and bells are going off. Uh uh I I I guess I mean that's a sign that we got to all wake up. I think what we've got from this panel I'm really sorry

that we don't have time for questions but we've got from this panel is on one hand the huge opportunity that exists in terms of the clean transition. We at CW say let's create clean markets that

don't exist. I guess we now have to create clean labor markets that don't exist. And I think the the data that uh Aditi shared the the tool that Weber my colleague shared but also what uh Nirmid

you as an entrepreneur are trying to do Praa you what you're trying to do with your stakeholders uh uh Sabina you shining the spotlight on the uncomfortable things and then cla

you trying to take it up to the the the halls of the powers that be uh I think it just demonstrates that this is not going to be solved uh by any single individual or stakeholder. It is a

partnership but that requires intentionality. Um we are here to partner with all of you. Um but all of you out there uh good luck in retaining your jobs or getting a new one. Thank

you. [applause] They want to give us some momentum. [laughter]
