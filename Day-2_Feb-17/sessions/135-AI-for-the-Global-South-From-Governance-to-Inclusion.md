## 📝 Transcript

And there are three key pillars of artificial intelligence as far as India is concerned. One, we do not want to go the way of ironclad legislation the way EU has gone for. Second, we want to have

soft touch regulations that will ensure enough guardrails for safety and security, but at the same point of time will not stifle innovation or starve our innovators from data and the required uh

areas of AI innovation. And the third key pillar and why it distinguishes from the global north is that we are more based on a welfare outcomebased approach than the global

north's riskbased approach. So for us it is more important that artificial intelligence is not limited to algorithms and centralization. AI should be democratized.

It should not be localized in the hands of a few. And the benefits of AI must transcend to the last person at the bottom of the pyramid. For the farmers, it should ensure better predictive

analysis to ensure better sewing and yields. For the expectant mothers, it should ensure better prenatal and neonatal care. For the students, it should ensure better innovation in the

classrooms. for the gig workers it should ensure better welfare. So just to pause at this point of time I would say these are the three key

pillars where India and probably global south is differentiated from the global north. Thank you. Thank you Tisham. The way I look at it is uh I think India is very uniquely

positioned because uh we within India have an Indian north and Indian south. Uh so I think uh India can be a good uh laboratory and testing case with regard to how all the advances that are

happening in AI can be used for the maximum benefit of the if I may use the expression local south. uh while I have been working along with Mr. Shashit Patra my fellow member on

the standing committee I think I have found that uh the major focus of India and that that is why I call it India is uniquely positioned is where right from the inception we have been focused less

on regulation we would want to learn we would want to learn from the regulations made by the other countries and see where they are going right and where they are going wrong. So the government

in that sense has uh very smartly not been very proactive but it's been responding from time to time and again from a larger welfare perspective. So I think where uh I find this technology

promising and the approach of India quite commendable and I'm not from the ruling party so don't think that I'm being complimentary. Yeah. So I I find it commendable is that uh right from the

inception we have a clear uh vision that we will use this technology for maximum public good and for maximum public benefit. We also have the challenge of limited resources but infinite people

who need to be tended to. So we need to make our solutions very smart and efficient. Make them uh work at a population scale. So this can actually be uh uh a a great pilot case for the

rest of the world and maybe we can uh harness this as we go along working with the global north but helping the global south. &gt;&gt; Thank you Ambassador Garcia.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. I've just arrived in New Delhi today early in the morning. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much for the invitation. I'm happy to be here. Congratulations on India's leadership in hosting this

important summit. I think in terms of the you question is about the north star that we have but actually this is the south star right I think we should start changing our mindsets to see the world

according to our views so from the southern hemisphere I think that's the first point but I think one concept that should be at the center of our concerns is development of course that that AI

should be development oriented because when we see the debates on AI governance a few years ago they had some AI principles uh transparency accountability or human rights fair and

equable ethical AI responsible AI but where where is development in this scenario because this is when we see the reality in Latin America America and Africa, parts of Asia, Middle East, etc.

For the global south, we should ask them what your priorities are. So in this think of for example, aentic AI, we say that it's the next big thing or it was supposed to be last year, but to do

what? To book a trip for you to go to the Disneylands in the US, maybe it's not what we need. Maybe we need AI for health care, AI for education, AI for local solutions. So I

think when we see this process for the summits, u India made the the best choice because the three pillars for the AI impact summit as you know the sutras are people, planets and progress. people

because we need more inclus inclusion more people being uh involved in benefit benefiting from AI planet because it needs to be sustainable otherwise we are destroying the planet and progress

because as my colleagues said we need AI for economic development social and for the benefit of our populations. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you ambassador.

&gt;&gt; Thank you so much. I will echo ambassador genu about um the user needs AI is there is no single AI there are multiple AIs uh it's a big stack ranging from AI for AI foundational models to AI

for public goods for AI for public service and um and then that's big range and then we need to find the granular level that fit with that the purpose of development of the AI for the member

states for each country for each needs so it should be user needs driven rather than competitiondriven which is the case today. I mean you see countries are competing around LLMs but in fact in

the infin is just a tool and then that should not be the finality. LLM will not be the final purpose of the AI. AI should serve people and build uh solutions for

people. But if you go back to the one of the biggest uh uh economic actors when it comes to the AI ch open AI and with their Chad GPT tool and biggest LLM ever meaning they are they are competing on

the size of the AI not about the benefit they are delivering and then we can see that through the economic results of the company itself meaning they have no revenue. So we need to locate the value

of AI. What is the value that we would like to extract from the AI? Value is a very relative notion for each country and for each citizen in each country. And then that's that should be our north

star how to make the AI a bottom up approach coming from citizens needs and building upon th those needs to satisfy and answer and make their life better. &gt;&gt; Thank you.

On the note of being driven by use rather than benchmarks uh a question for for both Dr. Patra and uh Shin Ranjan Reddi um how does so India's digital

transformation is very much tied to digital public infrastructure which is rooted in a public good of course. So how should India use DPI to ensure that then benefits of AI do go to the more

than 1.4 4 million people that are in this so-called last mile starting with Shri see the digital public infrastructure is [clears throat] one stack India is

working on this uh stack approach where they want to use DPI for the purpose of uh using AI to see how many benefits and in what measure it can can it be reached but I think in even apart from the DPI

stack itself um I think I've been noticing that lot State governments have been operating outside the DPI infrastructure and they have been working at a population scale because

each of the state governments and I think it will slowly percolate down to district level administrations also where they have these datas and because of the digital connectivity that has

increased tremendously in India they have a method of reaching the larger population digitally. So today when we do uh an agriculture related uh AI application it has become very local

because a particular district in a state within a state the geographical conditions will vary the cropping patterns will vary the soil conditions will vary so what's happening is uh uh

as I said even at a very hyper local level the state governments are able to manage and scale for their specific requirements at that particular level But at a DPI level, I think yes, there

are some potential uses. We are still trying to see how optimally we can use for different use cases. Yesterday, yesterday when I was talking to my team, I one of the thoughts that came to my

mind was when you now have UPI and the DPI and you have uh uh credit uh facil I mean the uh transactions that are being done at a very vendor local vendor level who don't have credit history. I was

just wondering if AI can be used for the purpose of just mapping the usage of UPI by each of the vendors and AI will be able to actually generate and give out a summary of what they have done which can

then be sent to them if they want to use and go to a bank. The AI can also inform them that look in the way your transactions have gone on. It could be a vegetable vendor. It could be a fruit

vendor. It could because we have Bhashimi which is an application which speaks in uh different languages to different people. So there are some oral messages that are also transmitted. So

if there's a credit history that's built up just one DPI related uh use that can be is what if we are able to send out to each of these people in their local language vernacular language that look

whatever you have done entitles you today to have this credit history you will be able to go to a bank by the normal RBI norms you may be entitled to get a loan of 50,000 rupees or one lakh

rupees now that will be something that they will come to know when they hear from uh uh a bot maybe but it is something that I think we have multiple uses that seem possible and potential. I

think uh I'm just very excited about the possibilities yet. I'll focus on the DPI stack. My colleague Mr. Reddi has very beautifully articulated the part where state

governments are working beyond the DPI stack. I'll try to integrate the DPI stack. What is for those uninitiated in this room? DPI stack means what? Digital public infrastructure means

what? It basically means there are different stacks of data. The first set of data is the Aadhaar data. What is Aadhaar? Aadhaar is like the unique ID that every individual in this country

has. That's your unique ID number. The second is Jandhan J which basically again is the bank accounts that have percolated down to the bottom of the pyramid. Almost 80% people are covered

in this country through the Jandan. The third is the digil locker. Today a student wants to have a certificate. No tries you don't have to do that you give your diglocker access and anyone in this

planet can access the data through your diger. So you're talking about Jandhan. You're talking about Aadhaar, you're talking about Mudra and you're talk Mudra is

small loans given and then Digilocker. So the jam trinity that is being percolated through the stack DPI stack added with the unique payment interface that we have where every day 8 billion

transactions are being done in real time in India. So therefore that's the kind of data that you're sitting on in this country. So what Thrish G is wanting to understand is given the extent of this

data given the magnitude of this data where does India want to use it through AI and how does that help the common man who is in the village I'll give you a very small example through this entire

interface a farmer through a government program called as PM Kisan Yojna receives a certain amount of money every year every quarter now for example that data of that farmer is seeded in this

data stack of DPI which has all the information about that farmer along with if any crop loss is there then what is the compensation paid his entire history as a farmer is locked in through that

Aadhaar portal so therefore when you're going to use that data stack the DPI stack and the UPI stack and on top of it you bring in artificial intelligence it makes intelligible able decision making

for the government in deriving policies and governance. So if there are any leakages in terms of funds and transfers, it will show up there. If it has to have predictive analysis that in

a certain state or a certain district of this country, you have pesticides which are causing harms to the farmers, it will pop up. If it shows unseasonal rains or specific drought seasons, it

will show up. So therefore it'll make governance and policym better and instead of a intuitive measures that is being used by the government it becomes more proactive more AI enabled that is

why it is essential that global south can use this formula of India for the entire global south especially the African Union that's the idea behind the DPI and the AI

&gt;&gt; thank you Dr. Arthur, you really zoomed in on how AI is essentially data. Thank you. Um, Ambassador Garcia, we're we're going to now zoom out from individual national case studies to what

countries can do together as Brazil as chair bricks. Um, how are you in your agenda setting navigating this tension between your countries need AI of course um, and

need to build compute power to support it. How do you balance that with the need to then depend on foreign companies to be able to build out that infrastructure?

So, how do you do that while securing your own data and maintaining sovereignity in this space? Thank you for the question. Yes, Brazil was president of the bricks in last year

2025. Now India has the presidency of the bricks. Congratulations. But uh we put uh AI also at the center of our concerns for the bricks agenda

and we establish uh an AI task force last year to negotiate among the group in delegations that we had several meetings discussing a nice statement that was adopted last year during the

summit in Rio of the bricks and they said the bricks leaders statement on AI governance and was the first time that we had such uh documents that is exclusively about AI governance

at the highest level in in the bricks uh group and some of the topics I think touch your question because we talk about for example digital sovereignty because we need to see how AI will be

developed but also respecting national choices or each country sovereign to decide what to do exactly in terms of where to put the money or should I regulate or how much

or where and this is a decision that domestically countries will have to make this and appreciate the costs and benefits of each choice but we need to respect this otherwise we'll preaching

to each other or maybe lecturing or maybe this in the disagreement what we we are supposed to do and because when we have this uh point of view that is domestically

and we respect the others u and how they think about it then we can sit down and and see how we can coordinate actions and work together but that's the challenge so for example developing

countries should come together. So like Brazil and India because u we have already a very strong partnership and as you know President Lula from Brazil will be attending this summit. He's coming

tomorrow and after the summit we have a state visit which is a bilateral visit from President Lula to India. We have a meeting with Prime Minister Modi and

several agreements will be signed but one especially is really important is a digital partnership for the future because it will take DPI's experience from India but also we have our

experience for example in terms of systems of payment we have the pics I don't know if you heard about this pix is like also a tool for financial inclusion a very successful in Brazil.

So coming from Indians experiencing but also AI uh high performance in computed semiconductors everything it's as a package in terms of cooperation including data governance e

government. So I think AI is key for this digital stack we are building together. So I see this a very promising partnership and uh hopefully this is going to be a very successful visit as

well. I believe Brazil has one of the largest national delegations to the summit from what I've heard. So very excited for the outcomes coming out of the next few days

and uh great point on avoiding just preaching to each other in endless circles. Absolutely we should avoid that. Um Dr. as as you're hearing these points being

presented, how does the UN's global digital compact process harmonize all of these national and regional priorities into a global standard

um that prevents digital fragmentation while still of course respecting the specific development needs of the global south. Thank you so much. Um just to explain what is the global digital

compact is the uh as taking the word of the UNG uh is the first global framework uh agree uh on digital cooperation between the all member states and uh there's a lot of cooperation agreement

at the UN um and there was no one related to the digital cooperation how what does it mean digital cooperation and partnership in in digital in AI in infrastructure and that was voted with

all member states uh during J something. Apologies for interrupting. I just want to check if everybody's able to hear because there is a lot of interference from the room. Is is the audio audible

back in the Okay, perfect. Please go ahead. &gt;&gt; I can start also [laughter] be a bit more loud. Okay. And uh that's the global digital compact. So it's it's

the real first framework for digital cooperation at the UN level. And um when it comes to the AI, there are specific actions that are um uh being undertaken at the UN level from scientific panel to

be uh to bring some vision on AI development both scientific risk and opportunities, a global dialogue that will start this year in Geneva and the next year in New York to bring all all

stakeholders to discuss about the AI development, AI governance, AI risks and then to get a voice around the table. then some some member-led uh activities like AI capacity building that should

equip member states with uh global understanding of the strategy and the impact of the governance being decided on their developments. Uh main measure point I think and that's not the UN uh

voice but I'm mostly on my work on AI on daily basis. I think that at the global level we should not aim too high in divine defining a global framework of AI governance rather than that we should

aim to get a minimum set of standards so that all can bring all member states around table and agree on this minimum set of standards the very basic human rights oriented citizen right oriented

economic and development oriented and peace oriented. So very basic reasons not no no no need to define this very complex high level um and often complex to to discuss governance mechanism that

we may have and building on on that set of minimum standards we can develop in different context related some new governance approach now you know that uh 20 years ago there is no discussion

about AI governance every member states was uh free to develop the AI vision they have at the time. So there is no today need to develop some governance mechanism that could be a constraints

for countries developed countries to develop their own AI and that's where we hear from the group from the um from the member states talking about we need the freedom in the decision- making process

yes for the freedom in terms of the governance mechanism but with this minimum set of standards that should be irreducible meaning and Um and then in anter like human rights like uh the

right for development and like the uh sovereignity notion with some coaches when it comes to the sovereignity because this is becoming a very granular notion of sovereignity. It could be

defined at a different layer and stack. We need to define where it started and when it ends for each context and its member states. &gt;&gt; Thank you Dr. S. Where does sovereignty

start? where does it? And that's a good question. I think we're all trying to figure out what sovereign AI really means in practice as countries truly aspire to it. Um,

bouncing off of that discussion, uh, Ambassador Garcia, back to you as Brazil hands the baton to India for bricks. uh how what's on your wish list in terms of how the nations of the global south

can move beyond the more principles based frame around AI ethics and governance to actualize the idea of polyateral governance as you've put it in the past. What is what in your view

is the importance of the global south setting those rules for itself? &gt;&gt; Thank you. Yes, I was talking later um before about digital sovereignty but it's not that countries should close

their borders or maybe seek isolation. It's exactly uh the contrary because when we say that actually when you see the world economy it's really impossible to to be detached

from the supply chains that everything now is global and it's how the world economy works. So what you need to do is to enhance domestic capabilities and at the same time seek partnerships with

other countries, other players, seek international cooperation. Then you can uh create alternatives that would little by little enhance your one sovereignty. I don't know if because

this is not closed sovereignty, it's open sovereignty that we seek collaborate with others to enhance our own domestic capabilities. So when we say that we have a relationship of

cooperation Brazil and India, it's good for both because we are cooperating and also we're also enhancing our national capabilities at the same time. So I think this should be also considered in

in the global south so that we can have all the uh different relations in terms of south south cooperation but also engaging in AI governance at the global level because when you said about

competition uh fragmentation because now we see AI governance it's a patchwork of initiatives sometimes they are not connect with each other and we

see a mistrust towards uh the multilateral system and we see that the UN has a key role to play because the global south is represented in New York in Geneva as UN member states. So the

developing countries are also they have this uh opportunity to participate under the opice of the UN. So I think it should be central to our concerns that we come to the defense of the

multilateral system and the role that the UN can play as well. &gt;&gt; So we're we're really breaking down what sovereignty means not just in terms of the technology itself but in how it's

being governed. Uh continuing on that thread of sovereignity and how it's reflected in our national and regional ecosystems. Uh my question to Mr. Reddi, you recently raised critical questions

regarding the risk that generative AI use presents uh in terms of platforms extracting sensitive government data and this is an important sovereign issue as well.

Right? So in a world where AI models are often hosted outside of a country's territory, how should governments then protect their sovereign data whilst of course still making use of AI? It is

immensely helpful in reducing paperwork or dull and repetitive tasks. I think some of these concepts are still work in progress because when you now speak of what is sovereign data. I can

understand that uh some of the data relating to the governance itself, the government uh that is integrally connected with the functioning of a nation may be sovereign data. But let's

say if I'm using a social media app and if I'm using an app that is developed by uh an American company and I'm using that for the purpose of uh uh uh having a conversation or sending some

communications. Now would that data become sovereign data just because the user is from a particular uh country and then uh if the data can be stored in some other

country, we need to have a global framework with regard to first defining as to what that data can be stored for and and what uses can that be put because suppose if someone is just

storing the data for the purpose of training their data sets as I said it's still work in progress this concepts are still fuzzy. uh because uh I'm also a lawyer by

profession. So I I find it a little befuddling to understand what may be treated as sovereign data as I said if anything related to the government governance the country may be sovereign

data but uh whether any general data relating to let's say a photograph that someone is posting on the internet. Now the photograph may be taken by a person of a particular nationality but he knows

that the internet is not confined to one country itself. Now if that is on the internet and absent the copyright uh issues if some data sets are working on that if that is uh uh being used by

someone would it qualify as violating a sovereign data. I think the larger issue that I was focusing on when you refer to the questions I asked was uh with regard to the data not being available within

India and it being available only outside India. So some of the countries are coming with some governance policy where they say look if you're taking data out of the country the law can

provide that you must also have a set located within the geographical limits of that particular country. If such a law is made then depending on the extent of law uh when the law provides that

this would be treated as a data that needs to be stored within the country then I think whoever is acting on that will have to be in compliance &gt;&gt; all right so uh I'm just going to get a

quick sense of um are we able to take questions from the audience so let's do that actually and then Yeah, in front and then one up here. So um thank you so much and really

insightful uh takes from all esteemed members of the panel. Um what I was wondering is that this theme of inclusivity has been going around um for the past two days already. I mean Dr.

Yesterday also in the panel that you did at the main venue, you spoke of how AI's use cases should reach the last mile and I see it being echoed more and more. But in a country that's as vast as ours, how

big of a of a challenge is the technological literacy part for policy makers and also for these last mile users like when we speak of uh say for example and body workers being able to

use AI meaningfully or farmers being able to use AI meaningfully. Is it also not imperative that they at least have some working knowledge of what that AI is also from a level of trust that if

say for example a farmer in a tier 2 tier three town is being given some advice by this black box then how is he that farmer just supposed to take that advice at face value right because that

advice may be tied into his economic well-being so what would you think about that &gt;&gt; I also ask you to introduce yourself &gt;&gt; yeah sorry oh yeah my uh my name is

Sanit I work on questions of technology governance and institutional readiness. &gt;&gt; All right. And I'll also zoom out your question because Brazil has a it's a very big country with a very diverse

population. So I would apply the same question to you. &gt;&gt; We can keep you have Thank you. to your specific question should a farmer

also have basic rudimentary understanding about AI right I I look at it in this perspective where I'm coming from a farmer in a village in my state of Orisa

probably 10 years back would get on a phone call not SMS a would get a phone call from the local if there was a cyclone appearing

3 years down back he started getting SMSs on his smartphone if it was happening what would AI do for him is when the skies are bright and there is no

inclination to him that something is coming he should be able to get a message to tell that the cyclone might hit in 7 days or 10 place, get your barns in place, tie up your livestock,

move to a specific location. So I'm looking at it from that perspective. I'm not looking at it at this point of time for an Anganari worker or a farmer to have the basic understanding about AI.

What I understand is given the data stack that we have as a country, how can AI make more intelligent and better decisions and solutions for those on the ground at the bottom of the pyramid or

in the fields of this. Once we have gone that distance then probably we can start finding out okay how do we dovetail them into the local panchiat levels the village

levels. So the punchiat offices and the block offices and the taluk offices have a basic understanding about AI. So once we have scaled part one we go to part two and then the part three. I'll

just end with the anganari worker. Let's say for example due to a specific water problem in a specific area it has been historically seen during a specific season of the

rainy season children at the ages of 3 to 6 years generally fall sick for various reasons. If that is a data that is available through the health portal and is made intelligible by artificial

intelligence over a period of time then the messages will start coming to the Anganari worker and the block level officer that this is a period that is appearing in two months time start

cleaning up the tanks start taking care of so I'm looking at a very basic understanding of how it's going to play out in the lives of people once we have scaled that probably then we can talk

about AI I intervening through capacity building programs but as of now again at the cost of being repetitive inclusive AI and welfare based AI outcome based AI is something that we need to focus on.

&gt;&gt; Thank you Dr. I think your point is that at this point in time uh more than AI literacy it's how useful AI is to people. Yes, absolutely. Ambassador Garcia.

&gt;&gt; Yes, also thank you for the question. I was think about it because Brazil as you know is also very large country in territory not same population as in India. But Brazil has a problem that is

perhaps the one of the challenges that we still are struggling is social inequality. I think we have some millionaires, billionaires, but the large population I

think it's mostly excluded sometimes but we need to our obligation as in terms of public public policy is to think of how we can include and the the the goal of our panel is to discuss from governance

to inclusion. So we inclusion within our countries. So this is I think what India is trying to do if taking DPI but also other initiatives and you see when we compare compare for example the Indian

AI mission we have the Brazilian plan for AI which is basically similar feeling that we need to do something for the people and uh and the moto of the this plan the Brazilian plan is AI for

the good of all which is very similar with what you're doing in terms of AI impact summit you see that the the concern that you have in also in Brazil is very much align we are on the same

page is not it is a nice word say AI for good because it's not tech for the safe of tech it's tech for something else so I think this is the difference that we because sometimes we see billionaires,

CEOs from large companies, private companies overseas. They say, "Oh, tech is our business." So, we know what we're doing. Don't worry about this. This is something that

we always do the right thing but we need to trust me or but I think yes but uh we when we see the reality of developing countries then we have to shift the mindset. I was talking before that that

they need to change the mindsets and really put our priorities first. just to from human rights perspective I'll echo ambassador and Dr. has meet about the capacity building and

awareness raising awareness about AI but still something is very important that was discussed about bringing the data from the citizen to train all these models. So that part requires some

awareness and that the this is an informed decision is being taken by the citizen to share data within these models to respect their privacy, their human rights because in AI there is no

opt out. Once you get your data inside of your model, it's there forever. So there's probably some capacity building and awareness regarding the fact that you are sharing your data for a benefit

for all and but it should be optional. It should never be mandatory and it should be an informed decision that requires some capacity building and some raising some awareness about the risk

also of sharing these data to build these models. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Uh there was another question &gt;&gt; just just a practical uh answer to what you're asking me. Uh what happens is

when you talk of trust to a person who is not trained and who is a complete novice in terms of this field without meaning any disrespect what would happen is it will work at a very practical

level. If there's a farmer he sees another farmer using this and benefiting from it then he will start trusting it. And when it comes to private enterprise there are already a lot of private

enterprises in the enterprises in the field. if they are able to go and reach out to a farmer and provide solutions, if uh they are actually delivering good results. Now seeing one farmer use this

private enterprise, the other farmers will go to the same enterprise and if they don't deliver good results, even the first farmer who use the private enterprise won't go back to that. So

this will work out practically. But uh it is something that would have to be earned. If it is happening at a government level, if the government is coordinating with some enterprises or

providing these solutions, then the trust is something that is intrinsic. It starts with that. But even if it is the public uh department that is doing it, if the farmer finds that it is not

useful, trust me, next year he will not trust it. He will rather go to a private enterprise which is more trustworthy. So the trust would have to be earned. So if it is the state or the government that

is providing these solutions, the state would have to be mindful because it's not just about agriculture. If the farmer loses out on one agricultural input related data uh

suggestion, he will not trust this even for his health, even for anything else that he may want to use. &gt;&gt; Maybe we can take two questions together. So this one and then another

one. &gt;&gt; Very good afternoon all of you. I'm Nickel Peter Fernandez. So I work with renewable energy, bio energy and uh basically with farmers on a daily basis

actually. So my question is also related to farmers and the first question would be to Dr. Patra and Sri Reddi and the second question would be to do Dr. Medi. So the first question is while we are

speaking about DPIs and the multiple stacks that we are having all the marginal the small scale farmers they come with no civil score no credit rating and all that. So getting microl

loans is a major issue there even though we have you know our government schemes wherein the monthly or the quarterly remittances happen. So from the government side is a policy decision

coming or some policy structure infrastructure coming to that effect that was my first question. Now to Dr. Medi see uh the BRICS countries as well as you know the ASEAN the African Union

as well we have our own aspirations when it comes to AI and if you take African Union 40% the entire union have I think about 40% of connectivity in terms of internet

connectivity till date so there are a lot of limitations and to add to that there are a lot of non-state actors in play who have ease of access to AI it's not a you know secret thing or

So from the UN's perspective and from the UN side, what is being done to that effect in terms of regulations? Thank &gt;&gt; Can you elaborate what you mean by non-state actors here?

&gt;&gt; Uh terrorists. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Just &gt;&gt; Yeah. Uh my question was because I'm basically a veteran so hence interest in

that field. Thank you. I &gt;&gt; I had briefly spoken about uh the credit scores and how AI could help. I'm not sure if the government is coming up with

any scheme because until they put it out in the public, they may be working on it is my clear idea because uh Mr. uh Nalani has been suggesting this for a long time that we need to have this

financial stack. So I'm hoping the government is working on it but I actually see it happening very soon. If the if the state doesn't come up with it, somebody will come up with a

solution and offer it to the state for offering it in the digital stack. Thanks for the question and then um yeah there is a there is a need for for the um for building some more uh robust

governance mechanisms but this is a fully member statedriven decision. This is a sovereign decision. It's not the UN role to build a decision but to raise awareness to support in building that

decision and that's typically the role of the UN with the new uh mechanism being built the global dialogue the international scientific panel and the capacity building. We need to raise the

awareness to build and support in um in uh activating the member states but it's not our role to build their own governance. This is a subverine decision that is fully in hands of the member

states. &gt;&gt; We just have a minute left. So uh we won't have time for any further questions and I know Mr. Ready has to go to Sangeit soon. Uh so I'll uh ask you

all to give your final thoughts uh quickly maybe 15 seconds each to close up the panel. Dr. 15 seconds. I believe uh AI for global south is real and we need to engage

together. Thank you. It just told me to shut up. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Just a quick word. I think uh good start, great start. I think we need to have more of multilateral and

minilateral coalitions for the purpose of uh bringing this to action. In my case, I think we need to take advantage of opportunities because in developing countries sometimes it's very

often that we don't we lack resources needed for AI infrastructure etc. So we need to take advantage of open-source opportunities that are available and for for doing that we need to u fight

against barriers against the vision of technology and say that we don't need discrimination we need to actually more open access to the technology for everybody

I'll say just that are looking at the title I'll rather go to AI for the global out from inclusion to governance rather than from governance to inclusion putting the inclusion as the the

articulating point for the governance mechanism to be built. &gt;&gt; Right. Thank you so much. Thank you all for joining us. [applause] The conversations shall continue over the

next three days. Thank you so much. Good job.
