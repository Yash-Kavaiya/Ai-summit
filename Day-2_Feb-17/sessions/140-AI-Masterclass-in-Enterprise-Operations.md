## 📝 Transcript

U you know on this journey right on exploring how AI uh can help uh you know supercharge and transform businesses right take them from their legacy operations to becoming AI native uh and

towards this end I'm sure even in your organizations uh you would have AI center of excellences we have the same right and uh I can see a lot of people smiling and laughing uh the what has

happened is you you know the intent is there right uh to transform the business. uh but you know people start you know you you have a project you you think of it like a project you start a

project right and you know you achieve some results and you want to take it to production and it takes let's say 6 8 months you say hey look this is my first project it's a learning curve that's

okay I'm seeing great outcomes let's do it right and then the second project comes along and you again start from scratch right it's going to take you another 6 8 months and then it's the

same process right same set of validation same set of approvals And the velocity of the innovation that was promised right the transformation from you know your legacy software to AI

nativity is just falls short right the promise is no longer there right and we observe the same thing uh at our you know AICE and our customers and so when we break down that problem right uh we

see there are a lot of root causes right you I mean I come from engineering we we do RCA we say hey look what what what is what is the cause of of this. Why aren't why aren't people with great intent,

right? Wanting to do the right thing by their businesses not able to move fast, right? And so we see siloed data, right? So fragmented data, whichever way you want to call it, right? You have data in

five different systems, five different places, right? Uh often times the data says the same thing. Sometimes they say different things. They're in conflict with each other. You have duplicates of

the data. Uh you have versioning of the data, right? data that was great today is no longer you know same tomorrow and it could be anything right it could be the menu at the Taj hotel it could be uh

you know your uh you know your release cycles in a software company it really doesn't matter data is living and breathing right then what we noticed was this promise of

um uh uh you know intelligence from a lot of uh lot of hyperscalers right so I mean I'm sure you guys have co-pilots right every system has a co-pilot Right. Right. And now we're moving from the

data islands, right, to AI islands, right? Those systems don't talk to each other. They don't have the context of your customer across every touch point that he interacts with your brand,

right? And what happens is, you know, at the end of the day when you are building these systems in the AICE, right? Um, you build it once, you build it twice, right? They're not standardized, right?

Uh the same guardrails don't appear. And how do you test for systems right that are inherently probabilistic right at scale for you know for safety right everybody wants to deploy responsible

and safe AI at scale right but you're dealing with uh these large language models right where they're inherently probabilistic you know the behavior is not the same across a thousand runs

right often times performance deteriorates right And you want to be able to quantify right what uh how how how well a system does right and finally we also have you know uh orchestration

across your different you know your group silos right functions right simple workflows right and uh you know reaching out to uh you know uh people customers in the channels that they are in right

so whether it be WhatsApp whether it be email right but having the same context right and And and I'm I'm saying the word context in a very very specific way. I'm not saying data, right? Data is

very different from context. Having the same context across all your systems, right? So that your AI, whether it be a large model, whether it be a small model, whether it be a medium model,

whatever it is, right? Whether it's a vision model, can act, right? In a really, really responsible, intelligent, and successful manner that can lead to task outcomes, right? So here we're not

interested in vanity metrics, right? You're not interested in you know how well you know your transcription is or your WR rates or you know whatever, right? you're you're interested in end

outcomes of a customer and doing that successfully over millions of ROS right so that's the context and so to solve for all of this uh what we've built and we're also on the journey right what

we're building is an AIOS for enterprise operations right uh now I I I call it OS right because u if you think about it right we had uh several disruptions right you had the PC era right you had

Windows Then you had the mobile era, you had the internet era, right? And in all of these uh you know eras right of transformation, you had people right

developers being able to build whatever they want right on a base system with apps right and that's the same uh you know uh interface and logic that we are going after. So we think there are about

four or five foundational elements right of building a great UI use case AI use case right uh that will help transform your company right from a being a legacy system to being AI native right now for

that what all do you need right obviously at the infrastructure level you need GPUs right you can get that from hyperscalers you can get it from uh us as a group right we are sovereign in

nature if that matters to you right you We need this context layer, right? Or semantic layer, right? Where we look at all your data. We find duplicates, we resolve conflicts, right? Uh we are able

to attach context to it, right? Across all the different channels. You need orchestration, right? So you need your agents, you need uh multi- aentic setup. We're calling it an AI

worker, right? You need all the tools, you need all the integrations, you need knowledge bases, right? U we by the way have built a voice AI system. Uh that is actually the first speechtospech model.

So I know you guys would have seen that at Yanni. We we released it about six months back. We are not great at PR, right? Uh we are tech people, right? Uh but you if you have the time and maybe

today we'll have the time to try it out or maybe at the booth, right? And on top of all of this is the uh is the rails of governance, right? So you have the audit layer, right? uh you have compliance,

you have observability, right? You have privacy core first design, all of the things that you would expect, right? That is out of the box. On the right side, what you have is all the SDKs,

right? So, if you want to uh you know, if you're in customer experience, uh you can talk to your customers on WhatsApp, on uh you know, Google RCS, you can talk to them on email, SMS, what have you,

right? Uh if you are doing processes, right? You can send notifications whatever, right? The whole whole set of actionable channels. And so this this forms the core of the AI OS, right?

Remember I told you about building apps. That final layer is the VIP app layer, right? Where you can build any app that you want, right? I think uh TCS has been conducting sessions as well, right? Uh

empowering people to use natural language to build apps, right? uh we have Kish in the room here who is the lead developer on that right so we're building uh apps right that uh you know

with natural language you can make it sit on top of all of this feature and functionality and get you where you need to so I'm going to move on

uh so I have a couple of uh I want to spend a couple of minutes here on the YUI cloud so I'm going to hand it over to Thomas uh for a few minutes and then uh we'll quickly get the master class

started. Thank you. So, how many of you have really heard about YU cloud before this? Okay, hardly three, four, five, six, seven. So, I think most of them are

from data communications itself, right? Um so many haven't heard about YUA, YU cloud itself, right? So, we have been That's actually the predecessor for the next conversation because you know

data communications YC cloud has been in business for over a decade and that brings in the you know setup for you know building your agents and putting it in production. How do you move from

pilots to operations in production at scale is something that you need to know and we have that experience in building that over the several decades right or more than a decade or so. So um what do

we have here? So when we talk about building in operational scale we have been doing past in private cloud in uh govern cloud in lot of those you know government community cloud. So we have a

lot of data centers that are operating here in India as well. More than five data centers which includes Bangalore, Delhi, Bombay, Chennai and recently we have launched the new AI cloud in our uh

latest data center in Chennai with with the liquid cooled um GPUs as a service that's a foundation of our AI cloud and also we have launched the latest AI studio. So what does AI studio comprise

of? It basically helps you to uh you know the rest of your complete data science or the AI life cycle which means that you can build a model, you can deploy a model, you can scale a model

and you can run govern a model uh in the space right so whether you build it on your own infrastructure in terms of in terms of which is being hired in in cloud or you bring in an external model

as an open source model and you basically run it. So if you look at that AI studio it helps you to do agile development um with the AI workbench integrated devops that means you can

manage the complete devops jet uh app genkins container studio container registry all that can be managed and uh once you deploy it you can manage it in model governance model registry all that

management along with serverless infrastructure and the next phase is you know once you have it you want to make Make sure that your is running in with all their compliances. We have sovereign

and secure capability that is certified and ya cloud is currently going through a ISO 42,000 certification and we'll be one of the first hyperscalers or we are the first

hyperscaler in India will have who will have the certification offered to where the difference of certification is that we have the data plane compliance as well as control plane compliance here in

India. So what's the summary? The summary is that we have the advantage of having 40% faster time to deploy 30% lower TCO and 100% compliant and so in at the core. So that's about a cloud.

Handing over to Bank. &gt;&gt; Thank you Thomas. So uh 30% lower TCO. All right. Uh let's let's get into uh the AI masterass and enterprise operations, right? Um so we're going to

uh talk about AI workers today. We're going to pick up different domains, right? Uh I think we have three or four different uh you know tasks planned for the day uh across uh you know, HR, IT

support. Uh I'm sure you guys are all used to it. Uh you would have seen a lot of vendors coming at you at it, right? Uh so today we're going to show you a hands-on session on all of the different

layers that I talked about coming together, right? For for it to work well, right? And work well reliably. repeatably right in uh in production. And so today we're going to do uh we're

already about 5 minutes late on the introduction, 50 minutes on the master class itself. Uh we're going to have demos. So we would love for you guys to come on stage, right? Talk about what

you built, right? And u the audience. Um and then we're going to do some uh you know uh final voting, right? To see what what what is good, what what people loved. Um and then we're going to uh

also issue certificates in the last few minutes, right? So that's the agenda for today. Uh so thank you so much for coming down and uh and having uh this session with us. Grateful for your

support. Uh hopefully it will be a fruitful and a learn a lot of learning during this during the session. Uh with that I want to introduce my uh uh colleagues who will be running uh the

session right so we have uh Jade on the team there if you can stand up. Uh we have Riyaz over here. Uh we have Kishan. uh we have Lakshmi right there and then we have Jitindraasur from ICL here. So

he's actually one of the uh experts right uh and uh runs this AICO himself. So a lot of uh lessons to be learned there u and then we also have Prau from AICOE right our COE here as well. So you

you get a good mix of people uh and we'd love to interact. Let's keep it interactive. Any questions? Happy to answer, right? Happy to leverage expertise. Thank you.

attention everyone. Uh you will have another 3 minutes to go to wrap up your AI worker. Uh post that we'll uh start doing demos. Uh for each demo you have again 3 minutes uh which would be

followed by voting. Okay. So your countdown for 3 minutes starts One minute to go. Okay,

laptops down. We are done. We are at as in where basis now. And uh any uh uh you know volunteer for uh the first

presentation or I should call from uh the names you had given earlier. Oh why nice please uh you'll have to tell the team name again. Okay and uh yeah uh you need to hook it on there.

Okay you can bring the laptop here. Oh yeah yeah yeah. So there's a gentleman here. He will help us plug in. Please do not try to plug in yourself. We do not want the manual technology

fail the AI. Hello everyone. My name is Arvanch along with Rajiv and Kit. Um so our team name is AI gems. Uh the problem statement statement we are

solving is here we are a corporate organization right providing IT support providing finance support providing various software development support. Now the the problem arise that key

whenever whenever there's a queries happening right to our support desk right multiple queries coming sometimes it's coming from the software development queries sometimes coming for

finance reporting sometimes can be coming basic SOP right so we thought to create a uh single uh uh view right where you can query right for different type of agents and hand handover is

happening according to the what agents is working what so I'll demonstrate okay what agents we have So for example how many we have so in this operation layer there is there

hello world is just for testing purpose otherwise we have a customer support we have a finance reporting we have now SOPs so now I'll do any query right related to for example if I do something

related to finance so it will hand off to finance agent and it will show up the example I'm showing what is the manpower cost for software development now there are

two things so now it's delegating to the finance reporting because I am curing related to uh meanwhile I'll actually give you the further for example it is working now

and it will give you the okay what is the manpower cost for software development uh based on that let's say if I see okay to support the software development okay what what are the

customer locations we have so that it it is going to hand over to the customer agent Okay, let's write. Okay. Okay. What are the customer locations we

have now? Now it is handing over to the customer support agent. It will query and it will give you okay what are the support locations we have.

Yeah. For example, okay. What are the SOPs we have right to support the IT? What are the SOPs we have? I want to buy monitor. So is it

or looks like Thank you. Who would volunteer to go next? Lakshmi.

Okay. I would like my team to come here. Please. Please come. Okay. Hi everyone. So we are team AIX and the solution that we have built.

It's going to increase the profit margin of ICL and reduce their operating costs. So meet our uh voice agent uh Aura. She's going to help um customers in their booking and their uh like

completing their booking queries. Yeah. So we have uh &gt;&gt; Okay. So the coming up. I was wondering something about

It was a technical issue. Check this special offers. Check special offers. [laughter] &gt;&gt; No, no. The moment you ask offers the

call was disconnected. [laughter] &gt;&gt; I see your point to be noted. &gt;&gt; But we tested it there and offers were there. Now because of you know complimentary breakfast.

&gt;&gt; Yes. February. Question. &gt;&gt; Insufficient amenities. I would like to have a

&gt;&gt; maybe some network issues. So we will help you with booking some other time. Guys that was group AI excellence. Next one to go is Yeah. Hello everyone. Good evening. So

you know we are a big hotel group like NAS right and we have this u problem statement. We we we we are facing some problems with the uh with the human agents, right? uh customer calls and

customer calls for the and uh I mean most of the time in fact customer go to our websites and book the do the booking while doing the booking sometimes they they don't put the card details and they

did not check out right sometimes they check out and it means in in both of that uh times the that uh booking does not go through so we need to create exactly an replica of the human aents

Right? Which should assist the customer exactly like human agent like ask the where the what is the name and all confirm first details if the valid customer genuine customer then provide

the uh uh payment link or whatever is they wants right if not then probably ask that that tell the customer that human agents I mean representative will call you back so for that use case we

have created this voice agent right so we will give you the demo for that Thank you. &gt;&gt; We are using the same aura the last our voice agent testing agent we have we

have given them five details uh basic details name mobile number date of booking and number of guests that are so now I'm going Sure. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it's9971

62 63 Hotel Mumbai. Correct. It's 22nd February. 24th

phone number. Okay. Yes. Sure. Sure. Thank you. So thank you. So this was the smooth

payment that should happen. But the alternative thing was if the user did not reply in any of the details then they would say that custom care representative will call and you can add

more comp complexity to these things. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. Thank you. That was team the correct. Oh yeah yeah yeah.

We we'll we'll vote accordingly later. &gt;&gt; We have the group chameleas. Yeah. Yeah. Coming in. Uh hi everyone myself Kapul Sharma and I represent uh the team Chamilia here. Uh

first of all I would like to uh give you a brief about the use case uh that we are targeting here. uh Tata Motors being kind of a major contributor uh in the Indian market. Uh you know there are a

lot of uh customers who are kind of uh lending up to the Tata Motors page and looking for uh different car models and they do the queries uh they find options but at times they

do not like go through uh the whole process and the queries are dropped. So these are the uh unfinished or I say unattended uh leads which have not converted into sales but it's a gold

data that you can say uh because every customer is unique and every customer is important for the business. So we are kind of targeting uh those users with the help of uh a chat bot uh which is

called Priya here and this chat bot would kind of uh connect to the user based on the search he she has made on the website and ask uh you know uh questions to probe more information and

interest and give recommendations. So this is uh what we have and my colleague uh Swati would uh give you the demo of the chatbot here. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So we filled a form and a call is

initiated on my number. Thank you for your interest. &gt;&gt; Hi Pria, I am looking for a car for my office. Do you think this is a good choice?

&gt;&gt; Thank you for sharing that. The Diago is an excellent choice for office, especially with it 1.2 L petrol engine, smooth 5-speed manual transmission, and impressive mileage of around 20 to 22

Diago XM petrol is now scheduled for Saturday 22nd February at 10 a.m. at the Tata dealership in Noa. You'll receive a confirmation SMS shortly with the address and dealer contact. The expert

will be ready to walk you through the features and let you explain. &gt;&gt; Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; Thank you everyone.

&gt;&gt; Thank you for this. Uh we have two teams left. Team Jaguar and uh Team Jaguar and Tata Harrier. Uh which one of you want to go first?

Jaguar. Jaguar. You want to go first? Finish with the bang. Maybe they coming. Hello everyitial person who are looking for some initial

is not up to the part. So over the time definitely when I go through this I realized there are some set of questions which should be asked at the very initial level and we prepared the set of

them. &gt;&gt; Greetings your virtual assistant that will help you before that I need some information.

This will take daily. &gt;&gt; What is your daily? &gt;&gt; What is your budget for the car? How many

&gt;&gt; especially the height when you plan to pass the city or &gt;&gt; what is your preference? &gt;&gt; Do you prefer a manual or automatic

transmission? What is your color? &gt;&gt; Do you want to keep the car for the long? &gt;&gt; Thank you.

Last but not the least, team Jaguar. Thank you. [clears throat] Hello friends, the objective why we did this project was in an organization as you understand

there are silos available. There are people who possibly are doing their job in silos and if there is somebody who wants an information about his own activity possibly sometimes and possibly

knowing what others are doing we get lost in the process. So we have tried to create a space here where it gives you a deep dive into number one what others are doing and how we have to do it

possibly and secondly we have also tried to act uh in a manner that you know the bot gives you emotional support. Sometimes in life we also feel that you know uh we only talk about AI which

solves your operational problems. Here we are also going to see that a little bit of cognitive element has been introduced and the emotional support sometimes you require in case of a

heartbroken or heartburn. This bot will also give you so is a buddy in the arm not only a bot. So we start with hello and we get the answer.

Now the point is if you look at it for example there is so much work it has to do and the job itself has got multiple problems coming in. Somebody has to do a uh some outage has happened in networks

or a database has to be restored. So we have created a bot which tells you information that if this is a problem how to solve it. Let us say give me an SOP for

database restoration. So this will actually aid into the knowledge base of the person concerned. Plus his productivity will increase. He

knows what he's going to solve and how he's going to solve rather than trying. You know one one basic thing which we notice in industry is that you know when people come to your place and try to

solve problems they will take too much time. They are not in a position to understand what needs to be done. So, so this is where this whole agent will give that

SOP for No problem. The seems the bot is not in a mood to work. It wants other to work first. There's a distinction between what is AI

and what is I. The A has got confused. The I is not. So let us see there's a person who wants to learn what is an IAN wide area connectivity. So

So this is what it shows on an IN you know it just takes you through the entire architecture what an IAN is what it solves. And lastly for people sometimes you feel

very low. So &gt;&gt; do you have a SOP for system slow broken heart? Do you have a SOP for broken heart?

&gt;&gt; Cognitive capabilities of the AI. Oh, I don't know. It was running there. It is not running here. Seems the AI has got boundaries where it runs.

If you look at all the all the answers out, I mean we were able to get all of these answers there. But I don't know why not here. &gt;&gt; Sabotage other teams. Look all the

answers are there &gt;&gt; but it doesn't work here. Your AI has got confused not working.
