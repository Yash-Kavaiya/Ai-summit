## 📝 Transcript

Can I request uh Mr. Sil Gupta chairing our DC council uh to please moderate the session? Sir, over to you. &gt;&gt; Good afternoon. &gt;&gt; Good afternoon everybody. Can I just

request somebody to close the door? Is there a lot of noise around? Uh so before we start the session, can I request all to for a group photograph? Okay.

Good afternoon. I think um energy is palpable for two years to just just I was there in the previous panel I was speaking that just two years back we all were

just figuring out what to do you know US has moved so far ahead China has moved so far ahead many many countries who are much smaller than India have uh have moved so far ahead we are uh 1.4 4

billion people 1 billion people carrying smartphones consuming technology like day-to-day the way we eat and drink you know that's how we consume technology but in AI we are nowhere there so in

last two years you have seen such a huge huge developments in India of course supported by various factors including intervention by government across the entire value stack of AI you know

whether it is uh getting chips in India whether it is building clouds in India compute capacity whether it is uh you know creating data sets, collecting data sets into marketplaces, building models

in India, building use case and applications in India. India has obviously been the leader in applied part of the technology all the way. So lots have happened in the last two years

and the real question which we are asking and that is by the way is the also topic of this whole summit called impact summit. Bletchley was talking about safety, risk avoidance. Then of

course Paris was also talking on the same topic governance regulation but India said let's talk about the applied part of this technology right how do we use this technology to benefit masses

because the real test case litmus test of any technology is beyond all the jarens and all the complexities is is this technology going to benefit the masses and we have the example like UPI

and the whole DPS tag to to actually pave the way for us in adoption of AI also B2B We still see pilot stages, lots of pilots going on, lots of PC's going on, but are we getting into production

and the real topic of this panel discussion is that business-led AI inclusion from pilots to production to real impact whether it is in B2B space, whether it

is in B2C space or whether it is in G2C space across board how do we lead a adoption of AI at a mass scale. So on this panel you will see practitioners who actually are working on across the

whole value layer of AI. There are people like I can see Mandar here representing hyperscalers. We have got uh uh ATC and a gaming company representing here. We have got uh you

know the the the the one of the largest digital payment enable in the world Mastercard. We have got uh you know you know acrossboard uh you know representation on this panel. So my

question to start with quickly is from Dr. Chris. Uh Dr. Chris uh Mastercard is using AI [snorts] for uh credit scoring for fraud detection you know and taking it on a

very very large global scale. So according to you how can AIdriven financial uh you can call it uh decision making how it can expand credit access

especially when I'm talking about the in a context of India where um you know you are dealing with so many of people how can AIEL uh

revolution in the payment space take the benefits of that to masses but at the same time make sure that there are no frauds there are no launderings and there are no artifacts other side

effects as well. How do you ensure that? &gt;&gt; Thank you. Uh first of all, I think the the first word that comes to mind being at this conference is scale. Uh it's it's overwhelming the scale of of

interest here. And one of the things there's a quote from our CEO who says if it's not inclusive, it won't scale. And if it doesn't scale, it doesn't matter. And so that's the operating emmo we have

had for quite some time as we've taken things from prototype to actual ROI. So I actually lead a team of data scientists globally. About half of them are actually based here in Gam. So it's

it's something we've been involved with at Mastercard for decades. It's not actually so new to us and we find great talent here. So I want to say that uh that's the AI garage that Nintendo

leads. What when we when we go to make an offering the key things that really make that happen are security by design, consent as a feature and interoperability.

So what do I mean by each of those? Security by design is something that gets covered like by a combination of account aggregators and DPDP where you have some oversight and ability to hold

data. who can hold the data for how long and for what purpose and is it redressible. All those things make that a key enabler for for getting trust in sharing data. So that's security by

design. The second thing is consent as a feature and I say that as a data scientist what we mean by a feature is something that actually can be used in a model to make it better. Right? So when

we get that consent because we've set up the right security by design, then we can actually create a model with better data. That's how you go from thin file to actually something more actionable,

right? Where you know if you've opted in to share commerce signals that show some indication of business activity, that's a better proxy for whether you're be able to have a loan than it is you know

based on the historical thin thin file challenges that we face here. Um and then the third thing is interoperability and master Mastercard is a standardsbased company where when we

when we set up these standards that makes everything interoperable. That means that the smallest players can be involved. It's not just a pointto-point with the bigger players. You actually

get everyone on board. So the the rails themselves carry the insights, carry the data so that we can actually have these insights and and create models that will actually make better predictions about

creditworthiness and then um I could so I could go on all all day. Is that is that a good &gt;&gt; So no uh thanks uh uh Dr. Chris uh essentially security by design and

interoperability by design scale will come automatically. Uh let me come to uh Mandar. Mandar you are representing one of the largest hypers scale cloud operators and uh your company is in

India for ages uh delivering tools like Windows and MS office and everything which you use on a day-to-day basis. You know our life runs on your company. So now when your company is scaling very

big through your Azure AI initiatives and you are scaling it to the remotest corners of the country, you are taking it to startups, you are taking it tomemes. My question to you is regarding

when you take it to production cases inmemes, how are you ensuring compliance and safety and security? Because if that is not there, nothing will succeed. How are you planning to do that? How are you

doing that as a company? &gt;&gt; Right. Thank you Sil uh for the question and for inviting for the panel to such. Um so I think Microsoft is rooted on three main principles. First we uh

started two years back something called a secure future initiative that is a groundup engineering initi initiative where we are rearchiting the entire security fabric for AI. Uh and Dr. Chris

took one word out of that secure by design. We do it secure by design uh secure by default and secure in operations. So we are looking at security to be embedded as a part of

every life cycle of software development service and all that. So that's a passive initiative that we are doing but along with that that was more of a Microsoft initiative. what how we make

our services more secure, how we make our software more more secure but along the lines what we realize is that we need to provide that kind of guidance that kind of tooling to our customers

especially in the age of AI. So what we started earlier was something called as responsible AI. uh way back even before the generative AI revolution uh our CEO Satyan wrote a paper in 2014 in how do

we develop AI responsibly since then we have been working on uh making it more clear so it's what started as a framework uh has got much more deeper now so it has got tools it has got uh

standards it has got dashboards all of that and all of that is open source so if you go to responsible AI search for that on GitHub. You can basically get the entire toolbox. For example, if you

want to understand model safety, if you want to understand uh or implement some of the content safety, right? If you want to put some guard rails, all of that or if you want to understand uh

what's the outcome of your application from safety, security, uh all of that perspective, all of that is available as an opensource. So responsible AI is a complete framework from how do you

develop artificial intelligence how do you adopt it how do you govern it that is something that we have done right that's the second thing that we have done and third and probably most

important and relevant formemes right is what we do there right we believe AI will only grow and you use keep couple of keywords uh adoption or scale that diffusion will only happen when it's

done for something which is very very relevant to It will happen two ways using some of our product and tools. When I say ours, not only Microsoft but lot of companies

that are here on the panel. But a lot of that will happen when there are theme specific applications which are developed at by our ISV partners because we will we are essentially a platform

company will offer that platform. But there are going to be hundreds and millions ofmemes in India who will have unique requirement uh that we may or may not be able to anticipate. We may or may

not be fulfill or customize it for the what they need. That's where our ISV ecosystem comes into picture. So what we are enabling is essentially a whole lot of AI application development by Indian

startups fulfilling specific needs of Indian SMBs. In fact, the pavilion that we have here is showcasing all our ISV solutions. We're not showcasing Microsoft product as such right and so

your team is also uh showcasing sovereign AI solution there. But essentially what we are saying is that those solutions India's problem will need solutions from Indian startups

Indian ISVS and our jobs to enable our job is to enable that. That's the approach we are taking to really ensure diffusion and empowering that with security.

&gt;&gt; Thank you Madar. So scaled infrastructure orchestration layers to make the life easy and then ISV ecosystem to deploy it deep into the millions and millions ofmemes. Thank

you. uh if there is one company in India which is making waves and who sort of figured out how to apply AI on real world scenarios and they were a big data

science company before they obviously started applying the same principles on AI is fractal they're in the market uh so my question sep you is and I'm sure this is something you're doing day in

and day out but in front of this audience you have to ask a question if you have to consult a theme CEO and he asked a question. I'm you know listening about this AI AI AI everywhere

but I'm a theme I have got certain tools right which are automating my operations if I have to pick up any one thing for have a quick win to have fastest returns right what should I do so sep you

&gt;&gt; thank you I think great question first I'll tell the uh theme CEO that you know you are in a much better position than the CEO of a very large enterprise because you have much less baggage you

know in terms of technology debt, tech debt, in terms of you know complicated structures in terms in terms of organizational friction. So you first of all don't think of that as a something

that you're not starting off I think you're starting off with a great advantage and you have much more flexibility to do things with AI. So AI is an opportunity to leapfrog. Second

thing that I'll tell them is not to use technology for technology sake sake and that's the biggest mistake right I want to do something with genai or I want to be able to say I did something with AI

these are all tools and tools are always used to solve a problem so first identify which are your biggest problems what is going to give you the either it is the biggest problem in your business

right now or it's going to give you the biggest lift in your business and I think it'll depend on the nature of uh theme the applications of AI today in a combination I And I know we all talk

about geni but I'll say that in a combination of genai and traditional a IML and deep learning and everything together the the the applications are across the value chain of any

enterprise. So if I were to pick something I think one of the biggest things always is how well do I handle my customers and I think in terms of removing the friction from the customer

engagement cycle AI can play a beautiful role and I don't mean it so much as I will put a voice bot and it'll talk to my customers. In fact, I would put that the last because that can while while AI

can scale advantages, it can also scale mistakes. So, I would put that as the last. But in understanding my customers needs better. If a customer is reaching out to me, being able to anticipate why

would they be reaching out and can I have a solution ready? Can I use AI and machine learning in that? That's one kind of an example. If I look at internal processes today, the

opportunity using AI tools is that all kinds of knowledge that you've built in the organization over years is now available to you at fingertips because you can now tap into all the sources of

dark knowledge in your organization. You know, emails, voice calls, if you've recorded uh PDF documents, etc. So, you actually have access to signals that you never had in your business. So if you

just take it into I I'll I mean while it is not for an SME if I take it for one of the clients that we are working with where we are helping them look at can you replace your usual new product uh uh

introduction process which it they used to do physically. They would actually take a product create a you know small batch take it into a few stores test it out and that takes 90 days and they're

in the fashion industry by the way 90 days the fashion may be over. So you're actually missing the train if you do it in the traditional way. Can you now do this using a lot of data? Can you listen

in? Can you collect the data? Can you simulate and then cut the cycle down to two weeks so that if this is the right product to launch, you actually start earning from it rather than waiting for

it. So I think the opportunities are galore but it has to be starting from where is my biggest uh problem and how do I solve it backwards. &gt;&gt; Thanks. Um I think your net message is

that so many time we are starting with constraints. I try to solve a problem but I start thinking what all constraints I have. I don't have data. Even if I data I don't have access to

it's in silos. So what will I do? So better let the business go as it's going. So what Sep is saying instead of getting just too much zested up or complex or confused by this technologies

and all the jargon which people like us keep on putting it. Just think of your regular business problem which you want to solve and then come to practitioners like fractal who will actually tell you

and guide you what you already have in terms of your data which is lying in your company itself and then they will start building solutions for you for the problem which you are facing in your

business. Thanks Adep. So Manoj coming to you. Manoj represents uh largest or one of the largest data center company in the world Equinix and they have data centers across the world. In India they

are hugely successful you know supporting so many enterprises. So Maro my question to you that AI is required across the world. You might not be able to create center of

excellence everywhere but it the benefits are required everywhere and you will have to definitely take these compute centers the data centers in as many parts as possible. So how important

it is to have data centers as close to the user as possible whether you are talking in the geographical context of putting data center in different countries because sovereignity angle

also comes in or whether you're calling in the context of India where sovereignity angle is not there if your data center is there in India but you also need to possibly take data centers

to let's say tier 2 cities or tier three cities because a proximity and the latency angle also starts coming in for a very very latency specific applications right so manoj what is your

take on this? &gt;&gt; Well, first thanks for the question and uh good evening everyone. Well, let's first focus on what is the problem that we are trying to solve and we are saying

that AI is going to make life better for most of us. That should be the focus that is it that AI service is available at at a jar hunt where a bunch of developers are using your platform to

develop a agent which serves the community over there or there is a school over there where the teachers are not available and we are using AI platforms where students can interact

with the platform and then have a class as if a teacher is present over there or a medical uh uh hospital does not have a doctor or a cable doctor and we are using AI to ensure that the uh the

patients get the right uh uh uh treatment and that is what is most important. Now for that all that we need is very high and good quality of internet. As long as we have good

internet with good latency the resources whether is data center or the compute frankly speaking can be anywhere. But it's very well known that a video conferencing where you're interacting

with a AI agent is nothing but a video conference. you say something and the other person responds to you can be handled can handle a way of 200 milliseconds of delay and 200 millconds

of delay actually anywhere in the country you have or even in Singapore also you can serve this uh uh community over here. So we should not get hung up with uh where the resources are as long

as the services that you want to offer is being uh provided properly efficiently over the resources that are available. Now the advantage that we have today is that some of the resources

which uh Sunil's company provides the compute it's on a tap you can take it from wherever it's available you can take it from wherever it's cheaper if something is cheaper in Dubai or

something is somewhere else maybe a developer can use that resource to provide services here in India so I believe uh that should be the focus we should ensure that the internet is uh

very good we have companies like Equinex is enabling some of these AI inferencing at low latency See we ensure that a multi cloud platforms are enabled where data is even if you want to have

sovereign data your data should be under your own control on your own device we can place it adjacent to the cloud such that it is within 1 millisecond delay and you get a feeling as to the data is

inside the cloud but actually it's not inside the cloud and hence you meet all the regulatory requirement that you data should be on your control not on somebody else control. So we have all

these solutions provided by companies like Equinex which will reduce latency, bring down cost of operation and help uh to make uh AI services ubiquitous and that's where I think uh there could be

some services which are very latency uh intensive uh that we have to find a solution. Problem is that data centers are not viable if the capacity is less than 20 megawatt. So if you build some

small data centers and they are very expensive that increases the cost of operation and that actually defeats the whole purpose and the same thing is with your computes also if you build small

small computes bringing them redundancy and all those things at all these multiple locations would be very difficult. So I think that's what my take is. No uh thanks Manoj and thanks

for clarifying on this matter because so many times we keep on hearing about edge data center but the even the sheer economics of that does not work out and the end purpose which we want to achieve

of taking this technology to masses at the lowest possible cost that purpose itself get defeated. So if you're able to cover the whole of India within 10 millisecond of latency for almost

majority of the applications that is fantastic right now by the way we all are accessing AI while the AI is sitting in US. So if you can handle 250 millcond of latency, I'm sure you can handle that

within India. Even if the data center compute hubs are only in some of the locations as well. So Dr. Stubi coming to you. Uh you are representing a huge AT tech company. You have been into

corporate affairs and regulatory affairs for long. So let me ask you a question. Uh see India's experience of adopting technology and taking it to mass scale. uh you know we have a track record

implementing the whole digital public infrastructure stack implementing UPI taking it to masses putting all the right controls uh and the way we have seen a UPI after

implementing in India we have been able to take it to more than 40 countries and in general the way we are as a society as a polity are like okay sabka sa subka vikas you know vasuv kum that everybody

should be P is India in the position to take this AIE development in a inclusive framework where we are not only taking the benefits to the masses in India but also

to global south and to a larger global community. What is your take on that? &gt;&gt; Thank you so much and so thank you for also saving the best for the last. I want to go back to

something that you started with Sunil Gi. India is not a lagard when it comes to AI and I want to show you something. This is what the phone looked like before we happened to the phone. It's an

Android device. Each time you press the power button, it serves content and this is served across 18 categories. It's about AI. It will tell you that a new toolkit for farmers in Meat in

Chhatarpur in Bhar is being launched and this gets served on 550 million mobile devices. We did it in India. We did it from India. We are making in India for the world and that's real inclusion. Uh

the topic that we're discussing today and you talked about UPI at scale. So in 2014 something magical happened. We decided to launch digital India and it wasn't just a mission mode statement.

We decided to put the infrastructure together and connect 250,000 village panchayad 600,000 villages under bharatnut. We also put together the giant tinity jandhan mobile or Aadhaaru.

Inobi is India's first unicorn. We became a unicorn in 2011 when this was not a buzzword. It was not fashionable. We are also the first investment that softbank made in India. We work very

closely with Microsoft and Bing. There are our partners. We work very closely with Google. The word that we need to take away today is collaboration and co-creation. We are competing with the

world but we're also today in a place where we are not aping from western models. So the west will always solve for very evolved constructs around privacy where for us as well privacy by

design is a given it's a take but we no longer see this as compliance burdens. So when India decided to solves for 1.4 4 billion people. We build products for use case. We build products at

population scale. So, Inobi became uh one of the world's largest independent ad tech companies. And what is it that we can do for businesses? That's where the lesson is. Everybody's adoption

journey in AI is going to be very different. There's going to be no blanket one-sizefits-all solution. We went to UP and all elected MLAs sat for two and a half hours. government there's

they're very keen on working with businesses and that's where the India mission because we discussing this at the India impact summit it's very open for the first time at 280 rupees per

hour you're getting access to compute the world is looking at that model because nobody's ever done that they've already procured 3,800 GPUs so what is it that makes AI special what is it that

makes this relevant because aso's hosting this we representmemes small businesses you have very very rich data and using AI can tell you when it's the right time to change the nuts and bolts

the productivity cycles are changing if you look at belts which are very very clear in Kashipur the farming cycles are changing they are now looking at gen AI tools and they're not just using them

they're determining market prices so what is InMobi doing we're working with Mastercard. Our partners are the AI garage. Our partners are Tata Suns and they've created an amazing thing called

the MSME toolkit which they're giving away for free. We're doing workshops across the country and the two things which are very important when we're trying to unlock trade between US India

between any other country under the US India CF forum under Puj's leadership it is do we do great recordkeeping are we financially able can we look at new tools which can be collaterals which

give you more access to credit and second most important do not look at privacy do not look at cyber hygiene and cyber security as burdens adoption of AI is going to happen. It's

no longer a choice because if we don't do that, we're leaving 11,000 billion US dollars on the table. It's now larger than the combined GDP of India and China. It's no longer a choice. But how

are you going to do it in manufacturing? How are you going to do it in education, remedial education, how is it that an enterprise solution will look at AI is now going to be a policy overlap. And

the last thing that I want to leave you with is companies are no longer competing with each other. Countries are competing with each other. So we have to make sure that we're behind this

ambition of the India mission. We are going to work with the government. ASOuch will make sure that sectoral committees work and unlock this for you so that every single sector whether it's

healthcare, agriculture, adtech, businesses, e-commerce, they're able to harness this amazing tool called AI. So jobs are not going to get lost. they will get transformed from 70 million

jobs being transformed to 110 million new jobs being created. So I'm very very optimistic. Thank you once again for the opportunity. &gt;&gt; Thank you Dr. Ruby. And uh uh fantastic.

I think the claps are just just saying everything. So uh because now we just uh have uh four minutes left. So I will just request all the speakers to have their one thought on a specific topic

and I'll just request them to limit it to one minute each. So Dr. uh Chris starting with you. AI for all. The benefit of AI for all becomes real when you have stakeholders

like students, you have stakeholders like businessmen, you have stakeholders like banks, you have stakeholders like farmers, agriculturalists, scientists, everybody, everybody,

nobody's looking at as a great technology. Wow, we have created something. Nobody is impressed with jargon. Everybody is trying to take some benefit out of that. So according to you

when will AI become real for the real masses? &gt;&gt; For me AI becomes real when it scales on trusted rails that we bring about inclusivity through those design

principles security by design, consent as a feature and interoperability. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Yeah, same question to maybe we can go SEP. Yeah. So I think uh AI becomes real when the power that it has

to really democratize uh the access to real intelligence is available to every person regardless of level of education regard regardless of the language they speak the

regardless of their economic uh straighta regardless of their social straighta I think that's the power of AI and once that is realized I think it becomes real

&gt;&gt; thank you uh I think the mantras as are adoption to do not leave anyone behind and adoption at scale so that there's equity represent people who are not in the room today build your own table

don't be on the menu be at the table thank you &gt;&gt; I think diffusion and adoption when uh AI is touching everybody's life and it's making a measurable significant impact

on how do they how do they do things how is it improving their life so diffusion and impact will determine And AI is real. &gt;&gt; For me, AI for all really becomes uh

meaningful if it starts consuming much lesser computer resources, much lesser power, much lesser water and becomes sustainable and also in some way becomes net job creative.

Thank you. And I think we are lucky to have uh Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's why I'm saying going coming to the big man. So we are lucky to have uh the chief of IBM and the chairman of the SOM AI task

force Mr. Sandep Patel with us. So Sep why don't you give us a keynote address sharing your thoughts on the subject. &gt;&gt; Actually uh I think it's just we've just got a minute left so I don't want to uh

hold up but I think I'll just make a few points. I think to your point about AI for all um I think there are three dimensions which uh we should really think about. Number one, I think for AI

to be relevant for all, I've been talking about actually most of the day today I've been talking about this notion about how can we move from being AI consumers to becoming AI

architects. AI architects in how we think about use cases, how we think about diffusion of AI to the masses as well as through to MSMES. And to do that what becomes really important is how do

we make it more affordable. So it's not just about you know compute power and and others but the relevance of small language models that are more fit for purpose that can be democratized and put

in the hands of developers to really drive innovation which becomes a lot more open-source in nature. I think becomes becomes very very relevant and all of these if if all of these elements

come together I think where we can define use cases that make AI real not just for large enterprises but also for small enterprises and consumers that is sort of where where we have to bring

this technology because right now I think there's a lot of talk but if it doesn't scale at the right level and to scale it, we will need skills. We will need the right um cost components of it

to make it affordable and we will need to have it a lot more democratized where innovation is being sustained across a larger platform of developers and researchers to make it real. So I'll

leave it at that. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you G. Sorry I didn't notice that you you came late. So &gt;&gt; no no that's okay. We the navigation here was quite

&gt;&gt; yeah I think we all are rushing. So that brings us to the end of this panel. I just hope that you all liked and you benefited from the views of all the panelists. Thank you so much.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you all. Can I request all the panelists for one more photograph please? Can I request Karavan Secretary General to please join for the photograph?
