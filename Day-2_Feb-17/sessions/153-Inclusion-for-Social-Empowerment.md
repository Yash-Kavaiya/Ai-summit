## 📝 Transcript

ation. One, a gap between equitable access to AI resources. Second, a fragmentation in approach to handling AI and that will definitely call for the next wave of diplomacy that will be AI

diplomacy. Now, that may include the infrastructure diplomacy, sovereignity and whatnot. In terms of creating the ecosystem for companies to operate, how do you see this AI diplomacy leading to

a governance framework which will speak the language of developing nations? One, second, India's unique model of uh the the sovereignty and and open innovation. How do you see we can position for all

of us to have an access to market that no one has seen before? &gt;&gt; Thank you. So uh it's a very uh pertinent question particularly [snorts] in the times we are in uh as you know

when we talk about AI diplomacy I think AI governance becomes the center of it and the AI governance if you look at is so fragmented as you said and the developing countries particularly the

global south is not finding a place in that that is something unless we have them on the board I think you can talk of any sort of AI governance or so it is not going to serve the purpose you know.

So we need to look at particularly how can we include you know the countries of global south and particularly the citizens of global south in the AI governance framework. So to my mind I

think uh the first thing which we need to do is uh perhaps look at uh uh a framework where uh the countries of global south also get representation. you know as of now if you look at

various uh you know forums where talks about AI governance is happening uh global south is not much represented and that is something which is creating some sort of uh fragmentation in the

sense that uh their voices are not heard uh there also I think uh developing must be developing nations I think should be the co-creator of all uh architects of the standards uh on data governance,

algorithm, uh accountability, safety and crossber data flow. I think if they are not finding the place in that I think that's not going to have a global governance as to say. So I think that is

something very important uh to look at. We need to provide uh a place for developing countries to be in in the discussions where these such discuss discussions are happening. I think uh uh

recently in the scientific panel certain developing countries have found place the UN which has been uh created by the UN recently. So that is a start perhaps we need to look at more and more of

this. This summit particularly is very important because this is a summit which is happening for the first time in a global south country and uh I think this summit would provide a lot of

opportunities for the global south to get into the governance frameworks and the discussions which we are having now you know the sutras uh which we have planned people uh and progress and also

the seven chakras they would provide the framework to go ahead uh you know in in in in the AI governance uh sphere. Uh another thing I think uh I want to uh emphasize is that uh uh AI governance

must also be developmentcentric. You know it cannot be only the risk uh which needs to be taken into consideration when we talk of AI governance. Uh you know the global south has its own

problems of and we need to resolve those problems at population scale. for example, healthcare, education, these are the things where AI is going to make a difference and it we don't have that

in the governance framework. I think uh uh focusing only on the risk is not going to help much. Uh third thing I want to uh I think mention here is that trust must be built uh through

interoperable framework. So I think uh I was having a discussion yesterday and a very good term which came in the discussion was that we should have a globally interoperable framework and

locally adaptable uh framework. I think that is very important. Uh the framework which we are creating for AI governance should have the local context that is very important. we should be uh you know

looking at particularly the problems the issues you know the the specific contexts in which the frameworks are going to operate. So some of these uh I think are important when we talk about

uh uh you know AI diplomacy for AI uh global AI governance. So that is I think we need to look at you talked about uh how India's model offers a credible template in that. I think you also

mentioned about the DPI which is I think an uh open-source model which we have created for the world. We have given it to others also. So I think that is perhaps we can it is also it has also

created lot of you know this is a model which perhaps at the same time it's an open but it's also created lot of trust among the people. So that is something which we need to look at uh as we go

forward. So India's model provide a uh a kind of a template to global south to go forward on this and we we will be very happy to assist in this direction uh to whosoever wants to take it from us. We

are already doing some work on AI diplomacy or you can say the digital diplomacy. So that is something which we look forward to continue in terms. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. I think two two very

important takeaways. One you said uh we don't need to fix uh our attention only on risk. We need to look at the scale and the opportunity and your other point on a globally interoperable framework

which is locally adoptable. The day that happens then we are all in for a treat in the for a for a dinner and we are done. I think we are we are then on the track. So that brings me to a very

important on scale to you Punit on scaling. Now you have been uh Microsoft has been uh part working with the India on laying the digital foundation of digital India and now also the digitally

intelligent India. Now from your perspective uh you know how do you see this transition from these pilots large scale AI pilots to impact driven business models which will have a direct

relevance and serving the needs of next billion including thememes and the rural India. What's your what's your vision and how do you see we can do that? First of all, I just want to emphasize what

sir said, right, which is I think India's got a terrific opportunity to set the template for population scale AI impact and for the global south and for the world. So a plus one to what you

said, sir. I think to your question, I think India's well moved ahead, moved beyond pilots. I 2024 and a little bit of 2025 was pilots. A customer of mine was joking with me, I have more pilots

than Lufansza in my organization. That those days are over. I think that's gone. Now we're talking about scale, right? Be it financial services, Bajage Finance. If you look at healthcare,

Apollo hospitals building clinician co-pilots, doctors using co-pilots, lawyers using co-pilots, the government, Ministry of Labor is building which is an AIdriven platform for 300 million

unorganized workers in this country. They're using AI to build CVS and do mock interviews. So, it's happening at scale. I think the recipe is also evolving. Uh, I think there are two or

three things that people companies or businesses or or public sector enterprises who are getting this right are doing. First is a real top- down ambition, right? You have to like the

leadership has to take charge. This is the time to be courageous and be bold on AI bets and and I see companies where the CEOs, the boards, the top leadership taking charge and setting a top down

goal do much better. Second, I think there's a lot of hobby projects going on, AI washing. Uh stop all of that stuff. Really focus on ROI for yourself and for your customers, be it topline or

bottom line, be it customer experience experience, be it employees, be it building new things. And then finally, the last thing is killing, right? Every customer I meet, I ask them, "How many

people are you skiing in AI?" Whatever number they give me, I add a zero behind it. I say even that is not enough. Like everybody has to be scaled, right? Because if people are not skilled,

people don't know how to think with AI, how to build with AI, how to get AI to work like a teammate, none of what I've said will work, right? So those three things, top down emission, real focus on

ROI and use cases, and then scaling and almost just thinking of a cultural renaissance. This is a mindset shift for all of us. I think that's what it'll take to scale.

&gt;&gt; Sure. Thank you so much. I think the difference between the skilling and also on the horizontal capacity building of uh the sectoral workers also and sectoral uh uh you know experts also is

important and that brings um one very important point that is the infrastructure and if I can come to you Shashi uh you know on uh you you have been uh you know enabling the

infrastructure now how do you see uh you know us taking cloud compute infrastructure now as a utility to lower the barrier for enterprise at least formemes uh to scale impactdriven AI

business uh models without the heavy capex that uh has been a hindrance so far. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you for that question and a plus one to both. Uh we are all in

together trying to solve a much bigger opportunity here. Uh there are uh three components and what are we talking about? We are talking about intelligence as a as a utility. That's that's

essentially the summation of AI and the three big components are one you really need a a fantastic model a rich foundational model the model gets richer then it becomes more multimodal then you

have less and less effort and less and less prep within the business within the enterprise to be done if you are working with a super rich model and if you have more multimodal capabilities not just

text but voice video u gestures uh graph graphics whatever then it becomes far more easier to engage and interact with the model. So that's that's the one one big uh uh topic uh can you build those

models make those models available in the country at scale uh u so that it's like renting out a super brain to every business right that's essentially what it is uh the second part of it is uh the

superbrain will work only when you have a phenomenal um uh computing resource and that's points to the hardware within within the within the um um uh deployment. The challenge there usually

is that the this hardware is so powerful that it will consume tons and tons of energy. So you have to plan for it. So how do you make hardware available? And so that's why uh we've been building

tensor processing units for a little over a decade right now. And how do you optimize those to bring make it so super tight that for you can even go back and say this is the price of token to warts

uh that level of telemetry and that level of optimization that is possible and that's what is happening on the hardware side of it. Now having done these two you need to kind of

orchestrate and balance this out to do things at scale and that has got to do with a platform like Vortex and there are many other platforms but then there is something unique here when you do

this orchestration on a single pane of glass and that biggest challenge is you have to give choice to customers you just can't do a one fit model right because customers are in various

businesses they will actually be specialists in their own businesses and want to want these models to work for them in very unique unique manner. So how do you accommodate all of that? How

do you have an open enough platform that allows you a single pane of glass that particular orchestration at scale? So all of these three are are the vital levers of really taking AI down to the

masses and and operating it at nation scale or population scale. Now all of that is all good but then we need something more. One is we need all of this local in the country because you

have to follow the laws of the land and there is a tremendous amount of uh uh paranoia around residency around security around latency of networks. So you need to make those investments in

the country right something that we did and I'm sure many others are also doing uh our announcement points to that particular investment that we are making in the country. Now that's that's one

one another thing and then you need to bring in enough sovereignity and enough security on top of it to make sure that all businesses run safe and uh uh people are not secondguing or or concerned

every time they start engaging or interacting with AI. interesting uh because both uh the the the technological expertise coming globally but at the

same time making it local for adoptation is the message that um uh you know I could get from uh Shashi uh and that uh gives us the next opportunity of moving beyond India and probably offering

services to other uh countries uh who have a similar uh kind of a landscape. Maybe I can come to you Mr. Mr. Rangnut Sadash Shiva so you know as CTO you focus on how of technology you know um

how do you see us now positioning as the primary solutions provider for other emerging economies that have that are facing similar situations uh including the social infrastructure challenges

that we have what what do you think see is the path ahead for all of us in the room &gt;&gt; yeah very interesting if you were Look at what everyone spoke. You know, it

speaks about the diversity that we have in an AI world. There are stacks and stacks of solutions that is available. Your ability to find your own way in amidst all of this is very very

important. And um to say the least, you know, that can change after 3 months, 4 months. So in that context, we're in a very very dynamic world, especially when we're talking of AI. um you can

essentially look at the solutioning capabilities across three or four stacks you know starting from infrastructure models orchestration and and use cases and I would assume that there are a lot

of solutioning that's possible but one thing that's very unique from an India perspective is we have kind of addressed the bottom of the pyramid you know very large scale AI projects which are very

foundational imagine a platform like Aadhaar you know and you're going to book a ticket it has a relevance there you know you kind of pitch into that that kind of database and information.

The solutioning is creation of that kind of a platform that's enabling many other businesses across the board. I think that's where the excellence has come in in the way that we have delivered uh the

solutioning capability and many of you would know that uh for all of these platforms the kind of solutioning tools are very open-source tools you know in the sense that they drive the economy of

scale as well as make it very economical for others. We have to solve for scale here. Uh if somebody asks me to describe the call rates in in in India, I can't do that in USD. Perhaps it's a fraction

of a cent, right? So that's the kind of solutioning that we need to do. So it is in that context that uh we have been able to do a lot of things. Does India have the talent and potential to do

that? I guess we have a lot of it. We just have to streamline that. Uh you know the amount of people in the GCC domain, you would understand and this kind of skill set that they have. If

you're able to harmonize all of those skill sets, we can essentially run an enterprise-l like world from India. So that's the talent that we have today. Uh but as I said, we'll have to figure out

how we will do this solutioning. Uh from an HP standpoint, we have been involved in several such kind of activities and we see that it's slowly but steadily growing across the board. uh and and in

a solutioning like this one thing that uh I I would definitely want to see is the fact that we take everybody inside you know everyone alongside uh rather than doing it for a specific set if if

it is an organization that is implementing AI the AI education should be across the board it can't be for for a set of people right we call it democratizing technology it better be

democratizing across the board so I see the skills being there it's only the will and ability to kind of scale that across across the board that that matters.

&gt;&gt; Interesting. Thank you. U let me come to you uh Sapna. Now a very important topic and area that we want to touch is secure and secure AI and security of AI given the ambition of scaling to the next

billion. that becomes I think the most important thing that uh one would look at and and somehow culturally we are we are we are still very open society when we talk what we should not talk so if

you go by a train you're sitting 5 hours with the next person by the time you get down you know everything about that person so that's our culture uh in terms of so given that uh my question to you

is we often treat security as the final bolt-on that is uh you know the foundational layer as we move to the next billion user, why should we shift to a prevention first secure AI and more

specifically how how should we shift to that? Very happy to hear your views. &gt;&gt; Sure. Thank you Lavnish and good afternoon to all of you. Uh it's a it's a very vivacious uh audience outside as

well as inside hopefully. So coming to um secure AI by design, we talked about a very important word for all the panelists here. Uh it was mentioned one way or the other is trust.

When you're going to democratize an AI based application, you expect billions of people to be banking with you, to be doing credit with you, to be sharing their medical information with this

application which is using AI in the background. You break that trust if the data that they're sharing with you is somehow leaked out because remember for every good person using AI there's also

a threat actor using AI. So first is not breaking that trust. Second doing secure AI by design also ensures economic resilience. We know time and again with many examples day in day out the price

to pay for a breach is much much higher than the price to pay for securing your AI application in the design phase. I'm sure you all would agree. I can see a lot of heads nodding. Excellent. So how

how do we make this happen? That was your question lnish. So let's move first of all from we move from devops to dev sec ops. Let's move from MLOps to ML sec ops. So every phase of an AI application

which is now a living being. It's not client server. It's not a three- tier. It's a living being. It's something which can tomorrow be born as an agent and then die off because the agent has

finished its job. How do you treat this ephemeral thing and how do you ensure it's protected? So from the phase of data injection, ensure the integrity of the data. Remember integrity before

intelligence throughout the phase of developing this AI application. Second, the model learning phase itself. Ensure the integrity of the model is maintained across. And then in runtime when the

actual AI application is interacting with these billion users, ensure that the data they are submitting, the prompts they are submitting cannot be attacking the AI application. So there

is security that has to be ensured runtime. And fourth, a very important pillar when it comes to AI based applications is governance. You have to constantly keep testing every phase as

you build this AI application. The integrity of every phase. So governance, constant governance is imperative as these AI applications become more and more democratized.

&gt;&gt; Thank you so much. And that's what I love about security discussion. All of us nod the hand ahead of VI. You are right. and then after we go out can you check my password on my mobile please I

give it to somebody else if that's how it is done so uh I think one very important point that you raised is this whole shift in thinking but I also want to go to the shift in architecture maybe

uh to you uh as our final panelists uh you know uh subadra what do you what do you see as the architectural shifts uh which are essential to build the AI infrastructure which is reliable secure

and actually real time scalable. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Uh good afternoon everyone and uh you know this is usually the uh aspect that is missed out whenever we are going after something new innovation

big scale etc right it is the fundamental architecture right and that's what I'm going to spend couple of minutes I think we all by now uh truly understand that India is at an

inflection point when it comes to AI right the you just see the energy outside the interest from you know people of all age groups you know uh all different sectors etc uh Now it is on us

to scale this by including everybody. I think if I look at I know we spoke a lot about UPI but that's something so close to all of us as well. It has set a real benchmark for us when it comes to

reliability and at scale right you know the the kind of penetration the number of transactions that we are able to deal uh with UPI is really the benchmark that we need to follow when we look at taking

AI at scale and taking everybody into the journey. Now for that the architecture you know how we do it is very very fundamental right. So let me kind of lay out few key aspects of it

right. The first one is AI has to sit inside the core public systems that we have. I think Punit spoke about moving from pilots to you know actual applications and workloads. If we have

to imagine that in India we are going to touch real people, real systems, lives of our citizens and for that AI cannot be like a separate dashboard or a batch processing that runs differently. It has

to be part of the transactions. I think one of the uh you know demos that you will see is on how you can embed fraud detection when we do UPI transaction because for the scale if we have to deal

UPI frauds post the event we are not going to be able to take it to the next billion right we really need to have it done within that few milliseconds you need now what is the architecture what

is the hardware you have to run it what kind of models I think that that kind of thought process has to happen you know our healthcare our our citizens should not be waiting you know to know the

answer for their claim. It has to happen instantly and AI has the potential for us to enable. The second aspect is I think you know we we hear about this word sovereignity everywhere. Uh India

is uh you know has kind of come up with the DPDP act and you know strengthened the regulations etc. But what is important is we have to realize every workload has its boundaries. There are

some that are going to scale you know probably naturally into cloud. There are some that have to stay within the boundary. So we have to kind of architecturally look at what is the

hybrid approach we need. How are we going to embed compliance into it so that the innovation remains sovereign for us right? So it's not like an afterthought but you're compliant from

day one. The third point I think that swapna touched upon is the governance. Governance is often retrofitted. I don't think we can afford that in this scaling journey. It has to be engineered. you

know what kind of uh trust you are building in your architecture you know are you using the right stack are those compliant in terms of the security requirements I think that's the third

part the last and the you know interesting part we think whenever we say scale we think it's about compute actually in AI one big you know change factor could is the data right meaning

our data is fragmented uh unstructured you know metadata is missing in lot of places and if we use that into AI the weaknesses are going to be you know amplified. So getting the data

architecture and cleaning and using the right data for AI is going to be very very key. So in summary I kind of look at these four aspects of you know embedding the intelligence you know

hybrid for compliance uh governance is inbuilt engineered and make sure that we have the right data modernization strategy that's going to be important for us to not just scale AI but to make

it dependable so that every citizen can actually start leveraging the effect of AI. Thank you. Thank you so much. That was really uh interesting and that has brought right to the end of this panel.

Please join me in giving a big hand to the panelist [applause] for such a diverse uh and comprehensive extensive view of probably what it will

take for us to shift uh from the return on investments to return on impact framework as we as we move forward. uh and I think one thing that if I can end and when I was entering somebody

mentioned hey why don't you give us a couplet so you know this uh one thing that we came out is the uniqueness of India and that's what we say that uh you know so so so you know India India

will we have global models but the way we are building on is our own innovation And that's the way it will scale up going forward adopting everything that is global and all of us are partnering

in this journey and we look forward to partnering with each one of you to make this happen. Next time when we meet we'll be on the next level of AI adoption. See you soon then. Thank you

so much. [applause] &gt;&gt; Uh thank you. Now we have another powerp pack panel uh AI for social inclusion which is divided into two. The first session would be AI for all profit with

purpose converting social challenges into the market into AI markets. Can I request all the speakers to please join me on the dis uh Mr. Claus Newman, Mr. Satend Pal Singh, Mr. Pu Saka, uh Mr.

Kartik Rajaram, Miss Pa Goldman, Mr. Narendra Singh Yadav and Mr. Amit Singh requesting all to please join us on dice. So [clears throat]

welcome welcome to this uh important session uh AI for all profit with into AI markets and I'm so happy that I see still a lot of energy into this room despite we all have been here for the

whole A and got already so much of input. Let me first uh introduce very briefly my co- panelists because we have really to hurry up. So we have Narendra Singh Yadav the chief business officer

of PTM here to my left directly. Next to him uh Paula Goldman uh Paula is chief ethical humane use officer of Salesforce. Welcome. Uh next to um Paula it's Kartik Kartik Rajaram country

manager India for 11 laps. Um and then we have um Amitab Zing if I'm here. No uh sorry [laughter] uh director CTO of IBM research and finally um

sorry you see uh Satinda Paling CTO of AWS in uh India. So with that I would like to just give a few a few uh very brief opening remarks uh on that session. Um I think from my perspective

and I have to say I I lived in India and today I live in China so I I have seen the world from two different poles so to say. Uh but I believe what is really the same is that access to technology and

access to AI is a topic. meanwhile uh across the globe and specifically of course also uh in those two countries and in the global south. Um and uh frugal AI which is a term that also was

uh coined not long ago uh also does not only require the latest hardware infrastructure and software but specifically also access and many people today in the conference also brought the

topic up that 500 million non English speakers in India and two and a half billion people who have not access to internet at Also this is one/ird of our population and the question is of course

from the massive investment we see into software infrastructure data centers in unimaginable amounts of money to those people who have not even internet access. How do we really bridge that gap

in a meaningful way? And I would really like to right away start and probably also then sit down uh with my panelists. This makes the um you see that is the nor that makes the thing a little

easier. Okay. Yeah. And I would like to start with you Paula uh with my first question. And uh first of all maybe you explain to us uh what is um what do you

do and a human AI officer so to say at Salesforce and also what from your point of view are currently the ethical stakes uh that are out there uh in bringing more people and having more people

accessing uh AI today? Yeah, thank you. Uh, thanks for the question and thanks for having me. So, um, so yes, I am Salesforce's first chief ethical and humane use officer and um, while the

title may be hard to repeat 10 times fast, um, uh, I do believe it's a job that is, um, becoming more and more common, which is how do we make sure that, um, we can trust that the AI that

we produce? How do we make sure that our customers are able to rely on it? And that means that um starting from a set of principles and values um we are thinking about both the intended and

unintended consequences of the technology. We're testing it. We're putting in features to make sure that uh that our customers know how to get the right results from it and so on. Um but

to your point about uh this question of like lots and lots more people using AI and AI for everyone. Um this is a very personal question for me. You mentioned you lived in India. I my first job out

of college was in a village in rural Harana at an affordable private school where there was an inter I'm sorry there was a computer lab that wasn't yet hooked up to the internet and um and

those students who are now technology executives there's this massive um uh massive potential for AI to um uh create bright new futures for people and um and part of that is about what I just talked

about which is designing technology that's truly usable and accessible by everyone that people know how to use it and the other part is making sure that um uh we're investing in the people to

understand the technology that they're ready with the technology that they're confident with the technology which is something else that Salesforce is doing. So for example, we have a community of

almost 5 million learners of technology here in in uh in India and and trained 75,000 people last year on AI and I think both sides of those things are necessary to make this an inclusive

transformation. &gt;&gt; Thank you Paula. Thank you very much. And um you spoke a lot about access to AI and and the humane access. Um maybe I come to Narendra um and asking also what

about the data? So do we have sufficient data in that segment of the market and can we transform that data that is available also into meaningful applications and use uh to really help

uh people from from the um yeah from that segment. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So uh 10 [clears throat] years ago when we started uh digital payments there were less than 1 million people

who were able to accept payment digitally. It took us some uh 10 12 years to uh provide this digital payment service to 40 50 million merchant. The interesting change that has happened

with this technology is that generally what happens in new technology that you need to explain you need to make people aware that you should adopt it. This is how it will help. Here the demand is

coming from these small businesses. they are already aware. They already know that how in what kind of different ways it can be meaningful for them. &gt;&gt; Uh you asked about data the there's just

insane amount of data that is already available in large platforms like us where we uh where using which we are able to make meaningful uh applications for these small businesses. We

facilitate digital payment. we are able to very easily give a chief financial officer or chief marketing officer to the small business because we know that which SKU is running out which SKU has

the most demand in that neighborhood but this particular small business does not have that SKU. So there is already a lot of data and that combined with expectation of these small businesses to

get the applications which will change uh uh their lives which will help them grow their business is going to mean that AI is actually going to reach to these 50 million merchant at absolutely

unprecedented scale. &gt;&gt; That's that's impressive I have to say and and congratulations to this journey which you just described. Um now we have um access we spoke about data we also

need to speak about infrastructure of course and I believe uh Mr. Satinda from AWS uh you are obviously a very strong infrastructure provider on this planet. Um what do you really do to enable

smallest business smallcale startups and so on with infrastructure and do you really see your infrastructure reaching every point in the world? Uh I think at at AWS we are disproportionately focused

on ensuring that our technology remains frugal. We provide the best of uh technologies right from India region. We have two fully featured regions one in Mumbai another one in Hyderabad uh

delivering 240 plus services ranging from IoT machine learning to latest AI models. But to coming back to your point on on the topic of the discussion which was frugal AI, if I have to give you my

top three, the first one is if you're building a solution on AI, the notion that one model or one type of model is going to rule it all is a fallacy to begin with. And I think from a tech

standpoint, you have to build your solution to ensure that you are making your model smallest enough that you can drive right kind of performance and right kind of a throughput with the

right kind of cost structure. There cannot be a better example that I can quote than something that we do very closely at Amazon which is rufus. I don't know how many of you have shopped

on Amazon app. You would have used Rufus. Uh I can tell you Rufus is a generative AI shopping assistant. In the last prime day we reported it did almost like 30 million interactions in within

two days. Uh roofers you would be surprised to know is from some of the technical folks in the audience it's int 8 quantized model. What it means is a very very small model and it does a job

and it does a great work at that job. So that's one. The second one is as you're building solutions there are other components to the solution as well not just the model itself.

So whether it's uh rack pipelines, whether it is re-ranking strategy, we've developed services that can scale as your needs are. The third is uh I'll go back to what Paula mentioned. I think

skilling is very very important. So we have to for startups, we provide specific skills in terms of data scientist. We have got uh a program that we call as GI innovation center. So we

can transfer these learnings uh that we had at scale building for customers and for Amazon. uh and till date we have enabled more than 6.2 2 million uh users in India with skills on cloud in general

and AI in specific. &gt;&gt; That's excellent. And um I also didn't know that I mean 2 and a half million is um quite quite a substantial uh upskilling yeah of many many people. Uh

Push I have a question to you. Um I think you work for HCL. I believe uh you do the Google business there, right? So uh it's quite a substantial part I believe of the uh HCL business. Now you

will have of course lots of large clients you are taking care of um but those services you offer there can they also be um transferred yeah to to smaller companies or also um uh in the

area of CSR right so is there an idea how can we enable uh more services uh for the good also from coming from corporate services and making this more accessible also to others

Yeah, absolutely. And I think you know one of the biggest challenges how do we bridge the gap between CSR and uh you know business outcomes and I will just take a quick example in terms of how we

are doing it uh in a sector where this is absolutely necessary is uh agriculture sector right where we are looking at how do we digitalize the complete uh information which is being

collected in the field and uh you know if you look at from the you know farming sector point of view there is so much of variation in terms in terms of temperature, in terms of moisture and

seed storage and supply chain becomes extremely difficult. Uh in fact uh you know telemetry and logistics is another big challenge and also if you uh look at uh because the data is so scattered it

is very difficult to get any insights out of that data right so we are working with a lot of customers in terms of you know how they were doing it manually to transform it into more AIled model uh

getting IoT devices uh to move data to cloud build uh digital platforms s and synthesize this data right and this is how we are enabling uh the end user which is farmers or agriculture

organizations to make use of AI using you know a very frugal uh technology from HCL techch point of view we have number of services which enable this you know we have a data analytics uh service

platform uh you know AI foundry uh which brings in complete data uh analytics we have our own impact act framework. We have responsible AI to make sure uh the services are compliant, secure and

responsible. Uh we also have uh you know u services where we are able to eliminate uh the the operational inefficiencies from the entire value chain right so that's how we are working

in bridging this gap today. &gt;&gt; So from CSR it's becomes a real profitable business also for you. &gt;&gt; Yes absolutely and for our end customers as well. Uh okay that's that's perfect.

Then over to Kartik. Uh Kartik uh is the country manager at 11 Labs. We spoke briefly before we moved into this room. Uh but maybe you can still explain to the audience in three sentences what 11

Labs does and then also tell me about where do you see in language a real opportunity uh here in India maybe also globally then. &gt;&gt; Sure. Thanks. Thanks Claus. Hey uh great

to be here everybody. Just for everybody's uh benefit uh I'll start off with with our mission at Lemon Labs. Our mission at Lemon Labs is is very simple. It is to make information accessible to

everyone in every language, voice and sound, right? And how do we do that? We do that by doing deep research and pushing the frontiers of audio AI solving the very complex audio

intelligence problem. uh and we do that by building foundational models of STDS and kind of building an orchestration on top of it. Right? And we firmly believe and all of us know this uh the most

natural way for humans to interact with humans or humans to interact with technology is voice and especially in the context of talking about getting access and inclusion to the next 500

million. think that voice and given the complexity and the and the linguistic diversity that our country has language boys is the most seamless and most friction-free way of reaching out to

those right and we are starting to see some fantastic use cases across various uh dimensions right from healthcare to scaling to education to uh financial inclusion to a lot of things and at

Freshworks what we're also doing is we are working with a lot of startups. We have a startups grant program about about 500 to,000 startups in India work with us uh in terms of building uh agent

tech experiences and use cases on top of our uh our our infra layer. Right? So we we we very firmly believe that voice is the one that is going to give access in the most seamless in the most

friction-free way to the next 500 million uh in our country. &gt;&gt; Fantastic. I couldn't agree more. Yeah. Uh because uh I come from Europe, it's also a very multilingual environment and

I have to say learning foreign languages was always not my stronghold. Yeah. Uh Amit uh Amit, I have um one question to you, right? Uh I when I moved to India, this is quite a long time ago, opposite

of SAP Labs was uh GE and back then at that time they had this reverse innovation case uh big thing. I think it was Harvard Business Journal or so where it was published and it was all about

this kind of frugal innovation, innovation from the bottom of the pyramid, however you call it. Um what happens in the field of frugal innovation today? What do we really see

as breakthroughs um from yeah frugal innovation or from reverse innovation today? Yeah, I'll put a generative AI lens on it. Uh because for sure. Yeah. And uh uh

you know, Satendra talked about some of it around picking the right model for the right job. &gt;&gt; U but you can go even further and uh in terms of uh if you're talking about

generative AI, you can say that okay, I've got this transform model and I'll keep making it bigger and bigger until I get AGI, right? That's one way to look at it. But when you're thinking about

frugal, you need a different mindset. You need to look at what's the use case, what's my ROI and approach it from that lens. And we see a lot of people looking at it from that lens at different layers

of the stack starting from the hardware, you know, the chip. So if you're only going to do inferencing, do you really need all the power of a GPU? If you're going to you know if the cost to the co

customer is going to be largely driven by inferencing can you optimize the chip for the purpose that it's going to be used and a lot of companies are doing that startups are doing that but then it

also goes to the layer of the the model architecture itself and there's been lot of innovations such as mixture of experts state structured spa state space models and making choices about the

neural network itself if you know that I'm not going going to use this neural network for answering anybody's questions in across the whole world but I'm going to use in these kinds of

domains you can actually optimize it the architecture itself so the neural network doesn't need to have all of those capabilities that you need while still having the expressivity that you

do need another layer where we are seeing a lot of optimization come up is how do you actually program we call it prompting today but I'm deliberately calling it pro programming these models

And in the world of LLMs um you know prompting started from the world where we said okay I'm going to have a model that takes any language in and generates any lang you know language out but if

you look at the world of agents and uh if agents need to not they don't you don't need agents to be writing poetry you need them to be calling tools reasoning about plans and things like

that that is a computational type of a workload rather than a creativity workload. code and there's work happening to actually convert from prompting to programming because once

you get to programming and you have a compiler mindset you can start bringing lot lot of optimizations in the way the model is being used. Uh so at many levels we're seeing these things. I

think ultimately it has to come from the lens of the use case and the ROI to say for this use case how do I optimize end to end to get what I need. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Thank you. Thank you so much. And

uh I think we have really now touched upon many different aspects uh of uh the AI and the affordability I think because ultimately I think it has a lot to do with affordability. I recall last year

when I was um at a conference for um yeah AI for the developing countries uh in Geneva and in that day basically the deepseek model was released. Yeah. And it made a huge impact on that conference

where the majority uh of the participants were actually from uh the global south and they said finally we have an AI we can afford and that I think partially at least this hope also

could be fulfilled by that model. So technology indeed as you said and the way we we deploy it makes a makes a huge difference there. We are really tough in time and I have

to thank this excellent panel to keep exactly the time six panelists in 20 minutes is an absolutely achievement. So maybe if you just one final sentence from each of you if you would have one

wish to let's say either the corporate sector or the government in how to make a more inclusive AI happening what would be that wish and um now I put you first [laughter] and then you just go uh

through here I think with the panelist what would be your wish to that &gt;&gt; I think uh the first uh The ambition uh the thing is that uh ideally we would like uh all small businesses very very

small businesses to be able to get full suite of business services full suite of services through which they can manage their businesses in uh say $1 or $2 a month.

&gt;&gt; Wonderful. So that is very small businesses in very short sentences. Sorry for that. Paula, what is your wish? &gt;&gt; My tagline would be put people at the

center. And so when we're talking about businesses using AI and and learning how to use AI, it's the people that are using it in their day-to-day work that have the best insights for how to use

it. So empower them. &gt;&gt; So empower the people. Great. So Katik, what is your &gt;&gt; I'll I'll talk about it from a from a Y standpoint, right? Uh three things

matter. One is uh quality, latency and cost. We got to optimize for all three. Uh only then it's going to work uh in a country like India. So that's that's what our mission is and that's what we

got to work towards. &gt;&gt; Makes perfect sense. Uh Satindo &gt;&gt; uh I think government is already doing a great job with uh you know events like this and India mission. Uh so I won't

have an ask from the government or a specific advice. The only thing that I'll tell is uh when we talk about generative AI there is a lot of focus on science part of it which is model right.

I think there has to be disproportionate focus on the engineering aspect of it. How do you make your model work as part of a solution? And there's a lot that you need to do there.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. Good. Then Amit. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Kind of similar to Satend there, right? Uh we are developing indigenous models, indigenous GPU infrastructure. I would really like to see us get to a

place where thousands of startups can directly connect to the people and focus on building highquality solutions without getting caught up in how do I tune this model, where do I put the

data, you know, all of that underlying engineering. So we need tools that plug into these sovereign AI technology. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you. And then final last but not least push.

&gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; What's your wish? &gt;&gt; Uh ensure uh responsible and secure AI and in fact enforce right. And the other thing will be uh invest

disproportionately in upskilling uh people in terms of both adopting and using AI. Yeah. The good news is you are all in positions to make this partially also happen and release push it in your

respective companies. I would like to thank everyone uh for joining and also Esso Cham in specific for sponsoring this panel. Uh it has been a great pleasure and uh thank you to my dear

panelists um for being so precise and also distinct. Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you. Can I request all for a group photograph? &gt;&gt; Yes, a group photograph. Everybody stays

a group. I come a bit closer. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Please join us. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Because you move to the middle. Maybe one second. I have my my

special picture. Good. Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

&gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; request a session moderator and also the co-chairman of the Associ Mr. Sunil Ibrahim to please join us on dice. Can I request Mr. Adita Swami MD

play partnership Google Mr. Akil Chadri, CEO, managing partner, Highpring India and Professor MP Gupta, director I am Laknau to please join us on Dice everybody.

&gt;&gt; Then over to you uh Sunil G to moderate the session. &gt;&gt; Thanks. So folks uh thank you for uh staying uh so it is uh

510 minutes after the official work day. So uh all of you in the room are uh providing overtime uh as per labor regulation. So very grateful that you have decided to spare

some of your overtime for us. I'm going to kick this off. Uh we have only uh 25 minutes. So I'll kick it off with uh uh perhaps uh five bullet points. And the question that I'm trying to answer in

these five bullet points is what innovation or AI innovation most specifically? uh uh what innovation does uh India bring uh to the AI story and I want to

start of course uh with this QR code in Digilocker. Uh it's the first time I think we saw dig uh QR codes that are digitally signed and contain

uh the image of the face. So that was a fantastic innovation. From the Saram story uh especially the initial model release we heard how they deal with the token tax that's again clearly

innovation uh a small group of free software developers in Hyderabad trained a Telugu model called Chanda Mama Kadagalu using just CPUs that's again uh an innovation and

uh the social transformation that is possible uh I would like to go back to my home state of Karnataka and ask you all how many of the primary school teachers in Karnataka if you ask

them please introduce me to the six schools of thought in Hindu philos philosophy how many of them can do it I asked all the AI models available and almost all the models did a reasonably

good job I think that is uh the future that we can possibly work towards so let me start with professor Gupta since he's got a flight to cash. U sir, could you tell us what are the key geopolitical

and regulatory challenges uh that need to be addressed uh before the developments from India can be shared more widely across the globe especially the global south.

So uh there are many challenges of course but I think uh three three challenges I notice which is u which requires you know close attention one is uh divergent

regulatory framework that exist across nations and uh that is also necessary but I'm sure looking at uh the debate going on discourse going on across nations uh begin in UK two years back

then France now in India So there'll be some overarching framework which will guide nations to know adop and coordinate re frameworks prevailing in nations itself. Second is

you know weaponization of uh military uh setup that's also very scary and looking at our part this part South Asia which is very volatile now even uh nations like Himalayan nations are very peaceful

uh become restless left right also you see so going beyond South Asia towards east you know one domain where we see a lot of similarities And uh what we do here kind of know uh

spread there. Uh third is uh supply chain issues. Uh a lot of innovations happen in North America and manufactured in u Taiwan, China, Korea, elsewhere. We are on user side. Okay. So we need to

know think about how can we uh invest into innovation R&amp;D and also create ecosystem for right manufacturing uh high quality manufacturing of you know uh these so there are three things I

noticed about challenges thank you so much uh professor Gupta uh Mr. Mr. Swami if I can uh come to you. Uh professor Gupta was talking about this uh differences in regulation which are as

important as uh the common standards in regulation. uh so I wanted you to uh reflect briefly on India's vision for digital public infrastructure and the principles that inform that vision and

ask what is it that companies like Google can do to allow for a dissemination of that approach uh to other parts of the world. &gt;&gt; So I think the fundamental principles I

think given all of us are using these products is one it's they've taken a very complex problem and made it very simple for the user. You talked about the digil locker experience. It took

literally 30 seconds to enter. So making using taking the complex stripping it into layers making it very simple and I think on the under that stands three fundamental tenants. I feel one it's

open source two it's interoperable and third it's safe and I think in many ways that these principles resonate very well with the way Google builds ecosystems. See Android for example is truly open

source. uh it gives developers tools to build very good apps and those apps also keep users safe. You hear all about the Google narrative bold and responsible is very much the uh the words we use in our

AI road map. So I think there's a lot of similarity but specifically DPI uh we are working very closely with theep the folks who who really fundamental to creating Aadhaar to create DPI in a box.

So think about as a as a toolkit that any kid country can just plug into and you know they don't have to start from scratch. They control out a series of uh of these services and I think the layer

on top of that which I think what Kartik from Leven talked about is really how do we make this work in so many local languages right so we have this project Vani which is our language initiative uh

we are training over 150,000 hours of speech data across 100 languages and we've I think with that layer on top of this DPI infrastructure it becomes very usable for people and the final step is

like Gemma Gemma is our open model, right? So we have over 22 versions of Gemma which are available out there for anyone to build on and I think that allows innovation to go at a rapid pace

also and also with the frugality that the earlier panel was talking about. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Those of you who have used this smaller weight gemma models would have been able to run it on your uh

laptops. Uh before I go to Mr. Mr. Chowri, I should apologize to all of you that we haven't been able to have uh Mrs. Miss Anne Robinson. She had another engagement and was not able to make it

and therefore apologies that this has ended up being a manel at an event where we are supposed to discuss inclusive uh social uh transformation. So uh Mr. Mr. Chowri uh professor Gupta spoke about

the regulatory foundations that are necessary and uh Mr. Swami uh told us that we need uh key components such as open source and uh digital public infrastructure. So once we have those

building blocks, what according to you are the underutilized AI use cases that we must aggressively pursue not just here in India but also in the global south, South Asia.

We're looking for those game changers. Do you have any of them for us? &gt;&gt; Absolutely. In fact, &gt;&gt; thank you.

Uh absolutely Mr. Abraham uh kind of uh we we had uh an interesting uh kind of insight into the layers that Google has been and in we we work very closely with Google too. So uh have definitely some

exposure to the other side of it. But then uh if if we look at it uh the the real democratization lies in building the use cases. &gt;&gt; How do we take it to the mass market?

&gt;&gt; Unless we take take it to the mass market, unless we bring up use cases where somebody on the street can let's say excess credit. a a farmer he's able to get or what kind of irrigation do I

need to take care of how do I take care of my pest control he gets that capability in languages now something like Wani will help enable uh some of those things in their own local language

and the it's the same case whether we talk of South Asia or or other parts of the Asia or [clears throat] Europe and and we we do see

proliferation of lot of languages in North America as well. Now so so I would say the problem is the same the whole story about AI it's going to be dependent on how do we build it to scale

for the masses and that's going to happen through the use cases that we build in uh where where it becomes a part of day-to-day life. I I I think uh we we in

businesses we keep talking of all the time optimization, [clears throat] profitability, but I think even that optimization or profitability

is going to come about in the best possible manner when masses use it. &gt;&gt; Uh I I think uh I I can continue but I looking at posity of time. &gt;&gt; Thank you Mr. Chadri. So, professor

Gupta, if I can come back to you. U Mr. Chadri spoke about uh use cases that still have uh unsolved science problems, unsolved engineering problems. Uh especially which pesticide to use in

which farm in India, the data is very sparse for a large number of small Indian languages. Uh we have not managed to digitize uh training data. So how should uh global south countries in

particular approach the question of building the current the correct pipeline of talent that can work on some of these problems that most probably will be ignored by global north uh

countries. So how would you go about uh designing the creation of large scale talent pipeline in the country? &gt;&gt; Yeah. So this is one very uh vital issue. It'll be huge challenge uh to you

know um ensure that there is the right kind of talent available to u feed corporations also citizens. Um we have a lot of software engineers but we need more innovators more technology

leaders and uh campuses should you know develop curriculum to produce those kind of mindsets. uh if you go back to late '90s when uh out of uh government push via it high

powered committee then led by Mr. Just man Singh he was uh I think Kis minister and defense minister under Waji government and uh that led to 108 recommendation

and so we created ministry of IT lot of sher parks and u it act was you know formulated in the same league you know it was projected that IT sector will have lot

of potential and now it is showing the results of that. So AICT at that point of time you know uh pushed uh a lot of universities and colleges to start programs into CS and IT. Now it's time

to know take up same scale of expansion into AI area and uh as I said we need more innovators and technology leaders. So curriculum should be very skillfully you know worked out and they should be

getting a lot of access to live projects and um a lot of internship as well. Um if you if I look at no talent pool of the kind I'm referring to I I I'm

referring to my own shoot on 12th of uh this month honorable uh Sik Shamantri G launched our program uh we are offering now going to start from July uh this year BS program four year in AI and

business analytics also a tech MBA so a very unique paired program and uh that ensures that you After four year we get rank kind of technocrate but after 4 year student can still remain with us

get a very powerful MBA degree and that that is going to know create a person who will be able to uh visualize unmet need and uh conceive a solution AI solution and uh keep on improving that

and commercialize. So in the scale of know TRL from 1 to 9 scale I think our setup is know more competent. So we are also going to work with it as well. So is one instance I'm referring to which

is going to know in a small way contribute to uh filling the gap of talent pool. I'm sure there will be other programs coming forward soon. &gt;&gt; Thank thank you uh professor Mr. Mr.

Swami. What uh professor Gupta focused on is the top down. What is it that the government should do? Uh what kind of policies need to be in place? What kind of laws need to be in place? What kind

of reform is needed in national curriculum? His ask very big asks for government but very small asks for industry. He just said let's work on some industry projects. We should have

some internships. But surely industry can do more than that. And uh the problem statement is rather hard because there are large cultural and linguistic diversity also. And so what is the

approach that you think would be most effective and most scalable when we want to do AI skills development at nation scale? &gt;&gt; Yeah, I think nation scale is the key.

The job is not to skill thousands of engineers. The job is to skill millions of non- tech workers, right? Right? I think if you do if you define the problem in that way, I think maybe there

are a few ways to do it. So one is what I call like quick bite-size skilling, right? Uh we do this program called Google career certification. It's not a yearly program. It's months. It's like

an done in matter of months. You can pick like analytics as an area and you can quickly skill yourself. AI foundation you can skill yourself, right? So and that's of offering you

like the sache type scaling. There I think is some of the foundational work that we are doing with matey and a lot of the government to really inculcate deep AI learning in schools in

universities in colleges. So that I really exciting to hear this tech MBA and things like that. I really bring it at at like when you learn physics and chemistry, you should also be learning

AI in school, right? &gt;&gt; Have a copy of my &gt;&gt; Thank you. [laughter] &gt;&gt; And finally, I think like a lot of people uh around who are maybe got fear

of technology because products that we use every day and I talk about our suite of products, Google workspace, Google, YouTube, Play Store are all have AI now inbuilt. I think it the fear of AI is

now being broken away because it becomes so simple. You realize you can be so much more productive and I call that learning by doing. As you become more and more comfortable with these tools,

you realize so much more can be unlocked and as you spend more time on these products, you start becoming an AI native yourself. So I think if you think about these like one is through

products, one is through curriculum and one is just like the cherry on top what you need for today. that could be a model that you know uh allows us to scale at scale. All of this needs strong

private public partnership and uh I think today is a good display of how that can come together to move things forward. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Um Mr. Swami uh Mr. Mr.

Chadri, if I can come to you for the last uh question and then I'll have a quick uh opportunity for all the panelists to respond to a single question. Uh and to go back to a story

from Karnataka again and this is Azim Preji Foundation. For years they put computer labs in schools and the thesis was that the teacher is not very important so teacher can be replaced.

And then a new CEO of the foundation did a systematic survey and realized that there is zero uh impact. There is a bit of a novelty impact when you introduce the computer but after that there is uh

zero impact. So how should we go about we shouldn't repeat repeat the old mistake of always replacing the human. Sometimes we need the AI to empower the and to enable the human. So how should

established industries especially in South Asia go about thinking of humans and AI and productivity? &gt;&gt; Uh I I think a great question and uh this is what has been haunting the

people who have been working with lot of organizations. I do come across lot of people who are who think their jobs are going to be displaced. And if we look at South Asia specifically, the

organizations are people dense, right? And so the scare is a little bigger over here while while it it pervades across the globe. Now uh whereas the reality is if if we really

delve into the history the the evolution and what how tech has shaped it across last couple of decades. I think we are going to create bigger opportunities. Now organizations keep talking of

optimization, cutting costs and replacing human beings, right? Cutting down on people. Whereas what we need to do is how do we augment the capabilities of the people who are

already working with? It's the inspired workforce which can create legacies for the organization. And now here I think what was very well mentioned uh by both my

panelists was reskilling uh how how different programs are being run uh to to skill uh reskill people. Now that's how organizations have to run those programs like microcertifications. Of

course this is the age of microlearning. So I think organizations while on the job during the day there are moments small moments when people can do microcertifications on some micro

capabilities. Uh that's that's one approach and how do we really enable that their work the burnouts that happen today a lot of times people are stretching by number of

hours across their days. Uh they they are highly stressed. Now if we are augmenting the capabilities of people if it's becoming an assistant to them uh I I think and if we can achieve that

work life balance we have a creative inspired workforce I think we can contribute to much better stronger organizations and contribute to a much better world as well.

So I I I think some of the points again uh I'll I'll say if we have time I can talk more about it. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Um unfortunately we're down to the last five minutes so I want to do the last

quick go around but I want to thank my panelists for their inspiring interventions. We started with the room half full and now we've got the room full and we've got folks standing as

well. So thanks to everybody that have joined us uh through this uh session. Hopefully the last question uh will make it worth uh the this extra effort of joining us. Um and this question is to

each one of you. What is your boldest prediction of uh the biggest transformation to the socioeconomic landscape of South Asia by uh 2030?

and what gives you the confidence that this transformation will be a positive and b uh equitable. So let's start with you again uh professor Gupta. uh I don't know I it is very scary to

predict future uh given the the way know things are changing uh but I I'm conscious about know challenges that we face and I had chance to meet my colleague at IT Madras head of school of

vi also yesterday I met my colleague at ID Delhi also school of vi head and both know put one thing to caution me about this program because in India the So the the challenge of know of having not

adequate uh access to kind of computing power we need to sustain the kind of you know solutions and uh good thing our minister of electronics and IT I think I heard

him saying that government of India has said that $70 billion to create that kind of infrastructure. So it's a it's a enough amount or I don't know but that is the one thing you

know I I look forward to uh things happening and then things will fall in line after that clearly professors LLM has very low temperature so he's not willing to shift from the truth but uh

can we come to you Mr. Chadri um and raise the temperature in your gender to AAI model and make a bold prediction even [clears throat] if you if it turns out to be a false

prediction. &gt;&gt; No, absolutely. Uh thanks for saying that and that's how I've been and I I consider failing to be my strength. So I'm happy to make a bold take a bold

call. uh provided everyone here thinks it's a bold car. Uh okay. So I uh my personal feel is that in next uh 4 year or 10 months by around 2030 I

I think AI is going to be mainstream. What I mean is like electricity, internet, it's going to be part of our day-to-day lives. We may not even have to say that. Yeah. And of course, it

will be powered by I I do expect that South Asia is going to play a leading role. Uh we talked about use cases. uh we we we have the population the

youth people who are willing to take those risks people are who are willing to take those challenges be open to jugar as well willing to go those extra steps now now these are the people I

think who are going to contribute to building those use cases uh which are going to contribute to making the world a better place uh so so that's

So the massification I I think AI will reach the masses. &gt;&gt; I I think not everybody understands how bold that claim is that AI will become mainstream. Only 5% of this country has

ever been on an aeroplane. 125 year old invention. So a very bold prediction but over to you Mr. Swami close us out. &gt;&gt; Keeping us keeping us in the theme of AI for everyone. Every single person in

this room will have an 24 by77 AI helper living inside your phone who will do all your mundane tasks for you. Booking a flight, buying your groceries, booking your dentist appointment so that all of

us have more time to do quality stuff at work for society and with family and friends. &gt;&gt; Thank you Mr. Swami. That's again an incredible vision of what the future can

look like. Thank you to this fantastic audience for staying with us uh over office hours and for giving us um the overtime. Very grateful indeed. And thanks to Asuchan for hosting us as a

panel. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you to the panelist. Before we close, can we request for a group photograph?
